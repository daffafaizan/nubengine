    
      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group
      study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LNP023 compared to
      placebo on proteinuria reduction and slowing renal disease progression in primary IgAN
      patients. The study will be the pivotal trial for registration of LNP023 in IgA Nephropathy
      patients with the aim to demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in proteinuria by
      LNP023 vs. placebo as assessed by reduction in urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR)
      sampled from a 24 hour urine collection at an IA at 9 months. Results from the IA may serve
      as basis for accelerated/conditional approval. The trial will continue in a blinded fashion
      to confirm long-term efficacy based on a renal function endpoint at the final analysis
      (annualized rate of total estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope estimated over 24
      months) to provide confirmatory evidence of LNP023 efficacy and safety in treating patients
      with IgAN. The trial will enroll approximately 450 participants; 430 biopsy-proven IgAN
      participants with eGFR â‰¥30 mL /min/1.73m2 (main study population) and approximately 20
      participants with eGFR 20 to <30 mL/min/1.73m2 (severe renal impairment (SRI) population).
      Estimated GFR will be calculated using the CKD-EPI formula (or modified MDRD formula
      according to specific ethnic groups and local practice guidelines at screening. The SRI
      population will not be included in the efficacy analyses of the main study population; it
      will primarily provide additional PK and safety information for SRI participants.
