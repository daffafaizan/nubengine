      neurologic impairments will be tested at the gait and motion laboratory. Each patient will be
      secured with a ceiling-mounted safety harness and will walk on the path wearing passive
      light-reflecting markers and surface electrodes. High-speed cameras will record the subject's
      movements and the markers will be tracked to produce data of joint angles, velocities and
      accelerations. Dynamic EMG will be recorded from various muscles.

      During the examination, the gait of the subjects will be disturb by either (i) a visual or
      sound signal that requires the subject to stop immediately, or (ii) walking different
      terrains, or (iii) tying a string to the foot and pulling it shortly to induce a trip.
