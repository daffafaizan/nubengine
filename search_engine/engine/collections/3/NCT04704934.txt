      participants with HER2-positive (defined as immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+/in situ
      hybridization [ISH]+) gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma (based on [American Society of Clinical
      Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines and confirmed by central
      assessment of tumor tissue) who have progressed on or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen
      and have not received any additional systemic therapy. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to
      either T-DXd or Ram + PTX treatment. The primary objective will assess overall survival.
      Secondary objectives will further assess progression-free survival, objective response rate,
      duration of response, disease control rate, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of
      T-DXd.
