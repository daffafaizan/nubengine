      outcomes has not been definitively established with delayed cord clamping. Maternal
      considerations include the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, need for additional uterotonic
      medications, need for maternal transfusion, retained placenta, and postpartum drop in
      hemoglobin. Neonatal considerations include markers of neonatal well-being such as arterial
      pH and 5-minute Apgar score, as well as hemoglobin and bilirubin levels. There is currently
      no protocol on the timing of third stage prophylactic oxytocin and its administration is
      based on physician/ delivery provider's preference. The investigators propose a quality
      assessment initiative, through a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the blood
      loss between administrations of prophylactic oxytocin immediately after delivery of the
      neonate versus after delivery of the placenta with delayed cord clamping.
