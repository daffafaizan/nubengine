      highly disabling and life-threatening, resulting of transthyretin (TTR) gene mutation.
      Clinically, TTR FAP is characterized by progressive sensorimotor and dysautonomic neuropathy,
      usually fatal within a few years. The disease prevalence is highly variable, with a large
      genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Early and accurate diagnosis remains essential to
      propose early treatment. New pharmacotherapies have been developed, such as TafamidisÂ®, and
      many patients can avoid liver transplant formerly considered as the only therapeutic option.
      The prevalence of TTR-FAP disease has been previously estimated in series of patients with
      severe and progressive neuropathy, frequently leading to a delayed diagnosis. TTR-FAP is also
      easily suspected when neuropathy is associated with cardiac symptoms or dysautonomia.

      Currently, genetic testing of TTR-FAP is targeted and is only prescribed to patients in whom
      the first-line assessment recommended by the High Authority for Health (HAS) did not identify
      a cause, and on the basis of a worsening of symptoms. An early diagnosis in those cases would
      allow earlier treatment and monitoring. No data are available about the prevalence of TTR-FAP
      in populations of patients with from chronic neuropathy of unknown aetiology, through a
      systematic screening of TTR mutations.

      The diagnosis of TTR-FAP will be performed using standard procedures following international
      recommendations, requiring genetic analysis of the TTR gene.

      The patients with a diagnosis of TTR-FAP confirmed during this study will be seen for an
      additional visit in the Investigating Centre and proposed suitable follow up, treatment and
      care.
