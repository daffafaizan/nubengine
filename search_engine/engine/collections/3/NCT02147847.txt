      the world, with an estimated prevalence of 636 million individuals (30 million in the US
      alone). Amplification devices (i.e., hearing aids) are commonly used to compensate for HI
      stemming from acoustic trauma, ototoxic insult, normal aging or other sources of cochlear
      degeneration. The chief complaint of individuals with HI is hearing in the types of noisy
      environments that characterize most work, educational, and social situations. Unfortunately,
      hearing aids do not completely address the perceptual impairments in these situations. That
      is because the difficulties that individuals with HI have hearing in noise result from the
      reduced salience of cues that are used to sort out auditory scenes. Making sounds louder
      improves audibility, but does not afford adaptation of the brain to the abnormal coding of
      sensory information by the damaged cochlea. The investigators will test whether the hearing
      in noise abilities of adults living with hearing impairment can be improved with a cognitive
      training paradigm.
