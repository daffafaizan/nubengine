      as compared to pre-emptive antifungal therapy in critically ill, non-neutropenic adult ACLF
      patients with suspected IFI?

      This study will be a single-center prospective randomized open-label with blinded end-point
      PROBE assessment and conducted at Liver ICU.

      ACLF patients aged 18 to 75 years with all three criteria will be included

        1. ICU stay of 48 hours or recent hospitalization

        2. Two or more risk factors for IFI 3. Clinical suspicion of IFI

      Exclusion criteria A Neutrophil count of less than 500 per mm3 B Recent antifungal treatment
      in the past 1months C Hepatocellular carcinoma or other active malignancy D Known
      hypersensitivity or contraindication to Liposomal AmB E HIV positivity or on HAART F
      Pregnancy or lactation G Moribund patients

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio to receive either early empiric
      systemic antifungal therapy (SAT: based on risk factors and clinical suspicion) or
      Pre-emptive SAT (based on risk factors, clinical suspicion and radiological/investigation
      based evidence of fungal infection) in addition to standard medical therapy SMT and followed
      up for a period of 28-days or transplant or death

      Empirical therapy will be Liposomal AmB 3 to 5 mg per kg of body weight per day.

      It is preferred because of maximum efficacy, widest spectrum, and safety in liver disease

      Pre-emptive therapy with liposomal AmB will be given if the treatment initiation rules are
      met including fungal biomarkers positivity, Mycological or radiological evidence of IFI

      Proven-IFI will be treated as per IDSA or ESCMID guidelines in either group Stoppage rules in
      both groups will be based on fungal biomarkers and cultures that will be done twice weekly
      and twice negative bio-markers or fungal cultures at day7 and 10 will be essential to stop
      treatment

      In case of intolerable adverse effects or contraindications to LipoAmB, the patients will
      undergo treatment as per IDSA guidelines Standard Medical Therapy will be as indicated and
      will include nutritional support, rifaximin lactulose albumin diuretics proton-pump
      inhibitors multivitamins and antibiotics

      Outcomes will include survival at 28-day, clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness and safety of
      two approaches of antifungal therapy
