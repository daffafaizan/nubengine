      of 80:20, a similar ratio of human breast milk, on blood branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)
      profile by HPLC technique, markers of protein metabolism (creatinine, urea, and urine
      nitrogen) and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) after a single bout of resistance
      exercise. A double-blind, crossover and acute study was conducted with ten men (age 29 ± 8 y;
      BMI: 25.4 ± 2.9 Kg/m2; 77 ± 12 kg; 1.74 ± 0.09 m) that were randomly assigned to five
      supplementation treatments: WP - whey protein; CAS - casein; WP/CAS - 80% WP/20% CAS; CAS/WP
      - 80% CAS/ 20% WP; PLA - placebo. Participants were submitted to the following evaluations:
      performance sessions, blood collection for each session for the BCAAs profile determination,
      two food records, 3-days assessment of DOMS (24h, 48h, 72h) after each treatment.
