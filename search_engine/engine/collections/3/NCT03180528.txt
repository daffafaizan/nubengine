      I. Overall response rate of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in subjects at 6 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Suppression of GLI1 (glioma-associated oncogene) expression in treated BCCs as compared
      with baseline.

      II. Safety assessment of Remetinostat after 6 weeks of topical treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Tumors receive Remetinostat topically three times per day (TID) for 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 4 weeks.
