        1. Assess the safety of recombinant antithrombin (rhAT) in hereditary antithrombin (AT)
           deficient patients.

        2. Assess the incidence of acute deep venous thrombosis(DVT) alone in patients with
           hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficiency in situations usually associated with a high
           risk for thromboembolic events after increasing and targeting functional AT activity at
           >80% and < 120% of normal by prophylactic IV administration of rhAT.

        3. Clinically assess and determine the relevance of thromboembolic events other than acute
           DVT to rhAT administration.
