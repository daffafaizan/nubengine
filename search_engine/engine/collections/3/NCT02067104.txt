      significantly reduce the incidence of newly diagnosed basal cell carcinomas (BCC) in high
      risk individuals when compared with placebo, as measured by the incidence of biopsy confirmed
      BCC over a 24 month period.

      The secondary objective will be to determine that there will be no difference in the
      incidence of newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in the same subjects receiving
      vismodegib treatment when compared with placebo, as measured by the incidence of biopsy
      confirmed SCC over the same 24 month period.
