      and relapse prevention in adult cigarette smokers. Specifically, this study has the following
      aims: Aim 1) Examine the efficacy of NAC, compared to placebo, in helping smokers achieve
      three days of continuous abstinence; Aim 2) Among those who maintain initial 3-day
      abstinence, examine the time to relapse over the 8-week intervention between NAC and placebo
      groups; Aim 3) Assess 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the 8-week end-of-treatment study
      visit in order to obtain effect sizes and estimates of variability to power a randomized
      clinical trial.
