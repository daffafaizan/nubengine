    
      This is a phase Ib/II, open label, multi-center study of sabatolimab as monotherapy and in
      combination with azacitidine, in participants with AML/secondary AML who have received one
      aHSCT and achieved complete remission but MRD+, by local assessment, anytime between day 100
      and day 365 post-aHSCT and at least 2 weeks after immunosuppressive medications have been
      tapered off.

      The study will enroll approximately 59 participants and will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1 is a Safety Run-in of approximately 20 participants, to assess whether sabatolimab as
      monotherapy at the two tested dose levels (400 mg and 800 mg intravenously Q4W) is safe when
      administered in the post-aHSCT setting. For each dose level, once the required number of
      evaluable participants has been confirmed, enrollment will be halted until participants have
      completed the DLT observation period (≥ 8 weeks following the first dose). Following the
      observation period for DLTs, a Safety Review Meeting will be conducted after each dose level
      to assess safety and determine the recommended dose for expansion to proceed with enrollment
      of additional cohorts in Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2 consists of sabatolimab monotherapy expansion cohort of approximately 13 participants,
      sabatolimab in combination with azacitidine cohort of approximately 20 participants, and an
      adolescent cohort of approximately 6 participants (≥ 12 years but < 18 years of age) with
      sabatolimab as monotherapy. Sabatolimab will be administered at the recommended dose for
      expansion determined in Part 1.
