    
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a new drug, selumetinib, given in
      combination with standard chemotherapies, that can be tolerated without causing very severe
      side effects. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that does not cause side
      effects in animals. Participants are given selumetinib and are watched very closely to see
      what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side
      effects are not severe, then more potential participants are asked to join this study and are
      given a higher dose of selumetinib. Participants joining this study later on will take
      selumetinib at higher doses, take doses twice daily or take for more days in a 21 day period
      than participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes
      severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
