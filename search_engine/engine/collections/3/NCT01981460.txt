      evaluating the addition of methylene blue and light activation on skin to determine whether
      this inexpensive and non-toxic treatment can decrease skin pathogens and prevent blood stream
      infections of long-term vascular catheters. This is a pilot study of normal volunteers to
      determine the effect on the microbiome of the addition of methylene blue and light activation
      on antiseptic-treated skin.
