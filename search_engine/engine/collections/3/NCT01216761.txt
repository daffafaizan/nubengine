      in blood culture contamination rates among 3 antiseptic skin preparations. The sequence of 3
      different antiseptic treatments was randomly assigned to 3 separate hospital floors,
      therefore in this trial cross-over occurred at the hospital floor level (not the individual
      patient level).

      Also, it is possible for subjects to have multiple blood culture sets obtained during the
      study. Thus, the number of blood culture sets will not equal the number of unique subjects in
      the study.
