      and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, health behavior change
      interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant
      promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for
      adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual
      narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well-positioned to design
      health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant
      impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health.

      With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific
      aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning
      behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a
      clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on
      adolescent behavior. The project will culminate with an investigation of the behavioral
      effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient
      primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the
      Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with
      CHANGEGRADIENTS will reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and
      increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior and avoid risky substance use.

      It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health
      behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized
      preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be
      tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of
      adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment,
      CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote
      self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through
      improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.
