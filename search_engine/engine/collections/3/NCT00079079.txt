      Primary

        -  Determine the activity of cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with gemcitabine, in
           terms of response rate, in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic
           malignant salivary gland tumor.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive either
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2 OR carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      thereafter until relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11- 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-3
      years.
