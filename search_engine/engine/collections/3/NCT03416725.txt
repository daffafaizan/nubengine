      contrary. The reported incidence of surgical success of tympanoplasty ranges from 60% to 99%
      in adults Belluci described four separate stages for prognosis of tympanoplasty 4 according
      to otorrhea

      . Austin proposed a prognostic stratification according to disease categories, stage
      categories, and disease descriptors.

      Black introduced the surgical, prosthetic, infection, tissues, and eustachian tube system
      (SPITE), and more recently Kartush developed middle ear risk index (MERI).

      Smoking is added as a middle ear risk. Furthermore, cholesteatoma and granulation tissue or
      effusion risk value has been increased in MERI 2001.

      Prognostic factors such as age, sex, presence of systemic diseases, location and size of
      perforation, duration of dry period, presence of myringosclerosis, presence of septal and
      conchal pathology, operation type, and status of the opposite ear and middle ear risk index
      were investigated. 9
