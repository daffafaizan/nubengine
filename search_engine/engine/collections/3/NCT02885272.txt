      I. To assess the optimal FDG positron emission tomography (PET) imaging time post radiotracer
      administration that maximizes separation of activity between lesion and non-lesional
      parenchyma (measured as lesion/background [L/B] ratio) in patients with glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify genotypic factors in FDG tumor metabolism derived from metrics such as maximum
      standard uptake value (SUVmax), mean standard uptake value (SUVmean), total lesion glycolysis
      (TLG), mean tumor volume (MTV) and L/B ratio.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify patterns of metabolism derived from metrics such as SUVmax, SUVmean, TLG, MTV,
      L/B ratio and magnetic resonance imaging metrics such as regional perfusion abnormalities,
      apparent diffusion coefficient values, fractional diffusivity measures and magnetic resonance
      spectroscopic finding.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorodeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and then undergo
      PET/computed tomography (CT) scans over 30 minutes at 1 hour, 4-5 hours, and 7-8 hours after
      injection. Patients also undergo a standard of care magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
      over 45 minutes if not already completed as part of standard of care.
