    
      Rationale:

      One of the next developments in healthcare is digitalization, including (mobile) applications
      that could support healthcare providers. A significant number of aging men suffer from lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), often caused by benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). LUTS/BPH is
      primarily treated by physicians (GPs or Urologists). Optimal evaluation of patients with
      LUTS/BPH, treatment selection and follow-up by the physicians and medication adherence are
      essential in the management of LUTS. This pilot project represents a strong collaboration
      between a urological association, urologists, and physicians in supporting healthcare
      improvement for LUTS/BPH with the use of a (mobile) application. The hypothesis is that the
      (mobile) application can support the patient in medication adherence and improve the
      adherence by feedback and that the application can help to collect objective disease
      information with electronic questionnaires.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to assess the feasibility, and acceptability of a (mobile)
      application for men presenting at their general practitioner/or urologist with LUTS/BPH who
      are either: under treatment, or who may require medical therapy for the first time.

      The secondary objectives are to identify potential gaps, clarify controversial points of the
      application, to document the communication between patients, physicians and supervising
      urologists in order to optimize (if necessary) the application, to assess medication
      adherence and to record if treatment provided by physicians is in compliance with the
      guidelines recommendations.
