    
      Atelectasis is developed in 90% of anesthetized patients after surgery.

      Protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP)
      promotes atelectasis with the potential right ventricle dysfunction induced by the increment
      in afterload (activation of the pulmonary hypoxic vasocontriction reflex).

      Lung recruitment can improve the right ventricle performance caused by atelectasis because
      the pulmonary hypoxic vasocontriction reflex desapear in a normal aerated lungs.
