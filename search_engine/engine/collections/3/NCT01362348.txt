    
      MD7114987 is a Phase 2a study designed to determine whether pazopanib eye drops have the
      potential to reduce retinal edema and maintain or improve visual acuity in persons with a
      previously untreated subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion secondary to
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to further characterize the safety and
      tolerability of pazopanib eye drops administered over a 12-week period.
