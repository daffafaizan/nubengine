      for STEMI patients within 24h of symptom onset. In stable STEMI patients presenting 12 to 48
      hours from symptom onset, BRAVE-2 Trial (n = 365) showed improved myocardial salvage and
      4-year survival in patients treated with primary PCI compared with conservative treatment
      alone. However, data is scarce about the reperfusion strategy focusing on STEMI patients
      within 24-48h of symptom onset.

      To our knowledge, due to the long onset time and insufficient antiplatelet/anticoagulant
      treatment, infarct-related artery in STEMI patients beyond 24h of symptom onset frequently
      suffer from severer thrombus burden. In this situation, the risk of no-reflow in primary PCI
      is high. Meanwhile, myocardial coagulative necrosis would be fully developed during 24-72h
      from symptom onset, the risk of perioperative cardiac rupture may also rise. These bring some
      doubts about the benefits of early invasive strategy for STEMI patients within 24-48h of
      symptom onset. Further investigations are warranted to explore the best timing of invasive
      strategy for STEMI patients within 24-48h of symptom onset.

      Given that no randomized clinical trial is designed especially for STEMI patients within
      24-48h of symptom onset, and limited data is available to compare early with deferred
      invasive strategy for the subgroup of STEMI patients, investigators plan to perform a
      controlled, randomized trial to compare the efficacy of early with deferred invasive strategy
      for STEMI patients within 24-48h of symptom onset.
