      sensor clip. The investigators analyzed previous studies with the Pronto device and
      calculated two cut-off values of the noninvasive hemoglobin device. If noninvasive hemoglobin
      values are higher than cut off value 1 the investigators postulate that with a sensitivity of
      99% the participant has no anemia. To confirm this, participants who are supposed to undergo
      elective surgery and come to the preoperative anesthetic ambulance are measured by the
      Pronto-device. The noninvasive measurements are compared with the laboratory values of the
      patients and cut-off value 1 can be confirmed.
