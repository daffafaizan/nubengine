      gestation with BPD (i.e. oxygen dependence for at least 28 postnatal days 5), preterm infants
      born < 300 weeks' gestation without BPD, late preterm infants (born at 340-366 weeks'
      gestation) and term controls.

      Pulmonary function testing and spirometry were measured Participants performed CPET on an
      electronically braked cycle ergometer. During the exercise testing, serial saturation, heart
      rate and blood pressure measurements were obtained.

      The peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) was measured and served as the primary endpoint of the
      study.
