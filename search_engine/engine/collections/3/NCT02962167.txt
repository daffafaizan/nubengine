    
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase I study to assess the safety of administering
      MV-NIS directly into the tumor bed (for locally recurrent medulloblastoma or ATRT patients)
      or into the subarachnoid space (for disseminated recurrent medulloblastoma or ATRT patients).

      For locally recurrent patients (patients in the first arm) MV-NIS will be directly
      administered into the tumor bed following a standard of care surgical resection. For patients
      with disseminated recurrence (patients in the second or third arm), MV-NIS will be injected
      via lumbar puncture (LP).

      Patients in the second arm will receive a one-time administration of MV-NIS. Patients will be
      closely monitored for 30 days after injection, and then followed for evaluation of 6 month
      progressive free survival and overall response rate.

      Patients in the third arm will receive two administrations of MV-NIS. Patients will be
      closely monitored for 56 days after injection, and then followed for evaluation of 4 month
      progressive free survival.
