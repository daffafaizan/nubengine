      Angiotensin II (Ang II) is known to enhance noradrenergic activity, which contributes to
      effects on blood pressure and sympathetic nervous system responses to stress. Inhibition of
      Ang II has been shown to reduce cravings for stimulants, including cocaine and
      methamphetamine.

      This clinical trial among 75 cocaine-dependent subjects is designed to test the efficacy of
      the Angiotensin II receptor antagonist, Candesartan, for treatment of cocaine dependence. The
      results of this study will provide medical safety and efficacy data, and will guide future
      pharmacotherapy trials using this class of medications for cocaine addiction.

      This 8-week trial includes a 1-week titration of the medication and 7-weeks of full dose
      medication (weeks 2-8), with all subjects receiving the active agent.

      At the conclusion of the trial, subjects who wish to be referred to an appropriate treatment
      program or treatment research program will be assisted with a referral.
