    
      To evaluate the efficacy of 4 weeks of 200 mg/24h of tedizolid for prosthetic join infections
      caused by tedizolid susceptible microorganisms treated with implant removal in one or two
      stages at 6 months of followup after stopping tedizolid treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

      Evaluate the efficacy of tedizolid at 12 months of follow-up; evaluate the rate of
      gastrointestinal adverse events with tedizolid; determine the rate of haematological
      abnormalities during tedizolid treatment and; in case of two-stage exchange, the rate of
      positive cultures during reimplantation.
