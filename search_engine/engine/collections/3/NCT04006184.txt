      symptomatic varicose veins to compare the need for/utilization of adjunctive phlebectomy
      performed as a concomitant or staged procedure in conjunction with either cyanoacrylate
      closure versus endothermal ablation of incompetent saphenous veins through 6 months of the
      index procedure. The overall cost of treatment for both groups will be compared.

      Some of the secondary aims of this study include:

        1. To assess changes in Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathology (CEAP) clinical class
           after completion of treatment.

        2. To assess changes in revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (rVCSS) and compare the two
           groups.

        3. To assess the need for adjunctive therapies.

        4. To record and compare retrospectively the adverse events between the two groups.
