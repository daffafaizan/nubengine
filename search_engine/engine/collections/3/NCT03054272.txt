      de Montréal were recruited on a voluntary basis. A 13-minute video based on a suggested CICO
      algorithm from the Difficult Airway Society to manage unanticipated difficult intubation in
      adults (3) was produced at the University of Montreal Simulation Centre using high-fidelity
      settings. The scenario was about a patient, with a cervical collar, in the post-anesthesia
      care unit. Throughout the video, the patient presents increasing respiratory distress
      worsening to respiratory failure. The anesthesiologist fails to ventilate, intubate and
      insert a laryngeal mask leading to a cricothyroidotomy. All participants were looking at a
      screen on which the scenario was broadcast. The screen was equipped with TobiiEyeX®, an
      eye-tracking system that automatically aggregates gaze data.
