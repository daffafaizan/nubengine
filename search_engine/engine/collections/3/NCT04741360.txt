      children with TBI through the modification of an existing, proven efficacious treatment
      protocol for learning and memory deficits in persons with moderate to severe TBI, the
      modified Story Memory Technique (mSMT), as well as the conduct of a pilot double blind,
      placebo-controlled, RCT of this new pediatric adaptation of the mSMT. Over a decade of
      research and development conducted at our center has demonstrated the mSMT to be effective
      for improving new learning and memory in adults with TBI, across three realms of functioning:
      objective behavior, brain functioning and everyday life. This convincing data provides Class
      I evidence supporting the efficacy of the mSMT for improving new learning and memory in
      adults with TBI. Clinical applications around the world have equally attested to its utility
      in the clinical care of adults with TBI. This highlights the tremendous potential of the mSMT
      to vastly improve the everyday lives and educational successes of children and adoles-cents
      living with TBI and the resultant learning and memory deficits. The currently proposed pilot
      work will begin to document that efficacy. The results of this study therefore have the
      potential to change clinical practice, inform policy, and improve the lives of children and
      adolescents living with TBI.
