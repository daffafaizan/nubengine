      first involves the collection of mouthwash samples from 200 volunteers, to assess the
      feasibility of pooling samples for quantitative genotype determinations. For a small number
      of volunteers, we will also collect a peripheral blood sample and a skin punch biopsy for
      establishment of lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines. The blood and skin samples will be
      used to compare the amount and subcellular localization of DNA repair proteins between
      lymphocytes (cells most commonly collected in epidemiologic studies) and fibroblasts (the
      cell types commonly used in assay development). In addition, we will conduct hands-on
      education and training sessions in molecular genetics for members of DCEG and others. The
      hands-on education sessions will be aimed at non-laboratory scientists and involve 6-9 hours
      of demonstration and participation in basic molecular genetics techniques. Participants will
      have the option of collecting their own mouthwash sample, extracting the DNA, and performing
      a genotyping assay on their sample in the Laboratory of Population Genetics in Building 41.
      After the education session, the biological samples will be reassigned arbitrary numbers not
      linked to personally identifying information and will be used for laboratory methods
      development only.
