      Peripheral thermal receptors send signals to central nervous system which regulate body
      temperature via peripheral effectors, such as vasoconstriction, vasodilatation, shivering,
      sweating and etc. In patients undergoing general anesthesia, the regulatory mechanism is
      altered. General anesthesia changes blood distribution in the body, the metabolic rate of
      muscle, threshold of thermal regulation in the brain and etc, so that heat distribution and
      microcirculation condition will also change. In this study, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      is used to measure the microcirculatory condition. NIRS is a non-invasive continuous
      measurement to detect tissue saturation with the method of different wavelength of
      near-infrared. General anesthesia with inhalational sevoflurane and intravenous propofol is
      separated into 2 groups. Because of different mechanism of general anesthesia of these 2
      anesthetics, different physiologic response may occur. Body temperature and somatic
      saturation are compared in each group.
