    
      This is a pilot clinical study of the therapeutic benefits of ventral capsular/ventral
      striatal deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for 10 patients with medically
      refractory thalamic pain syndrome. Patients to be enrolled under this protocol will have
      experienced severe pain for more than six months and will be considered medically refractory.
      Study subjects may have undergone and failed other surgical procedures or interventional
      procedures. Study subjects will have chronic, medically refractory pain of disabling
      severity, refractory to treatment attempts with conventional medications. Patients that are
      enrolled in the study will have bilateral DBS surgery, with implantation of one Medtronic
      3391 DBS lead on either side of the brain. These leads will then be connected at first to a
      single Medtronic PC pulse generator to be implanted in the infraclavicular region on one
      side. Once the PC pulse generator is depleted, and the patient has completed the blinded
      phase of the study, the PC pulse generator will be replaced for an RC pulse generator. The RC
      pulse generator has a battery life of 9 years and is a good option for the open label phase
      and for continued stimulation after the study is completed. However, the RC is not ideal for
      the blinded phase because patients may be able to tell if they are receiving active or sham
      stimulation. For this reason, patients enrolled in this study will receive, initially, the
      implant with the PC generator. Patients will have at least 6 months of stable chronic pain
      associated with TPS.
