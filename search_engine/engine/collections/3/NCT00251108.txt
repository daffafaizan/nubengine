      exercise programme to a 3-month unsupervised home-based exercise programme on discharge from
      inpatient rehabilitation on improving cardiorespiratory fitness and psychosocial functioning
      in a traumatic brain injured population. We plan to carry out a multi-centre, assessor
      blinded, randomised controlled trial with a parallel group design to compare the two
      interventions. We hypothesise that the supervised fitness-centre based programme will provide
      significantly better outcomes, and that these gains will not only be evident on completion of
      the programme, but will be maintained on follow-up, thereby demonstrating that investment in
      a supervised exercise programme can provide beneficial long-term effects.
