      is being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. The study is a Phase
      1, open-label study designed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism and
      excretion of GSK2118436 following administration of a single oral 14C labeled dose of
      GSK2118436 as a suspension in subjects with BRAF mutation positive tumors. A sufficient
      number of subjects will be enrolled to complete approximately four subjects. Following
      completion of the study, subjects may continue dosing with GSK2118436 in the rollover study,
      BRF114144.
