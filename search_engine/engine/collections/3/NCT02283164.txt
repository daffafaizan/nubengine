      antineoplastic drugs among oncology nurses who handle them. The specific project objective is
      to evaluate the efficacy of an audit and feedback intervention to improve PPE use by nurses
      who handle hazardous drugs in the ambulatory oncology setting. This project will pursue three
      specific aims:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of an audit and feedback intervention to improve recommended use
           of PPE;

        2. Determine whether the intervention effects on PPE use are mediated by knowledge about
           PPE use and perceived risk of hazardous drug exposure, and;

        3. Determine whether the intervention effects on PPE use are moderated by personal
           (experience, education, certification) and organizational factors (workloads, practice
           environments, safety organizing).

      To achieve these aims, 382 nurses employed in 11 oncology centers will participate in a
      cluster randomized controlled trial. Sites will be randomized so participants will receive a
      one-hour web-based educational module on hazardous drug safe handling with quarterly email
      reminders about the educational content (control) or the web-based educational module plus
      quarterly feedback on hazardous drug spills and drug levels measured in the study population
      (treatment). The hypothesis is that nurses in sites who receive the treatment will report
      significantly higher PPE use compared to nurses in sites assigned to receive the control.
      Data will also identify organizational factors that can be targeted for future interventions.
