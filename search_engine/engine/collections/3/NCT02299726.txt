      Exploratory Safety Study - will explore the safety of early mineralocorticoid receptor
      blockade with high-dose spironolactone (100mg/daily), an oral mineralocorticoid receptor
      antagonist, versus placebo (both in addition to standard therapy), in patients admitted with
      acute heart failure (AHF) for 3 days. Aim 1 will answer the critical question that early
      mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism in AHF patients is sufficiently safe to move
      forward with a definitive trial. Aim 2 will demonstrate feasibility of patient enrollment and
      compliance with treatment throughout the study to inform future study design and enrollment
      projections. This study will provide the necessary and sufficient data in order to plan a
      larger, simple, definitive trial to test the hypothesis that early aldosterone blockade in
      AHF patients will reduce mortality and 30-day readmissions.

      The primary endpoint for the pilot study will be the difference in incidence of mean change
      of serum potassium of a specific amount from baseline to 120 hours from initial dose between
      placebo vs. spironolactone treated subjects.
