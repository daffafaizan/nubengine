    
      This is a single center, open-label, pilot study to determine the safety, efficacy, and
      patient preference of a split-dose regimen of Crystalline Lactulose for cleansing of the
      colon prior to colonoscopy. Safety will be assessed by the occurrence of any treatment
      emergent adverse events. Efficacy will be determined by the endoscopist's rating of the
      cleanliness of the colon and the incidence of treatment failure (insufficient evacuation of
      the bowel). Patient preference will be determined by the patient's responses on a patient
      questionnaire.
