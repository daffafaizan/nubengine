      least 50 subjects will be enrolled.

      Primary endpoint:

      To determine the quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22) in patients with gastric
      cancer who receive combination treatment with Taxotere and Xeloda.

      Secondary endpoint:

      To evaluate time to progression (TTP), overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).

      Quality of life: to evaluate that QOL does not deteriorate from baseline. Quality of life is
      measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 with physical functioning score as the primary
      variable.

      Efficacy: time to progression, overall response rate, overall survival Time to progression is
      defined as time elapsed from inclusion to first documented progression or death whatever the
      reason. Overall response rate is assessed according to the RECIST criteria. Overall survival
      is defined as time elapsed from inclusion to death.

      Safety: clinical and laboratory toxicities or symptomatology will be graded according to
      NCI-CTC criteria.

      Statistical considerations:

      The primary variable, physical functioning score measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22
      instrument, will be analyzed using a paired t-test (change from baseline after two treatment
      cycles). A 95% confidence interval will also be calculated for the primary variable. Median
      TTP and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The ORR will be summarized.
      Safety variables will be summarized descriptively.
