      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer.
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have been shown to mediate long-term durable
      remissions in recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies, and thus the CAR-T therapy
      approach is considered a promising treatment against GBM. Certain antigens are highly
      specific in GBM, such as epidermal growth factor receptor variant iii, EGFRviii. EGFRviii is
      a variant form of EGFR protein, and one of the potential target antigens in GBM. Alternative
      antigens such as GD2 and MucI have also been targeted as potential GBM antigens.

      Tumor microenvironment is known to suppressive anti-cancer immune responses. Many immune
      checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated marked anti-tumor activities. Instead of infusing
      antibodies, this study aims to infuse antigen-specific T cells modified with immune
      modulatory genes (IgT) such as genes encoding immune checkpoint inhibitors. Combination of
      tumor targeting and immune modulatory activities, the IgT cells could target both the tumor
      cells and the tumor microenvironment.
