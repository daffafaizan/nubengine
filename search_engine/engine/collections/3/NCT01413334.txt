      assessment of lesion-specific ischemia, and a valuable adjunct to anatomic assessment of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) as determined by invasive coronary angiography. However, the
      invasiveness and measuring difficulty of FFR make it unfamiliar to perform. Coronary computed
      tomographic angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a non-invasive test, accurately evaluate
      anatomic coronary artery stenosis. Although CCTA evaluation of CAD has been validated against
      invasive coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound, anatomically-obstructive coronary
      stenosis by CCTA demonstrates an unreliable relationship to lesion-specific ischemia.
      Recently, with the advance of imaging reconstruction and analysis technique, several novel
      parameters computed from CCTA were suggested to have added value in determining the
      ischemia-causing coronary stenosis. In this study, diagnostic performance of transluminal
      attenuation gradient (TAG) and fractional flow reserve computed form CCTA (FFR-CCTA) for the
      presence of hemodynamically-significant coronary stenosis, as determined by FFR, will be
      compared to suggest best functional parameter noninvasively computed form CCTA.
