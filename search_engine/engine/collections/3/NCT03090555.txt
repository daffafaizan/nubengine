      physical therapy are thought to be useful for treating adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder.
      However, no single intervention for this condition has been proven to be superior to others.

      The translational manipulation under interscalene block may improve pain-free motion of the
      involved shoulder, by releasing tight tissue without the guarding and motion-limiting effect
      of active muscle tension. The interscalene block prevents the patient from actively
      contracting the muscles that control the involved shoulder, during the manipulation
      procedure.

      One additional possible benefit of the translational manipulation under interscalene block,
      is that the technique loads the joint structures--bone, joint capsule--in a safer way with
      less angular torque than conventional/traditional manipulation under anaesthesia. This
      minimizes the risk of physical/mechanical harm from the procedure.
