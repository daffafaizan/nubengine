    
      This study explores new treatment options for ACTG 320 enrollees (and, if needed, a limited
      number of non-ACTG 320 volunteers) who have been receiving ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC and IDV and
      are currently exhibiting a range of virologic responses. By dividing the study into the
      corresponding, nonsequential cohorts (Groups A, B, C, D), different approaches to evaluating
      virologic success, i.e., undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and virologic failure, i.e.,
      plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of 500 copies/ml or more [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: 200 copies/ml or
      more], are explored while maintaining long-term follow-up of ACTG 320 patients. [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B, C, and D completed follow-up on March 4, 1999. Therefore, only
      information pertinent to Group A is included. This study will examine the question of whether
      intensification of therapy can prolong the virologic benefit in individuals whose plasma
      HIV-1 RNA concentrations have been below the limits of assay detection on ZDV (or d4T) plus
      3TC plus IDV.]

      Rollover patients from ACTG 320 are given enrollment priority and permitted to enroll in all
      4 study groups; non-ACTG patients are permitted to enroll in Groups A and B if accrual
      objectives are not met with ACTG 320 patients.

      GROUP A:

      Patients with screening plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations below 500 copies/ml are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms and stratified according to their participation in ACTG 320 (original
      randomization to IDV versus open-label IDV). The 2 treatment arms are as follows:

      ARM A1: IDV plus ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus ABC. ARM A2: IDV plus ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus
      ABC placebo. Patients who achieve a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of 500 copies/ml or more on 2
      consecutive determinations may continue their assigned arm in a blinded fashion, or seek the
      best alternative therapy selected by the local investigator or primary care physician.

      GROUP B:

      Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-naive patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA
      plasma concentrations of 500 copies/ml or more are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms and
      stratified by plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations (above versus below 15,000 RNA copies/ml) and
      participation in ACTG 320 (original randomization to IDV versus open-label IDV). The
      treatment arms are as follows:

      ARM B1: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV. ARM B2: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir
      dipivoxil plus NFV placebo. ARM B3: 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (or
      1 if 2 not tolerated) (chosen from ZDV, 3TC, d4T, or didanosine [ddI]) plus EFV plus adefovir
      dipivoxil plus NFV.

      ARM B4: 2 NRTIs (or 1 if 2 not tolerated) (chosen from ZDV, 3TC, d4T, or ddI) plus EFV plus
      adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV placebo.

      GROUP C:

      NNRTI-naive patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of 500-2,000 copies/ml at screening
      may elect to be randomized to a treatment arm in Group B or continue with their current ACTG
      320 regimen as follows:

      ARM C: ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus IDV. Patients who elect this treatment are randomized in
      Group B if their plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations are confirmed to be above 2,000 copies.

      GROUP D:

      NNRTI-experienced, ACTG 320 patients with screening plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of 500
      copies/ml or more receive open-label treatment as follows:

      ARM D: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/29/98: Enrollment
      to Group B is closed to accrual. Group A patients with HIV-1 RNA of 200 copies/ml or more on
      2 consecutive determinations may continue their assigned treatment or seek best alternative
      antiretroviral therapy, which may include access to ABC. Group B patients with plasma HIV-1
      RNA of 500 copies/ml or more may continue their assigned treatment or seek best available
      antiretroviral therapy, which may include access to ABC, EFV, and adefovir dipivoxil with
      L-carnitine supplementation. Group C patients with HIV-1 RNA levels above 2,000 copies/ml and
      Group D patients with levels above 500 copies/ml may no longer be randomized to a treatment
      arm in Group B. Such patients may continue their assigned treatment or seek best available
      therapy, which may include access to therapy as per Group B patients.] [AS PER AMENDMENT
      06/16/99: Study treatment for Groups B, C, and D has been completed. Group A patients with a
      confirmed plasma HIV-2 endpoint who remain on study may have access to ABC while on study.]
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: With Version 4.0 of the protocol, many of the metabolic
      assessments and the cardiovascular risk assessment will be repeated, and a self-reported
      questionnaire of body shape changes will be added. In addition, an investigation of the
      effect of long-term IDV on pyuria/hematuria is added, as well as a study of HIV-1 RNA in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).]
