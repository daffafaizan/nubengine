      I. To compare fluciclovine F18 (F18 fluciclovine) PET CT for tumor volume assessment compared
      to T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 post contrast magnetic resonance
      (MR) brain imaging.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess changes in F18 fluciclovine defined disease with surgery and radiation.

      II. To assess the relationship between post-radiation enhancing brain tissue and F18
      fluciclovine activity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the association between results from pathology and F18 fluciclovine, T2 FLAIR,
      and T1 post-contrast MR brain imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) and undergo 4 PET/CT scans over 10
      minutes paired with standard of care MRI within 14 days prior to initial maximal tumor
      resection, within 7 days prior to initiation of radiation therapy, 28 days after the
      completion of radiation therapy, and 6 months after the completion of radiation therapy.

      After completion of study, patients will be followed up at 3 and 6 months.
