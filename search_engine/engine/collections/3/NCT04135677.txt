      for preventing thromboembolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The
      contemporary strategy for post-implantation antithrombotic medication therapy derived from
      several initial industrialized authoritative researches, demonstrated as 45days for
      anticoagulation and prolonged DOAC for 6 months. In spite of the increasing experience of
      operators and arrival of new technologies, the rates of DRT still maintained. Therefore,
      whether altered medication therapy post-implantation attracted overwide attention. Nowadays,
      new oral anticoagulation such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran has evolved empirically and
      successively has been applied for days-weeks anticoagulation therapy following LAAO ,yet, the
      specific recommended dosage remained unclear.

      Therefore, the objective of the study is to compare the effects of different dosage of
      rivaroxaban for short-term(3months) anticoagulation therapy versus DAPT on the prevention of
      device thrombusis following transcatheter LAAO.
