      subconjunctival scarring thay may result in the surgical failure in trabeculectomy, its
      sporous matrix modulates the migrations and proliferations of fibroblasts to create a
      vascular and long-lasting bleb without the adverse effects, such as avascular thin bleb wall,
      bleb leak, hypotony, and inflammations, potentially caused by the regeneration suppression
      effects upon the use of cytotoxic agents as anti-fibrotic agents, such as MMC (Mitomycin-C)in
      the study.

      Results of ologen CM studies have been published at conferences and published in
      peer-reviewed journals; ologen CM is approved in Europe as an aid for tissue repair, and by
      the FDA in the US as an adjunct in wound management(K080868). In general, over 6,000 ologen
      CM have been implanted worldwide during the past two years with good results and excellent
      safety profile.

      The clinical trial is a phase-IV post-marketing FDA approved device study designed as
      open-label, randomised, parallel, and comparative. 128 patients at 8 sites are anticipated to
      be recruited according to the enrollment criteria, while randomisation will be assigned by a
      sealed envelope system after the patient has signed consent. Trabeculectomy is performed
      thereafter with either MMC or ologen CM applications as described in the protocol with
      postoperative parameters to be measured and analysed with non-parametric tests(Chi-square,
      Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney tests) as well as Kaplan-Meier survival models.
