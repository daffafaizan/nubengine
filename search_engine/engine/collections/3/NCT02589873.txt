    
      The study seeks to compare weight loss, changes in physical activity and dietary fat intake,
      and participant engagement in two Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) interventions derived
      from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) curriculum: an in-person and an
      internet-based intervention program.

      We hypothesize that the internet-based intervention will be more effective in achieving
      weight loss than the in-person intervention, given its convenience for participants to
      complete sessions and therefore greater potential engagement in the program.
