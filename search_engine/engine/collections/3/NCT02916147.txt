      from alveolar and systemic inflammatory response. Alarmin is endogenous peptide released by
      white blood cells and epithelial cells when the body undergo danger signal stimulation which
      can enhance immune response and has a double effect on tumor. Some alarmins and their soluble
      receptors such as HMGN1, HMGb1, IL-33 and their soluble receptors including sTLR4 and sST2
      can be used as biomarkers for tumor progression. Previous studies have shown that sevoflurane
      anesthesia can reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
      Meanwhile, the latest retrospective study indicated that the mortality of cancer patients
      receiving volatile anesthesia was significantly higher than that of intravenous anesthesia.
      At this stage, no study aimed to investigate the change of alarmins in broncho-alveoli and
      serum during OLV lung surgery and the possible effect of different anesthetics on them.
      Therefore, the investigators plan to enroll 40 patients with lung cancer receiving pulmonary
      lobectomy. Patients are randomly divided into sevoflurane volatile anesthesia group and
      propofol intravenous anesthesia group (n=20). Perioperative serum and bronchoalveolar lavage
      from ventilated lung are obtained, using ELISA method, to assay and compare the changes of
      alarmins such as HMGN1, HMGb1, IL-33 and their soluble receptors including sTLR4 and sST2
      between two groups. All the patients will be followed up for 12 months. The correlation of
      alarmins and prognosis as well as the effect of volatile and intravenous anesthesia on the
      prognosis of patients will be preliminarily evaluated.
