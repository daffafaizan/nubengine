      hospitalized, place the Urinary Incontinence (UI) problem in a priority position both in
      hospital and community care. Guadarrama (Public Madrid Health Service) is a medium-stay
      Hospital. It makes treatment to recover from acute disease and UI has 80% prevalence at
      admitted patients.

      Main objective:To assess the efficacy of Prompted Voiding (PV) therapy for reverse of UI
      status in elderly patients hospitalized in a Functional Recovery Ward. (FRW) Methods:
      Experimental research pre/post-Intervention, with 5 repeated measures data: baseline
      (preintervention); at discharge, at one, three and six months after discharge
      (post-intervention). Sample size is 212 admitted patients in the FRW with UI. Prompted
      voiding intervention will be applied by nursing team following the procedure hospital
      approved and it will be individualized to each patient.

      Main Outcome: urinary continence (YES/NO), others outcomes: amount and frequency of urine
      loss, type of incontinence pads; follow-up: urinary continence at one, three, and six months
      after discharge.

      Applicability: Incorporating Prompted Voiding Therapy in UI patients care, encouraging global
      care, relevant implications for reduce the morbidity, improvement the quality of life,
      decrease health costs.
