      surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of RESPIMER速 NetiFlow速 solution
      on nasal tissue repair versus saline solution (0.9% NaCl), the standard treatment.

      The type of surgery selected for this study is total endoscopic ethmoidectomy. This is a
      frequently used standard surgery that requires nasal cleansing for an average of 28 days.
      This process allows the regeneration of the nasal epithelial lining of the wound (areas of
      exposed bone), as well as the healing of swelling and scarring due to the surgery.

      The follow up last 28 days with 4 visits (D7, D14, D21 and D28).
