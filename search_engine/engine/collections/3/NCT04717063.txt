      sample will be collected from the operatory's atmosphere for 30 min. prior to the study
      subject appointment by placing blood agar plates on a support board attached to the bracket
      chair tray. Upon completion of a half-mouth (e.g. right side) dental prophylaxis, each study
      subject will be instructed to rinse for one minute with 10 ml of one of the two mouthwash
      solutions (1.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.0% hydrogen peroxide) and to expectorate all remaining
      liquid. Next, the dental prophylaxis will be completed on the other side of the mouth.
      Bioaerosol samples will be collected prior to and following rinsing on blood agar plates
      placed on a support board at a 50-degree angle to the participant's chest, on the
      participant's chest, and on the examiner's forehead. Plates will be closed and labeled. The
      plates will be transferred to the microbiology laboratory for analysis. All subjects will be
      followed for adverse events throughout the study.
