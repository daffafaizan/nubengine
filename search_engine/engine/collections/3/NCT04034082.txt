      by cardiovascular disease, intermittent hypoxia therapy (IHT) - defined as repeated episodes
      of hypoxia interspersed with normoxic periods delivered by an ad hoc device - might be a
      valuable tool to be associated to structured cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions.

      The present study is a pilot, monocentric, randomized (randomization ratio 1:1), parallel
      group study to assess the effect of IHT on functional capacity vs conventional care in old
      patients with functional impairment admitted to a phase 2 in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation
      program.

      The study will enroll cardiac patients of both genders, â‰¥ 75 years and with a functional
      impairment assessed by a Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score < 7.

      The effect of IHT on functional capacity will be evaluated on top of the conventional
      multidisciplinary CR intervention, by means of SPPB score variation; variations in quality of
      life and cognitive status will also be evaluated as secondary goals of the study.

      The total amount of IHT sessions per patient will be 10, 1 per day over 2 weeks, the duration
      of each single procedure will be 45 min and the Hypoxic O2 conc.% will be 14-10. The study
      was approved by local ethic committee.
