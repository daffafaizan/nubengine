      failure. It is characterized by the presence of circulating adrenal antibodies. No therapy
      for infertile patients with premature ovarian failure due to autoimmune oophoritis has been
      proven effective by prospective controlled study. Anecdotal reports have suggested that
      high-dose, long-term prednisone therapy may be useful in treating autoimmune ovarian failure.
      However, prednisone, when used in high-dose for a long-term has substantial side effects,
      including aseptic necrosis of bone requiring major surgical intervention. Despite this risk,
      patients with premature ovarian failure are being treated based on this anecdotal evidence.
      We are aware of two patients with premature ovarian failure who developed aseptic necrosis of
      bone on high-dose, long-term prednisone therapy administered elsewhere.

      This protocol will test the hypothesis that a lower risk therapy (alternate-day, lower dose,
      shorter-term prednisone) will induce remission of ovarian failure caused by autoimmune
      oophoritis. The protocol will use a double-masked, placebo-controlled design. Patients with
      premature ovarian failure who have serologic evidence of steroidogenic cell autoimmunity will
      be candidates. Successful outcome will be defined as a return of ovulation as determined by
      weekly serum progesterone levels. The hypothesis that short-term, alternate-day prednisone
      therapy restores ovulation will be tested with an equality of proportions test comparing the
      proportion of patients who ovulate during placebo with the proportion of patients who ovulate
      during prednisone therapy.
