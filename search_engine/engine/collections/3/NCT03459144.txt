      treatment effect of "1+pro re nata(PRN)" treatment regimen for PCV. The aim of this study is
      to compare the outcomes of different treatment methods including PDT, IVR and combination
      therapy under the "1+PRN" treatment regimen for PCV.

      The study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial about different treatment
      methods on PCV under "1+PRN" treatment regimen. The null hypothesis of the study is that
      combination therapy may be the optimal treatment method for PCV. The primary outcome measures
      is the Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the participants at 1 year after treatment.
      Besides, the slit-lamp examination, tonometry, funduscopy, and OCT, FFA, ICGA examinations
      will also be compared between different groups to find the optimal treatment for PCV.
