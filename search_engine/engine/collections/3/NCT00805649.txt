      (Group 1; n = 52) and eyes with occult lesions (Group 2; n = 106). Patients with
      predominantly classic lesions received low fluorescence photodynamic therapy (42 J/cm2 for 72
      sec), followed by, 24 hours later, a 1.5 mL core pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal
      injection of dexamethasone (0.8 mg) and bevacizumab (1.25 mg). Patients with occult lesions
      received a 0.4 mL core pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal injection of triamcinolone (8
      mg) and bevacizumab (1.25 mg). At baseline and follow-up examinations, the best-corrected
      visual acuity (BCVA; logMar), central macular thickness (optical coherence tomography),
      intraocular pressure (IOP; Goldmann tonometry) were determined. In addition, the need for
      retreatment was assessed, and adverse events were monitored.
