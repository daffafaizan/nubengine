      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The patients who are treated according to this 2
      step allogeneic HSCT protocol will receive cyclophosphamide to induce in-vivo tolerization of
      both autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes, followed by an allogeneic CD34-selected HSCT. The
      primary research questions relate to immune reconstitution, incidence of GVHD, and relapse in
      patients who receive lymphocyte treatment of this type in allogeneic HSCT and how it impacts
      overall survival.
