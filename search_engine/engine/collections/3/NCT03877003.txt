      disease (CVD). In fact eggs are a good source of phosphatidyl choline (PC) and choline has a
      number of metabolic roles including lipid metabolism, membrane structure, liver health and a
      neurotransmitter. Recent reports that choline may be metabolized by the intestinal microbiota
      into TMAO, a compound that may increase the risk for heart disease. It is not clear how much
      egg contribute to TMAO formation in individuals with metabolic syndrome.

      Therefore the objective of this study is to determine the impact of daily intake of 3 eggs
      versus a choline supplement on plasma TMAO and other biomarkers for CVD risk and also to
      assess if there are changes in microbiota with these interventions that might lead to the
      increases of TMAO in plasma.
