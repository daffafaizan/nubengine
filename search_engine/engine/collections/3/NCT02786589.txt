      an optimal concentration and amount of blood-stage P. vivax to observe the infection time,
      rate and cycle; principal clinical symptoms such as fever and anemia; heart, liver and kidney
      function; changes in spleen morphology and function, and dynamic changes in the function of
      peripheral immune cells. Moreover, the patient's tolerance to Plasmodium infection and
      changes in tumor-related parameters will be observed.

      The duration of the planned treatment is 3-6 months, and successful infection will be
      indicated by microscopic observation of parasitemia in peripheral blood samples. The
      treatment will last at least 12 weeks from the day of finding the Plasmodium from peripheral
      blood and will be terminated by chloroquine phosphate or Artemisinin compound preparation or
      Artesunate injection. Each patient will be vaccinated with P. vivax-infected red blood cells
      containing approximately 0.3-1×10^7 Plasmodium parasites. After vaccination, the onset and
      duration of peripheral parasitemia and the infection rate; principal clinical symptoms such
      as Chills, fever, pain (headache, joint pain, etc.), digestive tract reaction;peripheral
      hemogram changes；heart, liver and kidney function; changes in lung function, and dynamic
      changes in the function of peripheral immune cells will be observed. Moreover, the patient's
      tolerance to Plasmodium infection and changes in tumor-related parameters will be observed.
