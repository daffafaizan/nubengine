      parent studies. After providing informed consent, all eligible participants should start
      crizanlizumab treatment at the earliest convenience following the treatment schedule of 28
      days of the last dose in the parent study. Crizanlizumab will be administered at the same
      dose/schedule as in the parent study.

      After 105 days of the last dose of the parent study the participants will have a safety
      follow up visit (overlapping with the treatment phase of the study).

      The study is expected to remain open for 10 years from the first Patient's first visit (FPFV)
      in this clinical study or until study treatment becomes commercially available and is
      reimbursed in the respective indication or until such time that all enrolled patients no
      longer need treatment with crizanlizumab, whichever comes first.
