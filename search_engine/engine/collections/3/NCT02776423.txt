      received treatment with transurethral polyacrylamide hydrogel injection (BulkamidÂ®). Patients
      were considered ineligible for surgery based on significant co-morbidity, one or more
      previously failed invasive treatments, complex urinary incontinence, or previous pelvic
      radiation therapy. At the baseline visit patients underwent a routine gynecological exam
      including pelvic ultrasonography. Patients completed validated questionnaires at the baseline
      visit and follow-up for evaluation of subjective treatment success. At baseline, women were
      asked to self-report any concomitant diseases or health conditions which were noted in the
      patient records together with a standard gynecological, urological and general health
      history. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 2 and 6 months after first injection at which
      time a second injection was administered at patients' discretion.
