      estimated at 45% regardless of treatment.1-4 Although neoadjuvant cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy (NAC) followed by a radical cystectomy or cystoprostatectomy with a lymph node
      dissection is the preferred treatment choice for MIBC in the United States, there are several
      drawbacks and challenges with this approach. Patients must be fit to undergo a surgical
      intervention. Grade 2 through 5 complications have been documented in 53% of patients
      undergoing cystectomy at a tertiary care center, and the surgical mortality rate is 1.5%.5, 6
      Furthermore, urinary diversion commonly requires an ileal conduit and an external appliance,
      impacting patient's quality of life.

      By incorporating neoadjuvant nivolumab with AMVAC, our goal in RETAIN-2 is to increase the
      number of patients who would be eligible for bladder preservation while maintaining the
      long-term oncologic outcomes. Nivolumab, an anti-PD1 therapy, is FDA approved for treatment
      of metastatic urothelial carcinoma post platinum-based chemotherapy.20 Recently, neoadjuvant
      pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) and atezolizumab (anti-PDL1) was tested in MIBC in the PURE-01 and
      ABACUS studies, and a pT0 rate of 38.6% and 29%, respectively, was achieved.21, 22
      Additionally, recent work by Kim et al. presented at AACR 2019 demonstrated that AMVAC
      induces gene signatures in luminal tumors and may have a synergistic response with
      immunotherapy. Given the impressive activity of both AMVAC and nivolumab in the neoadjuvant
      setting, in this study the investigators hypothesize that using the combination of
      neoadjuvant nivolumab and AMVAC will lead to higher cT0 rate and metastasis-free survival at
      2 years. At the same time by using the risk adapted strategy, a select group of patients will
      be able to preserve their bladders and significantly improve their quality-of-life.
