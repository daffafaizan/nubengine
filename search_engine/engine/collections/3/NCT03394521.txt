      picked up at a routine sight test at their optician or general practitioner. These patients
      are usually diagnosed in secondary care hospital eye services by an ophthalmologist.

      In addition to those diagnosed with OHT and glaucoma there are a large group of patients who
      have ocular characteristics similar to those found in glaucoma patients, but could also
      represent variations in normality. In this group, 'glaucoma suspects', monitoring in
      secondary care for a number of years is recommended in order to establish whether they have
      glaucoma or if after several years of monitoring there are no clear signs of glaucoma the
      patient may be discharged.

      In our study we will conduct a case-note review of a well-defined cohort of patients who were
      first identified through a diagnostic accuracy study (the GATE study). This includes (1)
      patients with OHT, (2) patients identified as glaucoma suspects and (3) patients diagnosed
      with glaucoma. We will investigate how many patients have experience worsening disease and
      how many patients have been discharged due to a low risk of glaucoma. We will also
      investigate the relationship between baseline demographic characteristics and characteristics
      of the eye and progression of disease.
