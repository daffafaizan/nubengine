      areas of the brain and has very few side effects.

      The treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation requires attendance to hospital daily
      sessions for 4 consecutive weeks. Each session lasts up to 30 minutes.

      Side effects include scalp discomfort and mild headache. No anesthesia is required.

      Stimulation aims the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region previously studied to treat
      depression symptoms with positive results.

      The present technique has never been employed in previous studies, but risks are
      insignificant.
