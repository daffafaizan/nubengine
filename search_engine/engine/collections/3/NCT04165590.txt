      vivax-infected red blood cells, containing approximately 0.1-1.0 Ã— 10^7 Plasmodium parasites.
      The treatment will last for 5-10 weeks from the day of successful infection. During the
      period of Plasmodium immunotherapy, doctor will use artesunate to control the P. vivax
      erythrocyte infection rate at a low level, so as to prevent the severe adverse event. After
      5-10 weeks, parasitemia will be terminated by antimalarial drugs for ending the treatment of
      Plasmodium immunotherapy (the immunological treatment effect may persist after the
      termination of Plasmodium infection). After the treatment, patients will be followed up for 2
      years.
