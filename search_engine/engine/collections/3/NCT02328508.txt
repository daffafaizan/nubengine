    
      OBJECTIVE - This study evaluated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on wound
      healing, inflammation index, glycemic control, amputation rate, survival rate of tissue,
      bacterial wound cultures, and quality of life (QOL) in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients
      with diabetes.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This study was a randomized, single-center clinical trial. The
      effects of HBOT on patients in the experimental group were compared with the control group
      received only routine care. HBOT was carried out in a hyperbaric chamber for 120-min per
      session, five days a week for four consecutive weeks (20 treatment sessions). Data were
      collected at 4 segments: pre-treatment (before first administration of HBOT; T1), during
      treatment (at the tenth administration of HBOT; T2), post-treatment (at the twentieth
      administration of HBOT; T3), and treatment follow-up (two weeks after the last therapy ended;
      T4).
