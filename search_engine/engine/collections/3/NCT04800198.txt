      non-invasively ventilated and spontaneously breathing premature and newborn babies, with a
      number large enough for an analysis. For this purpose, the pressure in the nasopharynx of
      these children is to be measured using a suction catheter, as is usually used to suction off
      mucus and saliva, and the measured values are to be evaluated with software. This method is a
      tried and tested method in adults for measuring the pressure conditions in the nasopharynx,
      which was developed and used by Mr. Olthoff. A possible later clinical application in
      premature and newborn infants ranges from the measurement of breathing and ventilation to
      manual control of respiratory support depending on the measured value to automatic triggering
      and control of a ventilator in the sense of nSIPPV ventilation (non-invasive synchronized
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation )
