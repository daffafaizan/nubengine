      resistance exercise training (PRET) on shoulder and neck dysfunction due to spinal accessory
      neurapraxia/ neurectomy in patients with head and neck cancer. Sixty-four head and neck
      cancer survivors will be randomly assigned to PRET or standard care. Participants assigned to
      the PRET group will exercise 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The goal of the exercise program
      will be to enhance scapular stability, and improve mobility and strength of the upper
      extremity. The resistance exercise program will be progressive in terms of the number of sets
      and repetitions performed, as well as amount lifted, depending on baseline strength levels
      and overall performance status. The primary outcomes for the study include pain and
      dysfunction, active and passive range of motion measures, strength and endurance testing, and
      quality of life. Nerve conduction testing and electromyography will be performed to assess/
      monitor the status of the spinal accessory nerve and trapezius muscle function respectively.
