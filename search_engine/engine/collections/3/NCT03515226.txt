      University's School of Social Work in Yakima Valley recently partnered to develop a training
      program for bachelors (BA) level Social Workers to address limited clinician capacity in
      rural primary care settings. Currently the curriculum is a combination of didactic training
      in telephone based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; 20 hours), role play training (25
      hours), and guided supervision. The scalability of these programs is limited, however, by
      expert time to conduct training activities, clinician time away from work to engage in
      training activities, and the fact that even when clinicians participate in training, there is
      no guarantee they will certify. Adaptive learning, an educational method that uses adaptive
      algorithms to may be a potential solution to these problems in capacity building. These
      programs can tailor the educational experience to the needs of the trainee, reduce time in
      training, improve competence in complex decision-making and standardize training. This study
      builds on the existing research base on clinicial training, and adds to it by designing and
      testing an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) based on adaptive learning algorithms. Both CBT
      experts (Aisenberg) and past CBT trainees (Heritage University School of Social Work) will
      partner with experts in educational software development (Popovic) to create the ITS, which
      will be compared to training as usual on time to training, competence and skill drift. The
      investigators hypothesize that capacity building through improved learnability (target
      mechanism) will result in enhanced clinical ability to deliver CBT elements competently, and
      in a shorter time-period, and that greater competence will result in better quality of care.
