      multidisciplinary team applicant, whose results are presented in paragraph 2.6 (group results
      Valladolid) and Annex I (group results Oviedo).

      The investigators propose phase I-II trial with 10 patients with a common condition and
      difficult to solve volumetric regeneration therapies, such as bone cysts in the maxillofacial
      region.

      Autologous mesenchymal cells isolated from a sample obtained from the cancellous bone of the
      tuberosity intraoral mandibular later and after expansion, will be conveyed in the matrix of
      autologous serum. The total process takes 6-8 weeks. After this time, perform the osteotomy
      and enucleation of the cyst under local anesthesia and the residual cavity is filled with
      bioimplant containing the MSV-H.

      Once the bioimplant, there will be clinical controls at 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months, to follow
      the evolution of regeneration by bone cavity in panoramic radiograph and CT scan.

      This project proposes a novel approach to therapy twice, combining a tissue engineering
      protocol (bioimplant) consisting of autologous mesenchymal cells have already been approved
      by the unit cell production of Valladolid (MSV-H), and a new protein matrix obtained
      autologous serum crosslinked in order to stimulate the regenerative capacity of maxillary
      cystic bone defects.
