      the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from the body
      over time) of ceftobiprole after a single 250-mg intravenous (IV) infusion (given directly
      into the vein) for 2 hours, before and after dialysis to patients with end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or healthy volunteers. This is a Phase 1, open label
      study (all patients involved know the identity of the drug). Healthy volunteers will be given
      a single 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole; patients with ESRD on hemodialysis will be
      given a 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole 3 hours either before dialysis or immediately
      after dialysis. Plasma and urine samples will be assayed for ceftobiprole. Samples will be
      collected over a 48 hour period of time. Safety evaluations will include monitoring of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry in all
      patients/volunteers, and urinalysis in healthy volunteers subjects), pregnancy testing, vital
      signs, physical examination, and recording of concomitant medications. Healthy volunteers
      will be given a single 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole; patients with ESRD on
      hemodialysis will be given a 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole 3 hours either before
      dialysis or immediately after dialysis.
