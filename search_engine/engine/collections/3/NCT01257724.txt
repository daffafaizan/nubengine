      investigators have developed 'Synthesized HIV/AIDS Research Evidence' (SHARE), which is an
      evidence service for those working in the HIV sector. SHARE consists of several components:
      1) an online searchable database of HIV-relevant systematic reviews (retrievable based on a
      taxonomy of topics related to HIV/AIDS and open text search), 2) periodic email updates, 3)
      access to user-friendly summaries, and 4) peer relevance assessments. The objective is to
      evaluate whether this "full serve" evidence service increases the use of research evidence by
      community-based organizations as compared to a "self-serve" evidence service.

      Methods/design The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT),
      along with a follow-up qualitative process study to explore the findings in greater depth.
      All community-based organizations affiliated with Canadian AIDS Society (n=120) will be
      invited to participate and will be randomized to receive either the "full-serve" version of
      SHARE or the "self-serve" version (a listing of relevant systematic reviews with links to
      records on PubMed and worksheets that help community-based organizations find and use
      research evidence) using a simple randomized design. All management and staff from each
      organization will be provided access to the version of SHARE that their organization is
      allocated to. The trial duration will be 10 months (two-month baseline period, six-month
      intervention period, and two month cross-over period), the primary outcome measure will be
      the mean number of logins/month/organization (averaged across the number of users from each
      organization) between baseline and the end of the intervention period and the secondary
      outcome will be intention to use research evidence as measured by a survey administered to
      one key decision-maker from each organization. For the qualitative study, one key
      organizational decision-maker from 15 organizations in each trial arm (n=30) will be
      purposively sampled. One-on-one semi-structured interviews will be conducted by telephone on
      their views about and their experiences with the evidence service they received, how helpful
      it was in their work, why it was helpful (or not helpful), what aspects were most and least
      helpful and why, and recommendations for next steps.
