        -  a clinical exam: disease history, previous treatments, weight, height, patient's
           performance status (ECOG) and HCC status.

        -  a biological test: biochemical (total bilirubin, ASAT-ALAT, LDH, albumin, alkaline
           phosphatases, GGT), hematological (if the patient is going to receive a fiducial),
           alphafoetoprotein (for HCC) and pregnancy test (if applicable)

        -  a tumor assessment: using a CT-scan or a MRI and using RECIST or mRECIST (if HCC), plus
           other morphological exams if judged useful by the investigator This check-up has to be
           realized within 28 days before inclusion. Then, the use of fiducial is optional.

      Before the beginning of the treatment, a pre-therapeutic check-up is done:

        -  the inclusion check-up has to be done a second time if the treatment begins more than 28
           days after the first one

        -  Tracking scanner.

      The SBRT treatment is done in 3 to 6 times and no specific SBRT techniques are asked for, the
      investigator can choose according to the center habits.

      After the treatment, a follow-up will be realized at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months
      and then once a year until the last patient included reach their 36th month of follow-up. The
      follow-up check-up consists of a clinical exam, biological test, tumor assessment and
      tolerance assessment.
