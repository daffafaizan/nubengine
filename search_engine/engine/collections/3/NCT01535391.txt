    
      This study is an open-label, multicentric, phase IIIb study of NILOTINIB administered orally
      at the dose of 300 mg twice daily (total daily dose 600 mg daily) for 24 months (study core),
      and indefinitely if it is in the interest of the patient (the drug will be given
      free-of-charge after 24 months to all those patients achieving the CMR4 at 24 months and in
      absence of safety concerns). Nilotinib dose is increased to 400 mg BID in case of suboptimal
      response or failure (with the exception of patients who will fail for progression to ABP: in
      case of progression to ABP, the patient will not be treated with study drug and the choice of
      the treatment will be up to the physician).

      Study duration is estimated in 6 years, 1 year of estimated enrollment, 2 years therapy
      duration. Thereafter, information on course and survival is due for other 3 years.

      The main data analysis will be performed when all patients will complete 24 months of
      treatment (or discontinued earlier). Safety and tolerability profile will be assessed by
      collecting hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events, laboratory examinations and ECG
      data. The molecular response will be assessed using the GIMEMA standardized molecular
      laboratories (Labnet network).
