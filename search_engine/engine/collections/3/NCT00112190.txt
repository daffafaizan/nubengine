      sugar pill called placebo. They have equal chances of receiving either treatment. After
      having completed this study, patients may be eligible to continue treatment for a longer
      period. At that point, all patients receive itopride.

      Patients need to come to the clinic for evaluations 4 times during the trial. Various
      evaluations are done at these visits, such as a physical exam, lab tests, evaluation of the
      heart condition, and questionnaires need to be completed by the patient to see if the drug
      helps them in relieving their symptoms.
