    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study
      designed to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal administration of 3 doses of OPN-375
      (100, 200, and 400 Âµg bid) in subjects with bilateral nasal polyposis and nasal congestion.

      This study consisted of 3 phases. After signing informed consent, subjects who met
      eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (screening) entered the study.

        1. Pretreatment phase (single-blind, placebo, run-in): 7 to up to 14 days duration, to
           determine disease status eligibility and to ensure the subject was able to comply with
           study procedures prior to randomization and enrolment in the double-blind treatment
           phase.

        2. Double-blind treatment phase: 16 weeks duration with 6 scheduled visits starting with
           Visit 2, Day 1 (baseline) when eligible subjects were randomized by balance allocation
           to 1 of 4 treatment groups and ending at Visit 7 (Week 16).

        3. Open-label extension phase: 8 weeks duration with 1 scheduled visit (Visit 8 [Week 24]).
