        -  No Catheterization after mini-PCNL (study) - the bladder catheterization is not
           performed.

        -  Catheterization after mini-PCNL (control) - the bladder will be drained with the
           urethral catheter.

      All patients will fill out the VASP in 2, 6, 12, 24 hours after mini-PCNL. Ultrasound
      examination of urinary bladder will be performed after mini-PCNL. All the AE will be
      registered.
