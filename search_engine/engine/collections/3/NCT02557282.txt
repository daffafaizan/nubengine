      de-identified patient cases collected retrospectively. The purpose of the study is to
      demonstrate equivalent clinical quality between the investigational and predicate devices
      using a radiologist evaluation of key metrics which are applicable to CTP images.

      The maps include the following:

        -  Mean Transfer Time (MTT) - the time that the contrast material stays in the tissue

        -  Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) - the volume of blood that is in a known volume of the
           tissue based on the concentration of contrast material that is in the tissue over the
           time

        -  Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) - describes the flow of the blood to the affected tissue

        -  Time To Peak (TTP) - the time that maximum enhancement is achieved at each volume of the
           tissue

        -  Time to maximum of impulse response function (TMAX)

      The retrospective data collected for each patient will include a non-contrast head CT exam
      completed on the same day as CTP image, and a follow-up head CT at least 1-2 days after the
      initial imaging study (initial non-contrast head CT) if available.

      Similar performance between the investigational and predicate devices was demonstrated by the
      following criteria.

      i. Substantial equivalence of the perfusion maps between devices ii. Substantial equivalence
      of the core and penumbra tissues resulting from thresholds on the perfusion maps between
      devices iii. The clinical decision based on the exclusion or inclusion criteria for treatment
      is equivalent between devices
