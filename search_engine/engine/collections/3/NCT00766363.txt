    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1b safety study of three dose
      levels of EVP-6124 in subjects with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease and who are taking
      an AChEI medication (donepezil or rivastigmine).

      Study drug will be supplied as capsules and will be orally administered once daily for a
      total of 28 days. Eligible subjects will be admitted to an inpatient study unit on Day -2
      (two days before the first dose of study drug is administered) and will remain confined to
      the inpatient study unit for a total of five days. Starting on Day 4, subjects will continue
      the study in the outpatient setting, with study visits on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Safety
      assessments, PK sampling, and cognitive testing will be performed inpatient and at each study
      visit.
