      intervention among 20 caregivers of patients with advanced cancer. Investigators will collect
      mixed methods data to describe changes in proximal and distal outcomes. Investigators have
      chosen the time points to capture neural and behavioral changes associated with the
      intervention and to capture end of life quality of life (QOL) for a majority of caregivers
      after death of their loved one. Investigators aim to:

        1. Evaluate the short and longer-term effects of the end of life care with medication
           (EOL_M) and meditation only (M_Only) interventions on stress reduction and end of life
           (EOL) planning behaviors and determine if there are different effects between EOL_M and
           M_ Only interventions.

        2. Evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of the intervention on caregiver distress,
           decisional regret, and EOL values and goals of care for treatment.

        3. Evaluate the impact of decentering on the association between the interventions,
           self-management behaviors (stress reduction and EOL planning behaviors) and distress,
           anxiety, concordance between EOL values and goals of care for treatment, decisional
           regret and satisfaction with EOL care.

        4. Describe the neural activity processes that are associated with increased
           self-management activities.
