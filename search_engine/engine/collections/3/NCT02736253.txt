      amputation and major amputation of the diabetic foot infection in the forward direction
      without using standard scoring procedures. Patients who were applied to Diabetic Foot Council
      of our setting with diabetic foot infections between 2012 and 2014 were included in the
      study. Patients were followed prospectively and ethical approval was obtained from research
      ethics committee of our setting. An informed consent form was provided by each patient.
      Diabetic foot infection was decided as local infection involving only the skin and the
      subcutaneous tissue or infection involving symptoms and signs more than this criterion.
      Properties and variables of the cases were recorded during the admission process with total
      57 different situations. The related characteristics were followed until the end of the
      treatment. Osteomyelitis, amputation and factors affecting to have major amputation on the
      cases were investigated. In the first step, data normality tests were performed with a simple
      data analysis and univariate analysis was applied in the second stage to which meaningful. At
      the last stage, major amputation, amputation and osteomyelitis were analyzed with stepwise
      multiple logistic analysis (SLA) model. Logistic regression was subject as significant data
      were saved as the independent risk factor. The Odds ratio and 95% CI were calculated from the
      beta coefficients of the variables with significant p value. P < 0.05 was used for
      significance at all tests.
