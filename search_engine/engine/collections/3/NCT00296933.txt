      The purpose of the present study is to comprehensively evaluate memory functioning of MDD
      patients before and after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment with bupropion-XL or
      escitalopram. A neuropsychological test battery will incorporate multiple aspects of memory
      functioning including: short-term & working memory; verbal, non-verbal, spatial and
      prospective memory.

      Major Research Questions:

        1. Which subtypes of memory at baseline are more impaired?

        2. What is the relationship between memory impairment and symptom severity and previous
           number of episodes or duration of illness?

        3. Is successful AD treatment associated with improvement in memory functioning?

        4. Is there a main effect by AD type?

        5. On which subtypes of memory do patients improve, worsen, or remain neutral in the 2
           different AD groups? (Main effect of memory type?)

        6. What is the relationship between change in memory function and symptomatic outcome?

      Study Design:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial comparing the memory functioning of
      depressed subjects before and after 8 weeks of treatment with bupropion-XL as compared to
      escitalopram.

      All consenting, eligible subjects will receive either active bupropion-XL or active
      escitalopram following the baseline visit. Doses will be fixed with an opportunity for dose
      reduction if subjects are unable to tolerate fixed dose.
