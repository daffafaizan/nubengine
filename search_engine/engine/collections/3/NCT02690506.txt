      the spinal anesthesia. Two hours before spinal anesthesia, placebo pill was administered to
      patients in the group C and pregabalin 150 mg was administered to patients in the group P,
      respectively. Time for the onset of blockade, cephalad level of analgesia and duration of
      analgesia were measured.
