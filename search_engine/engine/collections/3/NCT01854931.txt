      2008, a,b) was implemented in this dissemination project. Class duration was 90 minutes,
      2-times per week over a 12-month period. During the initial 2 weeks, practice involved
      learning and performing 2 forms practiced in one set of 8 repetitions (for each form) and
      increased to a set of 10 repetitions for up to 5 forms between Week 3 and Week 5. Although
      additional forms were learned as the intervention progressed, starting in Week 6, training
      focused on 10-12 repetitions of the combination of forms rather than single forms. Once all 8
      forms were learned ( Week 10), training was maintained at between 10-15 repetitions of the
      8-form routine. Exercise activities were accompanied by music. Each Tai Chi practice session
      included (a) a 10-15 minute warm-up, (b) 60 minutes of Tai Chi practice, and (c) a 10-minute
      cool-down period. Instruction comprised (a) learning new movements and (b) reviewing
      movements learned from previous sessions. In addition, copies of the videotape/DVD and user's
      guidebook were distributed to all participants who were encouraged to use these materials for
      additional home practice.

      All participating individuals were assessed at baseline, 6 months (mid-point), 12 months
      (intervention termination), and 6 months following the intervention (post-intervention
      follow-up) on measures of health, fall history, functional ability, and quality-of-life. Each
      evaluation session lasted about one hour and was conducted by a trained research assessor in
      various centers where these classes were held.
