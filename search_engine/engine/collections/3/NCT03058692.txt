    
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 120 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial will be conducted at 3 United States sites and is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two priming doses of
      M-001 followed by a seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). The duration
      of this trial for each subject will be approximately 7 months. The entire study duration will
      be approximately 24 months. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety as measured
      by vaccine related adverse events, reactogenicity, and laboratory adverse events of two doses
      of M-001 vaccine, each dose administered approximately 21 days apart; and 2) To assess the T
      cell responses to M-001 component peptides following two doses of M-001. The secondary
      objectives are: 1) To assess all serious adverse events (SAEs) following receipt of each dose
      of M-001 vaccine or placebo, each dose separated by approximately 21 days, through the end of
      the study; 2) To assess all unsolicited non-serious AEs following receipt of each dose of
      M-001 or placebo, each dose separated by approximately 21 days, through 21 days after each
      dose of M-001 or placebo; and 3) To assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses to the
      2018-2019 IIV4 vaccine viruses.
