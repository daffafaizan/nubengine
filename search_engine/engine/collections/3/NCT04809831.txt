    
      This is an open-label split-mouth randomized clinical trial that aims to suggest an
      innovative protocol for domiciliary oral care of periodontal patients. In details, home use
      of Biorepair Peribioma Toothpaste and Mousse is proposed as a support of professional hygiene
      sessions.

      Patients that respond to the eligibility criteria and that sign the informed consent are
      recruited for periodontal therapy.The first professional hygiene session is performed at the
      baseline (T0); the following ones will be performed after 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2) from the
      baseline. In each session, periodontal indices of inflammation are detected; then,
      subgingival removal of plaque and tartar is performed, followed by glycine/erythritol
      air-flow application in periodontal pockets. A microbiological test is perfomed in order to
      detect red and orange complex bacteria. At this time, patients are randomly allocated into
      two groups:

        -  Trial Group: domiciliary oral hygiene with Biorepair Peribioma Toothpaste and Mousse
           twice a day until T2 session.

        -  Control Group: home oral hygiene with Curasept Toothpaste (0,2% Chlorhexidine) twice a
           day until T2 session.

      At the end of T1 and T2 professional session, a satisfaction survey about Peribioma
      Toothpaste and Mousse will ben given to the patients.
