      in patients with DLBCL treated by R-CHOP. These high risk patients should be considered for
      additional new treatment to standard R-CHOP or investigational approaches in the context of
      clinical trials that are designed to ensure that potentially curative therapy.

      Bortezomib has shown activity in vitro against DLBCL-derived cell lines. Single-agent
      bortezomib or chemotherapy combined bortezomib are feasible in follicular, mantle cell,
      marginal zone lymphoma and DLBCL with manageable toxicities. Bortezomib enhances the activity
      of chemotherapy in non-GCB but not GCB DLBCL, and provide a rational therapeutic approach
      based on genetically distinct DLBCL subtypes.

      High CR/CRu rate with bortezomib with standard R-CHOP suggests it may be a good backbone for
      additional maintenance leading to durable response. However, there is no study of bortezomib
      as maintenance therapy after treated with R-CHOP in high risk patients with DLBCL. So we
      applied additional bortezomib as maintenance therapy in order to assess improving efficacy
      and survival rates in high risk patients with non-GCB DLBCL who had been confirmed CR after
      treated with R-CHOP.
