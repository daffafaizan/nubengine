      patients in the study will take pre-made cinnamon extract pills three times a day, while the
      other half will take placebo pills (pills with no cinnamon extract) three times a day for 6
      months. During this time, every patient will keep track of her period on a calendar.

      Blood tests measuring insulin, substances important for insulin action, cholesterol, and
      glucose (sugar) will be taken before and after the 6 months of medication. A total of 8
      separate visits will be needed to finish the study. At the end of the study, the
      investigators will then compare the number of periods, blood glucose, insulin, and
      cholesterol levels between the patients that took cinnamon and the patients that took
      placebo.
