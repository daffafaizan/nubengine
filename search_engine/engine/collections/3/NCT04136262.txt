      (MTX) for postmenopausal women with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a multicenter,
      randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Three hundred postmenopausal women with active
      RA will be randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment with TwHF 20mg thrice daily and MTX 10 mg
      once a week for 24 weeks, or MTX plus dummy TwHF. The primary outcome is the percentage of
      participants with American College of Rheumatology 20% at week 24.
