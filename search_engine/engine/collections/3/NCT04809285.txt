    
      The study is a multi-center, prospective single-arm design without controls. All subjects
      will participate for a minimum of 90 days (Phase 1) and some subjects 18 years of age or
      older will participate for up to 9 months (Phase 2). All subjects will wear the Guardian
      Connect system (real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)) continuously and use smart
      insulin pens or insulin pens with smart caps for multiple daily injections and continue their
      standard therapy throughout the duration of the study.

      The subject's insulin delivery, sleep, physical activity (as applicable) and food intake data
      will be collected through applications with meal logging requiring manual entry. In addition,
      subjects may also participate in optional self-administered insulin injection video capture
      and upload using Box and/or monthly menstrual cycle logging using Apple Health.
