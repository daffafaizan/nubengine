      stroke is pivotal for adequate treatment decision taking. Patients with small vessel stroke
      tend have a better prognosis than those with large artery disease. Further, patients with
      small artery infarction (lacunar stroke) have shown to respond well to treatment with
      intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA), but are poor candidates for
      endovascular recanalization. Conversely, IV rt-PA may be less effective at restoring
      perfusion of large artery occlusion, a stroke subtype that may benefit from intra-arterial
      thrombolysis or embolectomy. Similarly, patients with large intracerebral hemorrhage or
      cerebellar hemorrhage may require neurosurgical interventions, such as intracranial pressure
      monitoring, ventricular drainage, surgical evacuation, or hemicraniectomy.

      The purpose of TeleCLASS is to evaluate the discriminatory value of the Unassisted TeleStroke
      Scale (UTSS) obtained through in-hospital telemedicine for differentiation between patients
      with lacunar stroke and those with other acute stroke syndromes (nonLACS).
