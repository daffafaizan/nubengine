    
      This is a pilot study addressing office systems and clinician behavior change surrounding
      smoking cessation interventions for teens. The investigators' long-term goal is to improve
      the quality of clinical preventive services in practice-based research network settings.
      Their specific aims are to:

        -  a) pilot procedures for recruitment and randomization of PROS practices; and b) field
           trial/pilot PROS practitioner cessation counseling and practices' enrollment of
           adolescent patients; and

        -  assess the feasibility of pediatric clinician referral of adolescent patients to
           internet-based adjuncts for smoking cessation.

      The investigators will evaluate a pilot round of recruitment and randomization, and smoking
      cessation training and delivery in 10 PROS practice sites; and assess the acceptability of
      study procedures and on-line internet counseling adjunct referral feasibility within PROS
      practice sites. Up to 1000 adolescents presenting for well visits will complete a short
      baseline survey prior to their well-visit. A sample of them will be surveyed by phone at 4-6
      weeks to provide preliminary estimates of cessation counseling for future studies. The
      investigators will field test measures, describe the patterns of smoking among youth, and
      explore how much receiving interventions affects motivation, quitting, abstinence/relapse
      attitudes, attitudes towards internet-based outreach strategies, and behaviors for 100
      smokers.
