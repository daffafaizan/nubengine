      week) experimental trial, with a maximum number of 125 potential enrollees, with stratified
      random therapy assignment by Early or Late Perimenopause. Participants who meet the inclusion
      criteria for the original Progesterone for Perimenopausal Vasomotor Symptoms Study will be
      invited to join this additional sub-study. As part of the primary trial they will be randomly
      assigned into either the Progesterone or placebo group on a 1:1 basis. Primary and secondary
      data will be collected continuously throughout the study by completion of the Daily
      Perimenopause Diary-flow starting at baseline and continuously throughout the study.
