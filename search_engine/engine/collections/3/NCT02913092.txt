    
      This study will assess the feasibility of using electronic sensors for asthma inhalers in a
      population of urban minority adults and children with moderate-severe asthma in the Bronx.

      Investigators will also assess differences in asthma outcomes (specifically asthma control as
      a primary outcome measure) and treatment adherence in a group of participants with
      moderate-severe asthma who use inhalers with electronic sensors and real-time remote outreach
      worker monitoring/feedback compared to a group of participants who use inhalers with
      electronic sensors but without real-time monitoring/feedback.
