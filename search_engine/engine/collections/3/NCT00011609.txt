      robotic arm (WMRA) to improve the functional independence of veterans with SCI.

      The study will determine if the ability to perform marker tasks within the following four
      categories is improved after the 4 week training period using the robotic arm:

      1. activities of daily living, 2. vocational tasks, 3. advanced tasks, and subject-specific
      tasks.

      The secondary purposes of this project are the following: 1.Does quality of life (life
      satisfaction and health status) improve after a 4 week period of using the WMRA? 2. What are
      the perceived advantages of the WMRA to the veteran with SCI? Additionally, the study will
      evaluate the following: 1) ease of installation and usefulness of instructional manuals; 2)
      training requirements (time, tasks); 3) safety features; 4) reliability of the device; 5)
      home, community, and vocational applications; 6) user acceptability; 7) maintenance/ service;
      8) portability; and possible modifications.
