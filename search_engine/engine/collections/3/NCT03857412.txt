      phacoemulsification and implantation of an intraocular lens being the only therapeutic
      option. Cataract surgery is nowadays considered a safe and efficient procedure. However, one
      of the most frequent complications after surgery is posterior capsule opacification (PCO),
      that results in diminished postoperative visual acuity. PCO occurs due to remaining lens
      epithelial cells in the capsular bag, that start to migrate and proliferate.

      PCO can be easily treated by performing a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd-YAG)
      laser capsulotomy. However, even if laser capsulotomy is considered a simple procedure,
      possible complications are rise of intraocular pressure, inflammation, cystoid macular edema,
      or retinal detachment. Furthermore, several patients are no suitable candidates for laser
      capsulotomy, for example children and patients with high myopia.

      Therefore, it would be necessery to identify different approaches to prevent generation of
      PCO. One approach could be "cleaning" of the lens epithelial cells in the capsular bag by
      polishing of the lens capsule during surgery. Hence, the aim of this study is to examine
      whether capsular polishing is beneficial to decrease the growth and proliferation of LECs.
