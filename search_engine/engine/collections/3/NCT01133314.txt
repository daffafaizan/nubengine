    
      Children from Bissau seeking medical advice and who are recommended treatment for malaria in
      accordance with the current routines will be included as follows:

      All children getting the clinical diagnosis of malaria will be registered and basic
      information collected.

      All children with a positive malaria film and/or a positive RDT will be asked for a capillary
      blood sample (app. 50 - 100 microliters on a filterpaper). Using PCR the parasitological
      diagnosis will be verified and if parasites are identified the resistance patterns will be
      examined. Both the capillary blood samples and the RDTs (if taken by the health staff) will
      be used in order to examine whether the RDTs can be used for routine monitoring of resistance
      in an area.

      The study does not interfere in the routine treatment of the health staff. None of the
      children will be followed.
