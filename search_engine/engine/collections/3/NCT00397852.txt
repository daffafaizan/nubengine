      will be asked to join the trial.

      After informed consent, a randomization between 2 kinds of treatment will be done: K-wire
      fixation or no K-wire fixation of the fracture after a stable reposition.

      Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will
      investigate: the number of re-dislocations, re-operations, consolidation and dislocation on
      X-ray, function of both arms, complains in daily living and complications.
