      flouroapatite reinforced glass carbomer filling material.

      In this study, total of 100 (46 class I, 54 class II) restorations were performed in 36
      patients. All cavities were prepared conventionally. Half of the restorations were restored
      with nano composite resin (Tokuyama Estelite, Tokuyama Dental, Japan) and the other half were
      restored with glass carbomer material (GCP Dental, The Netherlands). Rubber-dam was used for
      isolation. Before the replacement of composite restorations, enamel edges were etched
      according to selective etching method. Then universal adhesive system was applied. Composite
      resin was applied to the cavity in 2 mm layers by incramental technique. Glass carbomer was
      placed with bulk technique by applying finger pressure with surface covering. Composite
      restorations were polymerized with LED light curing unit. Glass carbomer restorations were
      cured its own special curing unit. Restorations were evaluated with modified USPHS criteria
      at the end of the first week, 6 months and 12 months. Data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact
      Chi-Square test, Fisher Freeman Halton Test and Continuity (Yates) Correction. Wilcoxon sign
      test was used for intra-group comparisons of the parameters. Statistically significance was
      evaluated at p <0.05.
