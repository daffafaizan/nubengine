    
      The trial is designed as a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, phase 3,
      multi-center trial of IV arginine therapy in children with Vaso-occlusive painful episodes
      (VOE) in sickle cell disease (SCD) to further knowledge on efficacy and safety of the
      therapy. The exploratory objective is to more fully characterize the arginine metabolome in
      children with SCD during VOE, and evaluate the effects of arginine therapy on global arginine
      bioavailability and mitochondrial function together with important clinical outcomes (time to
      VOE resolution, pain scores, total parenteral opioid use, Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs),
      and hospital length of stay in children with SCD and VOE.
