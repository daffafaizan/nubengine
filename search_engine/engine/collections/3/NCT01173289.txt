      resection, radioactive iodine treatment, and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. The
      role of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), however, remains controversial.

      The purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the impact of EBRT on the locoregional
      control in locoregionally advanced or recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer patients.
