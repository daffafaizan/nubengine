      with a PVC-cuffed tracheal tube and receiving enteral nutrition who require at least 48 h of
      mechanical ventilation are eligible. Patients receive continuous control of cuff pressure
      using a pneumatic device (intervention group) or manual control using a manometer (control
      group). Target cuff pressure is 25 cmH2O.

      In all patients, pepsin is measured in tracheal aspirate during a 48-h period after
      inclusion, as proxy for gastric content aspiration. In addition tracheobronchial colonization
      and ventilator associated pneumonia rates will be compared between the two groups.
