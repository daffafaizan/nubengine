      brain tumours. The treatment strategies for this disease have not changed appreciably for
      many years consisting of a surgical intervention (biopsy or tumour resection) and
      post-operative local radiotherapy until several years ago. Combined chemoradiotherapy with
      temozolomide is at the moment the standard medical practice after results of the joint
      EORTC-NCIC phase III study randomizing between radiotherapy alone and combined
      chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide showed a significant improvement in 2-years survival from
      8% to 24% for the combined treatment arm (Stupp 2005). Given the poor prognosis of these
      patients and the still poor treatment response, further therapeutic improvement will remain
      the most challenging topic for the future. The next step to further improve survival for this
      patient group would be the addition of biological modifying and/or antiangiogenic therapies.
      These strategies are motivated by the fact that glioblastomas often express very high levels
      of vascular endothelial growth factor which is a key mediator of blood vessel growth as high
      expression of EGFR, which upregulates the downstream PI3K-AKTpathway. (Fischer I, Carmeliet
      P, Koul D) One possible candidate is nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor interfering with Akt
      activity downstream of EGFR and upstream of VEGF. (Geng L, Gorski D, HLu B)
