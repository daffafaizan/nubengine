      Primary

        -  Assess salivary function in patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by measuring stimulated saliva production at 6
           and 12 months after completion of therapy.

        -  Compare salivary function in these patients to salivary function in historical controls.

      Secondary

        -  Assess auditory, swallow, and voice function and quality of life of these patients
           before and after IMRT or chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Advance experience with IMRT/tomotherapy and improve field design for irradiating head
           and neck cancer in an effort to reduce radiation dose and minimize effects on
           surrounding normal tissue.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Patients undergo standard of care high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the
      head and neck.

      Patients undergo baseline and post-treatment testing of auditory, salivary, swallow, and
      voice function as well as quality of life evaluation.

      Patients are evaluated for radiation-induced toxicities at 1, 6, and 12 months after
      completion of IMRT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
