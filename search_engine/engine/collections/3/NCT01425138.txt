      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Data was extracted from the publications on various
      psoriasis endpoints including the Physician Global Assessment (PGA), Dermatology Life Quality
      Index (DLQI), and Short-Form 36 (SF-36). A traditional meta-analysis and a mixed treatment
      comparison was conducted on the extracted data. We included all published randomized
      controlled trials of treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis that met the study inclusion
      criteria.
