      predication of the real world functioning is generally the final goal. Among the cognitive
      deficits, the dysexecutive syndrome is certainly the most disabling in impeding to return to
      work. The classical neuropsychological tests often fail to asses theses deficits adequately.
      Several more ecological tests have been previously developed. Based on the multiple errands
      test and the six elements test, we built up first an ecological test over 60 minutes for
      activities of the daily living (test des errances multiples, " TEM, version CRR "). Used
      regularly in the clinical setting, it was able to evaluate the functional aptitudes of the
      patients and was useful to complete the classical neuropsychological tests. However test
      duration is too short and activities are far away from real work scenarios to test working
      aptitudes. Therefore we developed a new executive-ecological test in a vocational setting
      (TEM-PRO). The adaptation of the original test in a vocational setting induces the addition
      of 4 activities of variable complexity, research and redaction of information and demands to
      follow well defined rules. Skills that are solicited are planning, selective and sustained
      attention, prospective memory, organization, problems solving and behavior adaption over a
      long period of time. Based on a pilot study with patients without neurological deficit we
      assessed that our test displayed good sensitivity without ceiling effect. It allowed a
      quantitative and differentiated evaluation, a classification of various error types
      (interpretation and judgment failure, rule breaks, task failures and inefficiencies) and
      provided a qualitative behavioral analysis.
