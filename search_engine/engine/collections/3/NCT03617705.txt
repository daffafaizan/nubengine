      eventually related clinical outcomes (e.g., liver function) among HIV+ drinkers through
      biosensor-assisted intervention. Research shows HIV infection can influence alcohol
      metabolism (i.e., higher blood alcohol levels), so it's necessary to validate the new alcohol
      biosensor in HIV+ drinkers rather than in general population. The primary goal of this
      project, as a step toward the development and evaluation of a biosensor-assisted alcohol
      intervention, is to validate the newly available wrist worn transdermal alcohol biosensor
      (BACtrack Skyn). Up to 30 HIV+ and 30 HIV- drinkers will be recruited to validate the Skyn
      biosensor in both laboratory and real life settings. The two specific aims are: (1) To assess
      validity and reliability of the Skyn biosensor using fixed-dose lab administration of alcohol
      through comparison with laboratory grade breathalyzer, and (2) To validate Skyn biosensor in
      daily life using a 2-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and BACtrack Mobile Pro
      breathalyzer, and evaluate its usability and acceptability for daily alcohol monitoring. Also
      explored will be factors (e.g., gender, viral load) that may be associated with individual
      differences in biosensor readings (e.g., peak, time-to-peak).
