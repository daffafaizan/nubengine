      tension rings with intraocular lenses affects rotational stability of the lens.

      Lens Selection: The patients will undergo standard of care preoperative measurements and
      planning. The surgeon will evaluate preoperative measurements and use lens calculations, as
      well as a discussion with the patient, to identify whether a toric lens will be used and to
      determine the IOL power, cylinder, and target axis (standard of care). Preoperative
      measurements will be taken using IOL-Master 700, with the addition of the Pentacam and
      automatic keratometry as needed (standard of care). The toric lens used will be the TECNIS
      IOL. It will be used on label (standard of care).

      Randomization: Each eye undergoing cataract surgery will be randomized into a control or
      treatment group. If both eyes meet enrollment criteria, then each eye will be randomized
      independently.

        -  Control group: toric IOL only

        -  Treatment group: toric IOL plus capsular tension ring
