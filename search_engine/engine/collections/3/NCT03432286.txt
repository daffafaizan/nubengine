    
      The study has two parts which enroll separately from each other such that participants may
      choose to participate in either but not both: the main study and a study addendum.

        -  The main study includes a 3-month, randomized, double-blind treatment period in which
           participants receive either galcanezumab or placebo, followed by a 9-month open-label
           extension in which all participants receive galcanezumab.

        -  The study addendum is a stand-alone study of galcanezumab pharmacokinetics and safety in
           a group of participants separate from those in the main study. The study addendum
           includes a 5-month evaluation period after a single injection of galcanezumab, followed
           by a 9-month open-label extension.
