      that were classified as high risk for developing breast cancer based on the results of the
      cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) completed as part of clinic intake. As part of standard
      of care, the CGRA is administered via tablet computers and results are uploaded to the EMR.
      The PCP will receive a hard copy of CGRA results and a written reminder to provide genetic
      counseling order for patient if clinically appropriate, discuss the results of CGRA with the
      patient, and determine whether to provide an order for genetic counseling. The intake
      receptionist will also notify Patient Navigators (trained on protocol and informed consent)
      of women recommended for genetic counseling based on CGRA by giving Patient Navigators a
      printout of patient CGRA results and Medical Record Number (MRN). The results of the CGRA,
      including the identifiers, will be used to determine eligibility and to locate the patient
      EMR.After patients complete their clinic appointments, Patient Navigators will invite
      patients to participate in the study using a recruitment script and a recruitment flyer. If
      the participant is interested in participating in the study, the Patient Navigator will
      screen for eligibility using a checklist and obtain informed consent.
