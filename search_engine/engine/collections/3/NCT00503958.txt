        -  To prepare a molecular genetic and epidemiological risk assessment model based on the
           analysis of environmental exposures and genetic predisposition, which will provide an
           algorithm to measure an individual's risk for developing lung cancer.

        -  To develop an archive of specimens relating to at-risk individuals and those with lung
           cancer.

        -  To redefine lung cancer based on molecular pathology using the fields of expression and
           methylation profiling, and genetic instability.

        -  To identify and assess novel markers of pre-carcinogenesis in our high-risk populations.

        -  To facilitate the development of new intervention strategies (i.e., chemoprevention).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants and/or patients undergo tumor tissue, sputum, and blood sample collection
      periodically. Samples are analyzed via fields of expression and methylation profiling and
      genetic instability. Samples are also archived.

      Complete lifetime lifestyle, residential, environmental tobacco smoke, and occupational
      history are assessed in the first year and then in year five and year ten. Participants who
      return for follow-up complete a shorter questionnaire aimed at recording change over the
      interval since their last attendance.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 800 patients and 7,500 healthy participants will be accrued for this
      study.
