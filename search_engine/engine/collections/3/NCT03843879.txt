      intravenous (IV) lidocaine infusion against single-injection transversus abdominis plane
      (TAP) block in patients undergoing kidney transplant surgery. The investigators propose a
      study of 124 subjects randomized into two groups. The control group will receive a TAP block.
      The study group will receive a continuous IV lidocaine infusion. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be no statistically significant difference in postoperative
      opioid consumption between the two groups in the first 24 hours.
