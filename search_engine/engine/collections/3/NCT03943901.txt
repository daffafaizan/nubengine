      with de novo diagnosis of DLBCL or transformed DLBCL. Split-dose R-CHOP involves giving
      Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy at 14 days'
      interval with Rituximab given once/month. The safety for every 14-day CHOP administration was
      studied in a large prospective randomized control trial of patients up to the age of 80
      years. In this study, R-CHOP given every 14 days for up to 6 cycles was felt to be the best
      method of delivery of chemotherapy. Receiving greater than 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy
      was not found to be beneficial compared to participants receiving 6 cycles of R-CHOP.
      Additionally, an interim response adapted approach by combining imaging and MRD testing will
      be used to identify participants who will receive an abbreviated chemotherapy course if they
      are both Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) and Minimum Residual Dose
      (MRD) negative.

      In the proposed study, participants will receive a 50% dose reduction of CHOP chemotherapy on
      Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle with full dose Rituximab on Day 1 for up to a total of 6
      months of chemotherapy. Participants who are MRD and PET/CT negative after 2 months will be
      placed on an abbreviated regimen with R-CHOP x 4 additional doses with full dose Rituximab
      and a 50% dose reduction in CHOP chemotherapy. The hypothesis is that this method of
      administration of R-CHOP will be a safe and effective form of chemotherapy for older patients
      with DLBCL and will allow older patients to receive curative intent treatment.
