    
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate single-agent brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35)
      treatment in patients who previously participated in a brentuximab vedotin study, including
      Studies SGN35-005 (NCT01100502), SGN35-007 (NCT01026233), and SGN35-008 (NCT01026415).
      Patients treated on this study (SGN35-006) could re-enroll on study if eligible. The study
      consisted of 2 arms, as follows:

        -  Retreatment arm: Patients with CD30-positive hematologic malignancies who experienced a
           complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) with previous brentuximab vedotin
           treatment on a clinical study and subsequently experienced disease progression or
           relapse. The purpose of this arm was to assess safety and efficacy of retreatment with
           brentuximab vedotin.

        -  Extension treatment arm: Patients with either CD30-positive hematologic or
           nonhematologic malignancies who completed treatment in a prior brentuximab vedotin study
           without unacceptable toxicity and experienced clinical benefit as assessed by the
           investigator. The purpose of this arm was to enable patients who participated in certain
           prior brentuximab vedotin trials to receive extension treatment and to assess patient
           safety and survival in the extension treatment setting.
