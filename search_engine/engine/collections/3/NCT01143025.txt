      been proved to significantly reduce postoperative pain, morphine consumption and incidence of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting in comparison with patients receiving direct instillation
      of Bupivacaine 50 mg or placebo.

      Ropivacaine can be effectively administrated with non-heating nebulizers (AeronebPro®). In a
      recent study our group found that nebulization of Ropivacaine 30 mg with the AeronebPro®
      before or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain and
      morphine consumption. Nonetheless, most patients still need strong opioid based analgesia
      after surgery.

      We hypothesize that intraperitoneal nebulization of Ropivacaine 100 mg and 150 mg (maximum
      recommended dose in adults 300 mg or up to 3 mg/kg) may prevent the use of morphine during
      the first day after surgery maintaining ropivacaine plasma levels below toxic concentration.
