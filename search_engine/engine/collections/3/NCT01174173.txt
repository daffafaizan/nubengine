      high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart need
      to work harder than normal and is usually caused by a narrowing of the small arteries of the
      lung. This narrowing makes it harder for the right side of the heart to circulate the blood
      to the lungs. Over time, the right side of the heart may become enlarged and symptoms (such
      as angina [chest pain] shortness of breath, fatigue, edema) begin to appear.

      Ranolazine is a safe, well-tolerated, and FDA-approved medication for the treatment of
      chronic stable angina. Ranolazine may potentially improve blood flow to the right ventricle
      (RV), thereby relieving angina while simultaneously improving RV performance and
      contractility. This latter effect may increase stroke volume and cardiac output which could
      translate into benefits in exercise capacity and improved quality of life.

      The purpose of this single center, non-randomized, prospective pilot study is to investigate
      the effects of 3 months treatment with ranolazine on pulmonary artery hemodynamics, exercise
      capacity and quality of life in patients with PAH and symptoms of angina or angina
      equivalent.
