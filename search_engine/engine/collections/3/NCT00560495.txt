      Primary

        -  To assess the acute toxicity of combining antiangiogenic copper reduction with ammonium
           tetrathiomolybdate (TM) and standard external-beam radiotherapy in patients with stage
           I-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To measure changes in biological markers of angiogenesis (i.e., ELISA analysis of serum
           bFGF, VEGF, TGF-beta, IL-6, and IL-8) affected by TM or radiotherapy and an imaging
           technique (technetium 99m sestamibi) known to correlate with intratumoral angiogenesis.

        -  To follow the late toxicity that exists when angiogenic inhibition with the copper
           reduction agent TM is combined with standard external-beam radiotherapy in these
           patients.

        -  To collect tumor response, recurrence rate, and survival data on these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction phase: Patients receive oral ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM) 4 times daily
           for up to 3 weeks.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6-7 weeks
           along with concurrent TM.

        -  Maintenance phase: Patients continue to receive TM for a total of 1 year . Blood is
           collected periodically for analysis of laboratory outcomes by ELISA and technetium 99m
           sestamibi scans. Biomarkers may include VEGF, bFGF, TGF-beta, interleukin (IL)-6, and
           IL-8.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
