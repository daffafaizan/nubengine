      comparing the efficacy and tolerability of an add-on treatment with 200mg of topiramate
      versus placebo in obese patients with BED receiving group CBT. The aim of this trial is to
      investigate the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive topiramate to CBT in obese patients
      with BED through improvement in binge eating, related psychopathology, and weight loss. The
      study hypothesis is that the patients using topiramate + CBT will loose more weight than
      patients using placebo + CBT.Tolerability will be investigated through reported adverse
      events and dropouts, with reasons for leaving the study being analyzed. The randomized
      patients will receive capsules of topiramate (25 mg, 50 mg) or placebo correspondent daily
      for 21 weeks
