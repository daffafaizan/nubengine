      (defined as not using narcotic medications in 3 months prior to surgery) and presenting for
      surgery would be recruited. Preop administration of sedating medications (i.e. midazolam)
      would be avoided. On the day of surgery, once in OR and standard ASA monitors placed, a
      standardized dose of 2mcg/kg ideal body weight IV fentanyl is administered. The patient is
      then monitored for respiratory depression for 5 minutes prior to administration of additional
      induction agents. [would include respiratory rate, with RR < 10, or O2 Sat < 90%]. Would not
      provide supplemental oxygen during this time unless patient was already on supplemental
      oxygen. Patient would then be preoxygenated and general anesthesia induced. Once general
      anesthesia is induced, a blood sample is collected and stored. [sample could also be
      collected in preop upon IV placement]. Blood will be tested for Single Nucleotide
      Polymorphisms of genes related to opioid-induced analgesia. [Potential target genes listed in
      7.0-1] This genomic data will be evaluated for any correlations of the presence of
      opioid-related SNPs and concomitant opioid-induced respiratory depression.
