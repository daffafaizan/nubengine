      personalised conservative treatment (PCT) of LARS. However, it is unknown if scheduled,
      initiated defecation with the aid of a glycerol suppository will have the same clinical
      effect as TAI. Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of TAI with a glycerol
      suppository in patients suffering from major LARS.

      The study is a multi-centre, randomised, controlled, 12 weeks, parallel-group trial comparing
      treatment with TAI to treatment with glycerol suppositories. Patients will be randomised -
      stratified by centre and neoadjuvant radiotherapy - in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with
      TAI or glycerol suppositories. Primary endpoint will be assessed by the end of week twelve.
