      Primary

        -  Determine whether lenalidomide can augment the efficacy of pneumococcal polyvalent
           vaccine as it correlates with lenalidomide-induced antitumor efficacy in patients with
           relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antibody responses to pneumococcal serotypes in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine T-cell responses to the carrier protein CRM 197 in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the ability of lenalidomide to augment in vivo immune responsiveness as
           measured by cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to Candida and
           tetanus in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability of lenalidomide to prime and/or boost systemic vaccine responses
           in both peripheral blood lymphocytes and marrow lymphocytes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group 1: Patients receive oral lenalidomide on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine intramuscularly (IM) 14 days prior to
           beginning lenalidomide and again in approximately 2 months (after the first dose of the
           vaccine).

        -  Group 2: Patients receive lenalidomide as in group 1. Patients receive pneumococcal
           polyvalent vaccine IM approximately 45 days after beginning lenalidomide and again in
           approximately 2 months (after the first dose of the vaccine).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
