    
      In a previous study (2011), investigators demonstrated a statistically significant relation
      between the Endothelial Lipase(EL) c.584C>T polymorphism and the occurrence of diabetic
      retinopathy in 396 french patients with diabetes type 2 (DT2) with a longitudinal follow-up.

      Secondly (2014) in a subgroup of 287 DT2 patients, investigators showed the impact of the EL
      rare T allele was consistent with a recessive mode of inheritance, with homozygotes for the
      rare allele differing from the carriers of the major allele. Importantly, the homozygotes for
      the rare T allele were more likely to present with advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy
      (severe non proliferative and proliferative disease) and particularly with proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

      Based on this model investigators decided to conduct a case-control prospective study
      comparing 155 french patients with DT2 with PDR (cases) and 155 french patients with DT2
      without PDR (controls) on the basis of two genetic parameters: EL c.584C>T polymorphism that
      investigators previously studied and the C(-106)T aldose reductase polymorphism widely
      studied in diabetic retinopathy.
