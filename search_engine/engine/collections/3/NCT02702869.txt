    
      The purpose of this project is to implement a system of prospective, standardized data
      collection for all patients with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) treated by the cleft and
      craniofacial centers that participate in ACCQUIREnet.

      Adoption of this prospective data-collection system has two principal goals:

        1. To enable on-demand and scheduled review of cleft-care-related safety and outcomes data
           and team performance for the purpose of internal audits and continuous quality
           improvement; and

        2. To permit participation in multi-site, collaborative quality-improvement projects and/or
           research networks that require usage of these standardized data-collection methods.
           (These collaborations are described in corresponding IRB protocols and data-transfer
           agreements. Patient privacy and confidentiality is protected at all times.)

      All patients with CL/P treated at cleft and craniofacial centers participating in ACCQUIREnet
      will be invited to participate in this project. Duke University serves as the coordinating
      center and statistical support center for the study. Data are maintained in a local, secured
      database.

      The IRB protocol details methods of quality assurance, data monitoring, and auditing. Data
      dictionaries employed in ACCQUIREnet include the CleftCap REDCap project template, CleftKit
      Common Data Model (an extension of the PCORnet Common Data Model), the ICHOM Standard Set for
      the Comprehensive Appraisal of Cleft Care, and the CLEFT-Q patient-reported outcome manual,
      maintained by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ichom.org) and
      McMaster University, respectively.
