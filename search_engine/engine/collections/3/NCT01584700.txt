      sympathetic nervous system. This is a homeostatic response produced by the body in an attempt
      to compensate for a poorly functioning heart and the resultant underperfused tissues. In
      acute heart failure this has a positive effect but in chronic heart failure, the long
      standing sympathetic overactivity causes multiple undesirable side effects including profound
      vasoconstriction, increased sodium reabsorption by the kidneys, renin release and decreased
      renal blood flow. Afferent and efferent sympathetic chains in the renal artery play an
      important role in the mediation of this response.

      Current management of heart failure principally hinges on drugs that attempt to attenuate or
      interrupt this response via renin angiotensin system, adrenoreceptors or the renal tubules.
      These drugs have multiple side effects, partly because of their multiple sites of action.
      None directly target the sympathetic discharge at its source.

      The development of renal artery denervation opens a unique opportunity for potentially
      longlasting relief of this intense renal sympathetic over-activity. The technique has a
      current role in the management of resistant hypertension where it has shown very favourable
      results with minimal side effects. The investigators envisage that this technique could also
      be highly beneficial to patients with heart failure by directly interrupting this sympathetic
      overactivity. This initial study involving 7 patients is a pilot safety study to assess this
      potential.
