    
      Objective: To study cortical excitability, electroencephalography patterns, nerve conduction
      velocity, and sleep patterns, in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, a
      rare autosomal recessive pediatric neurotransmitter disease associated with elevated levels
      of brain gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter. The clinical
      phenotype includes mental retardation, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric manifestations.

      Study Population: Patients with SSADH deficiency, parents of patients (who are obligate
      heterozygotes), and healthy volunteers.

      Design: This is a natural history study in which subjects will have a series of
      neurophysiological tests. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique
      that allows for measures of cortical excitation and inhibition. Electroencephalography (EEG)
      measures baseline brain electrical activity. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of
      conduction of impulses by peripheral nerves. Polysomnography records sleep cycles and
      associated eye movements, muscle potentials, heart rate, and respiration.

      Outcome measures: Motor cortex excitability threshold, paired pulse facilitation, and paired
      pulse inhibition on TMS will be the main outcome measures. Values will be compared across the
      4 groups of patients, carriers, adult and child healthy volunteers. Additional measures will
      include nerve conduction velocity, EEG frequency, and sleep patterns.
