      NPC has a uniquely high prevalence in Southern China. According to the Hong Kong Cancer
      Registry in 2012, NPC was the sixth commonest cancer in men and thirteenth in women. It
      accounted for 2.9% of all new cancer cases. In 2012, there were 819 new cases of NPC.

      NPC is highly radiosensitive. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the mainstay of treatment.
      Despite the chemo-irradiation, disease control failure still occurred in NPC patients
      presenting as persistent tumor. Early detection of those post-radiotherapy residual NPC is
      essential for early arrangement of salvage therapy. Detection methods include imaging, plasma
      Epstein-Barr virus DNA, endoscopy examinations and nasopharynx biopsy.

      NBI system has been well proven as a tool to detect early digestive tract cancer and head and
      neck cancer. However, there were only few studies targeting the detection of
      post-radiotherapy mucosal residual of NPC using NBI system

      Objective

        1. To identify the vessel pattern of those confirmed NPC case using NBI system

        2. To identify the endoscopy features of post-radiotherapy mucosal residual nasopharyngeal
           carcinoma using NBI system

        3. To establish the positive predicted value, negative predicted value, sensitivity and
           specificity of using NBI system for detecting mucosal residual NPC

      Method:

        1. All newly biopsy confirmed NPC patient will be assessed, their nasopharynx endoscopic
           image will be captured using both WL + NBI system

        2. At post-radiotherapy 8th weeks, endoscopic examination will be arranged for patient
           using both WL + NBI system, biopsy will also be taken to detect mucosal residual NPC
