    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the vascular properties of pediatric brain tumors using ferumoxytol for
      DSC-MRI and GBCA for DCE-MRI in pediatric brain tumor (proven or presumptive) patients in a
      single MRI session.

      II. To describe evolving imaging characteristics of tumor vasculature using DSC-MRI with
      ferumoxytol and DCE-MRI with GBCA in pediatric brain tumor patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare and evaluate magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) with ferumoxytol between different
      time points.

      II. To describe number and size of tumors imaged. III. To assess histology and electron
      microscopy (EM) on tissue samples. IV. To demonstrate differences in patients with prior
      therapy versus (vs.) no prior therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol and gadolinium intravenously (IV) and then undergo DSC-MRI and
      DCE-MRI. An optional MRI without injection of a contrast agent may be obtained after 20-24
      hours at the discretion of the clinician. Patients may receive up to 3 more scans at least 3
      weeks apart over up to 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks.
