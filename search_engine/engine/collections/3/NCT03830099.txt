      Inhomogeneous ventilation may associate with ventilator-induced lung injury since the
      gravity-depend collapse and over-distention of nondependent regional in patients under
      mechanical ventilation. A large number of post-neurosurgical patients was delayed extubation
      and received mechanical ventilation, so that, inhomogeneous ventilation was more likely to
      happen in the population. Up to now, there is no research reported about the prevalence of
      inhomogeneous ventilation and the factors associated with inhomogeneous ventilation in
      post-neurosurgical patients, in present study, The investigators prospectively enrolled adult
      patients after neurosurgical operations. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an
      noninvasive, radiation-free, high temporal resolution, relatively cheap technique in
      monitoring ventilation distribution bedside. The investigators aimed to investigate the
      incidence of inhomogeneous ventilation and factors associated with inhomogeneous ventilation
      in post-neurosurgical patients under mechanical ventilation.
