      depression (PSD), a disorder that afflicts a large number of stroke victims and increases
      mortality, cognitive impairment, and disability for years after stroke. EFT is a new,
      home-delivered intervention based on our integrative model of PSD, which originated from our
      clinical biology and treatment studies in late-life depression. It postulates two main paths
      to PSD. First, stroke and stroke-repair mechanisms contribute to metabolic changes mediating
      PSD. Second, a "psychosocial storm" stemming both from the patient's sudden disability and
      the change in the patient's needs and family life add a biological burden to this cascade of
      depressogenic events. EFT targets the "psychosocial storm" of PSD and focuses on the
      reciprocal interaction between the patient's abilities and the challenges of his/her
      "ecosystem" (family, specialized therapists). EFT follows a structured personalization
      approach based on the "model of adaptive functioning", in which behavior is a function of the
      person's competence and the demands of the environment. Thus, EFT continuously "calibrates
      the environment" to the PSD patient's competence level and targets the PSD "psychosocial
      storm" through five integrated components: 1) It offers an action-oriented, "new perspective"
      about the patient's recovery. 2) It provides an "adherence enhancement structure". 3) It
      offers a "problem solving structure" to the patient focusing on problems, valued by the
      patient, and pertinent to daily function. 4) It helps the family "reengineer its goals,
      involvement, and plans" to accommodate the patient's disability. 5) It "coordinates care with
      specialized therapists" with the goal to increase patient participation in rehabilitation and
      social activities.
