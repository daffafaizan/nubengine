      the medical unity and walking outdoor.

      When the caregiver identify a level of agitation greater or equal to two on the gravity score
      and greater or equal to two on the impact score with the NPI test (The Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory Test), the caregiver let the patient wandering in the outside lanes of the hospital
      and encourage him to us his senses. For example, the sight could be stimulated by looking at
      a bird.

      This variation of sensory stimulations enable a temporo-sensory break on the crisis, allowing
      the patient to turn his attention from the crisis context to another stimulation.
