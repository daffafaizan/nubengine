      approached for interest, if consenting process completed, patients will be randomized to one
      of 2 arms in 1:1 through a block randomization table.

      Those enrolled into the study arm will receive the CHG cloths and instructions for use from
      research personal. Those randomized to the control arm will receive standard of care skin
      cleansing by nursing staff.

      All subjects who have signed consent will have a skin swab culture taken the day of screening
      and prior to cleansing with Chlorhexidine gluconate wipes close to the intended incision
      line. The investigators will also obtain skin swab cultures at site of incision
      preoperatively on the day of surgery, post-op day 4 or time of discharge and at the 30 day
      follow up.

      Both groups will be evaluated daily by study personnel for the development of SSI until
      post-op day 4 or hospital discharge whichever one comes first. After dressing removal, a
      daily high definition picture will be taken of the incision line to further document signs of
      SSI development (pictures will not have any patient identifiable information). Additional
      evaluations will take place at the 30 day (+/- 7 days) post-op visit. Blinded evaluators
      utilizing the CDC guideline will grade the incision line for presence of SSI. Measured change
      in skin flora will be performed by comparing skin swab cultures of intervention group versus
      standard of care group and individual changes pre and post operatively.
