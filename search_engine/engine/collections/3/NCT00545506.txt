      morbidity associated with surgical infections is considerable and includes substantial
      prolongation of hospitalization.

      The wound infection risk in patients undergoing cardiac surgery ranges from 0.8 to 17.7%
      including both superficial and deep sternal infections.

      Major factors influencing the incidence of surgical wound infection other than site and
      complexity of surgery, underlying illness, timely administration of prophylactic antibiotics,
      intraoperative patient temperature, hypovolemia and tissue oxygen tension. The primary
      determinant of tissue oxygen availability is local perfusion. Thermoregulatory status is one
      of the major factors influencing tissue perfusion. Local warming induces pre- capillary
      vasodilation and improves tissue oxygenation. Local warming of surgical wounds may provide a
      simple and inexpensive way to reduce perioperative wound complications. Specifically, we will
      test the hypothesis that Warm- Up therapy increases postoperative tissue oxygen tension in
      patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
