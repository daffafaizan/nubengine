      for ocular lubrication and protection can be compromised. However, the literature diverges on
      which is the best clinical practice for treatment. There is a scale for assessing the risk
      for corneal injury. Thus, the general objective of this study was to evaluate the risk for
      developing corneal injury in critically ill patients and the effectiveness of three types of
      interventions: eye gel, eyedrops and polyethylene film, compared to the control group in its
      prevention. The specific objectives were: verify the most effective intervention for the
      prevention of corneal injury from the available literature and provided by: eye gel, eyedrops
      and polyethylene film compared to the control group who received eye care through randomized
      controlled clinical trial. Patients and methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial
      to determine the best care for the prevention of corneal injury from those available on the
      market (eye drops, eye gel and polyethylene film), compared to a control group (eye care) in
      the period from 09/07/2013 to 03/15/2014 .
