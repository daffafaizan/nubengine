      significant motor disabilities. There are an estimated 5 million stroke survivors in the
      U.S., making strokes the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S.. Existing
      rehabilitation therapies have not been effective in returning all stroke survivors to full
      motor recovery.

      The AMES device was designed to be able to provide therapy for the ankle joint and the hand
      (fingers/wrist). Subjects may qualify for one or two limbs. In this 18 treatment sessions,
      double-blinded, control study, AMES therapy will be provided in addition to the usual
      physician-ordered rehabilitation during the sub-acute period following a stroke. Those
      control subject who complete the Phase 1 placebo sessions will have the opportunity to
      cross-over to participate in a AMES treatment group for a Phase 2.
