      decades, coronavirus has caused several epidemics worldwide with a vast number of deaths such
      as severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS (2003) with 8098 people infected, and 774 people
      died over 29 countries. The disease caused by SARS CoV-2 (COVID19) is manifest by fever,
      fatigue, dry cough, pharyngitis, and headache. In addition to the common clinical
      presentation of respiratory distress, and increasing frequency of cardiovascular
      manifestations has become evident.

      In this context, the investigators propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous
      administration of convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients
      requiring hospitalization for symptomatic "high risk" COVID19 disease. The study team wants
      to test the hypothesis that treatment with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary effects on
      COVID19 disease severity/duration, with the primary objective to reduce mortality. In
      addition, a major secondary objective to reduce the requirement for and/or duration of
      mechanical ventilation. This is a randomized clinical trial comparing convalescent plasma
      with the standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Vietnam. Patients
      were randomized 1:1 and received 500 ml of plasma with anti-SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibody
      titers of at least 1:80.

      Written informed consent will be obtained all eligible subjects prior to participation.

      Convalescent plasma will be obtained from male donors, nulliparous females, or female donors
      negative for HLA antibodies at least 14 days following recovery from COVID-19 infection.
