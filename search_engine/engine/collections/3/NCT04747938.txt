      be acute or chronic. Patients feel stiffness over the shoulder, shown by restriction in range
      of motion. The etiology includes trauma, cervical disc degeneration, physical strain,
      psychosocial problems and even genetic factors. The predisposing factors include
      immobilization of the arm for a long time, rotator cuff or biceps tendinitis, tenosynovitis
      of the long head of the biceps, congenital deformity of the shoulder girdle, scapula-costal
      cementing, ligamentous injury, osteoarthritis, muscular fibrosis or nutritional deficiencies.
      The pathology is unclear but it is widely believed that it is related to inflammation in the
      joint and surrounding soft tissues which lead to fibrosis. Frozen Shoulder can be divided
      into Primary Frozen Shoulder which occurs spontaneously without other diseases; and Secondary
      Frozen Shoulder is associated with joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis or fractures.

      UKFROST was a multi-centre randomized clinical trial comparing 3 parallel groups (arms) of
      frozen shoulder patients treated 1) under anaesthesia + steroid injection 2) under
      anaesthesia + arthoscopy, and 3) physiotherapy + steriod injection..The large-scale study
      proves physiotherapy program beneficial to frozen shoulder patients, and, the effectiveness
      might further improve by introducing East-Meets-West component - Chinese Medicine.
