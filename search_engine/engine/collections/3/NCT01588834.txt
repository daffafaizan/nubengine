    
      The specific aims are:

        -  In women with increased mammographic density (MD), determine the histological
           characteristics of functionally dense tissue compared to that of non-functionally dense
           tissue via core-needle biopsy of the breast.

        -  In women with increased mammographic density (MD), determine the correlations between
           the total percent area of functional density (FD) on MBI, percent density of MD on
           mammogram, and histological characteristics of dense tissue
