      micro-particles (MP) correlate with PA. The sensitivity and specificity of these proteins
      will be analyzed to further increase our understanding of the pathological mechanisms
      involved in PA. The knowledge gained from this study has the potential to develop a
      diagnostic test for PA with the ability to improve outcomes for mother and baby through
      earlier diagnosis and targeted therapy.
