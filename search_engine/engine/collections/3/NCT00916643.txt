    
      H.E.L.P. therapy is indicated for use in treating patients with familial hypercholesterolemia
      (FH) who have undergone six months of optimal diet and drug therapy and whose LDL-C level
      remains > 300 mg/dl in the absence of CHD or > 200 mg/dl with documented CHD. These patients
      are divided into three subgroups of interest:

        -  Group A: functional hypercholesterolemic homozygotes with LDL-C > 500mg/dl;

        -  Group B: functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygotes with LDL-C > 300mg/dl;

        -  Group C: functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygotes with LDL-C > 200mg/dl and
           documented CHD.

      Optimal diet therapy is defined as having received instruction by a trained dietitian in the
      use of a diet meeting the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 2 criteria (<
      30% of calories as fat, < 7% of calories as saturated fat, and < 200 mg of dietary
      cholesterol per day). Optimal drug therapy is defined as having been tried on at least two
      separate classes of effective serum LDL-C lowering agents (>15% reduction) as currently
      available for at least six months. These drugs include hydroxy methyl glutaryl (HMG) CoA
      reductase inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, niacin, and anion exchange resins. These
      agents should be used in combination at maximal doses as tolerated by the patient under the
      supervision of their treating physician to monitor side effects.

      Documented coronary heart disease (CHD) includes documentation of coronary heart disease by
      coronary angiography or a history of myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass
      surgery (CABG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or alternative
      revascularization procedure (e.g., atherectomy or stent), or progressive angina documented by
      exercise or non-exercise stress test.

      The primary criteria for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the device will be:

        -  Occurrence of Death

             -  cardiovascular deaths

             -  non-cardiovascular deaths

             -  MI - stroke

             -  unstable angina - transient ischemic attack (TIA)

             -  peripheral vascular bypass surgery

             -  percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)

             -  percutaneous transluminal peripheral angioplasty (PTA)

             -  coronary atherectomy (device)

             -  coronary artery bypass graft atherectomy (device)

             -  carotid endarterectomy (non-device)

             -  peripheral endarterectomy (non-device)

             -  coronary artery laser surgery

             -  coronary artery bypass graft laser surgery

             -  peripheral vascular laser surgery

             -  coronary artery stent placement

             -  coronary artery bypass graft stent placement

             -  peripheral vascular stent placement

             -  repair of atherosclerotic aortic and arterial aneurysms

             -  limb amputation for ASCVD

        -  Frequency and severity of CHD Symptoms:

             -  chest pain (angina),

             -  shortness of breath

             -  claudication
