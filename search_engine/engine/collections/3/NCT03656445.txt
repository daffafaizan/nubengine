      groups. All surgeries were performed under spinal anesthesia, without tourniquet and patients
      should be in agreement with the established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Group A (60
      patients) received 1g of IV TXA, Group B (60 patients) received an additional dose of IV TXA
      and Group C (60 patients) received three doses of IV TXA. The measured outcomes were the
      Hemoglobin (Hb) decrease, the transfusion rate, the functional, quality of life (QoL) and
      pain assessment based on their corresponding scoring system.
