      resulted in increased bioavailability in adult patients in clinical trials. However, the
      safety and pharmacokinetic patterns of drugs in infants often differ from those of adults and
      the direction of the variation is not predictable. This study will assess these parameters of
      bis-POM PMEA in children.

      Patients are stratified by age, and separate cohorts from each age group receive 1 of 2
      single doses of bis-POM PMEA. The lower dose is given to patients ages 3 months through 17
      years; if toxicity is acceptable, the other cohort in this age range receives the higher
      dose. At this point, accrual of infants < 3 months old may begin at the lower dose, followed
      by accrual of this age group at the higher dose if toxicity is acceptable. Serum drug
      concentrations are monitored up to 8 hours post dose.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 5/2/97: Based on data from both the low- and high-dose cohorts of the older
      age group (>= 3 months to < 18 years), the younger age group (<3 months) will be started at
      the high-dose.
