      acutely ill, data on the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are limited. FFP transfusion may
      not only be poorly effective in prevention of bleeding complications but is associated with
      significant complications. In a retrospective cohort of critically ill non-surgical patients
      with abnormal international normalized ratio (INR), we have observed significant variability
      in the practice of FFP transfusion. Rather than a benefit with liberal use, more adverse
      effects were observed, in particular pulmonary edema and acute lung injury. Our overall goal
      is to improve the safety of blood product transfusion and prevent pulmonary complications.
      Here we propose a randomized clinical trial of restrictive (INR 1.6-3) versus liberal (FFP
      transfusion to keep INR < 1.6) FFP transfusion prior to commonly performed invasive
      procedures (thoracocentesis, abdominal paracentesis and central venous cannulation). We will
      use the following outcome measures to compare the differences between the two groups: 1. New
      onset pulmonary edema; 2. Postprocedural bleeding complications; 3. Number of blood product
      transfusions; 4. Hospital mortality and 5. Length of intensive care unit and hospital stay.
      The results of this study will form the basis for future multicenter clinical trials with
      implications for worldwide transfusion practice.
