      biomarkers associated with oxidative stress (GSH/GSSG) and reduced methylation capacity
      (SAM/SAH) as well as abnormal DNA methylation (epigenetics). The investigative team
      hypothesize that these abnormal metabolic processes contribute to abnormalities in behavior
      and development associated with trisomy 21; this connection has never been investigated.
      Confirming and expanding on the preliminary data would provide new understanding of the
      biological and functional etiology of the behavioral and developmental delays associated with
      Trisomy 21. Further, establishing the underlying relationship between metabolic abnormalities
      and behavioral/cognitive function over the age spectrum can provide strong support for the
      design of future treatments of individuals with DS aimed at improving their behavior and
      development. In addition, these biomarkers may also prove to be predictive biomarkers for the
      risk of developing ASD like behaviors or Alzheimer's disease in this population. Finally,
      examining the modulating role of diet in the severity of biological abnormalities will
      provide new information for lifestyle guidance to improve biomarkers and potentially minimize
      the medical co-morbidities associated with trisomy 21.
