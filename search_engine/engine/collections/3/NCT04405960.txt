      mineralization of bones. Several studies found that Vitamin D levels were low in patients
      with knee OA.

      Vitamin D deficiency were found in 50% of women age 45-55 years old and 35% of women age
      60-90 years old in Jakarta and Bekasi. Alphacalcidol is a vitamin D supplementation
      recommended to be used in patients with renal insufficiency, which is prevalent in elderly.
      Alfacalcidol does not need to undergo renal 1-alpha-hydroxylation which impaired in renal
      insufficiency, although it can still cause hypercalcemia.

      Current detection and diagnosis of knee OA relies on plain radiological examination, which is
      not really objective because it depends on radiological expertise and experience. Moreover,
      plain radiological diagnosis has limited ability to detect joint damage at an early stage.
      Therefore, knee OA is often diagnosed at advanced stage. For this reason, selecting accurate
      joint cartilage biomarkers is important to detect and predict the severity of OA objectively
      and at earlier stage. Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) is one of degradation
      products released into synovium fluid and bloodstream from cartilage matrix turnover process.
      Therefore, COMP can be used as a marker of diagnosis and cartilage injury severity of knee
      OA.

      Currently, there has been no study about the association of Vitamin D supplementation with
      pain level and cartilage matrix turnover process in Indonesia. Therefore, this study aims to
      determine the effect of Vitamin D supplementation (Alphacalcidol) on pain and joint cartilage
      condition in elderly patients with knee OA.
