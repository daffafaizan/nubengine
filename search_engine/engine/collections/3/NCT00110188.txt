      ridaforolimus administration in participants with taxane-resistant AIPC. Other objectives
      include evaluating experimental parameters that may predict or indicate response to mTOR
      inhibition, such as effects on plasma VEGF, markers of tumoral PI3K/mTOR-pathway activity,
      and proteomic analysis. The inclusion of these evaluations in this trial may provide insight
      into the identification of markers that may be helpful in optimizing ridaforolimus treatment
      and in identifying patients with ridaforolimus-sensitive tumors.
