      enhance methyl aminolevulinate (MAL)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the skin prior to
      photodynamic therapy (PDT). The pretreatments include: microneedling, sandpaper, curettage,
      ablative fractional laser and non-ablative fractional laser. 17 treatment areas are mapped on
      the upper back of the participants. Each participant receives each intervention in a random
      sequence.

      Primary outcome measure: PpIX accumulation after 3 hours incubation with MAL. Secondary
      outcome measures: pain during treatment and skin reactions.
