      Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Acute GVHD produces significant morbidity and complicates
      patient management resulting in organ toxicity, frequent infections, malnutrition, and
      substantial delay in recovery from transplantation. Corticosteroids have been the primary
      therapy for acute GVHD for over three decades. Various additional immunosuppressive
      strategies have been tested as GVHD therapy but neither anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG),
      CD5-immunotoxins, IL-1 antagonists nor other agents have been demonstrably helpful in either
      control of GVHD symptoms or improvement in survival. Published response rates of complete
      response (CR) to acute GVHD therapy with corticosteroids range from 25-41%. These rates will
      be used as benchmarks for assessing efficacy of promising new agents. New immunosuppressive
      agents and strategies are required to improve the management of GVHD and decrease the
      toxicities of the immunosuppressive regimens.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this trial, patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD will be randomly assigned to receive
      corticosteroids plus one of four new agents (etanercept, MMF, denileukin diftitox [Ontak],
      and pentostatin). A control arm of only corticosteroids will not be employed. Each agent will
      be assessed for safety and efficacy (at least 35% complete remission [CR] rate at Day 28 of
      therapy can be expected from previously untreated patients).
