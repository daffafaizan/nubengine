      metabolism (burns energy) during exposure to cold, and how it may contribute to the weight
      loss observed in cancer. Many patients affected by cancer lose weight, despite normal or
      increased nutrition. It may progress to the condition called "cancer-associated cachexia."
      Cancer associated cachexia is defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass with or
      without the loss of fat mass, and may negatively affect quality of life and the ability to
      undergo cancer treatments. Metabolism is the breakdown of food by the body into the energy
      that your body needs.
