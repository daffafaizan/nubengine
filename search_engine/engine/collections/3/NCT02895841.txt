      integrated into inpatient care. Specifically, the investigator is looking to help patients
      better track their pain, use wearable technology to track physiological measures (for
      example, heart rate, sleep quantity and quality), and integrate these data points into the
      medical care of patients by providing the information to providers. This study will first
      gather information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the use of technology on
      the inpatient unit. This will help the study team to refine the technology of the mobile app
      and logistics of integration. Following this, the investigator will complete a second phase
      of the study, during which select patients will pilot the intervention. This will be followed
      by the third and final phase, during which patients will be randomly assigned to the active
      intervention or standard of care. This phase approach will enable the study team to refine
      the intervention, relying on the feedback from patients and providers, and subsequently test
      its utility compared to standard of care through random assignment.
