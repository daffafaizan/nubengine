    
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, multicenter, randomized, pivotal Phase 3 study
      comprising approximately 4,060 subjects aged 18 years or above randomized in a 3:1 ratio to
      the live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate (VLA1553) or placebo. The final dose of
      lyophilized VLA1553 or placebo will be administered as a single intramuscular immunization.
      Subjects in this study will be stratified into two age strata of 18 to 64 years and 65 years
      of age or above. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and
      safety of the final dose of VLA1553 28 days following the single immunization. Immunogenicity
      evaluations in the immunogenicity subset will include the proportion of subjects with
      seroprotective neutralizing CHIKV antibody titers above a surrogate threshold indicative of
      protection. The surrogate of protection reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit has
      been established in non-human primate passive transfer studies using human sera from the
      Phase 1 study. Safety data collection and immunogenicity will continue to be assessed until
      Month 6

      The first enrolled and randomized approximately 500 subjects will comprise the immunogenicity
      subset.
