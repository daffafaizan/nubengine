        -  Determine the response rates of patients with advanced neuroblastoma or other pediatric
           solid tumors treated with arsenic trioxide.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of disease (neuroblastoma with progressive
      disease vs neuroblastoma with stable refractory disease vs other solid tumor).

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.
