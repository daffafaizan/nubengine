      to 14 days), a Dosing Period (7 days), and a Follow-up Period (7 days). In-clinic visits
      occurred at screening, Visit 1 (Day 0), and Visit 2 (Day 7)/Early Discontinuation. All
      subjects received open-label SPN 804O as adjunctive therapy during the Dosing Period. At
      Visit 1, eligible subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (150, 300, 450, or
      600mg/day) based on weight (15-<30, 30-<45, 45-<60, >=60kg). The Dosing Period consisted of
      six consecutive days of a daily dose, taken at home, followed by a final day with the dose
      taken on-site and including blood draws for PK analysis.
