      Sleep and Fatigue Treatment in EMS (SaFTiE) - in a two-arm parallel cluster-randomized design
      of 36 EMS agencies. Our unit of randomization will be the EMS agency, with the intervention
      deployed as a Fatigue Risk Management Program that can be integrated into an agency's
      existing program. Prior to randomization the investigators will use a run-in period of 60
      days with all 36 agencies to capture the natural history of the target population whereby
      they are naive to the study intervention. During the active intervention phase, the
      investigators will use SaFTiE and an attention placebo control (APC) group to test the
      specific effect of our multi-component intervention on EMS worker fatigue and sleep health.
