      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The starting dose of glimepiride (1 mg QD) may
      be up-titrated as needed to optimize glycemic control over the first 18 weeks to a maximum
      dose of 6 mg/day, after which the dose will not be increased for the rest of the study
      (down-titration to avoid or control hypoglycemia is allowed).
