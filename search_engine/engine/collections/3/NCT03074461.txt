      and the side-to-end anastomosis, in low anterior resection in distal rectal cancer for the
      first time. Its focus is on the functional results. Besides stool frequency, the quality of
      life, safety of the procedures and the usage of stool modulating drugs is monitored in an 12
      months-follow up regime.
