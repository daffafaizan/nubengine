      long-term survival and accuracy of the tumor staging of patients with gastric cancer. The
      retrieval of more lymph nodes has gradually become a trend among surgeons. However,
      lymphadenectomy is currently performed without the aid of visual instruments which might lead
      to an unknown pathological outcome and influence the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.
      And none of the indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent imaging systems applied in clinical
      practice now is equipped with ultra-high definition (4K) or three-dimensional (3D) lens. To
      explore the advent of minimally invasive surgery with a conveniently switchable high-quality
      imaging system, we designed a new laparoscopic navigating technique that combined all the
      three characteristics.

      Aims: This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of the Intelligent
      Navigation 4K UHD 3D Endoscopic Imaging System in patients with gastric cancer.

      Methods/design This is a prospective, one-arm, single-center, single-set target value
      clinical trial to investigate the clinical value of the Intelligent Navigation 4K UHD 3D
      Endoscopic Imaging System on laparoscopic gastric surgery. The trial will recruit a total of
      67 participants.
