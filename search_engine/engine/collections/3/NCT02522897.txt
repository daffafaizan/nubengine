      Ranibizumab for 12 months in the "treat-and-extend" scheme. Following this scheme, all
      patients receive a series of three injections at the interval of 4 weeks. Thereafter, the
      retreatment interval is determined by results of certain examinations.

      The next control including a reinjection is scheduled with an extension of one week until the
      patient presents signs of recurrence. Assuming that by the time of recurrence the interval is
      too long, the next control (following a retreatment) is then scheduled one week sooner than
      the last control. Following this treatment schedule, the individualized retreatment interval
      is thereafter kept steady.

      Half the patients receive an additional panretinal photocoagulation on visit 3 and / or 4.
      Aim of this study is to investigate if this additional panretinal photocoagulation may result
      in a longer individualized retreatment interval corresponding to a reduced rate of recurrence
      of macular edema.
