    
      Background: Polypharmacy and inappropriate medication prescriptions are associated with
      increased morbidity and mortality. Most interventions proposed to improve appropriate
      prescribing are time and resource intensive and therefore hardly applicable in daily clinical
      practice.

      Objective: To test the efficacy of an easy-to-use checklist aimed at supporting the
      therapeutic reasoning of physicians in order to reduce inappropriate prescribing and
      polypharmacy.

      Design: single-center, interventional, quasi-experimental before-after study. Patients:
      Consecutive patients aged ≥65 years, hospitalized in the division of internal medicine of a
      Swiss secondary-level hospital from September to November 2012 (control group, N=450) and
      from September to November 2013 (intervention group, N=450).

      Intervention: Introduction of a 5-point checklist to be used by all physicians on the
      internal medicine wards.

      Main Measures: The proportion of patients with prescription of potentially inappropriate
      medications (PIMs) at discharge, according to Screening tool of older people's prescriptions
      (STOPP) criteria, and the number of prescribed medications at discharge, before and after the
      introduction of the checklist. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of polypharmacy (≥ 5
      drugs) and hyperpolypharmacy (≥ 10 drugs), and the prevalence of potentially inappropriate
      prescribing omissions (PPOs) according to START criteria.
