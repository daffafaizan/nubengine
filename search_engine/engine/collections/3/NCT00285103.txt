    
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in adults in the US and most
      of Western Europe. Many patients suffering from CLL have tumour cells expressing high amounts
      of Bcl-2 protein. Since over expression of Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, it is possible that this
      gene participates in the pathogenesis of CLL. By lowering the Bcl-2 protein in these tumour
      cells the cells may go into apoptosis due to changed balance in pro- and anti apoptotic
      proteins and thereby it might be possible to induce a tumour response.

      The study is an open-labelled, international, multicenter, dose escalating phase I/II study
      where patients receive 6, 3, 2 or 1 dose(s) of SPC2996, a LNA antisense molecule against
      Bcl-2, over a period of up to 2 weeks, and are followed for 6 months.
