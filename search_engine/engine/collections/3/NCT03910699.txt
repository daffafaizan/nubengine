      anastomosis with a surgical circular stapler device. Using a disposable circular stapler with
      two rows of staples is standard of care nowadays. Colorectal anastomosis dehiscence and
      subsequent anastomotic leak in postoperative period happens in 5-25% of cases and is a major
      and life-threatening complication. Thus different improvements to the procedure of creating a
      colorectal anastomosis are being proposed. One of them is utilizing a three-row instead of a
      two-row surgical circular stapler.

      A three-row surgical stapler has recently been registered and approved for clinical use in
      Russia. The primary purpose of this study is to find out the rate of colorectal anastomosis
      leakage when using a three-row circular stapler and to demonstrate that it is at least not
      bigger than the rate of colorectal anastomosis leakage when using a two-row circular stapler.
