      In the distal area of the maxilla, an adequate bone volume is often lacking because of the
      proximity of the sinus cavities to crestal bone. Sinus floor augmentation is an established
      way of increasing the height and volume of bone in the posterior region of the maxilla, which
      increase the stability of dental implants. For this purpose various materials, including auto
      grafts, allografts, alloplasts, and xenografts have been used.
