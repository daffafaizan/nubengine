      Approximately 50 of these patients will receive vortioxetine as a first treatment for the
      current Major Depressive Episode (MDE) (first treatment patients) and 50 patients will be
      switched to vortioxetine due to inadequate response to the current antidepressant medication
      treatment (switch patients).
