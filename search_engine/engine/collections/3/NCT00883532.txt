      double-blind design. Group I will receive surfactant and budesonide and GII will receive
      surfactant and air as control through endotracheal route. Therapy will be given every 8 hours
      until the infant require FIO2 < 30% or is extubated. The end point of assessment is the
      combined incidence of CLD and death judged at 36 weeks postconceptional age and the long term
      neurological and cognitive function at 2-3 years.

      The incidence of CLD and death in the selective group of infant is about 60%. Using this 60%
      incidence in the placebo group and expected 40% (33% improvement) in the treated group, 130
      infants in each group is needed to detected a difference, permitting a 5% chance of type I
      error and 10% chance of type II error. The total safe target number will be 300; 150 in each
      group. A collaborative study is therefore proposed. The primary outcome to be assessed is the
      combined incidence of CLD and death. The secondary outcome to be assessed is short term and
      long term side effects.
