    
      -  There are currently no effective and approved second line treatment options for
           advanced/ metastatic HCC.

        -  ASLAN001 (Varlitinib) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1 (EGFR),
           HER2, and HER4.

        -  In vivo studies on HER2/3 expressing HCC PDX models suggest inhibition of pERB B2/3,
           pERK1 and pERK 2 with treatment with ASLAN001 (Varlitinib). Dose dependent inhibition of
           Cdc2 and pAKT in HCC PDX models treated with ASLAN001 (Varlitinib) also suggest robust
           inhibition of the PI3K pathway.

        -  EGFR overexpression in HCC and matched non tumor tissues were detected in (32.5%) and
           (28.6%), respectively. Moreover, missense and silent mutations were detected in (39.4%)
           and (33.3%) of HCC tissues, respectively.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of ASLAN001 (Varlitinib) in
           advanced/metastatic HCC patients.

        -  After the recommended dose is determined, the Phase Ib portion of the study will
           evaluate the efficacy of ASLAN001 (Varlitinib) in HCC patients who have progressed on
           Sorafenib.
