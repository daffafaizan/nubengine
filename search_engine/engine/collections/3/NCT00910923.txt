      (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the volunteer or investigator knows
      the name of the assigned study drug), placebo-controlled (placebo is a substance that looks
      the same as JNJ-38431055 but contains no JNJ-38431055), single ascending dose study. In Part
      1, study drug (i.e., JNJ-38431055 or placebo) will be administered orally as single doses on
      Day 1 or three treatment periods. In Part 1, for each volunteer, the study will consist of a
      screening evaluation visit, 3 periods of double-blind treatment, and a final, follow-up
      examination. The total study duration for each volunteer will be approximately 9 weeks. Part
      2 is a randomized, open-label, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the effect of
      administering JNJ-38431055 together with food on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-38431055, as
      compared to administration in the fasting condition. In Part 2, study drug (JNJ-38431055 will
      be administered orally as single doses on Day 1 or two treatment periods. There will be at
      least 7 days between doses. In Part 1, study drug (i.e., JNJ-38431055 or placebo) will be
      administered orally as single doses on Day 1 of three treatment periods. In Part 2, study
      drug (JNJ-38431055) will be administered orally as single doses on Day 1 of two treatment
      periods.
