      will be examined. Students will be divided into 2 groups according to their year of studying
      (if they already studied "women health course or not implying 4th year students compared with
      1-3 year level students). Each participant will be asked to contract the pelvic floor
      muscles.

      The assessment of pelvic floor contraction will be measured by measuring bladder displacement
      via abdominal ultrasound. A curved linear array transducer will be placed in the transverse
      plane immediately suprapubically over the lower abdomen angled at 15-30 degrees from the
      vertical. Upward movement of the bladder during contraction will be marked as correct
      contraction. An on screen caliper and measurement tool will be used to measure bladder amount
      of bladder displacement.
