      platform collecting data on patients and procedures to provide a predictive tool to help
      physicians in the management of patients affected by a soft tissue lesion.

      The primary aim of our work is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of US-CNB. The secondary aim
      is to exploit all the imaging data conventionally available at a Sarcoma Center before a
      biopsy on a soft tissue mass, to build a multiparametric model and score of prediction of
      malignancy, and eventually of biological behavior - grading.
