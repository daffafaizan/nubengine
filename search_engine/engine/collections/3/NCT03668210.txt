      deficits, proprioceptive, hormonal, morphological deficits ... Moreover, there is also an
      increase in the number of contralateral fractures in patients who had a ligamentoplasty.
      There are many articles on the ACL pathology but unequal on the potential risk factors. The
      only proven risk factor for contralateral rupture is the age of the first episode; the female
      sex also seems to be important in some studies but remains more controversial. However, many
      factors have been studied: the intensity of the sport, the sex, the operative technique of
      ligamentoplasty, the operating duration, the duration of recovery of the sports activity, the
      level of recovery (of this sporting activity ) ...

      Isokinetics is used to measure the peak of strength of quadriceps and hamstrings, in
      concentric or eccentric, at slow and fast speed and to determine a hamstring / quadriceps
      ratio to highlight a deficit or imbalance.
