    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the extent to which a regimen of INCB024360 (epacadostat) that normalizes
      serum kynurenine (Kyn)/ tryptophan (Trp) ratios alters the tumor microenvironment of
      melanoma, including determining the number and character of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as
      determined by examination of serial biopsies with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene
      signatures.

      II. To determine the extent to which continued INCB024360 treatment plus the addition of the
      multipeptide melanoma vaccine, MELITAC 12.1 (MELITAC 12.1 peptide vaccine), further alters
      the tumor microenvironment of melanoma, including determining the number and character of
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as determined by serial biopsies evaluating IHC and gene
      signatures.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether a regimen of INCB024360 that normalizes serum Kyn/Trp ratios plus
      MELITAC 12.1 vaccine changes the level or character of the vaccine-induced clusters of
      differentiation (CD) 8+ and CD4+ T-cell immune responses as measured in peripheral blood, as
      compared to prior published experience.

      II. To evaluate the extent to which INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine alters the number
      and character of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations, including T and
      natural killer (NK) cells, as evaluated by multiparameter flow cytometry.

      III. To evaluate the extent to which INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine alters the PBMC
      transcriptome.

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine.

      V. To obtain preliminary data on the tumor response rate of INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1
      vaccine by objective response rate (ORR), time to tumor progression, and overall survival.

      VI. To associate any observed changes with the expression of IDO1 protein by IHC in tumor or
      tumor-infiltrating cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive epacadostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-98 and receive MELITAC
      12.1 peptide vaccine intradermally (ID)/subcutaneously (SC) on days 21, 28, 35, 56, 77, and
      98. Treatment with epacadostat may repeat every 98 days for up to 3 additional courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
