      dilution technique. Subsequently, they will be instructed to breathe 5 different inspired
      volumes (6, 8, 10, 12 and 15 ml/kg predicted body weight). Tidal volumes will be measured
      using a spirometer. For each inspired volume, 3 respiratory cycles will be recorded at four
      predetermined anatomic sites: left and right 3rd intercoastal space at the mid-clavicular
      line, and left and right 8th intercoastal space at the posterior axillary line. For each
      image, the probe will be oriented perpendicularly to the ribs. A research, non-commercially
      available, non-invasive vascular elastography platform will be used to calculate the various
      strain parameters for all of the recorded cineloops. For each recorded clip, an experienced
      lung ultrasonographer will segment the pleura on a single reference image. From this image,
      an algorithm will define a region of interest which will be tracked throughout the rest of
      the images of the video sequence. Finally, the algorithm will calculate the various
      components of pleural strain.
