    
      This is an interventional, phase II, open label, single arm, multicentric clinical trial to
      be conducted in China.

      The primary objective is to test the efficacy of concurrent RT-Pembrolizumab in patients with
      limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma and who are not eligible to receive chemotherapy.

      The secondary objectives are to further explore the efficacy and safety of a the combination
      of RT and Pembrolizumab as initial treatment of the patients population.

      All eligible patients will be treated with standard IFRT and concurrent pembrolizumab
      administered intravenously, over 30 minutes starting on day 1 of RT (C1D1, at the dose of 200
      mg, every 3 weeks). After 6 cycles of pembrolizumab patients will undergo restaging imaging.
      Patients with complete remission (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) will
      continue with pembrolizumab maintenance up to 2 years that will be administered
      intravenously, at the dose of 200 mg, over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks up to 34 cycles.

      The follow-up period will last up to 4 years from treatment start.
