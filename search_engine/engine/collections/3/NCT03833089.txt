      symptoms in heart failure patients and post-hoc studies have suggested that high-normal
      levels of blood potassium levels (p-K) markedly decreases the risk of malignant arrhythmias
      in cardiovascular patients.

      This trial will randomize patients implanted with implantable cardioverter defibrillators
      (ICDs), who remain at high risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, to a standard
      therapy or standard therapy plus a regimen to keep high-normal p-K levels. The study will
      enroll 1,000 patients from the outpatient pacemaker clinics at Rigshospitalet and Gentofte
      hospital. Using a planned regime to increase p-K using inexpensive drugs and potassium
      supplements, the patients enrolled and followed with regular controls as well as continuous
      monitoring using existing home monitoring systems over a period of 4 years for the primary
      endpoint of appropriate ICD therapy and all cause mortality. Including analysis, the trial
      will be running for 5 years
