      to assess tissue density, shape, texture and size before, during and after therapy. To the
      best of the investigator's knowledge, the impact of inter-observer delineation variability on
      the reliability of CT RF for PanNEN patients, including Hounsfield unit (HU) values-, shape-,
      and texture-based features, has not yet been assessed. One this has been determined, an
      additional evaluation will be conducted to correlate the morphologically observed images with
      their histopathological characteristics.

      The ultimate potential objective of this research is to identify and predict characteristics
      of aggressiveness of PanNEN in CT scans.
