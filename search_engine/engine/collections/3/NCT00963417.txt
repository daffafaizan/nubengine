        -  Evaluate changes in bone mineral density (BMD) among premenopausal women randomized in
           protocol IBC SG-25202 (TEXT-2) to receive either: A) triptorelin (GnRH analogue) for 5
           years plus tamoxifen for 5 years; or B) triptorelin (GnRH analogue) for 5 years plus the
           steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane for 5 years.

        -  Evaluate serial serum markers for bone remodeling (C-telopeptide, osteocalcin,
           bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) and investigate their correlation with BMD.

        -  Evaluate the relationship of genetic variants of CYP19A1, ERα, ERß, and IGF 1 with BMD.

        -  Evaluate serial serum growth factors (IGF-1 and IGFBP-3) and investigate whether their
           time course correlates with BMD.

        -  Explore the role of serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 as biomarkers of disease outcome
           (disease-free survival). (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected at baseline and then periodically for 6 years. Serum
      markers of bone remodeling and serum growth factor levels are measured.

      Bone mineral density in the L1-L4 (postero-anterior) region of the spine and femoral neck of
      the hip is measured by DEXA at baseline and then periodically for 6 years.

      Any surplus serum is stored for use in unspecified future research.
