    
      This is a single center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the tolerability,
      efficacy, and safety of eyelash prostheses over a 3-week period versus Xiidra BID over a 5
      week period in subjects with self-reported DED. 40 subjects will be randomized to either
      eyelash prostheses or Xiidra, in a 1:1 ratio.

      At Visit 1 (screening), informed consent will be obtained from subjects and eligibility will
      then be determined. All pre-treatment assessments will be done at this visit. Randomization
      will occur. If randomized to receive Xiidra eye drops, a prescription will be written and the
      treatment will be started right away. If randomized to eyelash prostheses, then a second
      study visit will be made approximately 2 weeks later.

      Visit 2 (Eyelash Prostheses application) Subjects randomized to receive eyelash prostheses
      will have them applied approximately 2 weeks after the screening and randomization visit.

      Visit 3 (Final visit) will be 3 weeks post eyelash prosthesis placement and 5 weeks post
      Xiidra eye drop initiation. This was done to compare the maximal treatment effect between the
      two groups. All subjects will undergo post-treatment assessments.

      At each visit, patients will be asked to report any adverse events.
