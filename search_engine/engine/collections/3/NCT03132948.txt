      physical, psychological, social, and functional well-being. In addition, quality of life
      includes one's overall ability to become a productive member of society and achieve personal
      fulfillment. Treatment of pediatric cancer is a highly stressful experience which can be
      challenging and disruptive to the lives of children and their families. Pediatric oncology
      patients receiving chemotherapy often experience a decline in quality of life due to
      decreased activity, fatigue, and psychological distress such as depression or anxiety when
      compared to healthy individuals. Preliminary data suggests that there is an association
      between physical activity and quality of life. Exercise has been show to improve mood,
      increase energy levels, and reduce stress. Although more research and clinical resources have
      been given to the effects of exercise on quality of life among adult cancer patients, there
      is a lack of research in these areas among children with cancer. The investigators know
      little about whether children with cancer would benefit from exercise.

      The investigators have added a blood sample for biomarkers. Research in adult cancer patients
      have shown an association between different biomarkers and sleep quality which suggests that
      regulation of certain biomarkers may be affected through exercise in adults. Measures of
      biomarkers may provide insight into potential mediators between PA, sleep quality, or fatigue
      levels.
