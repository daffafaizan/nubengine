      medications are SSRIs, which were empirically found to be somewhat helpful. Losartan provides
      a potentially important and exciting development in that it is readily available, safe,
      inexpensive (available as a generic drug), and has a neurobiological mechanism based on
      recent exciting discoveries, as outlined below. This proposal is designed to test, in a
      multisite RCT, this novel, mechanistically-determined, safe and well-tolerated, potentially
      powerful treatment for PTSD symptoms.
