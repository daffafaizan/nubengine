      of Proellex and to determine and characterize metabolites present in plasma and urine
      following a single oral dose of 25 mg. The 25 mg dose selected for this study has been
      included in all previous clinical trials. This dose was well tolerated and demonstrated
      efficacy against uterine fibroids and endometriosis.
