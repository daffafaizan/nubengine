      receiving medication and routine follow-up care at community clinics in San Antonio, Texas.

      Patients receive baseline assessments and then are randomly assigned to either Cognitive
      Remediation (CR) or Keyboarding Skills (KS) for a period of 8 weeks. Following 8 weeks of
      treatment in either CR or KS, all patients participated in Social Skills Training (SST) for a
      period of 8 weeks. Assessments conducted by raters blinded to treatment condition are
      repeated following either remediation or control treatment, and again following SST.

      Treatment groups Cognitive Remediation (CR) -- The CR program is based upon teaching
      techniques developed within educational psychology that promote intrinsic motivation and task
      engagement. The program uses existing computer software packages (e.g., Oregon Trail) with
      engaging story lines or activities, and built-in reinforcement of correct responses to help
      patients with schizophrenia develop attention, memory, planning, and problem-solving skills.
      CR is delivered in a computer lab setting with a facilitator present to assist patients.

      Keyboarding Skills (KS) -- Control Treatment: The control treatment is an engaging self-paced
      software program designed to teach typing skills. KS is delivered in a computer lab setting
      with a facilitator present.

      Both the KS and CR are administered in small groups of three to five patients each.

      Social Skills Training (SST) -- SST is a manual-driven, behavioral rehabilitation program
      teaching basic conversation and social problem-solving skills (Bellack et al., 1997). SST
      runs for 8 weeks and is conducted in small groups that meet twice weekly.
