    
      Our objective is to determine the most efficient route and timing of oxytocin administration
      by measuring the duration of third stage of labour, quantitative blood during the first hour
      after delivery and comparing haemoglobin and haematocrit changes and the need for additional
      interventions in patients who had either a spontaneous labour or received labour augmentation
      with oxytocin.
