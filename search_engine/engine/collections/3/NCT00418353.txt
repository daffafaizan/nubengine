      compared to dexamethasone among women at risk of preterm deliveries at Stony Brook University
      Hospital from August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2004. We excluded women with clinical
      chorioamnionitis, major fetal structural anomalies, fetal chromosomal abnormalities, prior
      antenatal steroid exposure, and use of betamethasone or dexamethasone for other medical
      indications, quadruplets and higher order multiple gestation and those who declined
      enrollment. Consenting women were randomly allocated to one of two groups by the Pharmacy
      using computer generated random numbers. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance
      of the intention-to-treat principle. Student t test, Chi square and Fisher exact test were
      used for analysis. A P value of < .05 was considered statistically significant.
