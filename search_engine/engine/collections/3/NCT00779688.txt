    
      This is a registry study to collect high quality longitudinal data from patients with
      suspected or indeterminate pancreaticobiliary pathology who are undergoing an ERCP with
      Cellvizio probe-based endomicroscopy procedure, with or without supplemental direct
      cholangiopancreatoscopy. The hypothesis is that ERCP with Cellvizio probe-based
      endomicroscopy improves differentiation of biliary and pancreatic duct lesions versus ERCP
      alone.

      Direct measures of accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, etc.) in the differentiation of
      malignant versus benign biliary and/or pancreatic duct lesions will be compared for the
      combination of endomicroscopy and ERCP imaging and ERCP alone. These presumptive diagnoses
      will be compared against a 12-month follow-up confirmed histopathologic endpoint (an
      initially-benign pathologic diagnosis will be confirmed by a 12-month follow-up). Secondary
      objectives include collecting various safety and technical performance parameters.
