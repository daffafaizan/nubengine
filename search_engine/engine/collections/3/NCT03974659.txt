      right cerebellar VIIa lobule. Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation(Negative stimulation) is
      used in left cerebellar VIIa lobule. The stimulation intensity was 80% Rest Motor
      Threshold.According to the patients' condition, age and tolerance,the intensity should be
      adjusted.

      Control group: The investigators use with fake stimulation , the appearance is the same as
      the magnetic stimulator used in the experimental group, and the stimulation will also make
      sounds, but no magnetic field effect, the stimulation mode is the same as the intervention
      group.

      Subsequently, The investigators collect patients MRI data and language behavioral assessment
      scores at 1week post operation and 1 month after the operation and 3 months after the
      operation.three times MRI data and language behavioral assessment scores were processed and
      statistically analyzed to compare the differences between the two groups from the cerebellar
      spontaneous neurological activity level (ALFF), cerebellar gray matter volume, functional
      connectivity of cerebellar network and language behavioral score.
