      consecutive patients undergoing thoracotomy for MIDCAB or lung tumor resection over a 6 month
      period. After patients emerged from a standardized general anesthetic and when objectively
      awake and complaining of pain >5/10 on a visual analogue pain scale, they were connected to
      an intravenous patient controlled analgesia regimen. The regimen was assigned randomly to be
      either morphine alone (1.5 mg per dose, lockout interval of 7 minutes) or morphine plus
      ketamine (1.0 mg morphine plus 5 mg ketamine per dose, same lockout interval). Rescue
      diclofenac was available to both groups. Follow-up lasted 4 hours.

      We planned to monitor and compare pain scores, wakefulness scores, hemodynamic and
      respiratory parameters as well as total morphine consumption and incidence of side effects
      and complications. All monitoring and recording was done by blinded nurses and intensive care
      physicians.
