      delivery may be employed in methacholine challenges using a quadrupling dose schedule instead
      of the standard doubling dose schedule with similar diagnostic efficacy, with no increase in
      patient adverse events, and with a shorter investigational duration. This has previously been
      shown to be true using the dosimeter technique of methacholine challenge.
