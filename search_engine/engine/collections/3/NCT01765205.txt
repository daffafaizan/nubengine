      disease (CHD) newborns using a new oximetry system. This system is interfaced to a laptop
      computer which computes the difference between central and lower extremity peripheral values,
      upper and lower body peripheral values, and records all data. This information may
      differentiate unaffected newborns and CHD newborns, and determine the effectiveness of pulse
      oximetry as a newborn screening for congenital cardiovascular malformations.
