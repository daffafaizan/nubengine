      A two-stage sinus augmentation was carried out in six patients using mineralized
      solvent-dehydrated bone allograft (MCBA), freeze-dried mineralized bone allograft (FDBA),
      anor-ganic bovine bone (ABB), equine-derived bone (EB); synthetic micromacroporous biphasic
      calcium-phosphate block consisting of 70% beta-tricalcium phosphate and 30% hydroxyap-atite
      (HA-Î²-TCP 30/70), or bioapatite-collagen (BC).
