      pathways. Jinshuibao capsule, which is composed of fermented cordyceps sinensis powder (Cs-4)
      , has shown therapeutic effects in chronic kidney disease (CKD) according to small sample
      exploratory studies. Here, we conduct a prospective, double-blind randomized controlled study
      to assess the efficacy and safety of Jinshuibao for patients with CKD due to
      glomerulonephritis.
