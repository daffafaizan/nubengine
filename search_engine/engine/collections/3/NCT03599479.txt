      cannot help being exposed to the acute pain and fear during the interventions. "Virtual
      Reality(VR)" is a state-of-art advanced technology, which is now being extended to various
      medical fields such as pain management, dental treatment, body rehabilitation and cancer
      pain. There is no study that have conjugated the virtual reality experience for patients'
      acute pain and anxiety which occurs during the pain interventions. So the investigators like
      to evaluate the effects of virtual reality experience on acute pain and anxiety precipitated
      by the pain interventions.
