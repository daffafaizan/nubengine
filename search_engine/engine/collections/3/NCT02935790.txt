    
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation cohort study. The study will consist of a
      dose escalation assessment of the safety and tolerability of ACY-241 administered
      concurrently in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab to patients with advanced melanoma.
      Treatment will be divided into induction and maintenance phases.

      Determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ACY-241 in combination with ipilimumab at 1
      mg/kg and nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses each during a 12-week induction
      period, then administered with nivolumab at a flat dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks in
      maintenance for up to 1 year in patients with unresectable Stage III/Stage IV melanoma.

      It is anticipated that this clinical study will enable selection of the RP2D and dose
      schedule of this 3-drug combination for further clinical testing. The trial will include an
      assessment of the pharmacodynamic activity of ACY-241.
