      as Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) < 17 cm, S' (TDI) < 10 cm/s) and
      estimate the RV-PA (Right Ventricle-Pulmonary Artery) coupling as indicated by Guazzi et all.
      (TAPSE/PAPs ratio, where PAPs is the Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure) after major lung
      resection (bilobectomy and pneumonectomy) using echocardiography, and to assess if these
      modifications (RV dysfunction and RV-PA coupling) may be associated with post-operative
      cardiopulmonary complications occurring during the hospitalization period. Investigators also
      intend to evaluate if these changes are associated with impaired functional capacity at 3
      months after surgery.
