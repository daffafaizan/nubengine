      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab, when administered concurrently with 5-fluorouracil
      (5-FU) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with clinical stage T3 or T4
      rectal cancer prior to surgery.

      II. To obtain preliminary data of the pathological response rate after preoperative therapy.

      III. To obtain preliminary data regarding progression free survival, local control, and
      overall survival.

      IV. To obtain preliminary data of the changes in the angiogenic profile of rectal cancer
      induced by this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bevacizumab.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 (courses 1-4). Beginning with
      course 2, patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-14 and undergo
      external beam radiotherapy on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo surgery 7 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 20 additional
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 2 years.
