      to radioresistance. Combinations of radiosensitisers such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin with
      radiotherapy have demonstrated promise in sarcomas, but with significant toxicity.

      The rationale for this study is based on:

        -  the frequency of hypoxia in soft-tissue sarcomas

        -  the importance of radiotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas

        -  targeting hypoxic vasculature with sunitinib

        -  the single agent activity of sunitinib in soft-tissue sarcomas. This study will assess
           the feasibility and tolerability of the combination of sunitinib with standard
           preoperative radiotherapy. The surrogate endpoints of tumor necrosis and functional and
           RECIST imaging response will provide early evidence of response rate. Toxicities will be
           assessed both during chemoradiation and following surgery. The impact of treatment on
           the hypoxic component of the tumor will be investigated with F18 azamycin arabinoside
           PET scans.

      Because the combination of sunitinib and radiotherapy has not been studied before, we propose
      a phase Ib design with dose reductions in the event of excessive toxicity. Sunitinib
      treatment will precede the commencement of radiotherapy by 2 weeks because there is
      preclinical evidence that priming the tumor vasculature may increase synergy with
      radiotherapy, and because sunitinib may have single agent activity in sarcomas, including
      measurable effects on tumor vasculature. Because it is anticipated that the likelihood of
      complications attributable to the combination of sunitinib and radiotherapy will be small,
      the starting dose of sunitinib will be 50mg/day for the two week lead-in period and then 25mg
      for 5 weeks with concurrent radiotherapy.
