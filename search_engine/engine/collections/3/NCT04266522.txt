      I. To evaluate whether the Medical Physics Direct Patient Care Initiative (MPDPCI) improves
      anxiety/distress.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      II. To assess whether the MPDPCI improves patient treatment adherence and overall
      satisfaction.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive printed materials describing the technical aspects of their
      treatment.

      ARM II: Patients receive printed materials as in Arm I. Patients also receive a minimum of 2
      direct physicist interactions to describe the technical aspects of their treatment either
      immediately prior to or immediately after treatment simulation.
