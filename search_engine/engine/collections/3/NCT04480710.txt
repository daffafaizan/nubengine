    
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, once daily (QD) dose study of CRV431
      in presumed NASH F2/F3 subjects. Study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a once
      daily 75mg dose of CRV431 compared to placebo over 28 days of dosing. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters of CRV431 and its major metabolites and fraction unbound will also be evaluated.
      Non-invasive antifibrotic bio-markers will be collected and quantified from presumed NASH
      F2/F3 subjects dosed with 75mg CRV431 or placebo.
