      from a nickel titanium alloy (Nitinol) tube and consists of a series of segments each
      connected to the next in a unique pattern to allow for flexibility and vessel conformability.
      Each segment consists of two struts and a crown (Figure 1). It is designed to produce optimal
      luminal diameter and increased scaffolding, and to maintain luminal patency.
