      with ITP and from 10 healthy women in the same stage after giving birth. Antibodies against
      platelets in the samples will be examined by using anti human IgM/G/A antibody following
      incubation of the serum/milk samples with platelets. The platelets will be from leftovers of
      samples send to platelets functionality test and found to be normal (the platelets samples
      will be taken without any identification and be marked only with lab number). The measurement
      will be done by flow cytometer. Sample will be consider as positive when the signal will be
      greater than 2 fold of control samples standard deviation. In addition, the presence of
      antibodies in different times from the birth will be checked in breastfeeding milk and sera
      of ITP patients. If the milk proteins and lipids will disturb the exam, the immunoglobulins
      from the milk will be isolated using Ig isolation kit from plasma.
