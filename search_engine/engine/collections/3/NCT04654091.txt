      carried out by including the sample of those patients who have diagnostic confirmation of
      plantar wart in the Chiropodology and Surgery Service of the University Podiatry Clinic of
      the Complutense University of Madrid, consecutively, between November 2020 and the date when
      the estimated sample size is reached.

      Participants in the trial will be assigned with equal probability to each treatment arm,
      based on their consecutive inclusion in the study. Subsequently, the treatment allocation
      will be determined by a random code generated by the Epidat 4.1 program using random permuted
      blocks. The treatment used will be evident both for the participant and for the research
      podiatrist responsible for the intervention. However, the primary result will be confirmed by
      the microbiological study carried out by the Department of Microbiology of the Complutense
      University of Madrid, which does not know any data about the patient or the treatment group
      to which it was initially assigned.
