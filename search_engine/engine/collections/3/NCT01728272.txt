      absorbtion of metoprolol postoperatively, hypothesis in that miniperfusion and off pump
      surgery does not decrease absorbtion of the metoprolol compared to conventional pefusion.

      Blood samples for concentration of metoprolol are taken preoperaively, 1. and 3. day after
      operation, before and 10 times after intake of 50 mg metoprolol.

      Sudy is randomized into 3 groups: 1. Miniperfusion n.15 2. Perfusion n.15 3. offpump n.15
