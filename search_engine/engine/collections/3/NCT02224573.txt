      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who have previously participated in double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical studies of GWP42003-P (Core Studies). The first participant will not enroll into the
      open-label extension study until the Data Safety Monitoring Committee has reviewed the safety
      data from Part A of study GWEP1332.
