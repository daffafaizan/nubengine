      earlier and with less pain after surgery. Sometimes if the stool softener or mild laxatives
      do not work, you may need to use stronger laxatives or enemas. We want to see if specifically
      using SennaS is better for having a bowel movement soon after surgery and with less pain.
      SennaS is FDA approved for constipation. It has a stool softener and a mild laxative and has
      been shown to be safe and effective for treating constipation.
