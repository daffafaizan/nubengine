      Lymphoma.CD19 is expressed on most B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma cells so it is an ideal
      target for CAR-T. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T
      targeting CD19 in patients with elapsed/refractory CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma. The
      primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment, including adverse events and disease status
      after treatment.
