      following perinatal loss. Our perinatal-loss adapted group IPT will be compared to a standard
      depression intervention (CWD, also delivered in a group format) in a sample of 274 women
      experiencing MDD following perinatal loss. The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      will test the hypotheses that: (1) IPT for perinatal loss will result in reduced time to
      recovery from MDD (primary), depressive symptoms, and PTSD symptoms (secondary) relative to
      CWD; and that among women meeting criteria for PTSD, IPT will result in reduced time to
      recovery from PTSD; (2) IPT for perinatal loss will result in increased social support,
      social role functioning (including parental functioning for women with living children), and
      well-being, and decreased grief and fear of subsequent pregnancies, relative to CWD; and (3)
      social support and grief will mediate the effects of IPT on time to MDD recovery.
