    
      It is designed to provide clinical and paraclinical efficacy and safety data for dexrazoxane
      in Mitoxantrone treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in order to investigate the possible positive
      influence of dexrazoxane on cardiac function of Mitoxantrone-affected myocardial tissue and
      on the possible augmented clinical efficacy of Mitoxantrone in combination with dexrazoxane
      on neurological outcome parameters. The incidence of cardiotoxicity during combined
      Mitoxantrone/dexrazoxane treatment will be investigated and compared to the standard
      Mitoxantrone-treatment without dexrazoxane.
