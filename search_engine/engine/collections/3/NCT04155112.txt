      and risk og type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit from interventions that
      lower body weight. Diet and physical activity are optimal. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet
      with and without weight loss reduce the incidence of CVD and was superiour to a low fat diet
      in lowering ectopic fat. Exercise lowers risk of type 2 diabetes and contributes to weight
      loss. Addition of exercise after 6 month of dieting decreased visceral fat without weight
      loss, suggesting that reduction in ectopic fat in addition to increased lean body mass
      explain the benefits of exercise.

      Poor motivation, physical limitations, socioeconomic factors and lack of enjoyment of
      exercise are common. and represent a major barrier to lifestyle change. Initiating one
      lifestyle change at a time (diet or exercise) may improve adherence.

      Studies examining the effects og lifestyle change on disease outcomes are difficult to
      conduct due to long follow up and large samples required. In the abscence of of hard
      outcomes, surrogate endpoints are of considerable importance in guiding lifestyle advice.
      Recently software has been developed to quantify ectopic fat deposits using MRI technology.

      To our knowledge, studies looking at the differential effects of dietary change versus
      physical activity on ectopic fat deposits using advanced technology have not been done.
