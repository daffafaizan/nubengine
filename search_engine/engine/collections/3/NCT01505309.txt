      been treated with open surgical techniques, requiring cardiopulmonary bypass and deep
      hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). Despite increasing experience and refinement of these
      procedures, there remains a substantial rate of morality and morbidity. The goal of Thoracic
      Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) is to re-construct the descending aorta and aortic arch to
      cover the primary entry tear of the dissection and to remodel the aorta. TEVAR technique were
      performed with various devices available. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      short to mid term efficacy and safety of Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) in
      patients who had aortic lesions, such as descending aortic/arch aneurysm, pseudo-aneurysm,
      Stanford Type B dissection,dissection with primary tear located in the aortic arch, et al.

      Primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome variables include
      conversion to stent and/or surgery, induced thrombosis of the false lumen, cardiovascular
      morbidity, aortic expansion (> 5 mm/y of maximum diameter including true and false lumina),
      quality of life, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. The study designs to
      enroll 50 patients to be monitored for 24 months.
