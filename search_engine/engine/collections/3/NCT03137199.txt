    
      A Phase 1 investigation will be performed to test the safety of two doses of bone
      marrow-derived MSCs (20,000,000 and 100,000,000) administered via peripheralintravenous
      infusion.

      Group 1: 3 subjects will receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 20 million
      cells delivered via peripheral intravenous infusion Group 2: 3 subjects will receive a single
      administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 100 million cells delivered via peripheral intravenous
      infusion Interim safety analysis will be performed four weeks after the 1st subject is
      enrolled in each cohort. Continued safety and tolerability with review of adverse events
      (AEs) will be assessed at each visit. Efficacy parameters (pulmonary function tests,
      diffusing capacity (DLCO), lung volumes, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and dyspnea/quality of
      life [QOL] questionnaires) will be assessed every 12 weeks until study completion. Clinical
      laboratory tests to assess safety will be performed at every visit.
