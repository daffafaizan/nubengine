      F18 Injection MPI in comparison with SPECT MPI in patients with known or suspected CAD. Six
      hundred and seventy-two evaluable patients will be enrolled and will undergo SPECT MPI and
      Flurpiridaz F18 PET MPI. Patients will be considered for enrollment if they are scheduled to
      undergo or have undergone prior ICA without intervention (being either positive or negative
      for CAD).
