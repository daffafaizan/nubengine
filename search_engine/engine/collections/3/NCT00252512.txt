      substance use disorders treatment at the Minneapolis VAMC and the VA Puget Sound Health Care
      System will be randomly assigned to 8 weeks of Usual Care or Usual Care plus Contingency
      Management. Minimal exclusion criteria include primary cannabis dependence, primary opioid
      dependence, screening positive for pathological gambling, serious psychiatric symptoms or
      suicide risk. Randomization will be stratified by site and primary substance use disorder
      (alcohol or stimulant). All participants will meet with a research assistant twice per week
      to submit urine drug and breath alcohol samples. Participants randomized to the contingency
      management interventions will have the opportunity to draw tokens (with replacement) from a
      bowl each time they submit negative urine drug and breath alcohol screens. The number of
      drawings allowed escalates with continuous weeks of negative screens or returns to baseline
      if screens are positive or missed. Half of the 500 tokens will result in social reinforcement
      ("Good Job!"). The remainder will earn a VA canteen voucher worth monetary value. Follow-up
      assessments occur 2, 6, and 12 months after enrollment into the study. Primary outcomes
      measures include number of days with negative urine drug and breath alcohol screens during
      the intervention phase, days of treatment attendance during the intervention phase, and
      percent days abstinent on the Timeline Follow-Back interview at follow-up assessments.
      Secondary outcomes include a brief assessment of employment, housing, legal, and psychiatric
      status, and administrative data on VA service utilization. A process evaluation and an
      economic analysis are included.
