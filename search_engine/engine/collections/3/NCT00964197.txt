      FemmeJock in patients with pelvic organ prolapse. We plan to enroll 30 patients who will be
      recruited from the OU Health Science Center. We will offer study participation to patients
      who meet the inclusion criteria listed below, and who are: (1) awaiting surgical management
      and desire a temporary nonsurgical option, (2) seeking permanent nonsurgical treatment, or
      (3) who have a contraindication to surgical management.
