      anticoagulant agents) is available for acute VTE, but it is associated with potentially
      dangerous side effects. In addition, DVT and PE are just two manifestations of VTE, which can
      occur everywhere in the human organism. An underlying disease (i.e. cancer) is often a key
      factor in developing VTE.

      Commonly used diagnostic imaging techniques in DVT and PE have a fair diagnostic accuracy,
      but do not address other important aspects of the disease. In contrast to this, FDG-PET/CT
      has the potential to contribute in VTE diagnosis by

        -  Differentiate between acute and chronic VTE

        -  Screening of the entire body for VTE (e.g. the pelvis where normal imaging techniques
           fail)

        -  Early diagnosis of underlying disease (e.g. cancer, with the possibility of early
           treatment)

      This is a pilot study with the above mentioned objectives, and is part of a larger study
      addressing other aspects of FDG-PET/CT in VTE.

      The investigators believe that their hypothesis that FDG-PET/CT imaging may introduce a new
      approach for detecting thrombi anywhere in the body, particularly in the venous system
      including the pelvis and the calves, will add a new dimension in treating patients with
      suspected PE. This technology will only detect acute thrombi and not chronic thrombi that no
      longer have activity, which will obviate unnecessary treatment in this population.
