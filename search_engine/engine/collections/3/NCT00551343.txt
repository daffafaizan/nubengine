      Hyperphagia is the main barrier to independent living in adults with PWS, and hitherto
      behavioural restraints and environmental modification are the only effective management
      measure. The emerging costs for professional care are immense. Thus, there is an urgent need
      for treatment which reduce appetite and food intake in this patient group. Agonists of the
      gut derived hormone GLP-1 which reduces food intake and causes weight loss due to slowed
      gastric emptying and through direct central effects. The aim of this pilot drug trial is to
      analyse the effect of a GLP-1 agonist on appetite regulating hormones, insulin secretion and
      energy expenditure before and after a meal.
