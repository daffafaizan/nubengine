      metastatic disease. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is a protein expressed on
      prostate cancer cells that can be imaged using small molecules that target this protocol. PET
      imaging will begin 50-100 minutes after injection, but may be possible in certain
      circumstances for imaging to be delayed due to patient workflow or equipment issues

      Primary Objective:

      Sensitivity on a per-patient and per-region-basis (Table 1) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection
      of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy, clinical and conventional imaging
      follow-up.
