        1. In patients with SIRS and oliguria the early administration of sodium bicarbonate or
           sodium chloride (control) triggered by an abnormally high NGAL level is feasible.

        2. In patients with SIRS and oliguria the early administration of sodium bicarbonate or
           sodium chloride (control) triggered by an abnormally high NGAL level is safe.

        3. In patients with SIRS and oliguria the early administration of sodium bicarbonate or
           sodium chloride (control) triggered by an abnormally high NGAL level leads to signs or
           trends of efficacy as measured by serum creatinine derived indices.
