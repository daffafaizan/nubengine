      problems. The exact cause of AD is unknown. Researchers believe mitochondria (the part of
      your cells that produces energy) might be linked to symptoms of AD. Some studies have shown
      that patients with Alzheimer's disease have reduced mitochondrial activity or have fewer
      mitochondria present in neurons. In this study, it is believed that by targeting
      mitochondria, we might learn more about its influence on AD symptoms.

      Mitochondria have a receptor site for estrogen (a hormone) called estrogen receptor β (ERβ).
      When estrogen attaches to this site, it promotes mitochondrial function. Studies have also
      suggested ERβ stimulation can cause cells to create new mitochondria. More mitochondria, or
      increased activity of existing mitochondria, in the cell might have an impact on patients
      with Alzheimer's disease. One way to measure this increase in function is to look for the
      presence of an enzyme called COX in your blood. If a drug increases mitochondrial function,
      there will be an increase in COX concentration in the bloodstream.

      By doing this study we hope to learn if S-equol, a compound that acts like estrogen in the
      body, causes such an increase in mitochondrial activity. We also hope to determine the
      tolerability of a therapeutic dose of S-equol. It is our goal to advance the understanding of
      AD, particularly in women.
