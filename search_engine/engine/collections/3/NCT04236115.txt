      study duration time (10 minutes). However, there were six patients with failure anaesthesia
      (5 in prilocaine group and 1 in articaine group). By application Person's Chi-square test
      (x2), there were no significant differences in the number of the episodes of the anaesthetic
      success between articaine and prilocaine groups at time intervals (P-value = 0.5). T- test
      showed there have been no important variations within the mean onset time of anaesthesia for
      articaine and prilocaine buccal infiltrations (P-value =0.1).
