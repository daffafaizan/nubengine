      for PICC placement can be included. Patients will be randomised into two groups, one with
      ECG-guided placement followed by ultrasound control and the other with only ultrasound guided
      placement. After placement, in both groups, control radiography of the chest will be done
      which will be interpreted by an independent radiologist. For the ECG-guided group the
      ultrasound control of the tip position will be done by an independent, blind operator, after
      placement. For the only ultrasound guided placement group, the ultrasound will be done by a
      second operator during placement.
