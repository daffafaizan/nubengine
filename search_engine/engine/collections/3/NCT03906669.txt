      receptor (ER) in human breast cancers. There is evidence for a reprogramming of ER chromatin
      binding sites with 470 genes differentially regulated by dual treatment with estrogen plus
      progestogen compared to estrogen alone in breast cancer cell lines. Functionally, there was
      an additive anti-cancer effect with the addition of natural progesterone to endocrine therapy
      in preclinical breast cancer models.

      This is a phase II multi-site, randomised, open-label, three-arm, study in 200 postmenopausal
      women with early-stage ER+, PR+, HER2-negative breast cancer. Eligible patients will be
      randomised (1:1:1) to receive 14 days of intervention with either letrozole 2.5mg PO daily
      (arm 1), letrozole 2.5mg + prometrium 300mg PO daily (arm 2) or tamoxifen 20mg + prometrium
      300mg PO daily (arm 3), between diagnosis of breast cancer and definitive surgery.
