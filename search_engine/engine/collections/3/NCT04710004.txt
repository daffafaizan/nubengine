    
      This is a nonrandomized interventional trial that will apply brain stimulation via clinically
      implanted intracranial electrodes to subjects with medial temporal lobe epilepsy with the
      purpose of identifying biomarkers related to the pre-ictal state; to perform an acute
      parameter search to determine the stimulation pattern that most effectively modifies these
      biomarkers and to identify changes in memory (free recall) during asynchronous distributed
      multi-electrode stimulation (ADMES).
