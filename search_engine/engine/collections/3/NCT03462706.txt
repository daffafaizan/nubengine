      study, we propose to evaluate four different treatments for polyps (sized 6mm-15mm). The four
      treatments are cold snaring without injection, hot snaring without injection, cold EMR, and
      hot EMR. This study aims to help to establish the optimal resection technique for 6-9 and
      10-15 mm polyps.
