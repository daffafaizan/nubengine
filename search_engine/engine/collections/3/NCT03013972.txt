      (estimated 60 patients). Brief fatigue inventory-Taiwanese form (BFI-T) and functional
      assessment of cancer therapy-general 7 (FACT-G7) will be used to evaluate patients' fatigue
      and quality of life. Patients will be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study
      activity schedule and all regulatory requirements that must be satisfied for informed
      consent. Only patients who give consent to participate in this study and meet all other
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll into this study. The
      questionnaire survey will be carried out before first chemotherapy treatment (baseline), and
      every four chemotherapy cycles (i.e. at cycle 4, 8 and 12) after chemotherapy treatment at
      outpatient department (OPD) or ward during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment period. All
      patients will receive standard chemotherapy which continued for 24 weeks (12 cycles) or until
      disease progression, whichever came first. Subject demographic and disease-related
      information will also be collected for analysis.
