    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, two-arm, 2:1 randomized clinical trial.

      Randomization will be stratified by the presence of medically treated diabetes vs. no
      medically treated diabetes and by site. Lesions planned to be treated must be declared and
      recorded at time of randomization.

      Angiographic follow-up will be performed at 6 months. Clinical follow-up will be performed at
      30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post randomization.

      The Primary Endpoint is in-stent late loss at 6 months as measured by the angiographic core
      laboratory.

      Angiographic Secondary Endpoints to be evaluated at 6 months are:

        -  In-segment late loss

        -  Follow-up percent diameter stenosis (in-stent and in-segment)

        -  Binary restenosis (in-stent and in-segment)

        -  Length and patterns of angiographic restenosis (Mehran classification)

      Clinical Secondary Endpoints to be evaluated at 30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
      years, except as noted, are:

        -  Device, Lesion, and Procedure Success at time of baseline procedure

        -  Target lesion failure (TLF; the composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related MI, or
           ischemia-driven TLR)

        -  Major adverse cardiac events (MACE; the composite rate of cardiac death, any MI or
           ischemia-driven TLR)

        -  Target vessel failure (TVF; the composite rate of death, target vessel-related MI, or
           ischemia-driven TVR)

        -  Overall Mortality

        -  Cardiac Death

        -  Myocardial Infarction

        -  Target Vessel Related MI

        -  Ischemia-driven TLR

        -  Ischemia-driven TVR

        -  Stent Thrombosis (ARC definite and probable)
