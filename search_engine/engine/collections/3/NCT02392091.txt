      may contribute to acidemia in the state of hyperchloremic acidosis, but the prevalence of RTA
      has never been studied in critically ill patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the
      prevalence, type, and possible risk factors of RTA in critically ill patients using a
      physical-chemical approach.

      This prospective, observational trial was conducted in a medical ICU of a university
      hospital. 100 consecutive critically ill patients at the age ≥18, expected to stay in the ICU
      for ≥24h, with the clinical necessity for a urinary catheter and the absence of anuria were
      included.

      Base excess subset calculation based on a physical-chemical approach on the first seven days
      after ICU admission was used to compare the effects of free water, chloride, albumin, and
      unmeasured anions on the standard base excess. Calculation of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) -
      as an approximate measure of the unmeasured urine cation ammonium - served as determinate
      between renal and extra-renal bicarbonate loss in the state of hyperchloremic acidosis.
