      environment due to its widespread use in operating rooms. Factors affecting the presence of
      anesthetic gases in the environment; device leakage, ventilation, fresh gas flow, and
      operation of the air cleaning system. Long-term exposure to anesthetic gases is known to
      adversely affect the health of employees in the operating room.

      Clara cell plays a reliable role as a large bronchiolar progenitor cell that can contribute
      to cell regeneration in the bronchial epithelium. Thus, it contributes to the protection of
      the normal epithelium of the distal conductive airways. Additionally, it has been shown to
      have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. It is thought that some
      substances accumulated in the respiratory system participate in the detoxification.

      Operations of patients undergoing hepatectomy usually take 4-6 hours. Inhalation anesthetics
      are widely used during this surgery. In this study, we thought to show the effect of
      long-term inhalation anesthesia exposure by performing this surgery on patients in this
      group. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of sevoflurane and desflurane
      inhalation anesthetics on clara cell protein in liver transplant donors scheduled for
      hepatectomy surgery.
