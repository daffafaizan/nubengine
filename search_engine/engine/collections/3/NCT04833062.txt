      dyslipidaemia, and cardiovascular diseases) has increased in recent years, in both
      industrialized and developing countries. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common
      disorders which occurred during pregnancy. Approximately 15% of pregnancies worldwide are
      thought to be affected by preexisting or gestational insulin-dependent (type 1) or
      independent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (DM).

      The utility of mid- and third trimester ultrasound parameters will be assessed for prediction
      of intrapartal events and perinatal outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus. The
      importance of mid-trimester uterine artery blood flow and foetal biometry will be
      investigated for prediction of intrapartal events and perinatal outcomes in patients with
      diabetes mellitus. Moreover, an investigation of the utility of third trimester (measured at
      30 and 34 weeks of gestation) ultrasound scan will be carried out for prediction of
      intrapartal events and perinatal outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus. Additionally,
      researchers will assess the relationship between the cerebro-placental ratio (CPR) and
      intrapartum and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by different types of Diabetes
      mellitus to determine if the CPR measured at 30 and 34 weeks of gestation is predictive of
      adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. At the end, investigators will evaluate the role of
      the addition of the UAPI to the CPR, alone or as CPUR [cerebro-placental-uterine ratio
      (CPUR)], in the improvement of the ability of CPR to predict APO at the end of pregnancy in
      any subgroup of diabetic patients. Finally, this project will enable precise intervention and
      resource saving as well as provide evidence for preventable targets development.
