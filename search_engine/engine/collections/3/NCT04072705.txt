      ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease, has been shown to have a superior antiplatelet
      effect compared to aspirin, and is therefore being administered to many patients with stroke
      and coronary artery disease. Clopidogrel inhibits platelet-derived ADP receptor, P2Y12, in
      the liver to produce an anti-platelet effect. It has been suggested that clopidogrel
      resistance could be occurred from drug-drug interaction via the same pharmacological
      metabolic pathway. Previous studies reported that the genotypes of Cytochrome P450 2C19,
      which is involved in the metabolism of clopidogrel in the liver, lead to differences in drug
      response and recurrence rates of cardiovascular disease. The risk of recurrence of ischemic
      stroke was reported to be about 4 times higher in patients with a poor metabolizer or
      intermediate metabolizer genotype of the Cytochrome P450 2C19 genotype compared to the
      extensive metabolizer genotype. This genotypes of Cytochrome P450 2C19 were also different
      according to race.

      The researches about cytochrome P450 2C19 genotype and clopidogrel resistance have been
      conducted mainly in patients with coronary artery disease and are not known in stroke
      patients. Few studies have examined whether the resistance of clopidogrel according to the
      genotype of cytochrome P450 2C19 in stroke patients is related to the occurrence and/or
      recurrence of cardiovascular disease. The hypothesis of this study is that "the poor
      metabolizer or intermediate metabolizer of the cytochrome P450 2C19 genotype in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and
      mortality compared to those who of extensive metabolizer of the cytochrome P450 2C19
      genotype".
