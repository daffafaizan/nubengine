      Center, a 684-bed academic teaching hospital that serves as the referral center for a
      population of approximately 800,000 people living in Western Massachusetts.

      The responsibility of the ambulation orderly is to walk patients after having a cardiac
      surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass surgery or a valve replacement or repair. Patients
      will be randomized to receive visits from the ambulation orderly (ambulation group) or to
      receive the standard care of Baystate Medical Center (control group). The standard of care
      will be nurse-directed ambulation, as is currently done in all other nursing floors at
      Baystate Medical Center. Nurses will be instructed to walk with the patients as they did
      before the initiation of the ambulation orderly and as they do when the orderly is on
      vacation, at conferences, training, or away for illness.
