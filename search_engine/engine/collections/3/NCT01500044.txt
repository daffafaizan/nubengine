    
      Cervical radiculopathy is a common form of neck pain and has been shown to lead to severe
      disability. Clinical rehabilitation approaches for cervical radiculopathies commonly include
      exercise and manual therapy interventions targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen but
      evidence regarding their effectiveness is scarce.

      This double-blind randomised clinical trial will allow the comparison, in terms of pain and
      disability, of patients presenting a cervical radiculopathy which will have been randomly
      assigned to one of the two intervention groups: the first group (n = 18) will receive a
      4-week rehabilitation program targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen, the second
      group (n = 18) will receive a 4-week conventional rehabilitation program. Participants will
      be evaluated on three separate occasions: at baseline (week 0), at the end of the 4-week
      program (week 4), and four weeks following the end of the program (week 8).
