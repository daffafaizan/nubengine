      effectively counteract depressed mood or anxiety, several studies suggest that they may
      reduce the symptoms irritability and anger more rapidly. In line with this, SRIs have been
      shown to reduce certain symptoms, including irritability, in women with premenstrual
      dysphoric disorder (PMDD) when the drug only is administered from ovulation to menstruation
      only, which indicates an onset of action of 10 days or less. How fast this effect appears in
      terms of hours or days is, however, not known. The objective of this study was to explore
      this issue.
