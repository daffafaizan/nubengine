    
      Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease consisting of
      oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet storage pool defect and, in some patients, lysosomal
      accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin. Other manifestations include pulmonary fibrosis (often
      fatal in the fourth or fifth decade), chronic granulomatous colitis and, rarely, renal
      involvement or cardiomyopathy. There exist 10 different genes known to cause HPS, but only
      HPS-2 and HPS-10 have a basic defect whose mechanism is known, i.e., defective subunits of a
      coat protein, adaptor complex-3, responsible for intracellular vesicle formation. HPS-1 is a
      severe genetic type common in northwest Puerto Rico, and HPS-3 is a milder one seen in
      central Puerto Rico. HPS-4 resembles HPS-1 in severity; HPS-5 and HPS-6 resemble HPS-3 in
      severity. HPS-7, HPS-8, and HPS-9 are extremely rare and have not been fully characterized.
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate individuals with HPS, perform mutation analysis
      for known HPS-causing genes, search for variants in other genes responsible for HPS, and
      obtain specimens to analyze basic mechanisms of HPS.
