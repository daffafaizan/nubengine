    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the 2-year second-event-free survival after vincristine (VCR) and dactinomycin
           (DACT) with or without doxorubicin (DOX), depending on the site of relapse and presence
           of microscopic residual disease, in children with relapsed Wilm's tumor previously
           treated with nephrectomy alone as initial therapy.

        -  Determine whether the 2-year second-event-free survival after intensive doxorubicin,
           etoposide (VP-16), cyclophosphamide (CTX), and carboplatin (CBDCA) plus radiotherapy to
           residual disease is at least 40% higher in patients with relapsed Wilm's tumor
           previously treated with Regimen EE-4A as initial therapy and without loss of
           heterozygosity for chromosomes 16q and 1p and increased DNA content in tumor cells than
           for similarly treated patients with loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 16q or 1p or
           increased DNA content in tumor cells.

        -  Determine whether the 4-year post-relapse survival after intensive VP-16, CTX, and CBDCA
           is at least 40% higher in patients with relapsed Wilm's tumor previously treated with
           Regimen DD-4A as initial therapy and without loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 16q
           and 1p and increased DNA content in tumor cells than for similarly treated patients with
           loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 16q or 1p or increased DNA content in tumor cells.

        -  Determine whether the rates of complete and partial response exceed 20% in patients with
           relapsed clear cell sarcoma of the kidney or diffuse anaplastic Wilms' tumor treated
           with CBDCA combined with VP-16.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are assigned to a treatment group based on initial therapy and histology. Patients
      under age 2 at diagnosis who were previously treated with nephrectomy as initial therapy for
      stage I favorable histology Wilms' tumor weighing less than 550 grams are assigned to group
      A. Patients who received Regimen EE-4A as initial therapy for Wilms' tumor are assigned to
      group B. Patients who received Regimen DD-4A as initial therapy for Wilms' tumor are assigned
      to group C. Patients with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney or diffuse anaplastic Wilms' tumor
      are assigned to group D.

      Group A

        -  Treatment is determined by site of relapse and the presence of microscopic or gross
           residual disease after attempted resection of relapsed disease. Children with suspected
           intra-abdominal recurrence undergo exploratory surgery to determine the site of
           recurrence and to obtain tissue for microscopic examination. Patients with stage I
           disease after recurrence are treated with regimen EE-4A. Patients with stage II or III
           disease are treated with regimen DD-4A.

             -  Regimen EE-4A: Patients receive dactinomycin (DACT) IV on weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
                and 18 and vincristine (VCR) IV on weeks 1-10, 12, 15, and 18 in the absence of
                disease progression.

             -  Regimen DD-4A: Patients receive DACT IV on weeks 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24; VCR IV
                weekly on weeks 1-10, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24; doxorubicin (DOX) IV on weeks 3, 9,
                15, and 21; and abdominal radiotherapy in the absence of disease progression.

      Group B

        -  Patients undergo resection. After resection, patients receive regimen I comprising DOX
           IV on weeks 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24; VCR IV on weeks 1, 2, 4, 5-8, 10-13, 18, and 24;
           cyclophosphamide (CTX) IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 and on days
           1-5 of weeks 3, 9, 15, and 21; and etoposide (VP-16) IV over 1 hour (after CTX infusion)
           on days 1-5 of weeks 3, 9, 15, and 21 in the absence of disease progression. Filgrastim
           (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after completion of
           chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients undergo radiotherapy to
           site of recurrence beginning within 1 week after initiation of chemotherapy.

      Group C

        -  Induction: Patients receive CTX IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 of weeks 0 and 3; VP-16 IV
           over 1 hour (after CTX infusion) on days 1-5 of weeks of 0 and 3 and on days 1-3 of
           weeks 6 and 9; and carboplatin (CBDCA) IV over 6 hours on days 1 and 2 of weeks 6 and 9
           in the absence of disease progression. G-CSF is administered SC beginning 24 hours after
           completion of CTX/VP-16 or CBDCA/VP-16 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Surgery: Patients with detectable disease undergo resection on week 13. If complete
           resection is not achieved or if it is deemed impossible, resection must be attempted no
           later than 3 weeks after consolidation radiotherapy.

        -  Consolidation: Beginning within 9 days of surgery, patients receive CTX IV over 1 hour
           on days 1-5 of week 1; VP-16 IV over 1 hour (after CTX infusion) on days 1-5 of week 1
           and on days 1-3 of week 4; CBDCA IV over 6 hours on days 1 and 2 of week 4; G-CSF as in
           induction; and radiotherapy in the absence of disease progression. Patients with
           complete or partial response after resection and/or radiotherapy proceed to maintenance
           therapy.

        -  Maintenance: Patients receive CTX IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 of weeks 0 and 3; VP-16 IV
           over 1 hour on days 1-5 of weeks 0 and 3 and on days 1-3 of weeks 6 and 9; CBDCA IV over
           6 hours on days 1 and 2 of weeks 6 and 9; and G-CSF as in induction. Treatment continues
           every 12 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.

      Group D

        -  Patients receive CBDCA IV over 6 hours on days 1 and 2 and VP-16 IV over 1 hour (after
           CBDCA infusion) on days 1-3 of weeks 0 and 3. Treatment continues weekly for 6 courses
           in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 15 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then
      annually for 3 years.
