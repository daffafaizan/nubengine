    
      Thirty patients will be enrolled and followed for 1 year after their inclusion.

      Cardiac MRI will be performed at inclusion and at 3 months and 12 months. At the same
      periods, echocardiography and right heart catheterization will be performed too.

      Morphological and functional parameters will be studied with MRI and correlated to invasive
      parameters and echocardiography too.

      Morphological parameters are: volumes, cardiac cavities areas and ratios and position of the
      interventricular septum. Functional parameters are: ejection fractions of right and left
      cavities, flow in pulmonary artery, across mitral and tricuspid valves, temporal measurements
      in the pulmonary artery and auriculoventricular valves.

      The invasive measurements are considered as the gold standard for this study. The
      classification of the severity is defined according to the parameters from right cardiac
      catheterization (4 grades with severity increasing between 1 and 4).
