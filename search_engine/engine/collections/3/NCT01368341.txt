      Norwegian general practice. Every patient receives 14 days of antibiotic treatment. There are
      blood samples for measurement of Borrelia antibody level at day 1, 14 and 90 and
      questionnaires on subjective health complaints (SHC) at day 1, 90 and 360. Side symptoms and
      side effects are registered. For volunteers there is an additional PCR-analysis on punch
      biopsy from the EM for subgrouping of the Borrelia bacteria. TBE-antibodies are measured on
      day 14. Antibody levels and SHC-scores are compared to healthy blood donors.
