      with advanced gastric cancer: the combination of fluorouracil plus hydroxyurea given as high
      dose 24 hour infusions plus interferon alfa-2a and filgrastim; versus the combination of
      doxorubicin and docetaxel. II. Evaluate the toxicities and reversibility of toxicities of
      each of these combinations in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, two arm, multicenter, randomized study. Arm I: Patients
      receive fluorouracil (5-FU), recombinant alfa-2a interferon, hydroxyurea (HU), and filgrastim
      (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF). 5-FU is administered by 24 hour infusion on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 (weeks 1-6). Recombinant alfa-2a interferon is administered
      subcutaneously immediately before beginning the 5-FU infusion, then three times a week for 6
      weeks. HU is administered by 24 hour infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 (weeks 1-6).
      G-CSF is administered subcutaneously on days 3, 4, 5, and 6 on weeks 1-6. Weeks 7 and 8 are
      rest periods. Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin administered by slow IV push followed (30
      minutes after infusion) by docetaxel as a 1 hour IV infusion. Treatment is repeated every 21
      days. All patients are assessed monthly during study and continue study treatment as long as
      no disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for years 2-5, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 26 patients (13 in each arm) and a maximum of 80 patients (40
      in each arm) will be accrued in this study in approximately 2 years.
