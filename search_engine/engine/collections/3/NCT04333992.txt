      aged 18-65 years for shoulder arthroplasty were enrolled in this prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded study.

      Patients were assigned to one of two groups : group PR, the propofol-remifentanil group; and
      group SR, the sevoflurane-remifentanil group.

      In the group PR, anesthetic induction was achieved with an initial target concentration of
      propofol 4 ㎍/mL and remifentanil 3-4 ng/mL using target controlled infusion (TCI) devices and
      rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg. After intubation, anesthesia was maintained with fixed target
      concentration of propofol 2-4 ㎍/mL and remifentanil 2-3 ng/mL to keep acceptable hemodynamic
      response and bispectral index (BIS) values 40-60.

      In the group SR, anesthetic induction was achieved with thiopental 5 mg/kg and initial target
      concentration of remifentanil 3-4 ng/mL using TCI and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg. Anesthesia was
      maintained with 1.5-2.5% end-tidal concentration sevoflurane in 50% oxygen with air and
      remifentanil 2-3 ng/mL was continuously infused adjusting to maintain an acceptable
      hemodynamics and BIS values 40-60.

      The administration of propofol or sevoflurane with remifentanil was stopped at the surgery
      ended.

      Postoperative pain intensity was assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS: 0; no pain,
      10; worst pain) at the 30 min, 2, 6, 12, 24 h. Also, the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
      was infused immediately after post anesthetic care unit arrival. The PCA device was set to
      deliver 0.38 ㎍/kg/h of fentanyl as a basal infusion rate and 20 ㎍ on demand with a 15 min
      lockout time. The total PCA volume, number of patients to need rescue analgesics was
      recorded.
