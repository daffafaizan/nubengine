    
      This study is designed as a multi-center, randomized, open-label, 2-arm parallel study of
      AVT02 administered via a PFS either manually via an autoinjector, in healthy adult subjects.

      A total of 204 subjects will be recruited into this study and will be randomly assigned with
      a ratio of 1:1 to receive either AVT02 manually or via autoinjector. As the study is
      open-label, both the site staff and the subjects themselves will know which treatments are
      being administered.

      The study consists of a screening period, admission and treatment period, assessment period
      and end of study (EOS) visit. Subjects will undertake a screening visit between Day -28 and
      Day -1 to determine eligibility in the study. Those subjects that meet the eligibility
      criteria will be admitted to the study site on the evening prior to dosing (Day -1) when
      continued eligibility will be assessed.

      On Day 1 prior to dosing, baseline assessments will be performed. Subjects will then be dosed
      according to the randomization schedule. Following dosing, PK, safety, tolerability and
      immunogenicity assessments will be performed according to the study schedule (Table 6).
      Subjects will remain confined to the study site from Day -1 to Day 3 (48 hours post-dose).
      Subjects will return to the study site on Day 4, Day 5, Day 6, Day 7, Day 8, Day 9, Day 12,
      Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 36, Day 43, Day 50 and Day 57.

      An EOS visit will occur at study Day 64 for final study assessments. The EOS visit will also
      be the early termination visit if required (to be completed within 7 days of early
      termination wherever possible).
