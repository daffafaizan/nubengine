      years for the treatment of depression. Meta-analysis of individual patient data indicates
      that tDCS results in improvement in depressive symptoms, with efficacy comparable to
      antidepressant medications and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), while
      tDCS offers advantages over other treatments, including side effect profile, cost, and
      portability. tDCS has been employed to a more limited extent in children and adolescents for
      psychiatric conditions other than depression, as well as in both adults and children with
      epilepsy, with excellent tolerability and a mild adverse effect profile. The proposed
      protocol aims to extend the use of tDCS for treatment of depression in children with epilepsy
      (CWE), a population with a very high prevalence of depression and a significant need for
      additional treatment options, particularly nonpharmacologic treatments, due to challenges
      with the use of antidepressant medications and other non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)
      techniques in CWE.
