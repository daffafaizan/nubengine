      treatments for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The efficacy of them, however, drops
      below baseline level after 9 months. Should Chinese herbal medicine make add-on benefit? The
      GRAPE formula was designed by Prof. J Tian, a prepared granules of Chinese herbs, according
      to Qifuyin in Jing Yue Quan Shu (published in A.D. 1624). Patients treated with CT+herbal
      therapy or CT alone for up to and over 12 months are collected. Cognition, activities of
      daily living and behavioral symptoms are selected as outcomes for assessing the
      effectiveness.
