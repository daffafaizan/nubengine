      Depersonalization symptoms may occasionally arise (30 to 70% of the population) or may become
      chronic in depersonalization disorder. Its prevalence is around 2.4% in the general
      population. This disorder is particularly resistant to pharmacological treatments. This study
      is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, and the investigators are testing
      the therapeutic efficacy of neuronavigated repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
      of right angular gyrus in patients with depersonalization disorder.
