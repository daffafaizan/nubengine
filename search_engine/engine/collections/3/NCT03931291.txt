    
      A multi-center, open label, Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of
      APR-246 in combination with azacitidine as maintenance therapy after allogeneic HSCT for
      patients with TP53 mutant AML or MDS.

      Patients will be prescreened for TP53 mutant AML or MDS before they have a HSCT. In order to
      proceed with APR-246 and azacitidine treatment, engraftment must be confirmed between Day 30
      to Day 100 post-HSCT.

      APR-246 will be administered on Days 1-4, with azacitidine on Days 1-5, of every 28 day
      cycle. Patients may receive a maximum of 12 cycles.
