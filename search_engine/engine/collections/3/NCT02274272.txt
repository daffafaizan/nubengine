      insulin sensitivity by reducing inflammation.

      Objective ： The objective of this study was to determine the effects of supplementation with
      the probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri ADR-1(ADR-1) and Lactobacillus reuteri GMNL-263
      (GMNL-263) over six months on metabolic profiles, intestinal microbiota profiles and
      biomarkers of inflammation in type 2 diabetes patents. Methods ： This randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 120 diabetic patients. Subjects were
      divided into 3 groups: 40 subjects in the group A received placebo, 40 subjects in the group
      B received ADR-1 (4 x 109 colony-forming units/d), and 40 subjects in the group C received
      GMNL-263. (2 x 1010 cells/d) for 6 months. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and
      after intervention to measure metabolic profiles and biomarkers of inflammation including C
      reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha( TNF-α). The
      intestinal microbiota profiles were detected in stool samples by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR).
