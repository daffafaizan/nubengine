    
      Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-deficient RCC) is a rare subtype of RCC
      characterized by germline/somatic mutation of the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene, and is an
      extremely aggressive tumor, with a propensity to disseminate early even in the setting of a
      small primary tumor.

      Loss-of-function mutation of FH results in the accumulation of fumarate, impairment of
      oxidative phosphorylation, alteration of the metabolic state, and stabilization of
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î±, thus activating angiogenic and oxidative stress response
      pathways. Unlike the robust response of clear cell RCC (ccRCC) to antiangiogenic agents,
      blocking the antiangiogenic pathway does not lead to better outcomes in FH-deficient RCC.
      Anti-mTOR agents are also ineffective.

      Although the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends the
      combination of bevacizumab plus erlotinib or everolimus for metastatic FH-deficient RCC,
      high-level evidence for standardized systematic therapy remains scarce.

      In the present study, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy and safety of
      immunotherapy with Sintilimab as second-line treatment in FH-deficient RCC, and to explore
      potential biomarkers related to the treatment efficacy by means of detection, including but
      not limited to the next-generation sequencing, flow cytometry, etc.
