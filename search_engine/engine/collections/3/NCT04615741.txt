      use interventions and RCT for online delivery, COVID-19 impacts, and province-wide spread.
      The second objective is to test if an online group body-oriented intervention
      (trauma-sensitive yoga) that has been designed to increase awareness of physical sensations,
      is superior to an online group verbal narrative intervention (mental wellness talking
      circle), and to control group. The investigators theorize that the body-oriented intervention
      may offer the opportunity to reprogram automatic physiologic hyperarousal in response to
      COVID-19 triggers and increase positive body awareness, and mindful attention to the ways in
      which habitual self-protective behaviours like substance use may be impacting health. The
      third objective is to examine the impacts of the interventions on adults with pre-existing
      MHSU issues, and those with previous experiences that may make them more susceptible to MHSU
      problems during COVID-19. The investigators will track other supports the participants engage
      during the study and the perceived impacts of these supports on the outcomes with the goal of
      shedding light on how to best match COVID-19 related services to adults who need them the
      most.
