    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two groups, an Internet-delivered
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) experimental group (Breathe) and a resource webpage
      (control group; considered treatment as usual for youth waiting for services). The
      investigators will evaluate several methodological processes and outcomes through the
      following objectives:

        1. To determine the effectiveness of a self-guided Internet-based CBT program with limited
           telephone and email support in reducing anxiety symptoms among adolescents with
           mild-to-moderate anxiety as compared to a usual self-help intervention, a resource-based
           webpage.

        2. To explore mediators and moderators of the Internet-based CBT program.

        3. To determine the effectiveness of a self-guided Internet-based CBT program in improving
           quality of life as compared to a usual self-help intervention.

        4. To determine adherence to a self-guided Internet-based CBT program.

        5. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the Internet-based CBT program.
