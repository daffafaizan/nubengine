      order to finalise the electronic questionnaire. The enrollment phase will involve the
      administration of the final web-based questionnaires to the subjects included in the
      enrollment phase.

      The data generated in this study will be useful to inform parents of newborns about the
      advantages of vaccinating people who are in close contact with the newborn even before the
      baby is born in order to prevent the transmission of pertussis to the newborn.

      No vaccine will be administered during this study.
