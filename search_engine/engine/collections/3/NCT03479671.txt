      (Intralipid/heparin) will cause mild insulin resistance. This dose-finding study is critical
      for future studies on free-fatty acid induced insulin resistance.

      Healthy male and healthy female volunteers will undergo a 6 hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
      clamp, in order to establish insulin sensitivity parameters in the presence of fatty acid
      co-infusion. The subjects will then return 1-3 weeks later, and undergo another 6 hour HIE
      clamp, this time in the presence of low-dose fatty acid co-infusion (30ml/hr). If this dose
      does not achieve ~25% reduction in the rate of glucose disposal, then the dose-confirmation
      study will be repeated 1-3 weeks later with a medium-dose fatty acid co-infusion (60ml/hr).

      A dose-response effect of fatty acids on insulin resistance has been demonstrated before, but
      not in the precise conditions of our study. This dose-finding study is critical because
      future studies require a reliable dose of fatty acid infusion, and the exact dose of fatty
      acid infusion that causes mild insulin resistance may be different in the conditions of our
      study.
