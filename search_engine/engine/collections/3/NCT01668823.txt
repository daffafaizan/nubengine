      I. To determine maximally tolerated light dose (MTID). Identify systemic and normal tissue
      toxicity using 2-[hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) for photodynamic therapy
      in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) or microinvasive carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study tumor response in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) or
      bronchogenic microinvasive carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Patients then photodynamic
      therapy with laser light on day 3. Patients also undergo therapeutic bronchoscopy for
      endoscopic debridement on day 5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and
      then periodically for at least 2 years.
