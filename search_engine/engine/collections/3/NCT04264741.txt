      recruited patients will be randomized assigned to the intervention group and the control
      group, receiving either 4-week of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      treatment or 4-week of sham rTMS treatment. Both groups will receive 16-week urine drug test
      (1 time per week, 4 weeks before rTMS, 4 weeks during rTMS and 8 weeks after rTMS). Negative
      rate of urine test for methamphetamine is set as primary outcome. Cognitive function and
      craving are also evaluated before and after the intervention. Functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) is applied to investigate the potential neurobiological mechanism of rTMS
      treatment. This study will be very helpful to develop an evidence-based rTMS treatment
      protocols for methadone maintenance therapy with methamphetamine abuse and decrease risk of
      relapse for both the patients and their families.
