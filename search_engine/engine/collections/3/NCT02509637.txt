      session of control, breathing exercises with flutter valve, that is a device that produces
      oscillation and positive pressure during the expiratory phase, or chest compression, that is
      a manual manoeuvre in the right and left sides of the lower chest, all of them in a sitting
      position. The main outcome will be obtained by impulse oscillometry, that is a method to
      access large and small airways, to evaluate the resistance (R), reactance (X), reactance area
      (AX) and resonant frequency (Fres) of respiratory system for the whole breath and for
      inspiratory and expiratory phase. Additionally, will be analysed the dyspnea using the
      Medical Research Council scale; acceptability and tolerability scale; pulse oxymetry;
      difficulty of expectoration score; and volume, adhesivity and purulence of sputum.
