      prolongation. However, in doing so, patients and families may avoid advance care planning;
      they do not discuss specific goals and wishes should disease progress despite surgery.
      Moreover, a subset of patients become critically ill following surgery, and family members
      must make life-and-death decisions without knowing patient wishes. Preoperative advance care
      planning-facilitating patient and family discussions concerning perioperative goals, hopes,
      and fears-could empower patients and families to better choose which therapies and procedures
      they want outside of the initial surgery and for the months following surgery. Advance care
      planning aids exist, but none were developed for or evaluated in a surgical patient
      population. Furthermore, video-based advance care planning tools are an innovative way to
      better empower patients and families. Previous research shows that, with the aid of an
      advance care planning video, patients and families are more knowledgeable about treatment
      options and more comfortable with making decisions. Moreover, when better educated, these
      patients and families frequently choose less aggressive therapies.

      However, video-based advance care planning tools have not been developed or tested in a
      surgical patient population. The investigators have developed and now will evaluate a
      video-based advance care planning aid for cancer patients and families pursing aggressive
      surgical cancer treatment. The investigators hypothesize that, in patients and family
      members, the video-based decision aid will facilitate better preoperative discussions about
      advance care planning between the patient and surgeon and decrease anxiety and depression
      after surgery.
