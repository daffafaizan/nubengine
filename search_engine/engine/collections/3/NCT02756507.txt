      Relationship between cognitive distortions/irrational beliefs and emotions, Cognitive
      restructuring, Exposure/ behavioral activation and problem solving, Maintenance of gainings.

      target vulnerable groups. Technology components added to traditional programs may lead to
      greater motivation and satisfaction with treatment.

      Adolescents will complete assessments at four time-points: T1 (baseline), T2
