      presence of tumors. Its appearance is a predictor of worse prognosis in the evolution of
      malignant neoplasm and reduces the quality of life of patients.

      The use of prostheses with drainage to the gastric cavity has shown good clinical results as
      the reduction of paracentesis evacuation needs. This achieves the reduction of hospital
      admissions and the improvement of the quality of life of the patient.

      In order to verify the usefulness of this drainage technique, a prospective observational
      study has been designed. Patients with cancer over 18 years of age will be included, with a
      life expectancy of less than 6 months and who have undergone drainage of refractory malignant
      ascites through the implantation of plastic prostheses.

      Participants receive the intervention in the same manner and intensity if they are not
      enrolled in the study.
