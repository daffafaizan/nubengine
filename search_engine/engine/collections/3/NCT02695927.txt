      space. Patients suffering right cerebral hemispheric damage from stroke or traumatic brain
      injury frequently suffer neglect and will ignore all information located in the left side of
      space. Currently there is no effective rehabilitation technique to treat neglect and many of
      these patients have severe long-term disability. The goal of this project is to determine
      whether a prototypical pair of rehabilitation glasses can reduce the symptoms of hemispatial
      neglect.
