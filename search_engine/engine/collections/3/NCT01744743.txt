      pregnancy outcome, offspring cognitive ability. Negro's study found improved maternal health
      in those screened in early trimester; while Lazarus et al. reported no significant offspring
      IQ score at 3yrs in universal screening in early trimester. Currently, it lacks evidence of
      universal pre-conception screening for maternal pregnancy outcome and offspring cognitive
      development, motivation ability, attention. China Governmental Health Department has included
      thyroid function screening into preconception in 2011. The investigators hypothesize that
      pre-conception effective treatment may be helpful for decrease possible negative effects on
      maternal and offspring health, instead of early trimester.
