    
      Background: Perioperative usage of immunonutrition can attenuate the pro-inflammatory
      cytokines and reduce postoperative infectious complications and length of hospital stay after
      major upper gastrointestinal surgery. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of
      immunomodulating diets, ANOM®, on surgical outcome in elective major upper gastrointestinal
      tract operations.

      Material and Methods:

      Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Participants: Seventy upper
      gastrointestinal tract cancer patients planned to undergo major upper gastrointestinal
      surgery in eesophagus、stomach、pancreas or duodenum, Interventions: Patients will be divided
      randomly into two groups to receive ANOM® or standard diet. Before surgery, 800ml ANOM® or
      standard diet (SEN) will be given for 5 days by mouth. After operation, 5% Distill water
      (D5W) combined with ANOM® or standard diet since the 2nd post-operation day (POD2) until day
      14 (POD14) or until discharged day by enteric route using nasogastric tube(NG) tube or
      jejunostomy. Postoperative parenteral nutrition will be given to maintain adequate nutrition.

      Clinical Assessment: The preoperative and postoperative immunological parameters, infection
      complications, and hospital stay will be compared.
