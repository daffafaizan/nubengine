    
      This study consists of Screening, Treatment Period, and Follow-up. The Treatment Period is
      subdivided into three periods (Periods 1 to 3). Screening will start within 4 weeks before
      starting Treatment Period 1. In Treatment Periods 1 and 2, one E2022 tape will be applied to
      the designated site. The Treatment Period 2 application must have at least a 17-day interval
      from the end of Treatment Period 1 application. In Treatment Period 3, E2022 tape will be
      applied to back site (contralateral to the first applied site during Treatment Periods 1 and
      2) after at least 17 days from the end of Treatment Period 2 (removing). A new E2022 tape
      will be applied to the same site after the specified intervals from the end of previous
      application (removing) in each group. Follow-up will start after at least a 17-day interval
      from the end of re-application in the Treatment Period 3 (removing).
