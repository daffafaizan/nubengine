      to hormonal therapy, and some may develop acquired resistance to the therapy after initial
      treatment. Hypoxia is a normal phenomenon in solid tumors that arises, in part, from
      uncontrolled proliferation and immature blood vessels. Previous studies have demonstrated
      hypoxia significantly reduced both the growth-promoting effects of estradiol (E2) and the
      growth-inhibitory effects of an antiestrogen on ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. A
      recent study comparing neoadjuvant letrozole with letrozole plus metronomic cyclophosphamide
      found that increased levels of HIF-1a were significantly associated with resistance to
      treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that hypoxia might be associated with
      endocrine resistance in breast cancer.

      With PET/CT, radiolabeled hypoxia-avid compounds can be applied to evaluate oxygenation
      status in experimental or human tumors. 18F-labeled fluoromisonidazole (1-[2-nitro-
      1-imidazolyl]-2-hydroxy-3-fluoropropane [18F-FMISO]) PET/CT is the most widely used one in
      the clinic. Studies have demonstrated an excellent correlation between the 18F-FMISO uptake
      and oxygenation status of several cancers including breast cancer.

      The major aim of our study was to analyze uptake of 18FFMISO as well as the IHC expression of
      HIF-1-alpha in ER-positive breast cancers, and to predict the clinical, pathological and
      biological response of primary endocrine therapy.
