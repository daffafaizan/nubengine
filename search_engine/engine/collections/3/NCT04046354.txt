      need for general anesthesia, less trauma for patients, and more reliable efficacy.Currently,
      it mainly includes percutaneous anhydrous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation and
      microwave ablation for the treatment of thyroid nodules.Currently, radiofrequency ablation
      and microwave ablation are mainly used to treat thyroid nodules.

      This study was a randomized, parallel, positive control, and non-inferiority multicenter
      clinical study.Radiofrequency ablation was used as the positive control.Follow-up was
      conducted at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after ablation. The primary endpoint was the rate of
      nodule volume reduction at 12 months after surgery.
