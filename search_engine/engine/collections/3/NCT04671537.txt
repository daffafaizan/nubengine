      care practice are important goals of anesthesiologist. It is known that hypotension that
      develops after taking patients to the beach chair position has a negative effect on cerebral
      oxygenation. Aggressive fluid regimes using to prevent hypotension can cause glycocalyx
      damage, edema and organ dysfunction. Also hypertension seconday to vasopressor therapy can
      cause bleeding at the surgical site and impaired surgical visualization during the
      arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

      In the literature, there are studies examine whether the hypotension is the result of
      decreased cardiac output or decreased systemic resistance and what should be the optimal
      treatment , but as far as investigators know, there is no study about effects of preloading
      before the beach chair position on hemodynamic parameters.
