      situation, especially the associated with cardiovascular outcomes and psychological diseases.
      HRV was also well known associated with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and
      could be improved after adequate treatments for OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) is the first choice of treatment for OSA and had been proved to able to improve HRV in
      OSA patients. However, the CPAP adherence is always problematic. Many CPAP predictors had
      been well documented but the HRV is never evaluated to be a potential predictor of CPAP
      adherence.

      Therefore, this study will evaluate the changes of HRV for polysomnography (PSG) night, for
      CPAP titration night to see if the changes of HRV in the CPAP titration night could predict
      CPAP adherence for OSA patients in Taiwan.
