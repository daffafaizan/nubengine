    
      Objective: to evaluate the acute effects of talampanel, a novel antagonist of AMPA type
      glutamate receptors, on the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor
      response complications.

      Study Population: patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease and dopaminergic
      therapy related motor complications, between the age of 21 and 80.

      Study Design: randomized, controlled, proof-of-principle pilot study lasting approximately 7
      weeks.

      Study Outcome Parameters: the pharmacokinetic characteristics of orally administered
      talampanel will be measured by means of plasma drug assays, its therapeutic efficacy will be
      evaluated using validated motor function scales, and safety will be monitored by means of
      frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
