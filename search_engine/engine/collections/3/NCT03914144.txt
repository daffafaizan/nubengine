      Is the intrapartum use of a catheter - either intermittent or indwelling - associated with an
      increased incidence of postnatal bacteriuria when compared with women who are not
      catheterised?

      Method

      Pregnant women will be recruited at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital Maternity Department from
      37 weeks gestation. Once eligibility is met, they will be asked to provide a mid-stream urine
      sample which will be tested for microscopy, culture and sensitivity (MC&S). They will be
      analysed according to their mode of delivery. Their notes will be scrutinised to assess
      whether or not a catheter was sited during their labour. Postnatally, they will be asked to
      provide an MSU on day 3 and day 28, which will both be sent for MC&S. A comparative analysis
      between each MSU will be performed and correlated to whether intrapartum catheterisation was
      undertaken.

      Data Collection & Analysis

      The data collection phase will take approximately three months, with data analysis and
      write-up estimated to take a further one-two months.
