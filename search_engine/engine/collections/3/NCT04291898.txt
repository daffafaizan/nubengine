      Occluder (ASO). Two new devices that entered the Canadian market are the Gore Cardioform ASD
      occluder (GAO) and the Figulla Flexible II Occlutech (FSO) device. There exists a paucity of
      data on the comparative efficacy and safety of these devices. This is a proposal, for the
      first time in Canada, to examine the comparative effectiveness of three commercially
      available ASD devices in an internal pilot randomized trial.

      Approximately 60 patients referred for transcatheter ASD closure will be recruited in this
      study over a period of 15 months from 4 participating centers across Canada. This will be a
      registry-based randomized controlled trial (RRCT) where patients will be enrolled into one of
      three arms (ASO, FSO, and GAO/GSO) to compare the effectiveness and safety outcomes of three
      different ASD closure devices.
