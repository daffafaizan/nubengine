      know its utility in infants and children population, nor in specific pathologies as non
      synostotic plagiocephaly.

      In the conservative treatment of plagiocephaly the educational physiotherapy and the helmet
      therapy have the better level of evidence among other treatments. When babies present
      preferential position of the head or Congenital Muscular Torticollis, stretching has shown
      efficacy.

      A protocol of ten sessions of Pediatric Manual Therapy will be applied to infants with
      positional plagiocephaly in combination with educational physiotherapy. The protocol consists
      in soft cervical mobilisation, myofascial induction and the application of some pressures to
      the cranial bones to improve the asymmetry of the head. Educational therapy which consists in
      more "tummy time" stimulation, stimulation to the non preference position of the head and
      counter positioning. The control group will receive a protocol of stretching at home done by
      their parents and Educational therapy.
