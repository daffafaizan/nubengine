    
      Context: Sleep loss is associated with increased blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      C-reactive protein (CRP). Medical residents are often deprived of normal sleep during
      extended work shifts, but the effects of work-related sleep loss on biomarkers of vascular
      inflammation and function are unknown.

      Objective: We sought to test the hypothesis that sleep loss during extended work shifts
      during medical training is associated with increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory
      biomarkers and evidence of vascular dysfunction.

      Design: Outcome measures were assessed after extended 30-hour work shifts and non-extended
      6-hour work shifts in a single-blind, randomized crossover design.

      Setting: University hospital medical intensive care unit

      Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-two healthy medical residents were studied during a
      medical intensive care unit rotation.

      Main Outcome Measure(s): Sleep related cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor),
      serum markers of vascular inflammation (C-reactive protein), and flow-mediated dilation in
      the brachial artery.
