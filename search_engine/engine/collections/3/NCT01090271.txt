      syndrome (SIS) presents alterations in several parameters, as for example, in scapular and
      glenohumeral kinematics, the strengthening of the shoulder abductors as an intervention
      strategy is controversial in literature.

      Strength training has been shown to be effective in reducing the fluctuations in force and
      had a positive effect on isometric steadiness in old adults and in healthy young subjects
      during bed rest. However, there are no studies that evaluated the effects of strength
      training on the force steadiness in subjects with SIS.
