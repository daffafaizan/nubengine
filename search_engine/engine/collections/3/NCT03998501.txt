      to 1) demonstrate neurophysiological evidence (using fMRI) of preventive CBTm classes for
      PTSD, and 2) validate the utility of the proposed imaging-based biomarker for PTSD-related
      resiliency. Emerging evidence suggests that a program such as CBTm classes could promote
      resiliency to PTSD in healthy individuals at high risk for trauma exposure. Further, our
      preliminary brain imaging data analysis suggests that we can quantitate the brain
      connectivity pattern that may reflect resilience to PTSD. We thus hypothesize that CBTm will
      increase the PTSD resilience-related brain connectivity pattern expression.

      In this novel pilot imaging study, we will recruit 40 PSP without PTSD or other mental
      disorder from 120 participants participating in our larger clinical trial. Twenty will be
      from each arm (CBTm and wait-list). The effect of CBTm on fMRI-based measures will be
      compared between arms.
