      determinant of energy intake. However, to our knowledge, no clinical trials have previously
      been conducted which examine the efficacy of a food portion control tool to control caloric
      intake and thereby induce weight loss.

      Most cases of type 2 diabetes can be attributed directly to obesity. Dietary caloric
      restriction has been shown to improve glycemic control by virtue of weight loss, with an
      additional benefit independent of weight loss.

      Comparison: daily use of a food portion control tool plus usual care at a diabetes care
      center, compared to usual care alone.
