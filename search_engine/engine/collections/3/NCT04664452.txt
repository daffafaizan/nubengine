      professional and social media. The questionnaire will not include questions defining the
      responders individually. The questions are related to frequency of utilization of porcine
      derived products in surgery, surgeons' level of awareness about utilization of porcine
      products, surgeons' level of religiousity and surgeons' choices about porcine derived product
      utilization and consent of patients. After collection of responses the data will be analyzed
      to discover current status of porcine derived surgical product utilization and surgeons'
      perception about the issue. The anquette will be distributed worldwide to surgeons in
      different branches of surgery. Literature seems to be lacking of that kind of study
