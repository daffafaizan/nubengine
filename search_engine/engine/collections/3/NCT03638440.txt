    
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Naloxegol in a real world
      setting in cancer patients.

      The primary safety end point is the incidence of adverse events leading to study
      discontinuation.

      The primary efficacy end point is the response rate assessed in the 4 week observation
      period. Response is defined as three or more bowel movements (without the use of rescue
      laxative treatment in the previous 24 hours) per week and an increase of one or more bowel
      movements over baseline.
