      sides. Gonial angle was measured on Cone-beam computed tomography images as the angle between
      the tangent line drawn posterior to the border of the ramus of the mandible and the tangent
      line drawn to the lower border of the mandible. Determination of the submandibular fossa
      depth was made with a line was drawn to connect the most dislocated upper and lower points on
      the inner surface of the mandible in the coronal plane sections, and the length of the line
      drawn at a right angle from the deepest point of the fossa to this line. Measurements were
      made separately for left and right sides.
