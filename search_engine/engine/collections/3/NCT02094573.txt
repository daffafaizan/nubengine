      treat people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or were intolerant to crizotinib. This study looked at
      the efficacy of brigatinib.

      The study enrolled 222 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Brigatinib 90 mg

        -  Brigatinib 90 mg -180 mg

      All participants were asked to take a tablet, orally once daily until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicity. Participants in Brigatinib 90 mg - 180 mg received 180 mg with a 7-day
      lead-in at 90 mg.

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and 3 months
      after the End-of-Treatment visit. Follow-up is intended to continue for 2 years after the
      last participants was enrolled into the study.
