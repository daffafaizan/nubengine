      antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected men. The following regimens are compared:
      lopinavir-ritonavir + Combivir and lopinavir-ritonavir + nevirapine (nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI]-sparing). Prior to the start of therapy and 3, 12, 24, and 36
      months thereafter the distribution of body fat and bone density (bioelectrical impedance
      analysis [BIA], computed tomography [CT] and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]), lipid
      spectrum, mitochondrial DNA (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] and adipose tissue
      biopsies) and vascular measurements are performed. In addition, insulin sensitivity is
      measured in a subgroup of sixteen individuals by using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
      and performing microvascular measurements. The aim of the study is to obtain prospective
      insight into the occurrence of various aspects of metabolic adverse events on the one hand
      and to compare an NRTI-containing therapy with an NRTI-sparing therapy on the other hand. The
      hypothesis is that in the NRTI-sparing arm, less metabolic and vascular changes are observed
      than in the NRTI containing regimen.
