      complex pain syndrome including both peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms. In
      fact, patients with unilateral CTS exhibit bilateral widespread pressure hyperalgesia and
      bilateral pain hypersensitivity suggesting the presence of altered nociceptive gain
      processing. In addition, these sensitization processes seem to be independent of
      electro-diagnostic findings. Previous studies support the use of physical therapy and
      surgical interventions for the management of pain and disability in these patients. However,
      there is no evidence related to changes in nociceptive gain process after the application of
      any therapeutic intervention. Preliminary evidence suggests that manual therapies can
      modulate sensitization mechanisms. Therefore, our objective is to conduct a randomized
      clinical trial to determine if manual therapies including desensitization maneuvers of the
      central nervous system are effective to decrease widespread pressure pain and thermal pain
      hypersensitivity in women with CTS.
