life span and lymphoma-incidence of mice injected at birth with spleencells across a weak histocompatibility locus .newborn cogenic c h mice receiving injections across a weak (h-i h-i )histocompatibility barrier exhibited life-shortening and a highincidence of lymphomatous disease during mid-adult life . in controlexperiments (h-i h-i ) lymphomatous disease developed much later life .both mouse strains when not given injections as new-borns manifest onlya negligible incidence of lymphoma or leukemia . these findings arevariably interpretable in terms of oncogenic virology, and of theimmunologic theories of aging and cancer by analogy with transplantationdisease mechanisms .
