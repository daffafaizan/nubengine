    
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine which is
      seen in 1-3% of the adolescent population and mostly in girls. Lateral curvature in the
      frontal plane, axial rotation in the horizontal plane, and kyphosis and lordosis in the
      sagittal plane are observed. Etiology-related factors of AIS are genetic factors, abnormal
      neurophysiological functions occurring in the nervous system, hormones, metabolic
      dysfunction, abnormal skeletal development, biomedical factors, environmental and lifestyle
      factors.

      The vertical position is associated with cortical, subcortical and medullar integration, and
      postural control based on bodily input.

      Approaches as observation, patient education, scoliosis-specific physiotherapy exercises
      (PSSE), inpatient rehabilitation, electrical stimulation, manipulative applications and brace
      application are the conservative treatments of scoliosis. PSSE, which includes
      three-dimensional correction, daily life activities training, posture stabilization and
      patient education, is a method recommended by Society On Scoliosis Orthopaedic and
      Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) for the conservative treatment of scoliosis. The Schroth
      'method is one of the PSSE methods that use three-dimensional postural correction mechanisms.
      The main goal of the Schroth 'exercises is to reduce the asymmetric load on the spine by
      using posture variations specific to the patient's curvature. There are no studies i
      regarding the effect of PSSE on changing proprioceptive neural mechanisms evaluated in the
      etiopathogenesis of scoliosis.
