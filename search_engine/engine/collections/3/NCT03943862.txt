      a common strategy to minimize the risk of being labeled. Both secrecy and disclosure have
      pros and cons. The decision whether, when, and to whom to disclose a previous suicide attempt
      is complex. Interventions can provide guidance for systematic consideration and a well
      informed decision. Potentially, it may not be disclosure itself, but the empowered decision
      for or against disclosure of a previous suicide attempt that reduces distress and leads to
      beneficial outcomes.

      The manualized peer-led group intervention "Honest, Open, Proud" (HOP) supports people with
      mental illness in their decision whether to disclose mental illness. Research showed positive
      effects of the intervention on stigma stress, disclosure-related distress and quality of
      life. Based on HOP, "To Share Or Not To Share" (2Share) was developed to systematically guide
      suicide attempt survivors through their decision whether and how to disclose a previous
      suicide attempt.

      2Share led to significant reductions in self-stigma and depressive symptoms, as well as
      increased self-esteem in a recent pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in the US. The aim
      of the current study is to evaluate 2Share in a German clinical setting. Feasibility and
      efficacy of 2 Share will be tested in a pilot RCT.
