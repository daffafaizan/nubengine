      enrolled posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients were
      randomized to one of the three treatment regimens when they are diagnosed with the
      Dix-Hallpike test. An then the patient was treated with one of the three maneuvers. After 20
      minutes, the patient was examined with the Dix-Hallpike test again. The resolution of
      nystagmus and symptoms were checked. When the nystagmus was sustained, the same treatment was
      applied once again. And after 20 minutes, the patient was examined with the Dix-Hallpike test
      too. 1 day after and 7 days after, the patient was re-examined with the Dix-Hallpike test.
