      in one third of people living in assisted accommodation. Frail elderly with poor appetite are
      at risk for malnutrition. Rebecca Stratton et al have reviewed effects of oral nutritional
      supplements (ONS) in elderly hospital patients and key findings in hospital trials were that
      ONS can improve intakes of energy, protein and micronutrients without substantially reducing
      food intake which may lead to weight gain or attenuate weight loss.

      Calogen extra is a fat emulsion containing 400 kcal/100 ml, based on canola and sunflower-oil
      which has a good fat composition. Moreover it contains around 30 % of recommended
      micronutrients and 5g protein/100 ml. It has potentially positive effects on energy intake,
      fatty acid profile and constipation.

      The investigators have recently performed a clinical trial in geriatric patients in an
      acute-ward setting to evaluate the effects of a similar fat emulsion, Calogen, without
      micronutrients. The investigators could conclude that this fat emulsion based on MUFA and
      PUFA distributed three times daily at medication rounds may have positive effects on weight,
      appetite and serum lipids. Moreover the approach was well accepted by patients and nurses.
      The intervention period was very short (median 8 days) therefore the investigators plan to
      perform a study with a similar design, for a longer period of time, in a group of elderly
      living in old peoples home.
