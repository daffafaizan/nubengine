      reported in 20%-30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3-ITD-positive AML
      patients have an inferior survival, primarily due to lower complete remission (CR) rate and
      higher relapse rate. Our previous studies demonstrated that post-transplantation sorafenib
      maintenance could improve the outcomes of FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. However, whether
      other co-existing mutations influence the efficacy of post-allo-HSCT sorafenib maintenance
      remains unknown.
