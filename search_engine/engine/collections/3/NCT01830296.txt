      analgesia with morphine alone (M), or morphine plus remifentanil (MR), in a double-blind
      manner. Postoperatively patients were allowed to use bolus doses of morphine (0.2 mg kg-1) or
      morphine (0.2 mg kg-1) plus remifentanil (0.2 Âµg kg-1) mixture every 10 min without a
      background infusion. Pain, discomfort, sedation scores, total and bolus patient-controlled
      morphine consumption, rescue analgesic requirement and side-effects were recorded for up to
      24 h after the start of patient-controlled analgesia.
