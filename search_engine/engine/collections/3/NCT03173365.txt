      chemotherapeutic agents such as capecitabine or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, as well as
      targeted cancer drugs such as sorafenib or other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. If the toxicity
      progresses edematous swelling, blistering and desquamation can lead to ulcerations of the
      palms and soles. Additionally, patients may be affected by nail-toxicities, such as
      discoloration, ridging, pitting up to complete onycholysis and pain. Today, cooling of hands
      and feet during infusion chemotherapy as well as preventive treatment with topical
      formulations containing urea 10% (e.g. Excipial U10 Lipolotion®) is considered as standard of
      care. Yet, these strategies are limited by intricateness, patient inconvenience and low
      efficacy. Hence, at this point the satisfactory treatment of HFS remains an unmet medical
      need, as until now, no effective therapy is available to prevent or reduce HFS symptoms
      during the cycle of chemotherapeutic treatment.

      Recently, brimonidine 3 mg/g gel (Mirvaso®) has been approved as a topical treatment of
      facial erythema of rosacea in adult patients. Brimonidine is an effective agonist of
      α2-adrenoreceptors thereby, in analogy to skin cooling, leading to peripheral
      vasoconstriction.

      Against this background, the following hypothesis was developed:

      The topical application brimonidine 3 mg/g gel (Mirvaso®) may prevent or reduce the severity
      of HFS in cancer patients that receive respective antineoplastic agents.
