      medicine (TCM) and common disease (CD). A large-scale, community-based, cross-sectional study
      was performed to investigate the associations. A total of 3748 participants were available
      for analysis in this study. The assessment of constitution of TCM was based on
      recommendations of Association Chinese Medicine in China. In this study, the diagnosis of CD
      was based on self-reported medical history. The associations were analyzed using univariate
      and multivariable logistic regression (MLR).
