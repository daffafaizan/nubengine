      influence samples. Testing for alcohol or drugs only or testing for both alcohol and drugs.

      Often if the primary suspicion of the apprehending police officer is of driving under the
      influence of drugs or alcohol then only laboratory analysis concerning that primary suspicion
      is requested.

      The study aims to provide information about those 'missed cases' where only analysis for
      drugs or alcohol is carried out. Traffic police samples from a 2 week period are to be
      screened for both drugs and alcohol, even if the primary suspicion is only one of these.

      The study is part of the EU-project DRUID. Altogether 13 European countries are participating
      in DRUID.
