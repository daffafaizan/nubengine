      women with chronic use of Glucocorticoid (GCs) are at high-risk of osteoporotic fractures.
      Despite bisphosphonate treatment, a certain proportion of high-risk patients using chronic
      GCs either do not achieve a satisfactory gain in bone mineral density (BMD) or develop new
      fragility fractures. Thus, more potent osteoporosis treatment is necessary for this subgroup
      of patients. This prompts the current study which aims to examine the efficacy of denosumab
      in current users of oral bisphosphonates for Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis (GIOP).
