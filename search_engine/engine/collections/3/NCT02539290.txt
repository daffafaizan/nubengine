      Uterine flushing, associated with a five-fold increase in pregnancy when performed
      preovulatory, has been proposed as a new alternative. This treatment could flush out debris
      or alter inflammatory factors preventing fertilisation and implantation. The objective of
      this study is to assess the efficacy of pre-ovulatory uterine flushing with physiological
      saline for the treatment of unexplained infertility. This study is a randomised controlled
      trial based on consecutive women aged between 18 and 37 years consulting for unexplained
      infertility for at least one year. The day of their luteinizing hormone surge, 192
      participants will be randomised in two equal groups to either receive 20 millilitres of
      physiological saline by an intra-uterine catheter or 10 millilitres of saline intravaginally.
      Investigators will assess relative risk of live birth (primary outcome), as well as pregnancy
      over one cycle of treatment. Side effects, complications, and acceptability of the
      intervention will be reported.
