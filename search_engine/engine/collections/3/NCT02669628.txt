      present in 17-44% of cases, with 40% of patients with endometriomas being sterile. However,
      the "gold standard" treatment is laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy and this therapy is
      associated with a diminished ovarian reserve, with a significant antimullerian hormone (AMH)
      decrease.

      Alcohol sclerotherapy is a new minimal invasive procedure in endometrioma treatment whose
      potential beneficial effect in fertility preservation is not still demonstrated.

      The investigators would like to demonstrate that this procedure improves fertility
      preservation and reduces morbidity and costs in contrast with conventional surgery.
      Moreover,the investigators would like to demonstrate that this procedure could be performed
      in different centers with similar results.
