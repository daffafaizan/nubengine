    
      This study is a Phase I trial. A total of 3 - 9 patients will be enrolled. Three patients
      will initially be enrolled. There will be no dose escalation in this study as only one dose
      for perifosine (50 mg) in combination with one dose of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 BID) will be
      evaluated. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined in which fewer than 33% of patients
      experienced DLT attributable to the study drug(s), when at least six patients have been
      treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data will also be
      evaluated from all enrolled patients.
