      worldwide. In its more severe forms, it can be life threatening. The most severe forms of
      depression, or those that fail to respond to chemical treatment are treated with
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The treatment is highly effective, and undoubtedly saves
      lives, but a range of factors, including side effect profile, the necessity for extended
      hospital care, and stigma, restricts its use.

      A recent study has shown that patients who receive ketamine as the anaesthetic for ECT
      experience an earlier reduction in depressive symptoms and have a greater reduction in
      depressive symptoms than those receiving propofol (Okamoto et al., 2009). However, in this
      study eight ECT treatments were given to all participants so it is unknown whether ketamine
      could have reduced the number of treatments required. Overall, these studies suggest that as
      well as being a neuroprotective agent; ketamine may also have an antidepressant effect. Given
      these findings it is hypothesized that the use of ketamine in ECT treatment may reduce the
      number of ECT sessions required due to this drug's effects on depression ratings.

      Our main research question is whether the use of ketamine as the anaesthetic for ECT
      treatment for depression improves the treatment outcome with respect to speed of response and
      reduction in side effects when compared to conventional anaesthesia.
