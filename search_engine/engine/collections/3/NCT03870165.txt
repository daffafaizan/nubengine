    
      On both infusion trials, participants will report to the laboratory at 0700 h after an
      overnight fast. Upon arrival to the lab, the participant will fill out a questionnaire and a
      baseline breath sample will be collected to determine 13CO2 enrichment by isotope ratio mass
      spectrometry. A Teflon catheter will be inserted into the antecubital vein for a baseline
      blood sample (t=-210) and then participants will receive priming doses of NaH13CO2 (2.35
      µmol·kg-1), L-[1-13C]leucine (7.6 µmol·kg-1), and L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine (2.0 µmol·kg-1).
      Subsequently, a continuous intravenous solution of L-[1-13C]leucine (0.10 µmol·kg-1·min-1)
      and L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine (0.05 µmol·kg-1·min-1) will be initiated (t=-210) and
      maintained over the infusion trials. A second Teflon catheter will be inserted into a heated
      dorsal vein for repeated arterialized blood sampling and remained patent by a 0.9% saline
      drip. Breath samples and arterialized blood samples will be collected every 30 to 60 minutes
      during the postabsorptive and postprandial states. In the post-absorptive state of infusion
      trial 1, muscle biopsies will be collected at t=-150 and -30 min of infusion to determine
      basal-state myofibrillar protein synthesis rates, relative skeletal muscle amino acid
      transporter content, and anabolic-related signaling. In the subsequent cross-over trial only
      1 muscle biopsy will be collected at t=-30 for Western blot analysis and postabsorptive
      myofibrillar protein-bound tracer enrichment. After collection of the resting muscle biopsy
      at t=-30 for both trials, the participants will perform resistance exercise that consists of
      4 sets of 10-12 repetitions or to muscular failure at 65-70% of 1-RM for both leg press and
      leg extension exercise.

      Immediately after the completion of the exercise bout, participants will ingest either 3.5 oz
      of Salmon fillet or a matched isolated amino acid and fat mixture (t=0). Completion of the
      meal will mark the start of the postprandial stage and additional muscle biopsies will be
      collected at t=120 and t=300.
