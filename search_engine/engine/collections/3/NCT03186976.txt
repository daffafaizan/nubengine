      population. It is associated with a six-fold risk of stroke and a two-fold increase in
      mortality, the main cardiac reason for death one year after presenting to the emergency
      department with AF is heart failure. It results in high healthcare costs, recurrent ED visits
      and hospitalizations. The burden of disability associated with AF has been found to increase
      by 20% from 1990-2010. AF was also cited as one of the seven causes of death that has been
      increasing worldwide. Prevention of AF has not been a focus of past treatments and it is well
      known that elevated body mass index, hypertension, smoking, increased alcohol intake, lack of
      exercise and sleep apnea are risk factors for AF. There is a lack of randomized, multicenter
      data proving that a strategy of aggressive risk factor modification will prevent and modify
      AF.

      Upstream therapy for AF has been of considerable interest, and benefit has been demonstrated
      in primary prevention of AF. Catheter ablation has demonstrated success over current medical
      therapies for long-term rhythm control, but recurrence remains high, irrespective of ablation
      strategy. This study is a feasibility study to determine whether a complex and
      multi-component risk factor modification can be successfully implemented.
