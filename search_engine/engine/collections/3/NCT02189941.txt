    
      This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, three-way crossover study under fed and
      fasting conditions designed to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      deferiprone sustained-release tablets in healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomized to
      receive the following 3 treatments in different orders, with a washout period of 7 days
      between treatments:

        -  2000 mg of deferiprone sustained-release tablets under fed conditions

        -  2000 mg of deferiprone sustained-release tablets under fasted conditions

        -  2000 mg of Ferriprox immediate-release tablets under fasted conditions

      In each period, blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment were collected prior to
      dosing and at specified time points up to 24 hours post-dose. Safety assessments were
      conducted throughout the study.
