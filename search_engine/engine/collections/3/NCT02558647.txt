    
      This is a two-arm RCT that assesses the benefits of online CBT-I compared with an
      alternative, active control intervention (online patient education about sleep (PE)). We will
      randomize 1500 individuals and collect follow-up data for up to two years. First, we will
      examine any differential change in the severity of insomnia, immediately after completing the
      interventions. Secondly, we will examine if there are differential changes in symptoms of
      physical and mental health (e.g. psychological distress, fatigue, and health related quality
      of life) immediately post-intervention, and whether any improvements in insomnia or other
      symptoms are reported at further follow-ups (6- and 24 months post treatment termination).
      Third, we will use national registry data collected routinely in Norway to compare rates of
      time off work due to sick leave days for up to two years before and after participating in
      the RCT, as well as monitoring medication and health resource utilization according to
      condition in the same time interval. Fourth, we will try to extend the knowledge base about
      online interventions by undertaking exploratory analyses to assess whether change in specific
      clinical variables (e.g. sleep variability, psychological measures of beliefs about sleep)
      mediate the effects of the CBT-I intervention. Lastly, (subject to additional funding to
      collect saliva samples), we will examine a subset of psycho-bio-social factors to try to
      identify potential treatment moderators that might inform the stratification of individuals
      with insomnia into 'treatment-relevant' subgroups in the future (e.g. this may include also
      an exploration of 'therapygenetics').
