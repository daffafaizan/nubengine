    
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and side effects of the
      vorinostat, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone investigational combination.

      All of these drugs - vorinostat, bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone, are approved by
      the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). They have not been approved in this combination
      for use in your type of cancer or any other type of cancer. Vorinostat is approved for
      treatment of patients with a different type of cancer (Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma). Bortezomib
      is currently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is currently
      approved for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome (another form of
      cancer affecting the blood) and for use with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma
      who have received at least one prior therapy. Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone,
      or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma.
