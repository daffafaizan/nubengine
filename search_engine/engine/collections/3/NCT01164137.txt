      community interface of care, thus decreasing preventable adverse drug events and preventable
      drug-related health system utilization following hospital discharge. This initiative has four
      objectives that aim to:

        1. Develop and test a community-based medication reconciliation process/intervention.

        2. Design and conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the
           intervention on post-discharge health services utilization by comparing a set of outcome
           variables between intervention and non-intervention groups.

        3. Design a risk prediction model that helps identify patients discharged from in-patient
           care with the highest level of need for the intervention.

        4. Determine whether a community-based medication reconciliation process/intervention adds
           risk reduction value to individuals who have undergone an in-hospital medication
           reconciliation.
