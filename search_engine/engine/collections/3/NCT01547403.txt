      currently is being marketed in Canada and other countries. Customers who are using the device
      have contacted the sponsor with questions about testing conditions which might affect the
      reproducibility of measurements.

      The objective is to obtain information to allow the Sponsor to address these issues. The
      concerns fall into three broad categories:

      â€¢ Factors affecting the interface between the skin and the test sensor

      These would include the effects of skin care products applied to the forearm, subject
      activity that changes perfusion to the skin and subject movement during the test procedure.

        -  General operating conditions Issues such as ambient temperature, lighting, and height of
           the table on which the SCOUT DS device rests have been questioned as possible factors
           influencing accuracy.

        -  Rare subject disorders

      Included here would be subject skin abnormalities or physiologic changes which occur so
      infrequently that they were not well represented in previous data sets. Examples of such rare
      conditions would include scleroderma, capillary angiomata, and Raynaud phenomenon.
