      account for onset of acute microvascular events in these patients. In line with this
      hypothesis, a previous study reported a correlation between low activity of anticoagulant
      factors and thrombosis, although stroke-like episodes, the most frequent event, were not
      analyzed in this study. Moreover, the hemostatic balance is usually investigated by global
      coagulation tests such as the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin
      (aPTT). However, these tests have serious limitations. First, they explore only 5 % of the
      whole generated thrombin, enough to clot the plasma. In addition, global tests are
      insensitive to the coagulation inhibitors, especially the PC system which cannot be mobilized
      in the absence of thrombomodulin (TM). The thrombin generation assay (TGA), is also a global
      coagulation assay, but it allows exploration of the whole thrombin formation process from its
      generation to its inhibition. Moreover, combining different analytical conditions, all the
      anticoagulant systems could be investigated, including antithrombin in basal conditions and
      the PC system in the presence of soluble TM (sTM)
