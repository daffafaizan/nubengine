    
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the feasibility and
      safety of an investigational intervention. "Investigational" means that the process targeting
      high doses of radiation to the tumor based on MRI is still being studied. This research study
      is a Feasibility Study, which means it is the first-time investigators at this institution
      are examining this type of MR-guided dose planning. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has cleared MRI planning for use.

        -  In Phase I of this study, will prospectively determine the feasibility of using an MRI
           simulator to plan radiation therapy.

        -  In Phase II, the efficacy of adjusting RT based on MRI simulation will be explored,
           either by utilizing an MRI-simulation and synthetic CT to plan treatment or by
           dose-painting based on functional MRI data
