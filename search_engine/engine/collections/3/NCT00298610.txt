    
      This is an unblinded non-randomized phase II pharmacokinetic study of a new GMP formulation
      of intravenous artesunate. Artesunate has been used throughout Asia and Africa for many
      years. Its overall efficacy associated with the ability to lower parasitemia is well
      established. To date, pharmacokinetic studies have not been done in Africa using GMP (Good
      Manufacturing Practices)-produced drug. The objective of this study is to show that GMP IV
      artesunate rapidly clears parasites in Adult Kenyan populations with malaria and that the
      pharmacokinetic profile of the drug approximates other populations of adults tested (Asians
      and North Americans).
