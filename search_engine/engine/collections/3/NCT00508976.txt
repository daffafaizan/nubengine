      bupivacaine against pre-incisional port site injection of 1% lidocaine against the
      instillation of streamed bupivacaine 0.5% against the instillation of aerosolized 0.5%
      bupivacaine as it relates to post-operative analgesia usage and pain scale scores. The null
      hypothesis will be that there is no difference between the four arms of the study in regards
      to pain score and analgesia usage.
