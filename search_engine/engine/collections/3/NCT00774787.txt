      there is a small risk a lesion may progress to skin cancer. Since one can not predict which
      actinic keratosis will progress, the standard of care is to treat the lesions. The most
      commonly used method to treat actinic keratoses in the United States is with cryotherapy,
      which uses intense cold to freeze and destroy the lesions. Efficacy appears to be related to
      how long one freezes the lesion, but increasing the freeze time may result in increased pain
      and/or skin pigment changes after treatment.

      Cryotherapy is a provider-administered "focal" treatment that only treats the lesions that
      are frozen. There may be early actinic keratoses in the skin surrounding treated lesions that
      are not easily seen; these may progress over time to visible lesions. There several
      patient-administered topical treatments for actinic keratoses that are applied to a treatment
      area or "field" rather than to specific lesions. Imiquimod 5% cream is one such treatment,
      and is approved in the United States for the treatment of AKs with a dosing regimen of 1
      packet applied 2 times per week to a 25 cm2 area 2x/week for 16 weeks.

      The study will use a split-face design (one side of face treated and the other side
      untreated) to explore whether a 4-week course of topical imiquimod 5% cream after cryotherapy
      of actinic keratoses reduces the total number of lesions (those treated with cryotherapy and
      new ones) in the treatment area at follow-up.
