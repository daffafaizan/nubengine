      uptake of HIV prevention, testing, and linkage for HIV to care services in a high-HIV burden
      African setting to optimize engagement in both the HIV prevention and care continua.

      Aim 1: To determine the preferred recruitment venue and testing modality that targets and
      finds the highest number of HIV infected and at risk female youth aged 15-24 years in Homa
      Bay County, Nyanza region, western Kenya.

        -  This will be determined by examining the uptake and yield of previously undiagnosed HIV
           infection of the two (2) 'seek' strategies (community or home-based) and the three (3)
           'test' strategies (self-testing, HIV testing services (HTS) in a home/mobile setting, or
           facility-based HTS) among female youth;

      Aim 2: (a) To pilot and evaluate an adaptive intervention to link newly diagnosed
      HIV-positive female youth to treatment and care services; and (b) To identify barriers and
      facilitators to seeking HIV care services after receiving a positive diagnosis; (c) To
      identify barriers and facilitators to seeking HIV prevention services for high risk female
      youth after receiving a negative HIV test result; (d) To provide an HIV prevention
      intervention to a randomly selected subset of high risk negatives, and to re-test them; and

      Aim 3: To conduct an economic evaluation, using cost effectiveness analyses to determine the
      relative utility of each seek, test, link, and prevention intervention.
