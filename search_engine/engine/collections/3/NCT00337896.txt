      being conducted in a healthy adult population aged 18-64 years (DMID 04-062) to test the
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N1 vaccine
      when given with either alone (no adjuvant), or given along with either alum or MF59. Two
      doses of the vaccine/adjuvent will be administered day 0 and day 28. This study is linked to
      DMID protocol 04-062. This protocol is a substudy to collect additional blood samples to
      specifically evaluate the cell-mediated immune responses generated from the vaccine. Primary
      goals of this study are 1) to establish reproducible, functional cell-mediate immune response
      assays to evaluate the magnitude and functional capacity of B cells, NK cells and T cells
      responding to monovalent subvirion H5 influenza vaccine 2) to evaluate the percent of
      subjects demonstrating B cell, NK cell, CD8+ and/or CD4+ response. The secondary goal of this
      study is to examine and compare the adjuvant effect of Alum or MF59 compared to no adjuvant
      on cell mediated immune responses.
