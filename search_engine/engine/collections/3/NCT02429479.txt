      to serve as surrogate decision-makers when their loved ones can no longer make medical
      decisions for themselves. Research shows that family caregivers find surrogate
      decision-making highly stressful and emotionally burdensome, in part because they feel
      unprepared for surrogate decision-making. To date, no studies have determined which advance
      care planning (ACP) process best prepares caregivers for this role. The investigators' prior
      work shows that a computer-based decision aid can help patients make more informed decisions
      and communicate their wishes more effectively. The investigators now propose to determine if
      family caregivers of patients with life-threatening illnesses are better prepared for
      surrogate decision-making: 1) when they engage in a structured ACP process together with
      patients; and 2) when they use this online decision aid for ACP. This will be accomplished
      via a randomized, controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design comprising 4 groups:
      Standard ACP/Patient Alone (Group 1), Decision Aid/Patient Alone (Group 2), Standard
      ACP/Patients and Caregivers Together (Group 3), and Decision Aid/Patients and Caregivers
      Together (Group 4).
