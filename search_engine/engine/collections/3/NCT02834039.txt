      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study.
      Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitor, electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse-oximeter was
      set on the subjects in the operation room. Anesthesia procedure was epidural regional block.
      After given premedication (midazolam 0.05 mg/kgBW and fentanyl 1-2 ug/kgBW), induced with
      propofol, 1-2 mg/kgbb, endotracheal tube intubation was done facilitated by atracurium 0.5
      mg/kgbb. Mechanical ventilation was set up with volume control mode, (Positive End Expiratory
      Pressure) PEEP 5cmH2O (5 centimeters of water), O2 fraction (FiO2) 30-50%, target
      carbondioxide (CO2) 35-45%. Volume tidal was given according to the group (6 mL/kgBW or 10
      ml/kgBW). Hemodynamic, ventilation parameter, Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) parameter
      were recorded. If desaturation happened intraoperatively will be managed by increasing FiO2
      and recruitment maneuver until oxygen saturation (SpO2) >95%. Data was analyzed using
      Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS), for numeric data using unpaired T-test or
      Mann-Whitney-U test, for categorical data using Chi-square or Fisher Exact Test. Significant
      value is p<0.05.
