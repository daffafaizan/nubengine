        1. To contribute to the adaptation of the Italian version of the Coma Recovery Scale
           (CRS-R) for the pediatric age, with specific differentiation and taking into account the
           age of the patients and the specific learning that characterize each developmental
           stage;

        2. As regards the patients with an adequate cognitive profile, to compare the effectiveness
           of a traditional multifunction neuropsychological treatment (cognitive functions are
           stimulated at the same time) vs a sequential treatment (cognitive functions are
           stimulated step by step).
