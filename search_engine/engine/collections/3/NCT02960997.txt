      placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants will be assigned to treat both feet with
      either topical sirolimus, 2% cream daily or placebo (vehicle-control) for 12 weeks, followed
      by a 4 week washout period, then re-treatment to both feet will occur by the cross-over
      intervention.

      These studies will exploit the naturally occurring transcriptional regulation of keratin
      sequences, the known gene aberration causing EB simplex, and assess the potential for mTOR
      pathway inhibition in treatment of the patient's plantar lesions. The objective of this study
      is to assess (1) the safety of topical rapamycin for plantar lesions for the treatment of EB
      simplex, and 2) test if topical rapamycin to improves the clinical severity of lesional skin,
      including pain and itch, in subjects with EB simplex at the end of treatment versus baseline
      and compared to an intrasubject placebo treated control. Wound size measurement, quality of
      life evaluation will be assessed using epidermolysis bullosa (QOLEB), and EB disease activity
      and Scarring Index (EBDASI). With the results of this pilot study, physicians would be able
      to transition from supportive care (the current state of the art for EB simplex) to targeted
      molecular therapeutics, leading to improved mobility and quality of life for patients with EB
      simplex.
