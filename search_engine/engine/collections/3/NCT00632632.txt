      to one of two programs, following an initial assessment. Both programs include Virtual
      Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) for the treatment of PTSD as well as widely-used standard
      cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques. The VRET is comprised of ten ninety minute sessions
      which involve mental imagery as well as virtual reality presentations delivered by a special
      display worn over the head and eyes. The virtual reality simulations consist of either images
      of the World Trade Center and the events of September 11, 2001 or multiple scenarios common
      to military personnel assigned to Iraq. One group of participants will receive the medication
      cycloserine (seromycin) and one group will receive a placebo drug (like a sugar pill).
      Participants take a dose of medication only on the days that they come to the laboratory for
      the Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) sessions, and 90 minutes prior to the VRE sessions. Some
      subjects in the study will receive a 100 mg dose of cycloserine, and other subjects in the
      study will receive the placebo (sugar pill). This will be determined randomly (as by the flip
      of a coin). Neither the patient nor the treating clinicians will know which pill that
      patients are receiving; however, this arrangement may be changed if medically necessary.
      Patients are briefly assessed for well-being at every session, and are reassessed following
      session three, session six, and session ten for changes in symptomatology. At the completion
      of treatment and again six months later, the principal investigator or one of her associates
      will reinterview participants and have them complete some questionnaires.
