      subject information leaflet and informed consent form. After screening them, subjects
      complying with inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study, randomised and
      vaccinated with one of the investigational medicinal products assigned by the randomisation
      list.

      Subjects were observed for thirty (30) minutes after vaccination for any immediate reactions.
      All adverse events (AEs) were collected from the enrolment to Day 21-28. Safety data between
      Day 0 and Day 7-9 were documented on a Diary card by each subject. Safety assessment were
      performed based on Day 7-9 and Day 21-28 safety data compared to the baseline on Day 0.

      Blood samples for immunogenicity assays were collected immediately before vaccination on Day
      0 (pre-vaccination blood samples) and on Day 21-28 (post-vaccination blood samples) in all
      subjects included in the study and complying with the study procedures. Immunogenicity were
      evaluated by hemagglutinin inhibition test in order to assess immune response 3-4 weeks after
      vaccination.

      The assessment of safety and immunogenicity of 4Fluart ID 1 µg/0.1 ml QIV and 4Fluart ID 2
      µg/0.1 ml QIV was performed in comparison to the authorised 3Fluart, i.e. 3Fluart
      intramuscular (IM) 6 µg/0.5 ml TIV.
