      primarily is manifested with deposits of exfoliative material present on the anterior capsule
      of the crystalline lens, zonules, papillary margin of the iris, corneal endothelium, ciliary
      body and the trabecular meshwork. The build of this exfoliative material causes microscopic
      changes of the zonules and their attachments, causing a weakening of the zonules. These
      clinical findings have implications not only for cataract surgery, as association of lens
      opacities with exfoliation syndrome is well documented but also for glaucoma, with
      exfoliative glaucoma being the most common cause for secondary open angle glaucoma in the
      world.In patients with exfoliation syndrome, small pupil and phacodonesis, comparison between
      extra capsular cataract extraction and small incision cataract surgery revealed better best
      corrected visual acuity and fewer intra and post operative complications with the smaller
      incision for phacoemulsification. The capsular tension rings (CTR) implanted prior to
      phacoemulsification reduced intraoperative zonular dialysis, increased the rate of capsular
      IOL fixation, and improved uncorrected visual acuity. Either the degree of lens change the
      stage of PXF, or the type of IOL might influence long term outcome in PXF associated with
      cataract surgery:The postoperative course of those with either more advanced cataract or with
      more advanced PXF may be different than those who have surgery with less cataract our and/or
      degree of PXF. The stage of PXF alone at the time of cataract surgery may influence outcome.
      Once PXF identified, surgery performed at an earlier stage of cataract with a softer lens in
      XFS results in fewer long term problems following phacoemulsification. A standardized way of
      clinically measuring/monitoring XFS is helpful during large clinical studies Specific
      intraocular lens design should be considered when scheduling phacoemulsification in patients
      with PXF.
