      life-threatening condition. Therefore, treatments that can remove fat deposits from the
      arteries are being developed. These treatments may prevent subsequent heart attacks or other
      cardiovascular events, addressing an unmet medical need. MEDI16012 is a new drug that targets
      a substance produced by the body to assist participants in breaking down the bodies "good"
      fat. The investigators are interested in understanding why MEDI6012 increases the good fat,
      but also why it increases other types of "bad" fat such as low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C).
