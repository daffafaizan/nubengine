    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult men ages 45-65 years
      and postmenopausal women up to age 65 years to measure the effect that Rejuvant dietary
      supplement products have on inflammation by the measurement of C-Reactive Protein (CRP).

      The study has four groups as outlined in Table 1. Groups 1-4 are divided by gender and each
      Group will receive the gender-specific investigational product or placebo.

      Rejuvant and placebo tablets are 0.500" round and 0.290" thick. Groups 1 and 3 will take two
      tablets per day of the gender-specific investigational dietary supplement product. Groups 2
      and 4 will take 2 placebo tablets per day. All Groups will take the investigational product
      for nine months. Participants will be assessed at four timepoints: Study Initiation (Day 1),
      Month 3, Month 6, and Month 9. At each visit weight, blood pressure, pulse, safety labs, CRP,
      blood chemistries, Hemoglobin A1C, and uric acid levels will be obtained, and the study
      questionnaire will be completed by each participant. These data will allow for an assessment
      of the antiinflammatory effects and the safety of the investigational dietary supplement
      products.

      Additionally, up to 200 plasma metabolites will be measured. These data will be used to
      assess changes in participant metabolism over the course of the study. The blood chemistry
      and metabolite data may also be used to calculate the biological age of the participant by
      one or more published algorithms. DNA methylation analysis of saliva will determine the
      degree of DNA methylation (the cytosine of the CpG dinucleotide can be methylated). The
      degree of DNA methylation is correlated with aging and can be used as another measure of the
      biological age of the participant.
