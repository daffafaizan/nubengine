      experienced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition that contributes significantly to their
      morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown ACEI to be an effective therapy for DMD boys with
      early cardiomyopathy. Although bisoprolol has been demonstrated as an effective neurohumoral
      drug for adult patients with DCM, few data exist concerning its safety and efficacy for the
      patients with DMD. The investigators hypothesize that the treatment with bisoprolol in
      addition to background ACEI therapy for 12 months in participants with DMD and early
      myocardial damage evident with late gadolinium enhancement and preserved ejection fraction,
      would blunt decline in left ventricular systolic performance.
