      and behaviors in subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome. This will be a randomized placebo
      controlled pilot study. The primary outcome measure is to determine if intranasal
      administration of oxytocin will cause any adverse events in subjects with Prader-Willi
      syndrome. Secondarily, the investigators will also perform evaluations to determine if
      intranasal oxytocin has any effect on social skills, behaviors, or appetite in children with
      Prader-Willi syndrome.
