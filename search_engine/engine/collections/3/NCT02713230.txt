    
      On Day 0, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of
      EXPAREL 133 mg in 10 mL expanded in volume with 10 mL of normal saline for a total volume of
      20 mL or placebo 20 mL. Study drug (EXPAREL or placebo) will be administered in a blinded
      manner via an ultrasound guided single-dose brachial plexus block at least 1 hour prior to
      surgery.

      Postsurgical assessments will include pain intensity scores using a 10-cm visual analog scale
      (VAS); total postsurgical opioid consumption; overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS)
      questionnaire; subject satisfaction with overall analgesia using a 5 point Likert scale;
      neurological assessment; sensory function assessment; motor function assessment; discharge
      readiness; unscheduled phone calls or office visits related to pain; 12-lead ECGs; vital sign
      measurements; and clinical laboratory tests. Adverse events will be recorded from the time
      the informed consent form is signed through postsurgical Day 29.

      Follow-up visits will be scheduled for all subjects on postsurgical Days 5 and 10. A
      follow-up phone call will be made on postsurgical Day 29.

      A population Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be utilized to limit the number of blood
      draws with a sampling schedule of baseline (prior to the nerve block) through hospital
      discharge. There will be two collection sequences for this study and a subject can only be
      randomized to one sequence.
