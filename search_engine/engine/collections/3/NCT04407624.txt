      randomization method. All patients are informed about risk factors and risk factor
      management. All patients are trained 3 days in the first week under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist to learn individual exercise programs. Exercise programs including warm-up,
      loading, cooling, and relaxation exercises are shown. The warm-up period is consist of
      light-paced walking, active movements of several large muscle groups. During the loading
      period, taking into consideration the heart rate, fatigue and shortness of breath, exercises
      such as walking, squat, limb movements with weights, stepping on the steps, walking on
      different floors are shown. Stretching exercises are done during the cooling period.
      Intermittent loading workouts will consist of 3-minute loads and 1-minute rest intervals.
      Moderate aerobic exercise is consist of brisk walking to reach 60-85% of the person's maximum
      heart rate. Participants of the experimental group are contacted every two weeks via
      communication methods such as e-mail, message and telephone conversation. Exercise diary is
      given to all patients and is taken from them at the end of the study.
