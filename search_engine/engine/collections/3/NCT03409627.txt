    
      This is a first-in-human, phase I, open label, safety study of INXN-4001 delivered via RCSI
      in patients with outpatient LVAD. Twelve stable patients with implanted LVAD for mechanical
      support of end stage heart failure have been allocated into 2 cohorts (6 subjects each) to
      evaluate the safety of infusing the same amount of INXN-4001 (80mg) in 2 volumes (40mL and
      80mL) at 20mL/min rate. Ongoing safety assessments include clinical labs, physical exams, ECG
      and medical history collected during clinic visits at: pre-treatment, day 3, then 1, 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months after dosing via RCSI. During visits, subjects complete the KCCQ questionnaire
      and are evaluated via 6-min walk test (6MWT) prior to and during an LVAD wean interval. Daily
      activity data is collected throughout the study using a wearable biosensor (Actigraph).
