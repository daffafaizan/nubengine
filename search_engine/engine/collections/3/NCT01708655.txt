      measure sweat secretion that is: highly reproducible in healthy controls; reduced by 50% in
      CF obligate heterozygotes; and absent in CF patients carrying severe mutations on both
      alleles. Further, test- retest experiments suggest good intra-individual reliability. All
      these features satisfy the required criteria for a biomarker assay that is capable of
      assessing small increments in CFTR function in vivo in clinical trials designed to assess the
      effectiveness of correctors and potentiators of CFTR channel activity. Therefore, to provide
      additional evidence of the value of this novel technique the investigators will determine the
      accuracy and reliability of evaporimetry to measure Beta-adrenergic induced sweating in
      subjects with a range of CFTR channel activity.
