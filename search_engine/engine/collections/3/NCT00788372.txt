    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center
      (conducted in more than one center) and non-comparative study of fentanyl one-day transdermal
      patch. The study consists of 4 periods: Screening period (3-14 days), Treatment period 1 (4
      weeks), Treatment period 2 (48 weeks), Tapering period (0-6 weeks) and Follow-up period (1
      week). Treatment will be initiated at 12.5 microgram per hour (mcg/hr). In both Treatment
      period 1 and 2, the dose will be increased as per the Investigator's discretion, ranging from
      12.5 mcg/hr to 100 mcg/hr and the maximum application dose will be 300 mcg/hr. However, in
      Treatment period 2, the dose will be increased on 7th day before the day of medical
      examination (only if the participant used rescue treatment for minimum of 3 times per day for
      minimum of 4 days). The patch will be applied on areas including the chest, abdomen, upper
      arm and femoral region and replaced daily. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by visual
      analog scale (VAS) score. The total duration of the study treatment will be 52 weeks.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
