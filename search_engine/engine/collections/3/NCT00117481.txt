    
      This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate
      the ability of DR-2001 to produce beneficial changes in endometriosis-related symptoms,
      primarily nonmenstrual pelvic pain, over a 12-week treatment period. The overall study
      duration for each patient will be about 20 weeks.

      Patients who meet all study entrance criteria will be randomly assigned to one of three
      treatment groups.

      The change in endometriosis-related clinical symptoms will be assessed in two ways: through a
      combined physician/patient assessment and also with a patient self-assessment. Patients will
      undergo a gynecologic exam at each study visit.
