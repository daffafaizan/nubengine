      radiotherapy. However, one of the associated toxicities is the occurrence of mucositis which
      can be a limiting factor in the treatment (dose reduction or treatment interruption can limit
      patient's survival), patient's quality of life decreases and severe complications can occur.
      The treatment of mucositis is mainly symptomatic; a randomized study has shown a benefit of a
      mouthwash with Benzydamine, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, for patients receiving
      50-Gy radiation. Another study with a lower number of patients has also shown a benefit of
      using a zinc sulfate solution. Boiron laboratories have developed a phytopharmaceutical
      preparation, Homeodent®, which has no secondary effects and which could prevent
      radiation-induced mucositis. This study will evaluate the efficiency of mouthwash with
      Homeodent® in a large randomized trial.
