      resulting in both vasodilation and a blunting of the sympathetic response. Due to these
      mechanistic considerations, patients who are dependent upon adrenergic tone to maintain blood
      pressure are more prone to its' hemodynamic instability. This is especially true in those who
      are receiving dexmedetomidine in the settings of hypovolemia, traumatic spinal cord injury,
      or general anesthetic administration. The use of dexmedetomidine in these patient populations
      may explain the high rate of hypotension reported in a recent study in trauma patients where
      almost 50% of patients had a spinal cord injury.

      Although hemodynamic instability may negatively impact outcomes in the ICU, specific risk
      factors for the development of clinically significant hemodynamic instability in patients
      receiving dexmedetomidine are poorly characterized in the current literature. Although
      previous studies in focused populations have implicated dexmedetomidine dosing strategies,
      including initial loading infusions and titration frequency, the degree to which alternative
      patient-specific factors or concurrent interventions impact the risk of hemodynamic
      instability remains incompletely understood.

      The aim of this study will be to determine the risk factors of dexmedetomidine-associated
      hemodynamic instability in critically ill trauma patients and the effect of this hemodynamic
      instability on different body systems.
