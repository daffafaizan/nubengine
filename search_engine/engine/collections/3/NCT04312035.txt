      knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Pressure pain threshold, as a measure of somatosensory function,
      is a well-applied measurement technique for the pain perception in KOA. The effect of
      mobilizations on decrease of peripheral and central sensitivity has been proven in KOA.
      Furthermore, few studies has revealed the effect of conservative therapy as an effective
      intervention in the increase of pain threshold. However, no study has investigated the effect
      of these interventions combined till date in KOA, which could give a long-lasting effect in
      the decrease of sensitization in KOA.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the short-term and long-term effect
      of end-range mobilization in addition to conservative therapy on decrease of pressure pain
      threshold in KOA.
