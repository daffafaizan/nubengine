      acute respiratory failure, requiring noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) outside the
      intensive care unit (ICU) in 10 hospitals in Catalonia (Spain). Demographic, laboratory,
      clinical and noninvasive respiratory support data will be collected and analyzed according to
      the primary outcome (death or endotracheal intubation at day 28) and secondary outcomes (see
      the dedicated section).

      During the hospitalization, patients were treated according to the standard procedures of the
      participating centers. This study is observational and no randomization have been performed.

      Patients were followed up to either 28-days or hospital discharge if still hospitalized at
      day 28 from NIRS initiation.
