    
      The primary objectives for the study are to assess the safety and tolerability profile,
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      LP-168 administered once or twice daily as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with
      relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM, FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL); and to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LP-168 in adult subjects with
      relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM, FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL).

      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect
      of LP-168 on progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of
      response (DOR) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM,
      FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL).

      Once the MTD is declared and the RP2D is established, additional subjects will be enrolled in
      a cohort expansion phase (Phase 1b).
