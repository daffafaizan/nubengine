      optimize health outcomes for mothers and newborn babies. Obese gravida meeting inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be offered enrollment in TAGG. Those that
      consent will be randomized to receive standard of care or enhanced care regarding gestational
      weight gain.

      The primary outcome is the proportion of patients that gain less than 20 lbs over the course
      of the pregnancy. Secondary outcomes include patient knowledge and expectations, attitude
      about pregnancy weight gain, self-efficacy of ability to eat healthy, and eating, sleeping
      and physical activity behavior, perceived stress, psychological factors, patient-experience,
      involvement in care, and food security.
