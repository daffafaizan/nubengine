    
      Randomization had to take place just prior to the first study drug injection (randomization
      ratio 1:1).

      The study period per participant was variable depending on the duration of chemotherapy. It
      included:

        -  a screening period up to 3 weeks,

        -  a double-blind treatment period,

        -  a follow-up period of 1 month.

      Study end date was at the latest 7 months following the randomization of the last participant
      (6 months treatment and 1 month follow-up).
