renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study .the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney tothe clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosisdiagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had thenephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria forrenal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloiddeposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amountof amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinicalrenal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and theheavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients whohad biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers ofplasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be aboutthe same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosisshould be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephroticsyndrome, or renal failure .
