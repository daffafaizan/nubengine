      a low but clinically relevant risk of bleeding (overall and major bleeding) at long-term
      follow-up, eventually exceeding the risk of ischemic events.

      Importantly, the vast majority of major bleeding events seem to occur in patients receiving
      antiplatelet therapy. Preliminary data suggest that antiplatelet therapy discontinuation is
      not associated with any increase in ischemic events, and could potentially translate into a
      lower rate of major bleeding events at longer term follow-up. We therefore hypothesize that
      in young patients without any other comorbidities increasing the risk of stroke, shorter-term
      (â‰¤1 year instead of lifelong) antiplatelet treatment could be a safe option following PFO
      closure.
