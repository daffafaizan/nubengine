      conditions and reduce doses of other substances needed for general anesthesia. For ensuring
      patient safety, neuromuscular function is monitored during general anesthesia. The latter one
      is only terminated, when neuromuscular monitoring shows an objective normal value. Despite
      this accurate surveillance, a lot of patients complain about subjectively uncomfortable
      muscle weakness in the recovery room. A possible explanation for this ostensive contradiction
      can be the variable "margin of safety" of neuromuscluar transmission in different muscle
      groups. Waud et al describe this phenomenon, as the fact, that neuromuscular transmission is
      only clinically detectable, when a certain number of post-synaptic receptors is not blocked.
      The necessary fraction of free receptors differs a lot between the muscle groups (15-50%). As
      neuromuscular monitoring only measures one muscle group exemplarily, and a clinically
      non-detectable number of post-synaptic receptors can be blocked shortly after anesthesia, the
      subjective muscle weakness of patients could need treatment.

      Sugammadex can encapsulate steroid-typ muscle relaxants within 2 to 5 minutes. After applying
      a sufficiently high dose, also those receptors will be free that elude neuromuscular
      monitoring. This constellation brings up the interesting problem to quantify the possible
      effect on patients' subjective muscle weakness.

      This study is designed to investigate, if the application of sugammadex improves muscle
      function and consequently well-being of patients, that have been extubated according to
      clinical standard.
