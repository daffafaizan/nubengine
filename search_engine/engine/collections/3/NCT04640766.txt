      electroencephalography neurofeedback (EFP-EEG-NF) technology and provide them with hands-on
      experience; 2) Assessing participants' ability to learn the feedback paradigm (i.e. control
      the EFP-EEG-NF signal; time to achieve learning; assess learning curves); 3) Exploring
      preliminary results assessing target symptoms (e.g. AISRS and BRIEF-A).
