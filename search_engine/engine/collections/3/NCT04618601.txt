      patients hospitalized for this diagnosis. Intravenous loop diuretics are the mainstay of
      treatment. Nonetheless, nearly half of the patients who are hospitalized for AdHF continue to
      have residual symptoms and sign of congestion at time of discharge. Various pharmacological
      and non-pharmacological interventions have been proposed over the past years as potential
      means for relieving congestion in hospitalized ADHF patients. However, their efficacy has not
      been shown.

      Given that hyperaldosteronism is a key feature in HF, the hypothesis that administration of
      high doses of spironolactone can potentiate the natriuretic effects of loop diuretics and
      relieve congestion in the setting of ADHF has been raised.

      According to the most recent guidelines spironolactone can be considered in combination with
      loop diuretic in patients with resistant edema or insufficient symptomatic response. However,
      spironolactone at a dose of 100 mg daily has failed to increase diuresis in patients with
      ADHF.

      The present study will assess the effect of high per os doses of spironolactone (â‰¥100mg) on
      top of SOC treatment compared with SOC treatment alone on diuresis, natriuresis, weight loss
      and levels of NT-proBNP in hospitalized patients with ADHF.
