      (day 1) comprised by anamnesis and evaluation of the bioimpedance to analyze the body
      composition, will still carry out the evaluation of the load for a maximum repetition. Thus,
      7 days after (day 2) the previous evaluation in the times immediately after and after 15
      minutes of the LED application will be carried out new tests. These will involve assessment
      of blood lactate, heart rate variability and electromyography. In addition, during the
      execution of the fatigue protocol will be collected the number of repetitions of muscle
      contraction and its total execution time.

      Due to the number of athletes that make up the university team (n = 19), cross-over will be
      necessary, where all athletes will initially be distributed to the 04 pre-defined groups in
      each subproject, and after the 7 days, they will be divided again.
