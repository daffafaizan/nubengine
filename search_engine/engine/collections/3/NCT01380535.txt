      in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) within prospective, randomized clinical studies
      is limited, despite its frequent clinical use.

      This phase 1/pilot study was the first randomized, prospective study to investigate ECP use
      as first-line therapy in cGVHD, based on the 2015 National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      consensus criteria for diagnosis and response assessment.

      Adult patients with new-onset (â‰¤3 years of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) moderate
      or severe cGVHD were randomized 1:1 to 26 weeks of SoC+ECP vs SoC (corticosteroids and
      cyclosporine A/tacrolimus) between 2011 and 2015. The primary endpoint was overall response
      rate (ORR), defined as complete or partial response, at week 28 in the intention-to-treat
      population (ITT).
