    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the anti-tumor activity of combination therapy with CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and
      nivolumab as compared to nivolumab alone in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) based on the lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy
      criteria or LYRIC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of treatment with a combination of CDX-1127
      (varlilumab) and nivolumab in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell NHL.

      II. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of combination therapy with CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and nivolumab on
      the immune system as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mass cytometry (CyTOF), changes
      in serum cytokine profile and immunogenicity assays.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and nivolumab when used
      in combination.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 4
      months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may cross over to Group II at the time of disease
      progression.

      GROUP II: Patients receive varlilumab IV over 90 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab
      IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 4 months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.
