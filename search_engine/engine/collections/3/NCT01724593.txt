        1. To describe the functional recovery following prolonged immobility and delayed
           rehabilitation in critically ill children.

        2. To explore the predictors of impaired functional recovery following immobilization in
           critically ill children.

      Prior to conducting a definitive multi-centre study to answer our research questions and
      achieve our study objectives above, we will conduct a pilot study in order to demonstrate
      feasibility.
