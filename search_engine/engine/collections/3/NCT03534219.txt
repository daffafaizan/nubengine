      prophylactically decrease incidence of AOM in children with recurrent AOM. The secondary
      hypothesis is that the EP device will be able to decrease morbidity of AOM and severity of
      AOM in children with recurrent AOM (by measuring quality of life and associated endpoints).

      The EP device is 510(K) regulated (510(K) Number K073401) as a non-surgical, non-drug related
      treatment for middle ear pressure problems such as: Middle ear fluid (Otitis Media with
      Effusion), Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, Temporary hearing loss, Ear pain and pressure caused
      by air travel, Ear fullness caused by colds, allergies and sinusitis.

      This is a randomized, controlled, double blinded study. This is a randomized controlled
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the EarPopper device (EP) in the reduction of
      episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) in children with recurrent otitis media. The control arm
      will be observational.

      Patients will be followed up for a period of one year, and monthly telephone call interviews
      will be conducted.

      All patients will receive the EarPopper device for participation in this trial (for the
      control arm, they will receive the device at the end of their study follow up).
