    
      Patients with active cancer and symptomatic pulmonary embolism, proximal deep vein
      thrombosis, iliac or caval thrombosis will be randomly assigned to receive either dalteparin
      using the CLOT regimen or to oral rivaroxaban using the conventional dosage given in the
      Einstein studies. Experimental and control treatments will be given for three months. The
      main outcome at three month will include all symptomatic and incidentally discovered venous
      thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (either objectively confirmed and death
      due to pulmonary embolism), lower limb and upper limb deep vein thrombosis, iliac, caval and
      visceral thrombosis and any worsening of vascular obstruction which will be collected
      systematically at inclusion and at day 90. The safety end-points will consist of the rate of
      major bleedings and the composite of major and non-major but clinically significant bleedings
      at day 90. All outcome events will be blindly adjudicated by a central independent
      adjudication committee.
