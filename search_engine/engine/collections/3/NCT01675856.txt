      triage leading to urgent endoscopy and a higher level of care. A GBS of 0 has been shown to
      identify patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who may be managed safely as
      outpatients. The proportion of patients requiring endoscopic therapy increases with a higher
      score. A cut-off score that identifies "high-risk" patients who may benefit from urgent
      intervention however has not been determined. Guidelines from Societies around the world
      recommend early endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation for acute upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding (AUGIB). The guidelines also state that a proportion of patients need emergency
      "out-of-hours" endoscopy, without defining the "high-risk" group. A recent international
      consensus on the management of NVUGIB recommended early endoscopy within 24 hours for
      Non-Variceal Upper Gastro Intestinal Bleeding (NVUGIB), and noted no additional benefit
      associated with urgent endoscopy (<12 hours) vs. early endoscopy (>12 hours) in unselected
      patients with NVUGIB. However, there are only limited data on the role of urgent endoscopy in
      the "selected" subgroup of patients with high-risk NVUGIB.
