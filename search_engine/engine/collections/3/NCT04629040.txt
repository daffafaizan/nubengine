      discomfort. There was no study using foot pressure as a parameter about lateral wedge insole
      intervention for the knee osteoarthritis patient. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the effect of lateral wedge insole for the patient of knee osteoarthritis. During
      total period of 12 weeks for the study, investigators randomized the patient into
      experimental and control group. Then investigators evaluated the patient's foot pressure,
      quadriceps thickness, stride length, stride width, walking speed, pain scale and daily
      function before intervention, 4th weeks, 8th weeks and 12th weeks. Investigators would use
      pressure insole designed in the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan. The
      portable device used in this study maybe suitable for evaluation of other lower limb disease.
      There were studies evaluating elderly people dysfunction, critical illness muscle atrophy or
      knee joint disease with ultrasound detected quadriceps thickness. But there was no study
      about the correlation between foot pressure and quadriceps thickness for evaluating the
      effect of lateral wedge insole. Investigators hoped to make a new model for evaluating lower
      limbs disorder in the future.
