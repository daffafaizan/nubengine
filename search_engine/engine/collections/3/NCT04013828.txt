    
      High-Grade Glioma is a life-threatening disease that can cause the patient substantial
      physical, mentally and psychosocially impairment. The life expectancy is short, and a
      majority of patients experience recurrence of tumour growth. At time of recurrence, the
      treatment possibilities can include surgery, oncological treatment and/or palliative care.

      In this situation the patients and their close relatives need to make a difficult balancing
      between benefits and trade offs.

      Little is known about how the patients and their close relatives experience the recurrence
      and the decision-making process.

      The objective of this study is therefore to explore the perspectives, experiences and needs
      in patients and their close relatives in relation to the decision-making process at time of
      recurrence.

      Data will be generated through semi-structured interviews. Interviews will be analysed and
      interpreted using a Ricoeur inspired method of qualitative analysis.

      The study is part of a larger PhD-study.
