      patients with ABSSSI caused or suspected to be caused by Gram-positive microorganisms. The
      current study is being conducted to evaluate the relative exposure, PK and safety of a new
      formulation of oritavancin, Kimyrsa, by adjusting infusion time, concentration and
      reconstitution/administration solutions of a single 1200 mg IV infusion of oritavancin in
      adult subjects with ABSSSI.

      Fifty (50) subjects will be administered the currently approved formulation of oritavancin,
      using the approved dosing regimen in which Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) is the
      reconstituting agent and Dextrose 5% in Water (D5W) is used for further dilution to a total
      volume of 1000 mL. This formulation will be infused per the approved label over 3 hours. An
      additional 50 subjects will be administered Kimyrsa which contains
      hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD). This formulation will be reconstituted with SWFI and
      further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) to a total volume of 250 mL. This
      formulation will be infused over 60 minutes.
