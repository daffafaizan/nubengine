      computerized tomography scan, commonly called a CT scan. A CT scan combines a series of x-ray
      views that are taken from many different angles and uses computer processing to create
      cross-sectional images inside your body. These cross-sectional images are very thin slices,
      often less than 1 mm thick and allow the radiologist to examine parts of your tissue very
      closely.

      Dual energy computed tomography (DECT) is a fairly new technology that uses both the normal
      x-ray and also a second less powerful x-ray to make the images. The Ottawa Hospital has
      scanners in use that are able to take the images that oncologists typically order for
      patients and can also be set to obtain DECT images at the same time.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether DECT images can provide helpful
      information to better predict how the tumor will respond to treatment and the likely course
      of head and neck tumors.
