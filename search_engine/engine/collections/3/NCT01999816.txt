      are associated with high treatment costs and reduced quality of life. This study will examine
      the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a promising lifestyle-based intervention designed to
      reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers among culturally diverse, community dwelling adults
      with SCI who have had serious pressure ulcers.

      The intervention being tested, termed lifestyle redesign (LR), is based on prior SCI
      literature as well as on the results of a qualitative pilot study undertaken by our study
      group. This intervention targets several psychosocial mediating variables that have been
      shown to be important in prevention of pressure ulcers in daily living contexts. Participants
      assigned to the LR condition receive individualized in-home sessions, personal phone calls,
      and incident-based contacts for a 12-month period, followed by 12 months of no intervention.
      Participants in the control condition do not receive any study-based intervention, but (along
      with the LR group) have continuing access to the standard options for prevention and
      treatment that are available through Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center.

      In addition to identifying a pressure ulcer prevention strategy, the planned research will
      lead to the development of testable theoretical models of the intervening process mechanisms
      that link the intervention to pressure ulcer reduction.
