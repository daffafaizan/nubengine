      delivering both tonic (continuous) stimulation as well as Burst (intermittent) stimulation.
      Patients are programmed to be in both stimulation modes for a study period of 4 weeks, after
      which their pain symptoms are evaluated on a variety of surveys: McGill Pain Questionnaire
      (MPQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale (PCS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Numerical Rating
      Scale (NRS) and Global Improvement. They also undergo Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST),
      where thermal, mechanical, vibration and pressure stimuli are applied to the patient and
      detection limits are documented.
