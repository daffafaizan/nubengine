    
      Striae Distensae (SD) is a form of scarring that can oftentimes be quite disfiguring and
      emotionally distressing to individuals.

      Fractional laser therapy has been used by doctors to treat stretch marks by stimulating
      collagen growth.

      Poly-L lactic acid also promotes collagen growth in the areas injected.

      The combination of laser and poly-L lactic acid might provide the optimal treatment modality
      for SD by decreasing the appearance of atrophic scars.
