      safety and immunogenicity of EBA-175 RII-NG malaria vaccine administered intramuscularly. The
      vaccine is a recombinant Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 kDa
      Region II-nonglycosylated (EBA-175 RII-NG) adsorbed to aluminum phosphate adjuvant. The study
      is being conducted at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. Eighty healthy subjects,
      between the ages of 18 and 40 years, males and females, will be recruited from Houston,
      Texas, and will participate in the study for approximately 13 months. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive 3 doses of the vaccine or saline placebo by the intramuscular route in
      a 9:1 ratio at 0, 1 and 6 months. The safety and immunogenicity of ascending dosages of the
      vaccine will be assessed. Eighteen subjects will receive vaccine at each of the following
      dosage levels: 5, 20, 80 and 160 micrograms. Two subjects will receive placebo for each
      dosage level. Dosage escalation will proceed only after review of the 2-week safety data of
      the 2 initial doses of the prior dosage level. The primary study objective is to assess the
      safety and reactogenicity (tolerability) of ascending dosages of EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine among
      healthy subjects given in 3 intramuscular doses at 0, 1 and 6 months. The secondary study
      objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine by measuring
      anti-EBA-175 RII-NG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), anti-parasite
      antibodies by indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT), inhibition of binding of EBA-175
      RII-NG to red blood cells (RBCs), and inhibition of Pf growth in vitro.
