      hematopoietic stem cell transplants for malignancies. There is also a reported decreased
      incidence of acute GVHD compared to matched unrelated donor transplants.A cord blood registry
      will be searched for suitable units with compatibility in the ABO and HLA systems. The
      minimum total nucleated cell dose required which would be 1.0 x 107/kg, and one unit of cells
      will be procured to meet this requirement. Although it is likely that the transplanted cord
      blood cells will be rejected over time, we hypothesize that while they remain in the host's
      tissue these cells will be producing and releasing cytokines, growth factors and other
      humoral factors that might promote vasculogenesis by stimulating endogenous stem cells and
      endothelial cells. Since there is no need to collect the patient's own stem cells, the
      patient's cardiovascular system will not be subjected to any stress due to the leukapheresis
      procedure itself. No injections of exogenous growth factors, which have been associated with
      thrombosis, would be required to mobilize the patient's own stem cells. The procedure could
      conceivably even be performed in its entirety on an outpatient basis.

      A total of 25 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be followed for 24 months
      after the procedure with evaluation visits one day after the transplant and then at one
      month, six, twelve and twenty four months post-treatment. The visit one day after the
      transplant will involve a history and physical with a leg exam, a CBC and a chemistry panel
      to evaluate for possible infection, or other adverse event.
