      of patients and has been associated with disease severity. Studies have also shown that cCK18
      is generally elevated to a higher degree in cirrhosis than in other liver diseases. In
      addition, increasing stages of cirrhosis from Child-Pugh A, Child-Pugh B to Child-Pugh C are
      associated with progressively higher levels of caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18. This suggests
      that apoptosis and caspase activity are associated with the severity of disease. IDN-6556 and
      its ability to inhibit inflammation and apoptosis may have a beneficial impact on both the
      dynamic and structural components associated with the pathogenesis of portal hypertension in
      cirrhosis.
