      moderate caries using sealants as an alternative to the restorations on occlusal surfaces of
      deciduous teeth. 96 children aged 3-6 years will be selected. Children must have at least one
      occlusal surface classified as scores 3 or 4 of International Caries Detection and Assessment
      System (ICDAS). Children will be randomly allocated according to the treatment: glass ionomer
      sealant and restoration with glass ionomer. After treatment, teeth will be assessed
      clinically after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months by trained and blinded examiners regarding the
      treatment received. The need of reintervention initially treated, either by failures that
      require repeating of the same procedure or for progression of caries lesions will be
      considered as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes will be the chil's acceptability to
      the treatment.
