    
      A randomized, 2-arm parallel-group clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a
      self-administered Virtual Reality (VR) program for the treatment of chronic lower back pain.
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of skills-based VR on changes in
      patient-reported pain and pain interference over the course of an 8-week intervention as well
      as compared to a placebo VR condition. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of
      skill-based VR on changes in patient-reported satisfaction over the course of an 8-week
      intervention and compared to a placebo VR condition. A tertiary objective is to assess the
      impact of skills-based VR on changes in patient-reported opioid use, physical function,
      behavioral skills development, and health outcomes immediately following the intervention
      relative to a pre-intervention baseline and compared to a placebo VR condition. An
      exploratory objective is to assess the impact of skills-based VR on changes in
      patient-reported pain levels, opioid use, physical function, behavioral skills development,
      health outcomes, and satisfaction at the 24-week post-intervention time point and compared to
      a placebo VR condition.
