      Induction of Labour (IOL). The women will be given a short leaflet regarding the study.
      During their time on the Induction of Labour (IOL) Suite, women will be seen by a member of
      the research team, the research will be discussed with them and they will receive a
      Participant Information Sheet if they desire. The woman will also be shown a short video
      regarding the Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH)Butterfly which is specifically for members of the
      public. After a discussion of the research, women will be asked to indicate in writing
      whether they may consider participation, whether they do not want to participate, or whether
      they are undecided but are happy to be asked again. Only those women who are considering
      participation, or who are happy to be asked again will be approached post-delivery. All of
      the women can be approached up to 72 hours post-delivery and asked if they wish to
      participate. If a woman has a vaginal delivery, a member of the research team will then
      attend the Delivery Suite, maternity theatre (the woman may have had an instrumental delivery
      in theatre) or the postnatal ward once informed by the midwife caring for her. They will
      clarify with the woman if she wishes to participate. Assuming the woman wishes to
      participate, informed, signed consent will be sought at this point and the device will be
      used, with a speculum examination taking place before and after use of the device.

      If the device is of an incorrect size, then the device size will be changed before repeating
      the process with 5-10 more women. In this way the final recruitment number may be more than
      10 in total.
