    
      This screening study is designed to evaluate patients with suspected or identified recurrent
      or unusual infections and their family members for clinical and in vitro correlates of
      exposure and susceptibility. It will allow for up to 2 visits to obtain blood, urine, saliva,
      stool, skin biopsy, or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for research
      studies related to understanding the nature of the infection as well as the genetic and
      biochemical bases of these diseases. Patients determined by initial evaluation to be of
      interest for additional study or treatment will be asked to provide consent for enrollment
      into an appropriate NIH follow-up study. The present study will enroll up to 2000 patients
      and family members over the next 25 years.
