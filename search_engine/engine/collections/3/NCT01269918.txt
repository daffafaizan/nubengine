      neurosurgical procedures should provide optimal surgical conditions while maintaining
      appropriate cerebral oxygen supply and stable systemic hemodynamics. (1) It is important to
      prevent patient response to noxious stimuli during the procedure like pinning, drilling of
      the bone, opening and manipulation of the dura etc., avoid coughing and bucking during
      surgery and during extubation thus necessitating a deeper level of anesthesia and analgesia.
      At the same time it is desirable to have the patient fully awake toward the end of the
      surgery in order to facilitate neurologic evaluation. Management of the above presents a
      challenge during induction, maintenance and extubation and also during multiple critical
      stages of surgery Fear of the side effects of analgesic drugs frequently leads to the
      under-treatment of post-craniotomy pain. (2) Nevertheless, this pain continues to be commonly
      observed, is frequently severe, and, if unrelieved, may cause distress for the neurosurgical
      patient and serious complications for the operative brain. (2) There is a need for larger
      trials to delineate safety and efficacy of analgesic therapies with a focus on short- and
      long-term outcomes.
