    
      PENNSAID Gel is a new topical gel formulation of diclofenac sodium that is similar in
      composition to PENNSAID solution.

      No clinical studies have been conducted using PENNSAID Gel. The current study will compare
      the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, safety and tolerability of diclofenac after the
      topical application of PENNSAID Gel with the approved formulations of topical PENNSAID
      Solution and oral Sandoz 75 mg diclofenac sodium delayed release tablets in healthy subjects.

      The efficacy profile of PENNSAID Gel is based on the known efficacy profile of PENNSAID
      solution. Support for the BID dosing regimen includes the higher concentration of diclofenac
      sodium in PENNSAID Gel (2.0%) compared to PENNSAID solution (1.5%). In addition, compared to
      PENNSAID solution, PENNSAID Gel is designed to have better penetration of diclofenac to allow
      for a reduction in the number of applications per day from four to two while maintaining
      effectiveness.
