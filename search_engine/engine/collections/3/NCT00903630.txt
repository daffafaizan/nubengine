      Phase I - Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when combined with fixed dose
           pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in women with recurrent ovarian
           epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      Phase II - Define the best overall response induced by lenalidomide in recurrent ovarian
      cancer patients

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary information on toxicity, response, and time to progression
           (duration of response) of these patients.

        -  Progression free survival

      Phase I OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide. Patients receive oral
      lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Phase II OUTLINE: The phase II component will include patients with measurable disease per
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria treated at lenalidomide 10 mg
      days 1-28 days of a 28 day cycle (Maximum Tolerated Dose from phase I) with liposomal
      doxorubicin 40 mg/m^2 to determine efficacy and safety of the combination therapy. (Effective
      with April 2010 revision)

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
