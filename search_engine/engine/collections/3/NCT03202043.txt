      c of vegetables each day to reduce risk of chronic disease, but current methods for assessing
      intake are either inaccurate (self-report) or invasive (blood carotenoid levels). Recent
      research indicates that skin carotenoid status may be a useful biomarker of vegetable intake,
      but the sensitivity to dose in unknown. In this study, we propose to test the dose-response
      of skin carotenoids to consumption of 3 different levels of vegetable juice (with a control
      group receiving water). We will test skin carotenoids in two ways: using resonance Raman
      spectroscopy (RRS), which we have previously validated, and with a new technique, pressure
      mediated reflection spectroscopy (RS; the "Veggie Meter"). We will compare the two techniques
      during an 8-week provided tomato-based juice intervention. Skin carotenoid readings will be
      compared to blood carotenoid concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
      genes related to the uptake, transport, and metabolism of carotenoids will be examined in
      blood and saliva.
