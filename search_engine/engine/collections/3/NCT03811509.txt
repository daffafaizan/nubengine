      incidence of osteoporosis, fractures and other musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly pain
      and stiffness. B-ABLE is a clinical, prospective cohort study carried out in both Breast
      Cancer and Bone Metabolism Units of the Hospital del Mar in Barcelona. Currently, 780
      postmenopausal Caucasian women with early breast cancer and candidates for adjuvant AI
      treatment were included and predicted to reach more than 1000 patients. The main objective of
      the study is to improve the life quality of women treated with AI. Cohort B-ABLE is designed
      to evaluate musculoskeletal events derived of using AI in breast cancer women. The project
      objectives are the analysis of the AI deleterious effect on bone microarchitecture and early
      determination of the risk of fragility fracture with DEXA, lumbar spine Rx, TBS and
      microindentation. Determination of physiological causes of the AI-related arthralgia by
      analyzing joint degradation markers, steroid hormone levels remaining in blood and functional
      magnetic resonance, before and after three months of AI treatment. The study results will
      help to decide the most appropriate treatment for each patient in order to minimize
      AI-related side effects and hence avoid discontinuation of adjuvant therapy treatment.
