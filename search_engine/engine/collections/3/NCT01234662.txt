      delivery. By using a combination of local anesthetics and opioids, it is often possible to
      avoid motor block. Spinal anesthesia is suitable for most elective cesarean sections.
      Epidural anesthesia and in particular catheter based epidural anesthesia allow a gradual
      extension of anesthesia and are suitable for prolonged treatment of postoperative pain.

      It is unclear which anesthetic technique provides better pain relief after cesarean section.

      This prospective, randomized study compares the effectiveness of three types of regional
      anesthetic techniques (Spinal anesthesia, Combined spinal epidural anesthesia, Combined
      spinal epidural anesthesia with indwelling catheter for 24 hrs) on pain after elective
      cesarean section.
