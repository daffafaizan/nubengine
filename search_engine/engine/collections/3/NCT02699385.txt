      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter (when more than one hospital or
      medical school team work on a medical research study) study. The study consists of 3 Phases:
      Screening Phase (-2 to 0 hours prior to baseline on Day 1), Double-blind treatment Phase (up
      to 7 Days) and follow-up Phase (7 Days). The duration of participation in the study for each
      participant is at most 15 Days. Efficacy and safety of domperidone will be evaluated.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
