    
      This is a single center, open-label, split-face, prospective study of ten to fifteen subjects
      seeking vascular laser therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate rosacea. Subjects will
      be screened for eligibility for vascular laser therapy outside of the confines of this
      protocol. Once approved for laser, subjects will be screened for study enrollment and topical
      treatment of their rosacea at the Screening/Baseline visit. All subjects will receive Finacea
      15% gel and will be instructed to apply the study drug to one half of the face, twice daily.
      Drug application will be modified just prior to and after the subjects' laser treatment to
      reduce irritation. Subjects will undergo Vascular Nd:Yag laser therapy to involved areas over
      the whole face two weeks after initiating Finacea treatment. Subjects will continue to use
      Finacea gel to one half of the face for the duration of the study. Assessment of acneiform
      lesions, redness, and telangiectasias will be performed at Screening/Baseline, Week 2 (prior
      to laser treatment), and week 6/End of Study. Photography will be performed at
      Screening/Baseline and End of Study visits. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit,
      and a patient survey will be completed at Baseline and at Week 6/End of Study visits.
