fetal and neonatal hepatitis and its consequences.the author reports on 18 fatal cases observedin infants from 3 weeks to 1 year old.in all cases, jaundice appeared just after birthor during the first days of life, andwas persistent.  the stools were sometimesdiscolored.  there was no blood incompatibility.the picture was similar to thatof congenital biliary atresia.  pathologicalstudy revealed 2 groups: (1) with pathologicalchanges of hepatitis (11 cases).the liver is enlarged, flabby and icteric.  microscopyshows dissociation of the cellcords and polymorphism of the hepatic cells(necrotic cells, balloon cells, giant celltransformation).  some of the giant cells showvacuoles, erythrocytes, lipids andacidophilic material in their cytoplasm.  thereare signs of regeneration, collapseof the stromal framework, proliferation of themesenchymal cells and bile retention.cells of the erythrocytic series are scatteredin the periportal spaces with eosinophilicleucocytes, lymphocytes and histiocytes.(2) with fibrosis and cirrhosis (7cases).  the liver is green, firm, with a nodularor granular surface.  the extra-hepaticbiliary tree is normal.  the spleen isenlarged.  microscopy shows bile stasis,pericholangiolitic fibrosis, and proliferationof bile ductules.  the periportal, interlobularand intralobular fibrous tissue is increased,and shows cellular infiltrations.the architecture of the liver is disturbed bythe presence of pseudolobuli in the regenerationareas.  it is suggested that these casesare due to a congenital viral hepatitis,which is not only the result of an intrauterineinfection, but also a feature offetal hepatitis, with secondary pericholangioliticor post-necrotic liver cirrhosis.the neonatal giant cell hepatitis is to be consideredas the result of a cytotoxic actionof the virus.  the author considers alsothe possibility of a viral etiology incases of biliary atresia on the basis of theirmorphological similarity with congenitalviral hepatitis.
