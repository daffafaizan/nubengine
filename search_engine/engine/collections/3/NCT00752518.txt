      repeatedly relapsed and became refractory. At present, various therapies including other
      multi-drug combination chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, corticosteroid
      massive therapy, interferon therapy, thalidomide therapy, radiation therapy and other
      experimental therapies are conducted exploratory as salvage therapies to find the one to
      which the patient shows response. Considering that the antitumor activity of JNJ-26866138
      against relapsed or refractory MM is clear and and the tolerability is acceptable based on
      results of the overseas clinical studies, the development of JNJ-26866138 in Japan is quite
      meaningful. This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study which
      consisting of the two parts: the Phase I part is intended to intravenously administer
      JNJ-26866138 twice daily for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) to establish the Japanese RD
      based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), while the Phase II part is
      intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-26866138 in patients repeatedly treated
      at the Japanese RD.

      Based on the body surface area calculated before treatment in each cycle, the dose is
      calculated for each patient according to the dose level specified by the Patient Enrollment
      Center (0.7mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2). JNJ-26866138 is intravenously administered once
      daily, twice weekly for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11), followed by a 10-day rest period
      (Days 12 to 21). This is considered one cycle (21 days), and treatment is repeated up to 6
      cycles in patients expected to show a response.
