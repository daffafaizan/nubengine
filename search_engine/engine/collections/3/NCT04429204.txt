      I. To evaluate the simple hypothesis that cryoablation of mesothelioma will promote local
      tumor infiltration by cytotoxic cluster of differentiation 8 positive (CD8+) cells that will
      not be present in ablation naive regions of the tumors.

      II. To determine whether there is a preponderance of T cells in ablated tumor tissue in
      comparison to non-cryoablated tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      At the time of standard of care pleural biopsy, patients undergo cryoablation over 30
      minutes, then a sample of tissue from the ablated region and a non-ablated (tumor negative
      control) region are collected.
