      revascularization after introduction of DES, post-DES restenosis still occur and the
      treatment for DES failure is challenging. However, there have been little data for
      therapeutic strategy for post-DES restenosis, especially diffuse type ISR. Therefore, we need
      the well-designed randomized trial to achieve the best therapeutic option for the treatment
      of diffuse type post-DES restenosis.
