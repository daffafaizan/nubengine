    
      Rationale:

      AV port reversal (AVPR) has been demonstrated to increase recirculation in venous catheters
      used in ICU for CVVH. The effects of this frequently used manoeuvre have not been described
      in the setting of CVVH using regional citrate anticoagulation.

      Objective:

      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of AVPR on recirculation, clearance,
      post-filter ionized calcium and subsequently citrate dosing.

      Study design and methods:

      Open trial studying the effect of AVPR in patients undergoing citrate CVVH. After measurement
      in standard catheter configuration, AVPR is performed after which effects on catheter
      recirculation, clearance, citrate dosing and post-filter ionized calcium (iCa) are monitored.

      Sample sites:

      Arterial line, arterial (pre-filter) port, postfilter port (after postdilution and calcium
      compensation), effluent sample. All flow rates to be noted.

      Study population:

      Twelve patients admitted to intensive care, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy
      (CRRT) for AKI. Patients are preferably anuric and have achieved good metabolic control under
      CVVH before inclusion in the study.
