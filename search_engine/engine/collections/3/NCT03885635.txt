      there is equipoise in available literature with regards to the best operative strategy and
      patient selection criteria. Hemiarch repair is current standard of care in most centers but
      extended arch repair is gaining popularity aiming to address early post-operative
      malperfusion and improve long term aortic remodeling.

      HEADSTART is a randomized controlled prospective trial of patients presenting to
      participating institutes with acute DeBakey 1 aortic dissection. Patients will be enrolled
      and randomized into one of two groups - 'hemiarch repair' and 'extended arch repair'.
      Pre-operative, early post-operative and long term follow clinical and CT imaging data will be
      collated on a centralized database and at a core lab respectively.
