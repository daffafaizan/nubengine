    
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent rheumatic disease in the world and its treatment is
      still relatively limited. The efficacy of platelet rich plasma (PRP) for treatment of
      osteoarthritis of knees has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Numerous studies
      published in literature show a good potential of PRP in treatment of osteoarthritis. However,
      results are not yet consistent due to methodological gaps such as lack of control, inadequate
      controls, inadequate assessment tools, inadequate matching for interventions, insufficient
      description of design and way of obtaining PRP.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy of autologous PRP injections guided by
      ultrasound for treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

      Patients will be randomized into three groups for ultrasound guided knee infiltrations: the
      first group will receive PRP, the second group will receive plasma and the third group will
      receive a placebo of physiological solution. All patients will be assessed using Visual
      Analog Pain Scale, WOMAC (Western Ontario McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index), Knee
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, conventional radiography, ultrasonography, and
      follow the standardization of results for clinical trials in Osteoarthritis (OMERACT-OARSI).
      Patients will be evaluated during clinical follow-up after 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks.
