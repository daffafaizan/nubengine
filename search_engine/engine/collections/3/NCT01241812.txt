      and strength analyses by the same blinded assessor, complete self-report questionnaires, and
      have blood and urine samples drawn. Participants will then be randomized into either: (i)
      exercise; or (ii) usual care (no additional treatment). Those in the exercise group will
      complete 10-weeks of strengthening targeting lower limb muscles. Once weekly, they will
      consult with the study physiotherapist (MAH) at UBC to ensure proper performance and safe
      progression of exercises. Participants will be given cuff weights and resistance bands to
      complete exercises at home five times per week. Exercise compliance will be monitored using
      log books. All participants will be encouraged to maintain their usual treatment regimen
      (except for exercises completed by the exercise group), but will document any unexpected
      alterations such as medication changes or physician visits.
