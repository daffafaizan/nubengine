      biological parameters that help clinicians to make the right diagnosis.

      Sepsis concerns patients with infection associated with a systemic inflammatory response.
      While this inflammatory profile is observed in many clinical situations in the ED, the
      challenge is to characterize in these patients suspected of sepsis those who have a real
      infection.

      Currently, no individual biomarker of sepsis is sufficiently discriminant. The objective of
      this study is to measure in patients suspected of sepsis in the emergency department, a
      combination of biomarkers (covering several distinct pathophysiological pathways) that could
      provide high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnostic and prognostic. The originality
      of this study is that compared with patients admitted to intensive care units, patients
      investigated for suspected sepsis in the ED are seen earlier in their medical history and
      usually before any therapeutic intervention (intravenous fluids, antibiotics, catecholamines)
      interfering with several biomarkers of interest.
