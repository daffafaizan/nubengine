      I. To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a study of two positive activities intended to
      improve the psychological and interpersonal well-being of cancer patients from collectivist
      cultures.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily assess changes in psychological, interpersonal, and physical well-being
      of the intervention patients and caregivers compared to control patients and caregivers.

      II. To preliminarily assess changes in psychological, interpersonal, and physical well-being
      of patients and caregivers who are members of collectivist cultures (African American, Asian
      American, or Latino/Hispanic) compared to patients and caregivers who are members of
      individualist (European American) cultures.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore mechanisms through which the interventions may improve psychological and
      interpersonal well-being.

      their caregivers who have helped with their treatment or recovery.
