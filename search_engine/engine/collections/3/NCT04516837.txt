      immunosuppressants and/or steroids might increase patients' susceptibility of virus
      infections. To minimize ITP patients' risk during the COVID-19 global crisis and to improve
      treatment efficacy, this treatment regimen of eltrombopag plus recombinant human
      thrombopoietin (rhTPO) should be investigated.

      Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is a full-length glycosylated-TPO produced by
      Chinese hamster ovary cells, which showed its effectiveness in ITP in a variety of studies.

      Eltrombopag, a small molecule agonist of thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-RA), was recommended as
      the subsequent treatment for ITP patients, which also already showed robust efficacy.

      Both eltrombopag and rhTPO demonstrated good safety in ITP patients. Since they increase the
      number of platelets through different mechanisms, and previous studies demonstrated that they
      might exert synergic effect. The investigators hypothesized that the combination of these two
      agents could be a promising option for ITP treatment.

      This study aimed to evaluate the sustained responses and safety of eltrombopag plus rhTPO as
      treatment for corticosteroid-resistant or relapsed ITP patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
