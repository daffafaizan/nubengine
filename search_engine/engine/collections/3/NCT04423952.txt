      350 million people worldwide and thus be an important cause of medical consultation and
      prescription drugs.

      The medical care of chronic otitis is difficult, despite several medical and surgical
      treatment options. Moreover this pathology is often recurrent.

      The completion of a standardized questionnaire to track symptoms objectively over time is
      fundamental to verify the efficacy of specific treatments and to compare treatments.

      The quality of life measurement questionnaire related to chronic otitis media (COMQ-12) is a
      new questionnaire, validated in English, to assist the physician in evaluating chronic otitis
      media.

      The original version of the COMQ12 questionnaire, in English, was developed by Phillips et
      al.. The construction of this questionnaire was based on three other questionnaires : the
      Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome-15 (COMOT-15), and the Chronic
      Otitis Media-5 (COM-5). The initial validation of the English version of Phillips et al. was
      evaluated with an alpha value of Cronbach to 0.889, which shows high internal consistency and
      would allow its use in several reputed international centers of otology.

      The objective of this study is to translate and validate the test in French in children.
