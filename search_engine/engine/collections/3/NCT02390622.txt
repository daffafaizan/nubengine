      developed unexplained high fever, bloating, nausea, vomit, a high stoma output or diarrhea in
      the color of yellow-green with copious amounts of mucus leading to dehydration and
      tachycardia after short time of operation (2-4d).We got the etiology diagnosis from all the
      patients' gastric juice cultures which revealed MRSA.Vancocin cp had a dissatisfied effect,so
      FMT was supplied for treating MRSA.All the patients had a decreased intestinal flora species
      before FMT and the content of staphylococcus aureus almost reached half of total intestinal
      flora . Patients' gut bacteria after FMT gradually agree with the donors' reflected the
      alleviative symptoms.
