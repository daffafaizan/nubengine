        -  Determine whether there is a clinically relevant difference in bone mineral density
           (BMD) at 2 years in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer (with or without
           osteopenia or osteoporosis) treated with exemestane vs anastrozole on protocol
           CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, companion study. Patients are stratified according to
      baseline bone mineral density (BMD) measurement (T-score* â‰¥ -2.0 standard deviation [SD] [no
      osteopenia or osteoporosis] vs T-score* < -2.0 SD).

      NOTE: *The lowest of the two T-scores: L1-L4 or total hip

      Blood samples for the identification of bone biomarkers (formation marker: serum
      amino-terminal procollagen 1 extension peptide [P1NP] and resorption marker: serum
      N-telopeptide) are obtained at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. BMD is determined by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at baseline and then annually for 5 years (or for as
      long as patient is receiving treatment on protocol CAN-NCIC-MA27).

      Patients receive oral calcium and oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D) daily. Patients with
      osteopenia or osteoporosis (stratum II) also receive oral bisphosphonate therapy

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 408 patients will be accrued for this study.
