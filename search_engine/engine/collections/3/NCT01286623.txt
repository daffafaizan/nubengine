      will occur; all samples will be collected at their routine visits to the pharmacology clinic.
      All blood samples and results will be managed by the routine clinical laboratory at Chelsea
      and Westminster Hospital, with the exception of the assessment of the hsCRP. The latter is a
      marker of inflammation that is measured to be able to add more information when
      cardiovascular risk is assessed. The blood sample for this test is sent to a laboratory in
      London called The Doctors Laboratory (TDL). All shipped samples are anonymous and patient
      names will not be disclosed outside the Hospital.

      The clinical visits will be scheduled approximately once within one year. However, extra
      visits may be clinically necessary if a clinical condition requires proper follow-up.
      Furthermore, clinical details will be marked to show patients have agreed to their use for
      this research study.
