      renal disease (ESRD). Preliminary data suggest that IGIV therapy could have significant
      benefits in modifying allograft rejection episodes, stabilizing long-term allograft function,
      and reducing ischemia/reperfusion injury.

      Qualified patients will have an in-vitro assessment of the ability of IGIV-C, 10% to convert
      the donor-specific crossmatch (cytotoxic assay) from positive to negative. Those patients
      with successful in-vitro conversion of the donor-specific crossmatch assay will be randomized
      to receive IGIV-C, 10% intravenously at a dose of either 2 gm/kg, 1 gm/kg, or 0.5 gm/kg.
      IGIV-C, 10% will be administered 3 to 5 days prior to planned transplantation and, if
      transplantation is successful, 7 days post-transplant. If after receiving the IGIV-C infusion
      the donor-specific crossmatch reveals that cell death has fallen to 20% or less above
      background, the crossmatch will be considered negative. If after receiving one infusion the
      crossmatch remains positive, additional IGIV-C infusions may be administered at one-month
      intervals, up to 4 infusions. A repeat crossmatch must be obtained after each infusion.
      Patients will be followed for 12 months post-transplant. Concomitant therapy will include a
      standard immunosuppression regimen of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone
      following induction therapy with thymoglobulin.
