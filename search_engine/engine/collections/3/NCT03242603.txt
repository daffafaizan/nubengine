      NUH. There is experience combining antibody infusion with autologous NK cells in the clinical
      trial with good safety data.

      The proposed trial is a phase I/II study to determine the safety and efficacy of expanded
      activated haploidentical NK cells in combination with anti-GD2 (ch14.18/CHO). We plan to
      enrol patients with high risk or relapsed neuroblastoma with evidence of residual disease who
      are at high risk of recurrence or progression on current treatment.

      In the proposed protocol , we plan to infuse NK cells at escalating dose levels to find the
      optimum dose tolerated by the patients in combination with anti-GD2 (ch14.18/CHO) . There are
      3 NK cell dose levels :

      Dose level 1 (1 x 10^6/kg) , Dose level 2 (1 x 10^7/kg) , Dose level 3 (1 x 10^8/kg)

      If a partial response or stable disease is observed, further infusions of NK cells can be
      administered. There will be intra- and inter - patient dose escalation.

      The donor will be either parent, based on the best NK cell donor as determined by the study
      team. The donor will be harvested and NK cells expanded prior to infusion into the patient
      along with anti-GD2 (ch14.18/CHO).

      The study aims to study safety and efficacy of a combination of NK cells and anti-GD2
      (ch14.18/CHO).
