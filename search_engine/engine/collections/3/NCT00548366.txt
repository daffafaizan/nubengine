        1. Demonstrate that patient acceptance is greater and diuresis faster with a No Added Salt
           diet compared with a Low Sodium diet

        2. Demonstrate that side-effects of diuretic therapy are the same or less when patients are
           on a No Added Salt diet

        3. Determine if glomerular filtration rate estimated from the modified diet in renal
           disease equation differs from that obtained by a 24 hour urinary creatinine in patients
           with cirrhotic ascites
