      Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb), a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis. The clinical and
      immunologic contributions of Mp infection in this setting are unknown, in part because of the
      lack of response of Mp to standard antifilarial therapies. The recent discovery of bacterial
      endosymbionts (Wolbachia) in a number of filarial species, including Mp, has led to new
      therapeutic options for reducing microfilaremia. Volunteers between the ages of 14 and 65
      will be screened in order to identify 240 volunteers (160 Wb+Mp+ and 80 Wb-Mp+) for
      participation in an open label randomized trial of doxycycline (200 mg daily for 6 weeks).
      Wb+Mp+ subjects will then be randomized to receive single dose treatment with albendazole and
      ivermectin 4 months after completion of the doxycycline treatment or no further treatment.
      Clinical, parasitologic and immunologic assessments will be performed prior to the initiation
      of treatment and at 6 months and 1 year and 3 years following initiation of treatment. The
      efficacy of doxycycline treatment in reducing Mp microfilaremia will be assessed in subjects
      with and without Wb coinfection. In addition, the effect of subsequent administration of
      albendazole/ivermectin on Mp clearance will be assessed in coinfected subjects.
