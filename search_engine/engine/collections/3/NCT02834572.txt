      the Intervention Arm (assessment and algorithm to deliver a tailored recommendation) or
      Control (assessment and standard HIV testing information) and followed for 6 months to
      estimate the intervention's potential efficacy in increasing HIV testing. After informed
      consent, participants are asked to provide contact information on the locator form. Then,
      participants complete a brief quantitative assessment including basic demographics, HIV
      testing history and other factors related to HIV testing. All participants, regardless of
      study arm, then receive information about each HIV testing method including how the tests are
      conducted (blood, oral sample), and availability of counseling and support. Participants then
      are randomized into 1 of the 2 study arms. A computer program will randomly assign each
      participant using randomly ordered block sizes of 4 and 6 and stratified by age (16-23, 24-29
      years) to balance groups.

      Participants assigned to the Intervention Arm will complete a brief quantitative assessment
      lasting approximately 2-3 minutes to assess those factors associated with HIV testing and
      thus are needed to complete the algorithm. They then receive the results of the HIV testing
      algorithm, presented as their personalized HIV testing approach. All participants will
      receive information on resources in New York City to test by all of these methods. The
      control participants are provided with the above information about each testing approach but
      without a recommended approach.
