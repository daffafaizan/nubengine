      groups, the participant's right eye will serve as a control with only
      Tropicamide/phenylephrine given. In one group of 10 participants the left eyes will receive
      Alphagan prior to Tropicamide/phenylephrine. In the other group of 10 eyes, the left eyes
      will have Tropicamide/phenylephrine administered prior to Alphagan. The investigator will
      observe the intraocular benefits of the addition of Alphagan over the
      Tropicamide/phenylephrine alone and determine if pre-treating is any better than
      post-treating. In addition, the investigator will monitor pupil response, as it is known that
      Alphagan may have some effect on the pupil dilation.
