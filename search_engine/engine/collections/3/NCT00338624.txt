      or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), randomized (patients are assigned different
      treatments based on chance), parallel group trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of oxybutynin extended release tablets 10 mg per day for 12 weeks in conjunction with an
      alpha-blocker for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The hypothesis of the
      study is that oxybutynin extended release tablets 10 mg plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg will be more
      effective than tamsulosin 0.4 mg plus placebo in the treatment of lower urinary tract
      symptoms as measured by change of the total International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) from
      baseline to Week 12 or the Final Visit. Safety assessments include Peak Flow Rate (PFR) and
      Post-Void Residual (PVR) volume, adverse events, vital signs and physical exams. Patients
      will receive oxybutynin extended release 10 mg plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg or placebo plus
      tamsulosin 0.4 mg every day for 12 weeks.
