    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate an autologous T-cell therapy for advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ET140203 T cells are autologous T cells genetically modified
      to carry a TCR-mimic (TCRm) construct capable of mediating cell killing by targeting tumor
      specific intracellular antigens and addressing solid tumor therapy challenges.
