      high risks for complications. Earlier trials have shown that respiratory restrictions persist
      after the operation as well as lower physical function, range of motion in the rib-cage and
      limitations in activities in daily living. There are, however, only two clinical studies that
      evaluate postoperative breathing exercises and none evaluating any other rehabilitation
      interventions.

      In other types of extensive surgery that may affect mobility with trauma to muscles and bone
      structures in the thorax and thoracic spinal column, there is strong evidence that speaks for
      an active rehabilitation approach in favour of a less active one.

      The intervention evaluated was a rehabilitation program including exercises to restore lung
      function, range of motion in the thoracic spine and shoulders and strength exercises for the
      back extensors, shoulders and legs.
