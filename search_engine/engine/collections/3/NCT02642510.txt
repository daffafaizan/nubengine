    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a structured, DVD educational
      intervention about what to expect during inpatient treatment of a newly diagnosed cancer. The
      focus of the study will be newly diagnosed lymphoma and acute leukemia patients and their
      family members. Outcome variables will be the patient and family member's satisfaction with
      inpatient teaching and anxiety about inpatient treatment.

      The experimental group will watch a DVD educational presentation of information about unit
      routines and activities; leukemia/lymphoma; treatment modalities and procedures; treatment of
      side effects; and patient and family members activities of importance to prevent infection
      and promote well-being during cancer treatment.

      Participants in the control group will receive usual educational teaching by their assigned
      nursing staff.
