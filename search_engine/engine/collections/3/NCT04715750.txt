      brain PET images obtained after application of [18F]PI-2620 with different specific
      activities: 1) High specific activity (low mass dose): 185 MBq containing a maximum mass dose
      of ≤5 μg in up to 10 mL and 2) Low specific activity (high mass dose): 185 MBq containing a
      maximum mass dose of 40-50 μg in up to 10 mL).
