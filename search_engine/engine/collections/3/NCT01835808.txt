    
      Portuguese Study on The Evaluation of FFR Guided Treatment of Coronary Disease (POST-IT9 is a
      national multicentric, prospective, consecutive (non selected) anonymous observational study
      of all patients submitted to coronary angiography and in which functional evaluation with
      pressure-wire of coronary lesions is to be performed. The main purpose of the registry is to
      collect data on the medical decisions and clinical results in CAD patients evaluated with FFR
      (using pressure-wireÂ®, St. Jude Medical), in order to provide evidence in "real world" non
      selected patients. This evidence will add to the already available clinical data from
      randomized trials. All Portuguese interventional cardiology centers performing regularly FFR
      studies were invited to participate in the study. Data will be collected at the time of the
      procedure and patients will be clinically followed-up for 1 year. Information concerning
      medical history, past exams, the angiography, the FFR study and the follow-up will be
      collected on registry forms. The treatment strategy for each patient will be decided by the
      operator physician, according to his best clinical judgment. Changes in treatment strategy
      due to FFR results will be recorded, but the intention of the study is just to collect
      clinical information, and not to influence physician practice. An informed consent form must
      be signed for all patients included. Patients will be free to withdraw this consent at
      anytime.
