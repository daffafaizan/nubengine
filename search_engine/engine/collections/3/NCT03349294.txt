    
      Methods Patients:All patients undergoing thyroidectomy and are about to be treated with
      iodine 131 30mCi will be invited to join the study. Exclusion with gastrointestinal surgery.

      Preparation:The patient of this study, their medication and diet and other matters needing
      attention, are in accordance with the original to accept iodine -131 30mCi treatment of the
      standard treatment.

      Imaging Protocol:After oral administration of iodine 131, patients must undergo whole body
      scan, for 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 168 hours, respectively. Image
      collection will use GE Infinia Hawkeye 4 SPECT / CT with high energy general purpose
      collimator. The imaging parameters use the original I-131 whole body scan protocol.

      Expected results:Image data is further analyzed by MATLAB software to obtain iodine 131 in
      the body of individual organs of the biological half-life and path strength percentage. This
      analysis can revise the iodine -131 biokinetic model of patients with total thyroidectomy,
      providing more accurate calculations and subsequent studies.
