      women and their offspring. Pregnant women attending outpatient obstetrics clinics in Toronto,
      Canada are recruited. The overall study protocol includes four study visits between the
      second half of pregnancy and the first year of infant's life and interim phone call
      interviews:

        -  Pregnant women undergo an oral glucose tolerance test at an expected average of 30 weeks
           of gestation and complete medical and lifestyle questionnaires including food frequency
           questionnaires.

        -  Infant birth anthropometry measurements and human milk samples are collected at an
           expected average of 3 days postpartum. The timing of onset of lactogenesis II is asked
           at 3d, 5d, 7d postpartum or until the event occurrence up to day 7.

        -  At 3 months postpartum, follow-up assessments including infant anthropometry, medical
           and lifestyle questionnaires and human milk sample collection are completed.

        -  Interim telephone interviews are conducted at 6 weeks and 5, 7, 9 months postpartum to
           characterize infant feeding and supplementation behaviors.

        -  At 12 months postpartum, infant anthropometric assessments are conducted.
