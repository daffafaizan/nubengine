      is about 15 to 20% in the general population. It is responsible for a frequent use of
      emergency departments (ED). The usual treatment is based on early administration of an
      association of antihistamines and corticosteroid. The therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids
      has never been established by high evidence studies. However, corticosteroids are frequently
      used. When stopped, corticosteroids could promote the occurence of urticaria recurrences, and
      a transition to chronic urticaria. In addition, corticosteroids may be rarely responsible for
      gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension and diabetes.
