           receptor (NK.1R), glycine receptor (GlyR), neuron nicotinic receptor (nnAChRs),
           Methyl-1-methyl-1-day aspartate (NMDA receptor), and TRPV1 receptor (TRPV1 receptor)
           produce the analgesic efficiency.

        2. propofol was traditional sedation reagent.

        3. index of Nociception (NOX) was the objective index for analgesia This study purpose to
           compare analgesia efficiency of Only Propofol and sevoflurane combine with propofol
           using index of Nociception (NOX)
