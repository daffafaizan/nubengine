      University and were scheduled to undergo the laparoscopic surgery were prospectively included
      and divided into the experimental group and the control group with the random number method.
      After surgery, patients in the experiment group were provided with intravenous fluid
      administration at 1.0ml/Kg/h and encouraged to take food and drink water early after surgery,
      and the intravenous fluid administration was stopped immediately when the oral intake was
      more than 1500ml/h; patients in the control group strictly followed the fasting and were
      provided with the intravenous fluid administration according to "Total amount of fluid =
      physiological requirement + additional loss (fever + gastrointestinal decompression) + amount
      lost" until their intestinal function completely recovered. The blood volume change
      indicators (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, oxyhemoglobin saturation, inferior vena cava
      diameter /body surface area (VCD), intra-abdominal pressure, specific gravity of urine, BNP,
      etc.) and inflammation indicators (CRP, IL-6, TNF-a) of the two groups of patients were
      observed and a comparison was made of the recovery time of intestinal function, incidence of
      complications, hospitalization time after operation and hospitalization expenses of the two
      groups.
