        -  Compare the ability of a single fraction of radiation therapy vs multiple fractions to
           provide complete pain relief in patients with painful bone metastases from breast or
           prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the frequency and duration of pain relief and narcotic relief after these
           treatments in these patient populations.

        -  Compare the effect on quality of life of these two treatments in these patient
           populations.

        -  Compare the incidence of pathologic fracture within the treatment fields after these two
           treatments in these patient populations.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I consists of radiation therapy delivered
      in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. Arm II consists of a single dose of radiation therapy. Any
      retreatment does not occur until at least 4 weeks after prior treatment unless there is an
      increase of 2 points on the pain score.

      Patients are followed and quality of life is assessed at 2 and 4 weeks, then at 2, 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months, every 6 months for the next 3 years, then annually until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 938 patients within 2 years.
