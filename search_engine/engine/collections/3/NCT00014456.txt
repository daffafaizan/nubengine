        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel in combination with gemcitabine and
           filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity associated with this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the objective anti-tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine fatigue and blood cytokines in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 2 and
      continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Fatigue is assessed at baseline and then at weeks 2, 5, 7, and 9 during therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-22
      months.
