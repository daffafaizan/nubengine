      and ended up to 6 months later. If available, retrospective data on vitamin D treatment as
      well as on the incidence of hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia in the 6 months leading up
      to paricalcitol treatment were also collected. Eight visits were planned for documentation of
      prospective data. In accordance with the non-interventional character of the study, only
      diagnostic and monitoring procedures were applied which are part of the routine medical care
      of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
