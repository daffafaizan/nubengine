      diseases like choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy has
      been demonstrated in a series of publications. Therefore intravitreally applied VEGF
      antagonists have been used in the treatment of CNV in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
      and diabetic cases. Three anti-VEGFs are available: Macugen® (Pegaptanib), Avastin®
      (Bevacizumab) and Lucentis® (Ranibizmab). Pegaptanib sodium is an aptamer designed to bind
      the VEGF 165 isoform with high affinity. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to
      VEGF designed for intravenous administration and approved for the treatment of colorectal
      cancer. Ranibizumab is an anti-body binding site fragment that is derived from the same
      anti-VEGF antibody as bevacizumab. The decrease of retinal thickness measured in the OCT
      provides information concerning the amount of intraretinal fluid accumulation and therefore
      for the activity of a neovascular lesion. It has been proven that the aqueous humor levels of
      VEGF of eyes with CNV are significantly higher than those of eyes without ocular or systemic
      diseases. The retinal thickness and the VEGF concentration in the aqueous humor should give a
      good correlation to the anti vasogenic effect of the intravitreal treatment. In this study
      bevacizumab and pegaptanib as monotherapy should be compared with a combined therapy of
      bevacizumab applied first with pegaptanib used for retreatment. The benefit of this combined
      therapy should be that an initial blockage of all VEGF isoforms is necessary whereas for
      retreatment the blockage of the most important isoform in the pathogenesis of CNV is
      sufficient and the normal function of the retinal pigment epithelium and the choriocapillaris
      is not affected.
