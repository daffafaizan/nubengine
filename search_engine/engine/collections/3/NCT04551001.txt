        1. Experimental group: using cold forceps for polyps <=3mm of the colon

        2. Control group: using cold snare for polyps <=3mm of the colon

        3. Methods:

             1. Colonoscopy will be performed in the same standard of care manner as if no study
                was taking place.

             2. If polyps <=3mm are identified, the endoscopist is randomized to performing
                polypectomy with cold forcep or cold snare.

             3. After removal of the polypectomy, two biopsies are performed at the margin of the
                polypectomy site to identify residual lesion.

             4. The polyp as well as well as the two biopsies are reviewed by a pathologist.
