      and illicit opioid use per year. There is inherent risk for patients to develop addiction
      when prescribing opiates for pain relief, and methods to reduce its use or the amount
      prescribed can help mitigate this risk.

      Surgery is one of the leading causes for prescribing narcotics to control pain. Patients
      undergoing rhinoplasty are often prescribed a short course of opiates during the acute post
      surgical phase. Intraoperative sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block has been successfully and
      safely used in endoscopic sinus surgery, and has been shown to decrease narcotic use and
      inpatient hospital stay time.

      The investigators are interested in determining if use of SPG block may offer an improved
      strategy to reducing the use of narcotics for post rhinoplasty/septoplasty pain relief. The
      investigators hypothesize that SPG block will reduce the amount of post operative opiates
      required for pain control.

      The study population will include patients undergoing rhinoplasty/septoplasty at Keck Medical
      Center of USC who are able to provide consent. The study will include two arms: SPG block
      (experimental) and placebo saline injection (control). Patients' post operative pain scale
      and narcotic use will be recorded until first follow-up visit (2 weeks). Patient
      demographics, surgical indication, and intraoperative analgesia will be recorded. T-tests
      will be conducted between patient groups. ANOVA will be used to analyze other factors that
      may be associated with decreased narcotic use.
