      glaucoma specialist on day 1, week 1,2,3,4, month 3 and 6 after surgery. The glaucoma
      specialist will evaluate the bleb appearance according to a standardized protocol. At the
      same time points the bleb will be imaged with the spectral domain optical coherence
      tomography, to monitor bleb changes objectively. The investigators hope to see signs of bleb
      incapsulation and scarring earlier and then treat the patient accordingly.
