      cell antibodies and recently diagnosed (less than 6 weeks) will be included in this study.
      Peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells will be mobilized from bone marrow of the patient
      with cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor), collected by
      leukapheresis and cryopreserved. After 2-3 weeks, high dose immunosuppression is given
      (cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg plus rabbit antithymocyte globulin 4.5 mg/kg) and stem cells are
      thawed and injected intravenously. This procedure is performed in isolated rooms at the Bone
      Marrow Transplantation Unit of the School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São
      Paulo, Brazil. Patients are discharged from the hospital after engraftment and closely
      followed up to 2 months after transplantation (with at least weekly outpatient visits) and
      continue the followup for 5 years after transplantation. Clinical, hematological, metabolical
      and immunological evaluations are performed to analyse the effect of the transplant in the
      disease and in the hematopoetic and immunologic systems of the body. Patients fitting the
      inclusion criteria but not agreeing to perform the transplantation are the control group and
      they will be followed in parallel with transplanted patients.
