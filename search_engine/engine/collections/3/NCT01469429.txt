      I. Determine the adherence of post-surgical head and neck (HN) cancer patients to clinical
      trial design expectations and define tolerability and potential adverse effects of long-term
      black raspberry administration in this patient cohort.

      II. Determine the effects of dose and delivery vehicle on the degree of uptake of black
      raspberry components in target oral tissues of post-surgical HN cancer patients over time and
      determine the relationships between adherence/exposure data and uptake.

      III. Determine the ability of black raspberries to modulate patterns of gene expression
      within key regulatory pathways in "at-risk normal" oral mucosa of post-surgical HN cancer
      patients that would favor the inhibition, delay or reversal of oral carcinogenesis.

      IV. Determine the persistence of modulation of "berry-responsive genes" for 2 years following
      commencement of black raspberry treatment and preliminarily define rate of recurrence and
      second primary oral cancers in a former oral cancer patient sub-cohort.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive lozenge placebo orally (PO) four times daily (QID).

      ARM II: Patients receive lyophilized black raspberries lozenge PO QID.

      ARM III: Patients receive Saliva Substitute placebo PO QID.

      ARM IV: Patients receive lyophilized black raspberries Saliva Substitute PO QID.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 6 months. Oral cavity scrapings, blood, urine, and
      saliva samples are collected periodically for laboratory analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, some patients are followed up at weeks 1-5 and then at
      2, 6, 12, and 18 months.
