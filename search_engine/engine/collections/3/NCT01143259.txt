      function. Alvimopan is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that blocks
      mu-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract but does not compromise central nervous
      system-mediated opioid-based analgesia. Length of stay is an important surrogate measure of
      quality after colon surgery and the most common reason for prolonged Length of Stay after
      abdominal surgery is delayed gastrointestinal recovery (postoperative ileus).

      The Food and Drug Administration has approved alvimopan (dosed preoperatively and twice daily
      postoperatively for up to 15 in-hospital doses) for the acceleration of upper and lower
      gastrointestinal recovery after partial bowel resection with primary anastomosis. In the 5
      phase III alvimopan efficacy trials, a simple standardized accelerated postoperative care
      pathway was used rather than a comprehensive, multidisciplinary colon surgery care process
      model that is used by Intermountain Healthcare. In the most recently completed alvimopan
      phase III trial, the mean postoperative length of stay was 5.2 days whereas the mean length
      of stay at Intermountain Healthcare is 4.4 days without the addition of alvimopan to the
      multidisciplinary colon care process model.

      This trial will investigate if the addition of alvimopan to the Intermountain Healthcare
      multidisciplinary care process can decrease length of stay compared with the
      multidisciplinary care process plus placebo.
