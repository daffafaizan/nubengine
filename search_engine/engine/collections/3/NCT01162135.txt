      on inhibiting PCa progression as measured by PSADT. The participants will take study drug
      digoxin, which is approved by FDA for the treatment of CHF, 125 or 250 mcg orally daily,
      titrated to the level of 0.8 - 2 ng/ml for total of 6 cycles (4 weeks/cycle). The lower dose
      of digoxin (such as 125 mcg/day) will be chosen if serum level reaches 0.8 ng/ml already.
      Patients may continue another 6 cycles if evident of clinical benefit.
