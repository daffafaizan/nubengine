      prediction of thoracic skin epidural depth (SED) might increase the success rate and decrease
      complications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most comprehensive imaging modality of
      the spine, and the measurements derived can be more accurate.

      The present study is based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based measurements to evaluate
      the thoracic SED and define the ratio between the straight and inclined SED at the two
      thoracic levels (T6-7 and T9-10) in children.
