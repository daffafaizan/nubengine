      Diabetes is one of the rapidly growing chronic health conditions across the world. Healthcare
      providers still continue to face difficulties in delivering optimal care and education
      worldwide. Thus, continuing education is needed to improve Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices
      of physicians.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a continuing education (CE) program on the
      Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of primary health care physicians (HCPs) towards a high
      quality of diabetes care.

      Design and Methods:

      This is a quasi-experimental design composed of pre-test post-test uncontrolled experimental
      design. The study will include all PHC physicians registered in health sectors of Abha and
      Khamis Musheet cities, Aseer Region. The physicians will be invited to attend a CE program.
      All participants will fill out a questionnaire before and after the intervention. The change
      in knowledge and attitudes of the participants will be measured at the end of the program.
      After 4 months, the practice of physicians will be assessed through retrospective review of
      patient's files.

      Impact:

      Education programs could positively influence the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of
      healthcare workers toward a high quality of diabetes care, which in turn plays a major role
      in improving clinical outcomes.
