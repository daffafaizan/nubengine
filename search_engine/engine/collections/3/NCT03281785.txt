      on diaphragmatic thickness using ultrasonography and the relation between time of mechanical
      ventilation and the percentage of change of diaphragmatic thickness in head trauma patients
      subjected for mechanical ventilation (>2 days) intensive care unit.

      Modes of ventilation will be used in the study are:

        -  Pressure controlled mandatory ventilation mode (P-CMV).

        -  Pressure synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation mode (P-SIMV).

        -  Pressure support (PS) mode.
