      crossover study in healthy adults. The study consists of a screening phase and a treatment
      phase during which each volunteer will receive 5 treatments of study drug in a random order
      and separated by a washout period of at least 7 to 14 days. Treatments consist of a single
      oral dose of: A) paliperidone ER pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg,
      fasted; B) the same formulation as A but with food; C) paliperidone-coated ER OROS
      formulation (2 mg eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg, fasted; D) the same formulation as C but with
      food; E) IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1 mg/mL solution, fasted.
      Alternative paliperidone ER formulations are being developed with the aim to increase the
      bioavailability without compromising the favorable effect on the orthostatic hypotension as
      seen with ER OROS paliperidone. Therefore, in this study, the pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties, as well as the effect of food, of 2 alternative paliperidone ER
      formulations using different mechanisms to achieve extended release of the drug will be
      investigated: a multiparticulate ER capsule formulation, containing coated pellets comprised
      of 3 coating layers, with both immediate and extended drug-release properties (pellet
      formulation; drug ratio extended- versus immediate-release layer: 9:1), and an OROS trilayer
      longitudinally compressed tablet formulation (Push-Pull delivery system) (overcoated-OROS
      formulation). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Single doses of
      paliperidone ER pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, fasted; paliperidone ER
      pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast);
      paliperidone-coated OROS ER formulation (2 mg-eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg, fasted;
      paliperidone-coated OROS ER formulation (2 mg-eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg with food (high-fat
      breakfast); IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1 mg/mL solution, fasted.
