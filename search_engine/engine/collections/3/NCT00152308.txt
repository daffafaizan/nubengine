      Either sirolimus or paclitaxel drug-eluting stents have been demonstrated to decrease
      neointima proliferation resulting in a remarkable reduction of restenosis rate. However,
      despite the outstanding results achieved with this novel approach to restenosis, some caveats
      still remain. Although sirolimus markedly decreased the restenosis rate among diabetic
      patients in SIRIUS trial, the benefit of treatment was modest in those diabetics treated with
      insulin as well as with lesions longer than 15 mm located in vessels smaller than 2.5 mm.
      Additionally, in a recent study it was reported that the restenosis rate in high-risk lesions
      such as coronary bifurcations still remains a problem Data from patient populations other
      than those enrolled in randomized trials suggest even more caution in the evaluation of the
      impact of DES on restenosis in the "real world", where the operator must deal with in-stent
      restenosis, bifurcation lesions, chronic total occlusions, small vessels, and long lesions.
      The identification of some of the traditional risk factors for restenosis as important
      predictors for in-DES restenosis could be explained as an insufficient inhibition of tissue
      reaction and neointimal growth by the antiproliferative action of the specific drug or dose
      used. This leads to the inference that an individualized approach should be adopted by
      tailoring the choice and the dosing of eluting drug(s) according to the specific lesion or
      patient characteristics. On the other hand, although drug-eluting stents are currently
      considered as the most effective way to reduce in-stent restenosis, their widespread use is
      hampered by the high costs. Therefore, it is important to develop new methods and techniques
      that would result in a more effective prevention of in-stent restenosis while being available
      for a larger number of patients. These considerations as well as the proven efficacy of
      rapamycin in lowering the rate of coronary restenosis, support the rationality of the concept
      of on-site coating of stents in the catheterization laboratory with individualized doses of
      rapamycin after the clinical and the angiographic profiles of the patient scheduled to
      coronary stenting have been determined
