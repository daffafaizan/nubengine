      exercise adherence and engagement. We hypothesize that class participation rates, physical
      activity counts, and self-reported exercise participation levels will be higher at 4 months
      for participants in the CORTEX condition relative to the Control condition. We also predict
      that pre-intervention training will demonstrate high feasibility/acceptability, as indicated
      by a thorough process evaluation.

      Primary Aim 2: To determine if integrated general and exercise-specific cognitive training
      improves facets of executive function and exercise-related efficacy judgments. We hypothesize
      that participants in the CORTEX condition will show faster reaction times and greater
      accuracy for trained and untrained-domain-relevant tasks, including dual task performance,
      reasoning, and thought-stopping at post-booster testing and 4-month follow-up. Furthermore,
      we hypothesize that CORTEX participants will show significantly higher levels of exercise
      efficacy judgments, and exhibit greater automaticity (faster reaction times) in making those
      judgments, at post-booster testing, 1 month and 4-month follow-up.

      Secondary Aim 1: We will use longitudinal mediation analyses to examine mechanisms of change
      brought about by the cognitive training effects on exercise adherence and engagement. We
      hypothesize that changes in efficacy and use of self-regulatory strategies will mediate
      cognitive training effects on exercise adherence over 4-months.
