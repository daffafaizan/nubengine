      surgical research in the operating room. In contrast to pre and postop process optimization
      with tools like the World Health Organization (WHO) checklist or the Enhanced Recovery after
      Surgery (ERAS) protocol intraoperative processes tend to be poorly defined especially in rare
      and complex visceral surgery (e.g. esophageal, pancreatic rectal resection, sarcoma surgery,
      revisional bariatric surgery). This leads to delay, increased stress of the operating team
      and increased intraoperative mistakes and eventually increased complication rates. From
      previous investigations we know that step by step planning and briefing of the entire OR Team
      can reduce operative interruptions. With the development of a dedicated planning tool which
      allows to create and distribute step by step protocols for rare and complex visceral surgical
      procedures to the entire OR Team we hope to decrease delays and reduce OR time variance.

      Objective: Development and implementation of a planning tool for rare and complex visceral
      surgical procedures.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: (delay/variability) operative times as defined as time from skin
      incision to skin closure

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Costs

        -  Influence of preoperative augmented planning on degree of and quality of teaching

        -  Level of stress of each operating team member

        -  Number of intraoperative mistakes

        -  Number and severity of intraoperative and postoperative complications
