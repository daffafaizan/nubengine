      (SCRD). The central hypothesis is that mantra meditation (independent variable) will be
      associated with improvement on 1 or more tests of behaviorally measured sustained attention
      (dependent variable). The mantra in this study is the syllable "um" and is not assigned any
      spiritual, religious, or affective meaning. The mantra is repeated aloud together by the
      subject and the PI for a duration of 30 minutes in each session. This procedure constitutes
      meditation for the purposes of this study. There are 9 session of meditation (3 times per
      week for 3 weeks). Attention is measured in each of these sessions as well as in 3 separate
      testing sessions that precede the intervention period.
