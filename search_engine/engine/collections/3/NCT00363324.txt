      for acute myocardial infarction are randomized to receive bone-marrow derived stem cells or
      sham-infusion at the time percutaneous coronary intervention of the target vessel. The
      end-points are many arrhythmia risk variables, suchs as heart rate variability, T-wave
      alternans and many ECG variables as well as systolic and diastolic left ventricular function.
