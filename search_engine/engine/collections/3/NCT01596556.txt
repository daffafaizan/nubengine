      They will arrive to our lab four or five times. During their first visit they will go through
      a VO2 max test in order to evaluate their aerobic fitness, and their physiological
      efficiency. During their second visit all subjects will go through the same test after
      exposure to nicotine. During the smokers' third visit they will go through the same test,
      after exposure to cigarette smoking. During the non-smokers third visit and the smokers
      fourth visit - they will go through an exercise heat tolerance test without prior smoking.
      During the fifth visit the smokers will go through an exercise heat tolerance test after
      exposure to cigarette smoking. During the smokers' sixth visit and the non-smokers fourth
      visit they will go through an HTT after exposure to nicotine.
