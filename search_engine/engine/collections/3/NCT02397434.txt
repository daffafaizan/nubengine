      Radiation up to a median dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions will be delivered with IMAT to the
      pelvic lymph node regions. If there is a positive surgical margin, the operative bladder bed
      will be included in the radiation field. A simultaneous integrated boost to 64 Gy to the
      positive lymph nodes will be delivered. Pathological evaluation on cystectomy specimen
      includes: tumor stage and grade, area of necrosis (absolute and relative), micro vessel
      density, epidermal growth factor receptor.
