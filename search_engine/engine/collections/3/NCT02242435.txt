    
      A total of approximately 320 male or female subjects, aged from 40 to 85 years, with OA knee
      pain, will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 across two study arms, to receive three (3) IA
      injections of either the active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or a placebo injection at Baseline (Day
      0) and Weeks 2 and 4 after confirming eligibility regarding the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      listed below. Enrollment of Kellgren subjects will be limited to Kellgren III and IV only.

      There will be seven (7) in-clinic visits and three (3) phone visits. Subjects will receive
      three (3) IA injections of active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and
      Weeks 2 and 4. Subjects will also attend in-clinic visits at Week 6, Week 12, Week 20, Week
      24 (final assessment). Post-treatment follow-up telephone calls will be made to each subject
      within 24 hours of each IA injection (Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2 and 4) with each call
      documented.

      The clinical effects of treatment on OA knee pain will be evaluated during clinic visits at
      Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 20, and 24 using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis
      Index (WOMAC®) osteoarthritis Index 3.1 (pain subscore and function subscore) and an overall
      global severity assessment (Subject's Global Assessment [PGA]).
