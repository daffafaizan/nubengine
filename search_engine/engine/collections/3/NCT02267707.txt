    
      There are 2 treatment cohorts in this study based on the predose total bilirubin levels on
      Cycle 1 Day 1 (Cohort 1 > 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal [ULN] to 3 x ULN bilirubin and Cohort 2
      > 3 x ULN to 5 x ULN). Enrollment of subjects into Cohort 2 will only proceed after a review
      of the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data for all subjects in Cohort 1 has been completed
      by the Safety Monitoring Committee. The study is following a 3+3 dose escalation scheme
      within each dose level cohort group. A total of 3 subjects will initially be enrolled to the
      starting dose level in each cohort. The dose of the study regimen in each cohort will be
      escalated (or reduced) according to tolerability.
