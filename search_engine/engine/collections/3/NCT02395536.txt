    
      RIO 2 is a two arm, randomized, prospective, un-blinded, multicenter, non-significant risk
      study. The primary objective for RIO 2 will be assessed by randomizing subjects to receive
      their LINQ™ insertion in the office setting or in the traditional hospital environment.
      Moving the LINQ™ insertion procedure to the office setting is not expected to decrease the
      complication rate compared to in hospital insertion procedures, however, moving the LINQ™
      insertion procedure out of the traditional hospital setting may benefit the patient and
      reduce the burden to the healthcare system.
