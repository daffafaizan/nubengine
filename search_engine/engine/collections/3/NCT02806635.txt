      poverty level) - many of whom are also African American, Hispanic/Latino, or rural couples -
      face numerous challenges to their relationships. Chief amongst those challenges are: 1)
      higher risk of relationship problems and 2) lack of access to effective relationship services
      to prevent or intervene with relationship distress. Compared to higher-income couples, LI
      married and cohabiting couples are significantly more likely to divorce or separate and
      report lower relationship quality. Unfortunately, LI couples are least likely to receive
      interventions to prevent or solve relationship problems. To overcome these barriers, we
      propose to test the effectiveness of two effective web-based curricula - OurRelationship and
      PREP Online.

      A total of 750 LI couples will be recruited nationwide and randomly assigned to the PREP
      Online program, the OurRelationship program, or a wait-list control group and followed for
      six months. Once randomly assigned to group, couples will be assessed at one month, two
      months, four months, and six months following randomization. After couples randomized to the
      wait-list control group finish their waiting period, they will be able to select the program
      they would like to complete (OurRelationship or ePREP) but will not complete research
      assessments during or following their participation in the program. Interested couples can
      find out more information (and sign up for the study) at www.OurRelationship.com
