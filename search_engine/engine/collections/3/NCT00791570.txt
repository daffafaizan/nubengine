      that peptides derived from these receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific
      CTL response in vitro and vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the
      safety, immunological and clinical response of those peptides. Patients will be vaccinated
      once a week for 12 weeks. On each vaccination day, VEGFR1 peptide (1mg) and VEGFR2 peptide
      (1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection. In the
      study, our primary aim is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of these peptide vaccine.
      The second aim is evaluate the immunological and clinical response of this vaccine therapy.
