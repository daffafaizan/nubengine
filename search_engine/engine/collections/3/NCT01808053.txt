      healthcare costs threatening independent living. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a growing
      health epidemic and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and cost. Mayo Clinic
      and Preventice have developed a non-invasive, minimally obtrusive, interactive remote
      monitoring platform. It enables on-body monitoring and integration of ECG, heart rate,
      breathing, and activity, with measures of weight and blood pressure. It is designed as a
      platform for physician directed patient self-management. This technology may be useful in
      monitoring CHF patients. Our overall objective is to adapt, refine, test and validate this
      technology in subjects in an independent living center, with wireless transmission of data to
      a central data analysis hub.
