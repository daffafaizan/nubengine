      Primary:

      Evaluate the impact of the Get REAL and HEEL research program (standardized combination of
      aerobic and resistance training) on change in V02peak from pre to post 16-week intervention.

      Secondary:

      Evaluate the impact of the GR&H program (standardized combination of aerobic and resistance
      training) on change in cardiorespiratory function, immunology, physical function parameters,
      cognition, balance, and patient-reported outcomes from pre to post 16-week intervention.

      Evaluate changes in all measures annually over the 5 year follow-up period.

      Report on enrollment, recruitment, and attrition.

      Exploratory Objectives

      The investigator's exploratory aims are focused on evaluating the impact of exercise on
      biomarkers: (1) aging - p16INK4a, (2) total leukocyte, lymphocyte (T cells and natural killer
      cells), monocyte and neutrophil counts and T cell proliferation assays, natural killer
      cytotoxicity assays, and cytokine production from stimulated neutrophils and monocytes, and
      (3) circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will complete pre-intervention assessments, questionnaires and blood draw at
      week 1 and 2 pre-intervention, followed by a 16-week aerobic and resistance training exercise
      program (intervention). Participants will complete assessments, questionnaires and blood
      draws at week 1 and 2 following the intervention and then again at 6 months and 12 months
      following intervention. Questionnaires only will be administered at year 2, 3,4 and 5
      following intervention.
