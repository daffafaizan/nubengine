      disability. Regaining function requires learning through repetitive movements and activities
      of daily living(ADLs).

      The aim of the study in this application is to test the usability of the system in
      specialized rehabilitation hospital settings. In this first stage of development, after
      developing and testing the system together with expert physiotherapists, we will examine the
      system for usability (is it "user friendly"), comfort level, and therapeutic efficacy.

      The system consists of an ordinary PC computer, specially written software, and a
      commercially available force feedback joystick. (Force feedback joysticks, are usually used
      for gaming; they contain miniature motors that allow the joystick to either help or resist
      the movements of the person using it). Patients who are unable to grasp the joystick will use
      a specially built arm rest that is attached to an ordinary office chair without wheels.
      Patients rest their forearm on the arm rest and thus can manipulate the joystick by means of
      movement of the shoulder and elbow joints instead of by movements of the wrist, since wrist
      movements are often difficult for brain damaged individuals.
