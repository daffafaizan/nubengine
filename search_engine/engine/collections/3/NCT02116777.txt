      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      temozolomide when combined with a dose of talazoparib (BMN 673) given once daily for 5 days
      after a one day dose of BMN 673 administered orally (either once daily or twice daily), every
      28 days to children with refractory or recurrent solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To define and
      describe the toxicities of BMN 673 given with temozolomide administered on this schedule.
      (Phase I) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of BMN 673 and temozolomide when given in
      combination to children with refractory or recurrent cancer. (Phase I) IV. To define the
      antitumor activity of BMN 673 when given with temozolomide in recurrent/refractory Ewing
      sarcoma.(Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of BMN 673 and temozolomide in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors within the confines of a phase I study.

      II. To explore possible predictive biomarkers in archival tumor tissue from Ewing sarcoma
      patients in Phase II.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-6 and
      temozolomide PO QD on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
