    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Find maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) for the combination therapy of ixazomib (ixazomib
      citrate) and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride)/doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride)
      (i.e. dose pairs of ixazomib and gemcitabine/doxorubicin that have an acceptable target
      toxicity rate of 30%). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the dose-limiting toxicities of the dose pairs found. II. Choose a dose pair for
      phase II expansion in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      III. Determine the objective response rate and median survival for patients treated on the
      phase II expansion.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO), gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
