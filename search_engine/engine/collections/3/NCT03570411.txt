    
      T-SPOT response will be measured using the results from the T-SPOT.CMV blood test in both HCT
      recipients and HCT donors.

      A blood sample for the T-SPOT.CMV blood test will be collected from the HCT donor prior to
      transplant.

      Blood specimens will be collected for the T-SPOT.CMV blood test from HCT recipients over the
      course of 6 months, starting weekly at Day +1, biweekly starting at Day +45, and monthly
      starting at day +120.

      HCT recipient participant demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected at
      enrollment. Additional clinical information will be abstracted from the HCT recipient
      participants medical record during the study follow-up period. This will include information
      related to transplant history and outcome, infections, antimicrobial exposure, chemotherapy,
      and laboratory values related to infectious diseases and immunosuppression.

      The feasibility of the T-SPOT.CMV spot count test will be evaluated once the first 30
      participants enrolled on study reach day +90. If 75% of patients have at least 1 evaluable
      samples after engraftment (> 75,000 per microtiter wells), we will proceed with enrollment.
      If more >25% of patients have all their samples deemed not evaluable due to insufficient
      mononuclear cell count (<75,000 per microtiter wells) the study will be stopped and concluded
      as not feasible.
