genetic transcription during morphogenesis .messenger rna's from bacillus subtilis undergoing sporulation,germination, or step-down transition have been characterized andcompared . hybrid competition experiments indicate that these messengersare derived from distinct genetic loci . the results are consistent withthe hypothesis that differential transcription of the genome occursduring morphogenesis . the data also complement previously observedchanges in morphology and enzymatic activity in sporulating bacteria .
