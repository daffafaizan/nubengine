      response duration, and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. II. Assess the
      quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.
      III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DX-8951 in plasma.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
