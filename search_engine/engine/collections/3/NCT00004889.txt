      patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia treated with rituximab. II. Correlate
      expression and changes in expression of CD20 on patient plasma cells and B-cells with
      clinical responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive rituximab IV weekly for 4 weeks.
      Treatment may be repeated 2 months later in patients with stable disease, partial response,
      or complete response. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
