      elusive for many patients treated with standard therapies. The combination of fludarabine, a
      purine analog, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, is an effective and frequently used
      therapy for CLL. However, this drug combination is associated with increased toxicity.
      Lenalidomide has been shown to be less toxic and has been used to treat hematologic
      malignancies including CLL. We propose this Phase I/Phase II study to examine the combination
      of lenalidomide with a rituximab/fludarabine backbone.
