      performed annually in the U.S. and this number is expected to increase over the next seven
      years, along with a simultaneously projected shortage of trained orthopaedic surgeons to care
      for these patients. This proposal addresses the optimization of the surgeons' clinical time
      through utilization of innovative home based technologies to monitor and communicate with
      patients during the first 12 weeks after total knee arthroplasty. This will be accomplished
      by establishing home monitoring connectivity with novel technology and measure validated
      patient-reported outcomes, knee ROM and gait parameters in a postoperative TKA patient's
      native living environment. It will allow the investigators to prospectively, electronically
      capture clinically relevant TKA outcomes at the patient's home and provide insight into
      postoperative rehabilitation progress, predictors of suboptimal clinical outcomes, and guide
      future randomized controlled trial development to improve outcomes.
