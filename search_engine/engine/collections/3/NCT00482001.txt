      poses substantial risks of motor vehicle collisions, many people in the earliest stages of AD
      continue to drive. Memory problems themselves are poor predictors of who is actually unsafe
      on the road, and various medications that are used to treat people with AD may impact on
      their driving abilities. Donepezil is a drug used to treat the memory problems associated
      with AD. While previous studies have shown that it slows the decline of activities of daily
      living (eg. shopping, banking, dressing) and may improve the ability of younger pilots to
      perform on computerized flight simulators, no studies have examined the impact of donepezil
      on driving abilities in older adults.

      The present investigation is a pilot study aiming to determine if donepezil helps healthy
      older drivers perform on driving simulators. Two Canadian academic centers have different
      driving simulators - one in Toronto and one in Thunder Bay. At each of these centers, ten
      healthy men aged 65 to 75 will be randomly assigned to receive either donepezil 5mg/day or
      identical placebo for two weeks.

      Using the driving simulator, we will assess various aspects of driving ability. These
      measures of driving performance will be compared between those who received the drug and
      those who received the placebo.
