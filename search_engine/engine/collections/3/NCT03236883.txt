      treatment of hematopoietic malignancy. In recent years, non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (NST) has been introduced to treat solid tumors due to the Graft-versus
      tumor effect. In this study, the investigators try to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NST
      in the treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients.
