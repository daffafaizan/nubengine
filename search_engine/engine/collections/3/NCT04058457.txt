      approached to participate in this study (i.e. every patient will be offered participation in
      the study). Over the same time period other DBS patients (GPi and VIM) will be approached
      before their implantation procedure to participate as controls/comparators. Participants will
      all be offered the full study, but will also be free to participate in a smaller number of
      activities if so chosen.

      Patients will be assessed both pre-operatively and post-operatively where they will complete
      a compound respiratory questionnaire and tests of respiratory interoception and function.
      Post-operatively, these tests will be carried out with stimulation ON and OFF, the order of
      which will be randomised between patients.

      Data on daily activity will be collected during pre- and post-operative windows, using a
      wearable pedometer/heart-rate monitor.

      Positive findings of respiratory neuromodulation will be correlated between patients with
      structural connectivity (e.g. STN-insula.) from pre-operative MRI scans.
