      relax." The esophagus consists of 3 parts: the first part (uppermost part) is the upper
      esophageal sphincter (UES). The UES is a specialized ring of muscle which separates the
      esophagus from the throat, & prevents food in the second part (body) of the esophagus from
      regurgitating into the throat. The third part of the esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter
      [LES]) also consists of a specialized ring of muscle which separates the body of the
      esophagus from the stomach, & prevents food & acid from regurgitating into the body of the
      esophagus. When achalasia is present, patients experience dysphasia (difficulty swallowing
      food, & [sometimes] liquids), chest pain & can experience recurrent pneumonia & loss of
      weight.

      Current treatments for achalasia include oral medications (calcium channel blockers) to relax
      the LES (difficult to swallow pill/capsule), dilation (stretching) of the LES, (temporary
      relief) & Esophagomyotomy (general surgery to cut the LES).

      POEM (Per-Oral endoscopic myotomy (creating a muscle [esophagus] opening), an incision-less
      (no cutting of the surface of the body) endoscopic procedure, is an effective non-surgical
      alternative to release the muscle & sphincter of the LES for the treatment of achalasia.
