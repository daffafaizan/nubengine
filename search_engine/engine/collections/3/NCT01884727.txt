      containing 123 mg sodium and 129 mg chloride per 4 oz. serving. A proprietary electrolytic
      and catalytic process rearranges the salt water solution to mimic the redox signaling
      molecular composition of the native salt-water compounds found in and around human cells.
      Data obtained thus far, suggests the possibility that consumption of the ASEA beverage may
      increase energy expenditure and thus be beneficial for the treatment of obesity, however,
      this has not been assessed in human clinical studies. To this end, we will measure the
      effects of ASEA consumption on energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry using the indirect
      room calorimeter at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Nutrition Research Institute.

      The primary outcome measures will be the change in 24-h energy expenditure and respiratory
      quotient in response to ASEA consumption. The secondary outcome variables will include
      changes in relevant peptide hormones, and norepinephrine/epinephrine and their relationship
      to changes in energy expenditure in response to consumption of ASEA.
