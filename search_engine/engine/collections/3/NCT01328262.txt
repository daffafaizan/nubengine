      study is to evaluate whether the targeted hemoglobin increment (2 grams per decilitre) in the
      patient can be predicted from the hemoglobin dose/weight of the blood bag transfused. In the
      test group, the hemoglobin dose needed will be calculated, whereas in the control group, the
      prescribed number of red cell units will be transfused.
