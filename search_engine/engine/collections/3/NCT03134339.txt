      users (n=18) to complete four separate experimental sessions. Each session will include one
      randomly assigned infusion that will be either saline or a single dose of nicotine (1 mg per
      70 kg body weight) delivered at three different infusion rates, rapid, moderate or slow
      (0.24, 0.048 or 0.024 mcg per kg body weight per second). A total infusion duration of 10 min
      will be maintained during each session by adding saline infusions of variable duration after
      nicotine delivery. This will be achieved by two separate infusion pumps, one for saline and
      one for nicotine. For example, the rapid 0.24 mcg/kg/s condition will include a 1 min
      infusion of nicotine followed by a 9 min infusion of saline. The subjects will be blinded to
      the infusion pump procedures. The rapid delivery rate, which we have used in our prior
      studies, induces positive subjective drug effects and suppresses symptoms of nicotine
      withdrawal. The moderate delivery rate,0.048 mcg/kg/s, approximates the rate of nicotine
      intake encountered while smoking a typical cigarette over 5 min (4). The slowest nicotine
      delivery rate, 0.024mcg/kg/s, was chosen to approximate the rate of nicotine intake
      encountered while using a newer EC (5).
