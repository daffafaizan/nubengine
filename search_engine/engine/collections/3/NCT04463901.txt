      recurrent pterygium. Conjunctival autograft with or without limbal tissue used to cover the
      bare sclera will efficiently reduce postoperative longstanding epithelial defect.

      Patients with recurrent pterygium will be randomly assigned to undertake pterygium excision
      followed by intraoperative mitomycin C with conjunctival autograft or limbal conjunctival
      autograft .The patients will be followed at least 12 months. Corneal recurrence is considered
      as a fibrovascular ingrowth beyond the limbus with conjunctival drag in the area of previous
      pterygium excision.
