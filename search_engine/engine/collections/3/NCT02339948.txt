    
      Patients with locally confined prostate adenocarcinoma (clinical stage T1c - T2bN0M0, Gleason
      score 7, PSA 20 ng/ml) are assigned to one of two treatment arms. Low risk patients (T1c-T2a
      and PSA <10 ng/ml and Gleason Score 6 or less) will receive 5 fractions of 8.0 Gy for a total
      of 40 Gy. Intermediate risk patients (T2b or PSA >10 ng/ml orGleason Score 7) will receive
      1.8 Gy of IMRT for 25 fractions over 5 weeks for a total of 45 Gy. They will then receive a
      boost consisting of 4, 5.5 Gy fractions after IMRT for a total of 22 Gy. All patients will be
      assessed for toxicity at periodic time points following completion of treatment.
