      'memory tonic'. Brahmi's use as a cognitive enhancer has led to recent research to
      investigate a broad spectrum of cognitive domains. Additionally, micronutrient deficiency in
      children can impair cognitive functions, and micronutrient supplementation can help
      reduce/prevent deficiencies in those at risk. Several studies have been conducted so far
      which establish the cognition enahncing abilities of Brahmi, with no major side effects. The
      aim of the current study is to investigate the beneficial impact of 4 month consumption of a
      beverage powder fortified with Brahmi extract and multiple vitamins and minerals on short
      term memory as assessed using standardised cognitive test battery.
