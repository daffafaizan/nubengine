      proactive management of mental health complications, can improve clinical outcomes from mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

      Background: Up to 1 in 4 people who sustain an mTBI develop depression or an anxiety disorder
      within the first 3 months. Mental health problems triple the risk of long-term disability
      after mTBI. However, mental health disorders after mTBI are under-detected and under-treated.
      Canadian clinical practice guidelines for mTBI developed by the Ontario Neurotrauma
      Foundation (ONF) recommend that family physicians proactively screen and initiate treatment
      for mental health disorders.

      Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of an implementation intervention designed to facilitate
      timely detection and treatment of mental health complications in primary care.

      Approach: Triple-blinded (treatment provider, patient, assessor) cluster randomized
      controlled trial with two arms. The intervention involves collecting screening test results
      from patients and a complex intervention with two components: sharing the screening test
      results in an actionable format with their family physician and activating patients for the
      clinical encounter with the family physician by sharing education materials about mental
      health problems and treatment options after mTBI. The comparison group is usual care.

      Hypotheses: The researchers hypothesize that the guideline implementation tool will be
      associated with lower rates of mental health complications at 26 weeks post-injury, compared
      to usual care.
