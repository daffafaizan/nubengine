      receive the SAFE intervention (plus usual case management) or to receive usual case
      management only. Those assigned to SAFE will receive 12 mindfulness-based,
      cognitive-behavioral modules through a 3-day intensive group intervention provided by an
      agency intern and a hired project staff member. The intervention uses mindfulness-based
      cognitive-behavioral approaches to augment youth attention to risk-related processes,
      including risk detection, problem solving, assertiveness, and help seeking skills. It is
      hypothesized the intervention will result in reduced substance use and victimization and that
      these effects will be explained, at least in part, by improved risk-related attention skills
      (risk detection, problem solving, assertiveness, and help seeking skills). Post baseline
      interview, participants will be randomly assigned and will participate in a posttest
      interview (1 week post baseline) and follow up interviews at 6-weeks, 3-months, and 6-months
      post baseline interview.
