      Decision Making Process in a sample of patients who made a decision about cancer screening in
      the last 2 years. Patients from 4 hospitals who have received a patient decision aid for
      breast, colon, prostate, or lung cancer screening will be screened for eligibility. A random
      sample of eligible patients will be sent a one-time survey. The survey asks patients about
      their experiences talking with healthcare providers about the specific cancer screening
      decision. The survey includes the Shared Decision Making Process scale, knowledge,
      preferences, decisional conflict and decision regret. The study will obtain 400 completed
      surveys, or 100 for each cancer topic.

      The sample consists of patients who received a decision aid for cancer screening within the
      last two years and meet specific qualifications.

      All analyses will be conducted separately for each group, and results may be pooled. First,
      study staff examine the descriptives for the Shared Decision Making Process items. Study
      staff will also test several hypotheses to examine performance of the scores such as whether
      higher shared decision making process scores are associated with less decisional conflict and
      less regret.
