      same, which results in the maintenance and growth of muscle fibers, but the cleavage of
      agrin, a process by which is formed the agrin fragment C-terminus (CAF), has been linked to
      the development of sarcopenia, because its presence is directly linked to the reduction in
      the number of muscle fibers, increasing the heterogeneity of fiber size, presence of Central
      cores and increasing the proportion of type I fibers and consequently a greater degradation
      of lean body mass. Studies in mice show that the greatest cleavage of agrin carries on
      development of sarcopenia and human studies report that individuals with higher serum levels
      of sarcopenia CAF compared to individuals without sarcopenia.

      Therefore, aiming at the complexity of cancer associated with the cachexia and the great
      importance of the maintenance of lean body mass to a better prognosis in disease, is of
      fundamental importance to elucidate the role of CAF and the factors associated with
      sarcopenia, the possible use of these proteins for diagnosis and the contribution that this
      clarification could bring in clinical therapy.
