      for refractive eye care. These individuals are screened for eye disease and visual acuity is
      measured as part of routine care. All with distance vision worse than 20/40 will have pinhole
      acuity taken to estimate benefit of refractive correction. Those who have refracted distance
      visual acuity better than 20/40 in the better eye and minimum spherical refractive error of
      Â±1 dioptre will be eligible for the study. The clinical testing can be conducted on the same
      day and include habitual distance vision, refraction and refracted visual acuity.

      In China, participants will be recruited from those identified by a School Screening Program
      in place in GuangZhou (Childsight). In this program, teachers measure visual acuity. Those
      who have 20/40 or worse distance vision will be invited to a parent information night. At
      this time, information will be provided about the study and those interested in participating
      will sign a record of informed assent with parental permission. The clinical testing will be
      conducted at a later visit by an optometrist attending the school. Study questionnaires will
      be administered and clinical testing of vision including habitual distance vision, refraction
      and refracted visual acuity.

      The duration of the study will be up to 2 months and will require a total of three visits.
      After the initial visit, the dispensing visit will be arranged based on time to supply
      spectacles and the final visit planned for 1 month after receipt of spectacles.

      This study will be masked. The persons interviewing the patients about quality of life and
      those testing vision on both visits will not know the intervention status of the subjects.
