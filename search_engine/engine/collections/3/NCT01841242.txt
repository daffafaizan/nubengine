      prognosis of these patients. Thus, recent studies have shown greater effectiveness of local
      preparation for alcoholic chlorhexidine (applicator containing 2% chlorhexidine and 70%
      alcohol isopropanolol) (AC 2%) compared to the aqueous povidone iodine (API)in general
      surgery. It has been shown that the rate of local infection was significantly reduced in the
      AC group vs 2%. aqueous povidone iodine, respectively vs. 9.5%. 16.1% (p = 0.004). No
      randomized trials have previously prospectively compared the interest of local preparation
      with AC 2% compared with the usual preparation by API during implantation Resynchronization
      devices. Based on experimental and clinical studies, and we hope this new approach to assess
      local skin preparation in the prevention of general and local risk of infection after
      implantation of a cardiac resynchronization device. To ensure consistency, and because of its
      high efficiency assumed on the basis of experimental and clinical studies, the choice fell on
      the revenue 2% with applicator and patients should benefit from a primary location or
      "up-grading" to a CR device.
