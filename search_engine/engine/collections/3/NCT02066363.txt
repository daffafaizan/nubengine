      computer generated list, stratifying in respect to performance status 0 and 1 in opposite to
      PS 2 for the first 10 patients enrolled in the study.

      To make the two treatment groups comparable, the patients number 11-100 enrolled in the study
      will be placed in the treatment groups using the minimization method. Using the minimization
      method the prognostic factors for age, diagnosis and performance status at the enrollment,
      will be considered to make the treatment groups similar.
