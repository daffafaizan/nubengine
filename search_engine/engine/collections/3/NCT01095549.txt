    
      In this study, 300 HD patients will be enrolled to receive ABI and baPWV and about 90
      patients (30% according to the literature review) who have abnormal ABI (<0.9) or baPWV
      (>2100 cm/sec) will be randomly allocated to FIR group (receiving FIR therapy for 40 minutes
      thrice weekly) and control group (without FIR therapy). In patients with abnormal ABI or
      baPWV, the effect of single or one-year treatment of FIR on the following items will be
      studied: (1) ABI, (2) baPWV and (3) markers related to endothelial dysfunction [including low
      and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL and HDL), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA),
      hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)]. The effect of
      FIR on PAD or cardiovascular events during one year of follow-up will also be studied.

      This study will allow us to identify the frequency of and the risk factors associated with
      abnormal ABI & PWV as well as the effect of single or one-year FIR therapy on ABI & PWV in HD
      patients.
