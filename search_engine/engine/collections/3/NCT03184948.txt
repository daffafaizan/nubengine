      (phototherapy) to 46 public hospitals in Rwanda. The investigators have worked with MIH to
      have the delivery of these machines be staggered over three phases through random selection.
      The methodology relies on the staggered distribution of Brilliance devices and survey data
      collected prior and during delivery dates to evaluate the provision of low-cost high quality
      phototherapy machines, following the basic design of a staggered randomized controlled trial.
      Specifically, the investigators will survey all hospitals prior to the receipt of any
      Brilliance devices to provide a baseline description of the care received in these
      facilities. These surveys will collect information on the facility itself, including average
      infant jaundice caseloads and descriptions of recent cases. The investigators will then
      randomly select 15 hospitals to receive the Brilliance units. Three months after installation
      of Brilliance has occurred at these facilities (Group 1), another randomly selected subset of
      16 facilities (Group 2) will receive their Brilliance machines. Three months after these
      installations have been completed, the remaining facilities (Group 3) will receive their
      Brilliance machines. During this period, there will be ongoing data collection from the
      hospitals, creating a panel dataset on the jaundice-related caseloads at these facilities.
      The data collected will be akin to collecting hospital records of patients diagnosed with
      jaundice, but no identifiable patient information will be collected.
