      as a consequence of infection. Septic shock frequently causes multi-organ failure in the ICU.
      For this reason the extracorporeal therapies for the treatment of renal failure have become
      widespread in the ICU and, at the same time, new extracorporeal depurative techniques have
      been developed for the removal of inflammatory mediators. One of these techniques is CPFA
      (coupled plasma-filtration adsorption) that uses a sorbent once the separation between plasma
      and blood has been obtained with a plasma filter. The study objective is to clarify whether
      the application of CPFA in addition to the current clinical practice is able to reduce
      mortality and prevent organ failures in septic shock patients in intensive care unit.
