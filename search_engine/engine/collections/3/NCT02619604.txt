    
      This multifaceted initiative will include evaluating patient perspectives on their QoL,
      evaluating provider perspectives on managing QoL, and providing education to the whole CLL
      care team (hematologists/oncologists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses)
      on contemporary approaches for individualized, patient-centered management of CLL. Providers,
      including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants will participate in
      educational initiatives geared towards enhancing their knowledge and confidence with managing
      QoL concerns for patients with CLL. Pre and post surveys will be conducted with providers to
      evaluate change in these areas. The project aims to train this team on how to enhance
      communication with patients and caregivers as a means to increase patient engagement in care
      and QoL in this population.
