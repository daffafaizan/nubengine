      Although bronchoscopy is relatively safe, it still has inherent risks to the subject.
      Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens are easy to collect and are minimally invasive for the
      subject. We will use a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect respiratory
      viruses in paired BAL and NP specimens to determine if either specimen is more likely to be
      positive. The study population will include all patients undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical
      indications at the Clinical Center. This is a prospective observational study.
