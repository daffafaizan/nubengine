      AKs in a 25 cm2 treatment area on the face or scalp. All subjects will be treated with two
      cycles of ingenol mebutate 0.015%. The first cycle will be started on Day 1, and the second
      cycle will be started on Day 29 (four weeks apart). Subjects will utilize the once daily for
      three days regimen for both cycles. For the first cycle of study application, subjects will
      be followed on day 1, day 2, and day 4 during treatment; on day 1 baseline photographs will
      be taken, on day 2 LSR will be assessed and visual analog scale (VAS) regarding perceived
      irritation will be conducted, and on day 4 LSR, VAS and photographs will be taken.
      Post-treatment follow-up will be conducted on day 8 and day 15, in which LSR will be assessed
      and photographs taken. Approximately four weeks later, a second cycle of once daily for three
      day regimen of ingenol mebutate 0.015% will be applied to the same treatment area on the face
      or scalp. Subjects will be followed during treatment on day 29, day 30 and day 32; on day 29
      LSR and photographs will be taken, on day 30 LSR will be assessed and VAS conducted, and on
      day 32 LSR, VAS and photographs will be taken. Post-treatment follow-up for the second cycle
      of application will occur on day 36, day 43, and day 56. During these post-treatment
      follow-up visits LSR and photographs will be taken. LSR scores from day 4 and day 32 will be
      assessed by a blinded observer. Lastly, on day 29 and day 56 the patient's treatment
      satisfaction will be evaluated on a 10 point visual analog scale (VAS). Consequently, there
      will be a total of 11 visits during a 56 day period.
