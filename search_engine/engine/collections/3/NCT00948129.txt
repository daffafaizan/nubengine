      I. Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based
      low-income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial.

      II. Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception,
      self-efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking
      abstinence.

      III. Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I (STANDARD CARE): Participants undergo standard of care smoking cessation intervention
      consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help
      written materials.

      GROUP II (ENHANCED CARE): Participants undergo standard of care smoking cessation
      intervention as in Group I and attend a health feedback counseling session at baseline.
      Participants also receive access to a smoking cessation hotline telephone number and
      supportive text messages daily for 12 weeks.

      GROUP III (INTENSIVE CARE): Participants undergo standard of care smoking cessation
      intervention as in Group I and attend a health feedback counseling session at baseline.
      Participants also receive access to a smoking cessation hotline telephone number, supportive
      text messages daily for 12 weeks, and a smoking cessation telephone call over 15 minutes
      weekly for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
