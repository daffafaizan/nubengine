    
      MTN-035 is a multi-site, randomized-sequence, three-period, open label crossover study that
      will enroll approximately 210 participants randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of six sequences
      of rectal microbicide placebo product application. At the start of each 4-week product use
      period, participants will receive either rectal inserts, rectal douches, or rectal
      suppositories and be instructed to use their assigned study product prior to each receptive
      anal intercourse (RAI) encounter during that period. Participants who do not have RAI in a
      given week will be asked to use the product without sex. There will be a 1-week washout
      period between each of the three product use periods. Participant follow-up will take
      approximately 3.5 months.
