the effect of human growth hormone inhypopituitary dwarfismhuman growth hormone (hgh) raben has beenused in a dosage of 2 mg./m.2/day or 5 mg./m.2 twiceweekly.  this dosage is probably in or below, butcertainly not above, the range of physiologicalreplacement therapy.in a standardized five-day metabolic hgh testhypopituitary dwarfs retain more n than childrenwithout gh deficiency.  this test is valuablediagnostic help in hypopituitary dwarfism.a prolonged treatment with hgh acceleratesgrowth in hypopituitary dwarfs but not in childrenwithout gh deficiency.  growth rate, induced bythis treatment, is first above average and later averageor below average for age.  this decreasing responseto hgh is typical for the general phenomenon ofcatch-up growth and is not caused by the develop-ment of antibodies.of 9 hypopituitary dwarfs, treated for at least 9months, 3 were growth resistant from the beginningin spite of a high n retention in the preceding hghtest.  this resistance is caused by the developmentof high titres of specific hgh antibodies in the veryfirst few months of treatment.  these antibodiessuppress the effect of hgh both on metabolism andon growth.  the unexpected occasional induction inman of antibodies against a homologous proteinhormone is of great interest.  the possibility thatthese antibodies might be active not only against thehomogenous but also against the endogenous hormonecould have a far-reaching biological importance.
