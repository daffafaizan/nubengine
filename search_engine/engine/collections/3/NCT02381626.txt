    
      DRIIVE (Data and Research on Interventions to Improve the Vehicular Environment) is a
      community-engaged translational pilot project that will utilize a three parallel arm design
      to obtain preliminary data on associations between Particulate Matter (PM)/air pollution and
      physiologic measurements and biomarkers in taxi drivers, and to determine the impact of a
      HEPA filter (to remove PM and volatile organic compounds) intervention on such physiologic
      measurements and biomarkers. DRIIVE is funded by the New York State Department of Health
      Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program (ECRIP), which trains physicians in clinical
      research in New York. Drivers will be randomized to one of two groups: Intervention or
      Wait-list Control. In total, two groups of 14 participants in each group will be recruited:
      1) Wait List Control group, who will receive a HEPA filter at the end of the 1 month
      participation period, and 2) Intervention group, who will receive a HEPA filter two weeks
      into their participation period. The project will be completed within a 2 year timeframe.
