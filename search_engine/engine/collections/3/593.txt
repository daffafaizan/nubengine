studies with human growth hormoneten dwarfed patients whose short stature was ofvarying aetiology were studied by investigation ofsome of the metabolic effects of human growthhormone, 10 mg. being administered daily for aperiod of 5 to 9 days.  the patients were maintainedon a constant diet during a preliminary controlperiod, while receiving hgh, and in 7 patients from2 to 7 days in the post-hgh period.  hgh produceda reduction in serum cholesterol, with arebound on withdrawal, in 7; a delayed clearance offat from the blood after a fat load in 9; and theappearance of pre-b lipoprotein in the fasting state,as measured by paper electrophoresis, in all of them.the fall in serum cholesterol and the rebound onwithdrawal of hgh has some relevance to theobservation that hypercholesterolaemia occurs insome hypopituitary patients even in the absence ofhypothyroidism.no change was observed in tests of thyroid andadrenocortical function during the short-term highdosage administration of hgh.hypopituitary patients show a considerableretention of nitrogen on hgh administration, andwe have confirmed the work of prader and hiscolleagues that this provides a valuable diagnostictest for growth hormone deficiency.  the measurementof urinary nitrogen excretion after the withdrawalof hgh also promises to be a useful investigationin the differential diagnosis of short stature.nitrogen excretion in the withdrawal phase inhypopituitary children returns slowly to its pre-hghlevels; two non-hypopituitary dwarfedchildren excreted much more nitrogen in the withdrawalperiod than they retained in the hghperiod.  one primordial dwarf showed a negligiblechange in urinary nitrogen excretion both in thehgh and in the post-hgh periods.
