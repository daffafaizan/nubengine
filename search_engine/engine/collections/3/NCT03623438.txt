    
      Objectives: To evaluate the clinical effects of self-administered acupressure for treating
      insomnia disorder delivered by a training course.

      Hypothesis: Subjects in the self-administered acupressure group will have greater improvement
      in insomnia symptoms and daytime impairment than those in the sleep hygiene education (SHE)
      group at 4 weeks and 8 weeks.

      Design and subjects: A randomized controlled trial. 184 subjects with insomnia disorder
      recruited from the community will be randomized to self-administered acupressure or SHE
      groups in a 1: 1 ratio.

      Study instrument: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) will be used to assess insomnia symptoms and
      daytime impairment.

      Interventions: Subjects in the self-administered acupressure group will attend two training
      lessons (2-hour each) to learn self-administered acupressure and practice it every night for
      4 weeks; subjects in the SHE group will receive sleep hygiene education with the schedule and
      duration that are same to the self-administered acupressure group.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the ISI score. Other measures include
      sleep parameters by subjective sleep diary and objective actigraphy, Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale, and SF-6D at 4 and 8 weeks. Acceptability and compliance of
      self-administered acupressure will be evaluated.

      Data Analysis: Differences in the questionnaire scores, subjective and objective sleep
      parameters will be examined using a mixed-effects model.
