    
      This is a three cohort, multicenter, open-label, prospective study of 60 (optionally up to
      90) multiple sclerosis (MS) patients currently treated with siponimod or a first-line disease
      modifying therapy (DMT) or without MS treatment in clinical routine planning to undergo a
      SARS-CoV-2 modRNA vaccination as part of clinical routine. The maximal duration of the study
      for an individual patient is 14 months.

        -  The first cohort in this study will be participants not interrupting their current
           siponimod therapy for the purpose of a SARS-CoV-2 modRNA vaccination.

        -  The second cohort will be participants interrupting their current siponimod therapy for
           the purpose of a SARS-CoV-2 modRNA vaccination for approximately 2-3 months.

        -  The third cohort will be participants receiving modRNA vaccine while on treatment with
           the following first-line DMTs (dimethylfumarate, glatirameracetate, interferons,
           teriflunomide) or no current treatment in clinical routine.

      The study will investigate the development of functional anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and
      T-cell titers for six months after the participants' vaccination.
