      Institute (NCI) National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and NCI Community Oncology Research
      Program (NCORP). The accrual period is 5+ years. After central pathology review of registered
      participants, approximately 2,000 cases of MDS or MDS/MPN overlap disorders, and 500 cases of
      ICUS will be identified for the longitudinal study cohort and up to 1000 cases will be
      identified for the cross-sectional cohort. No more than 3500 total participants will be
      registered. Participants in the longitudinal cohort may be followed for life.

      The goal of the National MDS Study is to establish a publicly available resource to
      facilitate the study of MDS natural history. This will be accomplished through: 1) Creation
      of a multi-institutional, longitudinal collection of consistently processed and clinically
      well-annotated blood and tissue specimens collected prospectively from participants with MDS
      and participants with idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS); and 2)
      Support for investigator-initiated studies of MDS that will have high-impact for MDS
      patients, including basic science, clinical, health outcomes and epidemiological research.
