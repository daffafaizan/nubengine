      during the period July to September 2015, from four localities in the southern region of
      México: including Champotón, Campeche, Mérida, and Valladolid. Older adults were interviewed

      capillary blood sample was collected to measure hemoblobin in situ using HemoCue. Anemia was
      defined according to WHO criteria. A fasting venous blood sample was collected in 803 older
      adults. Serum was separated and frozen at -20°C to measure ferritin, retinol, vitamin B12,
      folate, iron, soluble transferrin receptor, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, alpha
      glycoprotein 1, hepcidin, erythropoietin in the laboratory of nutrition of the National
      Institute of Public Health.

      The study protocol was approved by Research, Biosecurity and Ethics Committees of the
      National Institute of Public Health. Participants received a detailed explanation of the
      study procedures and signed an informed consent form prior to data collection.
