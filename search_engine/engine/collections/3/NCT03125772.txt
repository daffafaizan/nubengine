    
      Primary Endpoint:

      Composite safety endpoint of Target Vessel Failure (TVF) rate at 12 months post-index
      procedure:

        -  Cardiac Death related to target vessel

        -  Target Vessel Myocardial Infarction (TV-MI)

        -  Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)

      Secondary Endpoint:

      Clinical endpoints measured at 30, 180 days, and 1 and 2 years post index procedure:

        -  TVF rate (primary endpoint 1 year)

        -  Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) rate

        -  Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR)

        -  Composite of cardiac death or target vessel MI

        -  Composite of all deaths, all MI, all revascularizations

        -  Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) which is the composite endpoint of cardiac death,
           all myocardial infarction, and TLR

        -  MI (Q-wave and non-Q-wave) rate

        -  Cardiac death rate

        -  Non-cardiac death rate

        -  All death rate

        -  Cardiac death or MI rate

        -  All death or MI rate

        -  Stent thrombosis rate (definite or probable by Academic Research Consortium [ARC]
           definitions)

      Periprocedural endpoints:

        -  Technical success rate

        -  Clinical procedural success rate

      Anti-platelet Therapy

      A loading dose of either Clopidogrel (300mg, 600mg recommended), Ticlopidine (500mg), or
      Prasugrel (60mg) must be given to the patient prior to index procedure. Thereafter,
      Clopidogrel (75mg daily), Ticlopidine (250mg twice daily), Prasugrel (10mg) must be given for
      at least 12 months after stent implantation. If the protocol mandated (loading and or daily)
      dosage conflicts with local DFU, the local DFU should take precedence. Aspirin (ASA): Must be
      administered concomitantly with Clopidogrel, Ticlopidine or Prasugrel and then continued
      indefinitely

      Sample Size Parameters:

      The expected 12 month TVF rate for both groups is estimated to be 8.4% based on the data
      available from the SPIRIT IV trial. Given the non-inferiority margin (delta) of 4% with equal
      expected means and a one-sided 5% significance level, 824 patients in each group will provide
      at least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis if it is false. When allowance is made for
      10% attrition, approximately 915 patients are required per each treatment group. Therefore,
      the necessary total sample size for the trial is 1,830 patients.
