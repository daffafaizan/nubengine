      catalytic domains of diphtheria toxin. This trial is designed to augment lymphodepletion
      prior to CAR-T cells by administration of a targeted immunotoxin against CD25-expressing
      T-cells. CD25 is expressed at high levels on Tregs but also on activated effector T cells.
      The use of the CAR-T cell product and associated apheresis and LD chemotherapy is considered
      standard of care (SOC).
