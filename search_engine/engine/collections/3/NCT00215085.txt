      lipomas, and rhabdomyomas, while malignant tumors are typically angiosarcomas and
      rhabdomyosarcomas. Due to the rarity of these tumors, it is difficult to gather meaningful
      information regarding their natural history, pathology and treatment.

      The primary aims are to define the natural history of untreated cardiac tumors, study the
      pathology of primary cardiac tumors, review the surgical treatment and results of primary
      cardiac tumors and to determine the prognosis for these tumors. The secondary aims are to
      discover patterns and consistencies among primary cardiac tumors and to define the best
      treatment options for these patients. The study will be conducted through a retrospective
      chart review of about 70 patients.
