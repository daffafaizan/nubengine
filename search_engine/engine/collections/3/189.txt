detection of pericardial effusion by radioisotope heart scanning .a marked difference between the cardiac silhouette on the six-footchest roentgenogram and the cardiac blood pool, determined by radioiso-tope scanning, has been shown to be consistent with pericardial effusionand/or thickening . it has also been observed that the cardiac bloodpool is separated from the liver margin by the interposition of peri-cardial fluid and/or thickening . this separation was not demonstratedin the presence of a normal pericardium . to appreciate these features,400 c. of radioiodinated human serum albumin and 50 c. of colloidalradiogold were used for scanning . the former outlined the blood pooland the latter demonstrated the position of the liver .
