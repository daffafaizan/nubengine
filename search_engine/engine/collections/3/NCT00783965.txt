      Primary

        -  To expand and refine chemopreventive strategies in individuals with basal cell nevus
           syndrome (BCNS) on the chest and back, who are at high risk for the development of basal
           cell carcinomas (BCCs).

        -  To determine whether tazarotene 0.1% cream applied to the chest for two years will
           reduce the numbers of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) observed, as compared to the number
           expected, based on changes in BCC numbers observed during months 0-12.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the difference in total BCC burden (measured as the total lesion surface
           area) between chest and back over various time points and aggregated intervals of
           interest.

        -  To determine whether there are any detectable wash-in or wash-out periods for the
           tazarotene effects.

        -  Explore the use of a random effects model for longitudinal analysis of total lesions
           over time.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients apply 0.1% tazarotene cream on months 0-12 and vehicle (placebo) on
           months 13-36 once daily to the chest in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients apply vehicle (placebo) on months 0-12 and 0.1% tazarotene cream on
           months 13-36 once daily to the chest in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Treated chest and untreated back is evaluated at 3 month intervals for 36 months.
