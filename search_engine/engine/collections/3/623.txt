histidinemiaa review of published reports ofhistidinemia indicates that this conditionhas a variability of clinical and biochemicalexpression.  three children with histidinemia,born of a consanguineous marriageare reported here.  they had blond hair,blue eyes, speech defects, mental retardation,and a peculiar eeg abnormality.  theyalso exhibited characteristic biochemicalfindings of the disease: elevated blood andurine histidine, increased urine imidazolepyruvicacid, and a sustained high rise inplasma histidine following an oral histidinetolerance test.  they did not, however, havethe reduction of skin histidine a-deaminaseactivity which has been observed in somechildren with this condition.  tests for determinationof heterozygotes in the familywere not successful.parental consanguinity and normal skina-deaminase activity set these children apartfrom other reported cases.  the first lendssupport to the hypothesis that histidinemiais inherited as an autosomal recessive trait;the second supports the idea that the genicfault which results in reduced histidine a-deaminase activity can be expressed to adifferent degree in different tissues.  thesechildren seem to represent a variant ofhistidinemia where liver histidase activity isreduced while skin histidase activity ispresent.
