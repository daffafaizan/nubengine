      I. To determine the efficacy of the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (IUD)
      (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) to treat complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH)
      and grade 1 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (G1 EEC).

      II. To determine if response to therapy can be predicted based on the molecular profile of
      the tumor or by change in gene expression after therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess quality of life outcomes in patients treated with levonorgestrel IUD.

      II. To document the toxicity profile of the levonorgestrel IUD in the treatment of complex
      atypical hyperplasia and grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer.

      III. To evaluate the molecular profile of the hysterectomy specimen of patients treated with
      the levonorgestrel IUD. Compare molecular profile in pretreatment tissue to hysterectomy
      tissue between responders and non-responders to levonorgestrel IUD therapy.

      IV. To evaluate long-term survival, disease status, and fertility outcomes in patients with
      levonorgestrel IUD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo placement of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and
      then periodically for up to 5 years.
