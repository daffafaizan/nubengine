    
      Aim of the work: Evaluate the skeletal, dentoalveolar and soft tissue effects of two
      different force application systems which are the pulling force (CS 2000® appliance/ CS
      appliance) and the pushing force (Reversed Forsus fatigue-resistant device/ RF appliance).

      Materials and methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to address
      the aim of the study. Thirty three growing skeletal Class III patients (9-11 years) will be
      recruited upon a lateral cephalometric x-ray. Subjects complying with the inclusion criteria
      will be randomly assigned using a computer-generated list to one of the three groups Group I:
      Eleven patients treated with CS2000 appliance, Group II: Eleven patients treated with
      reversed Forsus Fatigue Resistant device and Group III: control group of Eleven untreated
      patients with a ratio of 1:1:1 allocation. A CBCT will be made before installing the
      appliances. After gaining a 2 mm positive overjet or a 6 months period, alginate impressions
      will be poured and dental casts will be made. Photographs and CBCTs will also be performed to
      record the dentofacial effect of the used appliances.
