        -  Determine whether the prophylactic use of a topical urea/lactic acid cream can decrease
           the incidence/severity of capecitabine-caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in
           patients receiving capecitabine for breast and/or other cancer.

        -  Evaluate the potential toxicity of this cream.

        -  Determine whether the prophylactic use of vitamin B6 can decrease the incidence and/or
           severity of capecitabine-caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.

        -  Evaluate the potential toxicity of vitamin B6.

        -  Determine whether the prophylactic use of a topical urea/lactic acid cream in
           combination with vitamin B6 can decrease the incidence and/or severity of capecitabine
           caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to age (< 50 years old vs 50-60 years old vs > 60 years old), sex,
      capecitabine dose level (2000 mg/day vs 2500 mg/day), cancer type (breast vs other), and mode
      of therapy (adjuvant [including neo-adjuvant] therapy vs metastatic disease). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms (treatment arms I-IV closed to accrual as of 10/24/007).

        -  Arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive topical urea/lactic
           acid-based cream applied to palms and soles twice daily and oral pyridoxine once daily
           on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive topical urea/lactic
           acid-based cream as in arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007) and oral placebo once
           daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm III (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive placebo cream applied to
           palms and soles twice daily and pyridoxine as in arm I (closed to accrual as of
           10/24/2007).

        -  Arm IV (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007):Patients receive placebo cream as in arm III
           and oral placebo as in arm II (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007).

        -  Arm V: Patients receive topical urea/lactic acid-based cream applied to palms and soles
           twice daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm VI: Patients receive placebo cream applied to palms and soles twice daily on days
           1-21.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
