      pain, and will reduce the opioid consumption, opioid-related side effects, and hospital
      length of stay compared with placebo in patients undergoing elective craniotomy.

      Methods: 316 adults (18-65y), ASA I-III, undergoing elective craniotomy will be randomized to
      receive: 100mg or 150mg pregabalin or placebo once pre-operatively and 50mg or 75mg or
      placebo twice daily for 14 post-operative days. NRS pain scores, opioid consumption and side
      effects will be assessed up to 48h, and long-term pain at days 7, 14, 30, and 90. The primary
      analysis will involve the comparison between the 2 treatment groups together vs. placebo. A
      stepwise method will be used to evaluate the pairwise comparisons.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the incidence of chronic post-craniotomy pain at 3 mos.
      Important secondary outcomes are: neuropathic component of pain at 3 mos., total opioid
      consumption in the first 24h, and incidence and severity of opioid-related side effects at
      days 1, 2 and 7.
