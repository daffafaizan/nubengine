      headaches, as defined by the International Headache Classification. Subjects will be given an
      online medical screening questionnaire to differentiate and screen additional types of
      headache symptoms (migraine, cluster, tension-type, for example) and identify possible
      contraindications for manual therapy treatment techniques and exclude individuals if
      necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of three groups (upper cervical mobilization,
      upper cervical manipulation, or control) and be tested with the Cervical Flexion Rotation
      Test, Joint Position Error testing, and sensorimotor balance testing via NeuroCom Balance
      Master. Subjects with cervicogenic headaches will receive their assigned intervention and
      dependent variables will be reassessed immediately, as well as 4-weeks after initial
      intervention. Individuals in either intervention group (mobilization or manipulation) will
      also complete a specific home-exercise program, which has been reported to improve upper
      cervical range of motion, to the C1/2 segment.
