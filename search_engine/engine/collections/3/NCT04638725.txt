      breast cancer including detailed epidemiologic and treatment data. The distribution of
      constitutional genetic variants will be evaluated within groups of patients treated with
      different regimes of targeted therapies, identifying variants associated with histological
      response, as well as sensitivity or resistance to these therapies.

      Blood samples will be collected in two 6ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes after
      informed consent and inclusion in the study.

      As the samples are received at the biological resource center, the plasma will be aliquoted
      into a 500 µl tube and frozen at -80° C. DNA will be extracted using standard protocols.
      Plasma and DNA will be stored in anticipation of genetic analyses. An aliquot of the DNA
      sample will be genotyped for a panel of high-density genetic markers covering the whole
      genome for genome-wide association studies.

      The collected plasma may also be used for analyses to determine the expression profile of
      proteins, alone or combined with genetic factors that allow distinguishing between groups of
      patients.
