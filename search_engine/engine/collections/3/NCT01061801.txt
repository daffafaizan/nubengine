      survivors - persons known to report elevated levels of distress as compared to both norms and
      their patient counterparts. Specific Aims are to: (1) Determine, via experimental
      manipulation, whether or not CGs of hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients engage in
      protective buffering, a coping mechanism whereby partners shield patients from
      illness-related concerns or worries, (2) Examine synchrony or lack thereof, desynchrony,
      among subjective, expressive and biologic indicators of emotion among spousal CGs, and (3)
      Test the feasibility and implementation of an emotional expression (EE) exercise designed to
      enhance psychological and immune functioning among spousal CGs.
