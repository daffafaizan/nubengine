      and tumor grade and may better define tumor extension and the ideal site for biopsy compared
      with conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A multifunctional approach with
      diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and permeability maps, along with
      H-MRS, may enhance the accuracy of the diagnosis and characterization of brain tumors and
      estimation of therapeutic response. Integration of advanced imaging techniques with
      conventional MR imaging and the clinical history help to improve the accuracy, sensitivity,
      and specificity in differentiating tumors and nonneoplastic lesions.
