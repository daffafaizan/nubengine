      of time, and may develop long-term physiological, psychological and behavioral sequelae
      including increased sensitivity to pain and higher levels of anxiety before painful
      procedures. There is strong evidence to show that distraction is effective in reducing
      children's pain and distress during painful procedures. However, the evidence to support
      distraction, as well as other methods of pain reduction during venipuncture (i.e. vibration,
      topical anesthetics, sucrose), has primarily focused on children who are previously well, as
      those with chronic disease are an understudied population with regards to pain reduction
      during simple procedures. Children with chronic disease or pathology, particularly those who
      have received transplantation (e.g. cardiac, renal, liver), are a population who undergo
      frequent painful procedures, such as venipuncture multiple times per week. There is currently
      no standard of care for pain reduction during venipuncture for pediatric patients having
      blood drawn in phlebotomy or in the transplant clinics as an outpatient.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial comparing two groups: Distraction
      versus standard of care (i.e. no distraction). The intervention (distraction) will be
      administered using an iPad and allowing the child to self-select a developmentally
      appropriate distraction (e.g. game, movie, music). Participants will be videotaped for
      approximately 1 minute, starting from the time of the venipuncture. This video will be viewed
      at a later date by two trained study investigators to assess the patient's pain and distress
      associated with venipuncture, as measured by the OSBD-r, CHEOPS, and FLACC.
