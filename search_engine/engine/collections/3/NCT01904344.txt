      their effect on the cardiovascular system. Currently, these sleeping disorders are diagnosed
      using polysomnography (PSG), which is a sleep test that monitors different physiological
      signals such as heart rate, respiration, ECG, muscle tone and eye movement.

      Although polysomnography is an important diagnostic tool for sleep medicine, it is an
      uncomfortable and costly procedure, especially when multiple nights of observation are
      required. In order to reduce costs and improve patients comfort, different home monitoring
      systems (using different numbers and type of sensors) have been introduced to the market, but
      those focus especially on self-screening and collect general sleep information. In addition
      to increasing comfort and reducing costs, the diagnostic capabilities of PSG need to be
      enhanced. This can be achieved by adding novel sensors that may capture new information and
      improve the measurement of vital physiological parameters during sleep
