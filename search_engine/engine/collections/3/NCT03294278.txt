    
      The main purpose of this trial is to develop evidence-based curative treatment with optimal
      net benefit for patients with Brugada syndrome. As recent non-randomized pilot studies and
      scarce case reports documented the potential benefit of epicardial ablation, patients in this
      trial will be randomized to epicardial catheter ablation of the regions exhibiting abnormally
      prolonged and fragmented electrograms in the right ventricular outflow tract plus continued
      implanted cardioverter defibrillator therapy (ablation arm) or continued implanted
      cardioverter defibrillator therapy (control arm).

      Survival from any ventricular arrhythmia (VA) recurrence will be considered as primary
      endpoint.

      A projected 150 patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive ablation or not in a 2:1
      fashion (Ablation+ICD arm 105 patients vs ICD only 45 patients).
