      characterized by chronic anovulation and excess ovarian activity.

      Since last decade, Clinical Reproductive Medicine Management System/Electronic Medical Record
      Cohort Database (CCRM/EMRCD) has been used in Reproductive Medical Center, First Affiliated
      Hospital of Zhengzhou University, and Henan Province Key Laboratory for Reproduction and
      Genetics. Information of patients (POI, PCOS, Endometriosis, azoospermia, ect) were recorded
      comprehensively. The current project plans to recruit PCOS participants in our center.
      Biological samples, questionnaires and short/long term health data will be collected. The
      study is aimed to provide evidence for PCOS prognosis.
