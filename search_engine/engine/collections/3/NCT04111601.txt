      non-neoplastic polyps. Accurate identification of small non-neoplastic polyps (e.g.
      rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps) that do not harbour malignant potential can lead to future
      implementation of a 'resect and discard' or 'diagnose and leave' strategy. However, there is
      insufficient evidence that endoscopists are able to attain high enough levels of optical
      diagnostic performance in-vivo in order to implement this strategy safely. Blue Light Imaging
      (BLI) is a new enhanced imaging technology that enhances mucosal surface and vessel patterns.
      A specific BLI classification was recently developed to enable better characterisation of
      colorectal polyps (BLI Adenoma Serrated International Classification - BASIC). The use of
      this technology with the appropriate classification to enhance its performance has not yet
      been tested in clinical settings of polyp surveillance and screening colonoscopy amongst
      general endoscopists.

      BLAST is a multicentre prospective observational study which will compare BLI optical
      diagnosis with histological assessment (as a reference standard) for patients with small
      polyps (<10mm) identified at colonoscopy.
