      including sessions for: screening, preparation, experiment/drug, immediate follow-ups, a
      1-month follow-up and 1 post completion urine collection. On each of five experimental
      session participants will orally ingest capsules of either a placebo or varying doses of one
      of 18 different psychoactive compounds.

      Subjective drug effects will be examined with methods previously used by this laboratory for
      characterizing the effects of psychoactive substances from a variety different classes.
      Volunteers will swallow capsules containing various doses of drugs, complete tasks during the
      session, and rate effects of the drug and complete questionnaires at the end of each session
