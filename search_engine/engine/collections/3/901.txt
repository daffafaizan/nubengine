serologic epidemiologic studies with m. pneumoniae. ii. prevalence ofantibodies in several populations.the prevalence of antibodiesfor m. pneumoniaewas determined in 6 populationsby means of a newserologic test.  among membersof a population of 'normal'families, no one underage 15 had antibodies.none of the latter acquired aninfection during the followingyear.  of 67 children ina home, only 3 had antibodies.the 7 cottage matesof one of these childrenwho had acquired an infection,remained uninfected.  ina group of 124 elderly persons,65 (53%) had antibodies.a similar proportion of 76 personsattending a rheumaticfever prophylaxis clinicwas positive.  in this populationit was demonstrated thatantibodies could persistin undiminished titer for at least10 yr.  of 169 pointbarrow residents, 68% hadantibodies.  above age 15the rate was approximately90%.  two companies ofnaval recruits who had similarpositive antibody ratesat the beginning of training,acquired antibodies inrather divergent patterns, 63%in one and 26% in theother.  m. pneumoniae infectionsseem to be sporadicand to produce epidemics onlyinfrequently in civilianpopulations.
