      no cure. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease will depend on the development of
      safe and effective vaccines against HIV.

      Healthy volunteers are injected on days 0, 30, and 180 with one of four preparations: gp160
      vaccine (40 mcg), gp160 vaccine (80 mcg), hepatitis B vaccine, and placebo. The hepatitis B
      vaccine group will serve as an additional control for immunological evaluations. An optional
      fourth injection may be given 15-21 months following the initial inoculation.
