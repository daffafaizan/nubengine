      treated at Sagol center for hyperbaric medicine and research, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center,
      Israel

      Patients included if they had at least two perfusion MRIs + DTI and two neurocognitive tests,
      before and after Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). The study was approved by the
      institutional review board of the hospital.

      Patients are treated with 50-70 daily hyperbaric sessions, 5 days per week. Each session
      consists of 60 minutes exposure to 100% oxygen at 1.5 ATA.

      All patients that underwent MRI before and after HBOT. The MRI protocol included DSC, DCE,
      DTI, FLAIR, T2 and SWI.

      MRI scans sequences parameters:

      * DSC: 50 T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired, 2
      repetitions before a bolus injection of Gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA), 48 repetitions after
      injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: TR=2,300 ms, TE= 40ms, flip angle = 30Â°, voxel
      size = 1.8 x1.8, Matrix = 128x128, No. of slices = 25, Slice thickness = 3.9 mm.

        -  DCE: three T1 weighted Fast Low Angle SHot (FLASH) volumes were acquired with different
           flip angles (2, 7 and 15 degrees) followed by 70 dynamic T1 weighted FLASH volumes with
           flip angle of 15 degrees after bolus injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: before
           injection: TR=4.09, after injection - TR=4.86 ms, TE= 1.76 ms, Voxel size = 1.5x1.5,
           Matrix = 192X192, No. of slices = 26, Slice thickness = 3.5mm.

        -  DTI: 30 diffusion weighted images were scanned with different gradient directions
           (b=1000) and one volume without diffusion weighting, with the following parameters:
           TR=10,300 ms, TE=89 ms, Voxel size = 1.8X1.8, Matrix = 128 X 128, No. of slices = 63,
           Slice thickness = 2.2mm
