    
      This was a multicenter, non-randomized phase 2 trial using a Simon two-stage design with 3
      cohorts.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the response rates of mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas to
      bortezomib and vorinostat combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of the study regimen. II. Observe progression-free
      survival and response durations. III. Observe the relationship between pretreatment lymphoma
      cell nuclear v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (relA) and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Patients also
      receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
