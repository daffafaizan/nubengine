      increase fetal hemoglobin levels and improve the symptoms of sickle cell disease, and to
      monitor how patient's bodies react to oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine. The overall
      purpose is to develop disease modifying treatment for sickle cell disease that is less
      cytotoxic than the current standard of care, and which can directly and more efficiently
      reactivate fetal hemoglobin levels. The hypothesis is that patients treated with oral
      tetrahydrouridine and decitabine will have the same chance of severe non-hematologic
      toxicities as the placebo group. The primary end-point is ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity.
      The investigators' hypothesis is that patients in the treatment groups receiving oral
      THU-decitabine 2X/week over 8 weeks (n=15) will be equivalent to placebo group (n=10) with
      regards to the chance of ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity.
