      by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device is safe and effective in
      patients with non-specific low back pain. The regiment of variable-frequency combination
      (1-10000 Hz or 1-20000 Hz), continuous use for 36-60 mins per day and 30 to 180 days per
      session has been proven to be safe. To validate the clinical applicability of FSM by using a
      TENS device, DW-1330 (Taiwan Resonant Waves Research Co., Taiwan R.O.C.), a prospective,
      randomized, double-blinded trial is proposed. Investigators are going to recruit 60 patients
      with non-specific low back pain for at least 3 months. Clinical assessments include Numerical
      Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D), Pressure
      pain threshold (PPT), and Heart rate variability (HRV). The 60 patients were double-blinded,
      1:1:1-randomly-distributed into 3 groups using different variable-frequency combinations: (1)
      Variable-frequency combination 1 (2) Variable-frequency combination 2 (3) Control(Placebo).
      During the surveillance period, a total of 2 visits and a telephone follow-up is set at Time
      point = 0, 2(telephone) and 4 week after recruitment. The primary endpoint is the change of
      NRS. The secondary endpoint is change of Heart rate variability (HRV). The safety evaluated
      index is the adverse event rate for all 3 groups.
