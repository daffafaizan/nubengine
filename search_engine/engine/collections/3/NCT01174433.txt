      scaffolding (coverage and radial strength) and ease of deliverability. In straight lesions,
      these stents have been shown to provide superb acute and long-term results. One lesion subset
      that continues to challenge the interventionalist is bifurcations lesions. A number of
      different strategies have been employed with standard stents to address bifurcation lesions
      each of which have significant limitations. Large contemporary registries characterising
      current stent usage in bifurcating lesions have demonstrated decreased procedural success
      with increased rates in restenosis and thrombosis (acute, subacute and delayed). The
      limitations of currently available stents have led groups to develop stents designed
      specifically to treat bifurcation lesions. The Tryton Side-Branch Stent Stent TM (Tryton
      Medical, Inc., Newton, MA, USA) is a balloon expandable cobalt chromium stent, designed
      specifically to treat bifurcation lesions.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the use of
      the Tryton bifurcation coronary stent system for the treatment of single de novo bifurcation
      lesions in native coronary arteries with reference vessel diameters (RVD) for the proximal
      main vessel of 2.5 - 5.0 mm, distal main branch of 2.5 - 5.0 mm, and side branch RVD 2.5 -
      3.5 mm.
