    
      A total of 40 subjects with a sebum excretion rate of at least 4 will be included. Subjects
      will be seen at Day 0 and Day 7. Casual sebum measurements will be performed at least 2 hours
      after washing the face in the morning with a Sebumeter® following a 30-second application of
      a Sebumeter® Measurement Cartridge to the forehead. Sebum excretion rates will be measured
      with Sebutape® applied to the right and left forehead at each visit. Each Sebutape® will be
      scanned and the area covered by sebum, seen as gray-black dots on the scanned Sebutape®, will
      be measured by an image analysis software. Circulating levels of free testosterone and DHEAS
      will be measured at each visit. A skin biopsy behind an ear will be performed at Day 0 and
      Day 7 to measure gene expression of the 5-α-reductase type 1. On Day 0 and Day 7, subjects
      will be required to take a 24-hour recall questionnaire. On Day 0 and Day 7, subjects will be
      questioned about the time of sleep induction, their total sleep time for the night preceding
      the visit, facial washing routine and the number of hours of direct and indirect UV exposure
      in the past 24 hours. On Day 0 and Day 7, subject's forehead skin temperature will be
      measured.
