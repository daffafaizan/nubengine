      (accelerations, rotations, alterations in thoracic volume, heart rate, electrocardiogram) in
      a real life physical activity practice (subjects in their living environment and during their
      usual physical practices) using the DS's real-time communication tools, automatic data
      processing, and the DS's ability to produce information.
