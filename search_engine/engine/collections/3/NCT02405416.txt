      undergoing hepatectomy. There have been various hepatic vascular control techniques,
      including infrahepatic inferior vena cava clamping (IIVCC) and selective hepatic vascular
      exclusion (SHVE).The propose of this study is to compare these two surgical techniques
      combined with the portal triad clamping (PTC) in hepatic cirrhotic patients. All patients
      being performed hepatectomy at the center are scanned according to inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. After intraoperative exploration, patients are randomized into two interventional
      groups. PTC, IIVCC or SHVE is performed at the specified timepoint in liver parenchymal
      transection in two different groups. All data are collected prospectively.
