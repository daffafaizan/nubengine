      related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, exceeds $150 billion
      annually. "Morbidly" or "severely" obese patients - defined by a body mass index [BMI] of >35
      kg/m2 or greater - are especially high risk for serious complications due to the metabolic
      and physiologic derangements that occur with severe obesity. Within the Veterans Health
      Administration (VA) system, nearly 600,000 patients are severely obese. These Veterans exert
      significant costs on the VA system, experience poorer quality of life, and have shortened
      lifespans. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity for weight
      loss, comorbidity resolution, and quality of life. Bariatric surgery is supported as a
      treatment option by many national societies, including those representing primary care and
      endocrinology. However, less than 1% of Veterans who qualify for bariatric surgery undergo
      it. Reasons for low utilization are unclear, although the investigators' preliminary research
      suggests that there are various patient, provider and system level barriers to severe obesity
      care. The goal of this study is to pilot-test an educational video that aligns patient
      preferences with treatment options to optimize the care that severely obese Veterans receive.
