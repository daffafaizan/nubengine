    
      Ninety 11-16 year olds with T1DM (duration >1 year), attending paediatric diabetes outpatient
      clinics based in 4 centres in South-West England, UK, will be recruited to a randomised
      controlled trial of one to one sessions of CBT versus non-directive supportive counselling.
      Participants will attend up to 6 sessions (weekly) with either a CBT therapist or a
      counsellor, with 2 further sessions at 6 and 12 months. Follow up will continue for 12 months
      post intervention. HbA1c is the primary outcome measure. Psychological measures will also be
      measured.
