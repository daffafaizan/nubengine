      protocol and progressive muscle relaxation differ in their effectiveness of treating people
      with anxiety disorders (AD) or major depressive disorder (MDD).

      In this study, acupuncture was executed according to the NADA protocol: a standardized and
      comparable method of auricular acupuncture (AA) with ease of application and limited adverse
      reactions, which seems to have high acceptance among psychiatric patients. The NADA (National
      Acupuncture Detoxification Association) protocol includes the needling of five specific
      acupuncture points on both ears.

      As a comparative relaxation treatment, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) was applied in our
      study. It has been well established for many decades, especially for the treatment of severe
      states of physical and mental tension, which is a common symptom of anxiety disorders and
      depression. Many studies also suggest its potential utility in the treatment program of many
      other illnesses, which are associated with conditions of anxiety and depression, such as
      schizophrenia, sleeping disorders, endometriosis, atopic dermatitis or cancer.

      The main aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of AA according to the NADA
      protocol versus PMR in patients with AD or MDD. We hypothesized, that both treatments show
      significant effects in alleviating the examined items (tension, anxiety, anger/aggression and
      state ofr mood) and that there is no significant difference between these two treatments. In
      order to increase the patientsÂ´ treatment acceptance and compliance, this study was set up in
      an open design in which each patient was freely able to choose between both treatments.
