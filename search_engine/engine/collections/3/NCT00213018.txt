    
      Carraguardâ„¢ (PC-515), the Population Council's lead candidate microbicide, was tested in a
      triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial fielded in two sites in South Africa. The
      primary aims of the study were to assess Carraguard's safety (toxicity) - including signs of
      irritation, such as itching or burning; changes in vaginal flora; and incidence of abnormal
      external genital, vaginal, and cervical findings - when applied vaginally for durations of
      6-12 months, and to evaluate several dimensions of the acceptability of Carraguard and
      placebo products. Secondary aims were to investigate whether study participants using
      Carraguard had lower rates of HIV seroconversion or other sexually transmitted infections
      (including C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, and T. pallidum) than the placebo
      (methyl cellulose gel). In addition, when it began, this trial was the first to explore the
      feasibility of large-scale microbicides testing in a non-sex worker population. Last, the
      trial gauged women's reactions to using a non-contraceptive product (in vitro testing had
      shown that Carraguard has no contraceptive effect), as well as potential use-dynamics in
      communities where drying agents and other traditional vaginal products are used with high
      frequency.
