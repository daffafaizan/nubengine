      characteristics, including age, sex, BMI and baseline scores on outcome measures. In addition
      we will assess the inter-rater reliability of the scoring of the delivery of the CBT-p by the
      two trained practitioners utilizing kappa statistics. We will perform data analyses using
      SPSS.
