      66.5% of children under five have anaemia.

      Looking at the magnitude of the problem, National Program for Family Planning (FP) and
      Primary Health Care (PHC) (also known as the Lady Health Workers (LHW) Program) has developed
      National Sprinkles Pilot Project Proposal with technical assistance of Micronutrient
      Initiative and Aga Khan University (AKU). As the projects technical partner, AKU is
      responsible to conduct the monitoring and evaluation of the project.

      The study will use a cluster randomized pre-post intervention design that compares before and
      after hemoglobin (Hb) measurements, serum ferritin, serum retinol and urinary iodine among
      children who received Sprinkles and age-appropriate feeding advice (Sprinkles-Advice group)
      and children who only receive age-appropriate feeding advice (Advice-only group).
      Age-appropriate feeding advice is part of the standard nutrition messages given by all Lady
      Health Workers (LHWs) during their community visits. However, intervention LHWs, will give
      additional advice regarding the benefits of Sprinkles and its appropriate use.

      The target population selected for the study consisted of children between the ages of six
      and eighteen months of age in the catchment area of the Lady Health Workers.
