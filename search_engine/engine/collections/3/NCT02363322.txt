    
      Ebolaviruses (EBOV) are members of the Filoviridae and are known primarily as the underlying
      cause of severe viral hemorrhagic fevers with disturbingly high case fatality rates. Between
      1994 and the present, there have been many EBOV outbreaks affecting mostly central Africa,
      with 2 large outbreaks in 1995 in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and in Gulu,
      Uganda in 2000-2001. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds all
      previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of patients affected, and in disruption of
      typical activities of civil society.

      There is strong consensus that the most important element necessary to improve survival from
      Ebola infection is the provision of full hemodynamic support in the form of aggressive fluid
      replacement, ability to diagnose and correct severe metabolic derangements, and other
      standards of modern medical care available in resource-rich environments. However, against
      this background, a small series of investigational agents or interventions have also been
      proposed as putative antiviral strategies of potential utility in treating this infection.
      Unfortunately, phase 1/2 data supporting the safety and efficacy of these agents is generally
      lacking, and thus there should be equipoise as to which, if any, of these interventions
      should be utilized in the treatment of severe infection.

      In this multicenter randomized trial, we propose a flexible trial design with frequent
      interim monitoring to facilitate early elimination of poorly performing treatments as well as
      the introduction of new candidate therapies. The trial allows for a series of pairwise
      comparisons of novel interventions against a background of optimized medical care, with the
      goal of determining whether one or more of these interventions can improve the mortality over
      that achievable through optimized standard-of- care (oSOC) alone. The primary endpoint of
      this trial will be comparative mortality at Day 28, with a number of secondary endpoints that
      hopefully will generate generalizable knowledge about the relative safety and antiviral
      activity of these adjunctive interventions.
