      less invasive than thoracotomy but postoperative pain is still a problem.

      At Aalborg University Hospital, intercostal blockades with bupivacaine is used as standard
      pain treatment for patients undergoing VATS. Adding adjuvants to the blockades may prolong
      the effect.

      The aim of this study is to investigate if intercostal nerve blockade with adjuvants
      (dexamethasone and adrenaline) will result in better pain management.
