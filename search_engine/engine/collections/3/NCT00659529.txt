      stable patients with mild to moderate CF lung disease. The length of participation for each
      subject will be approximately 10 weeks, and will consist of a screening visit, a study visit
      for initiation of study drug if subject qualifies, interim visits to escalate drug dose,
      obtain drug levels, review concomitant medications and assess side effects, a visit at the
      end of the therapy period (to reassess inflammatory markers, laboratory studies and side
      effects,) and a follow-up assessment 2 weeks after subject completion.
