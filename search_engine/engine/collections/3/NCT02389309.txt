    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      combination treatment with dasatinib, cyclophosphamide and temsirolimus.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of the combination of dasatinib, cyclophosphamide
      and temsirolimus administered on this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of dasatinib,
      cyclophosphamide and temsirolimus within the confines of a phase 1 study.

      II. Preliminary assessment of biological markers and correlates of response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dasatinib and temsirolimus.

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, cyclophosphamide PO
      once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing stable disease or better may
      continue treatment with the approval of the study chair.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
