      affects of placing more Suture Anchors per patient (as compared to the current practice) in
      Primary Obesity Surgery Endoluminal(POSE). USGI wants to see if placing more anchors
      (particularly in the distal body/antrum region) significantly impacts primary weight loss,
      satiety, and metabolic outcomes.
