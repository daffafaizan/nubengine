    
      Data of all patients with posterior pelvic static disorder are collected prospectively and
      consecutively in the Fondamentum database since 2005, secured and hosted by the Rennes
      University Hospital.

      The data from initial functional assessment, carried out as part of routine care between 2005
      and 2019, include a clinical examination of pelvic static disorders, anorectal manometry,
      defecography, collection of symptoms by questioning and by a systematic questionnaire
      completed by the patient during the routine care consultation.

      Patients identified from this database and meeting the selection criteria will receive an
      information letter along with a questionnaire and a stamped envelope for returning the
      questionnaire. The self-questionnaires will focus on collecting symptoms related to static
      disorders (incontinence, constipation, quality of life). Regarding the management of pelvic
      static disorder, we will detail whether it was operated or not, and what were the proposed
      medical care.

      Upon receipt of the questionnaire, the new data will be entered into the research-specific
      database and will complete the clinical data resulting from the extraction of the care base
      The self-administered questionnaire sent to patients includes validated constipation (score
      of kess) and fecal incontinence (Cleveland) questionnaires, and quality of life questions
      from the validated SF36 questionnaire. It also includes a visual scale ranging from -5 to +5.
