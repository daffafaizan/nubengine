      lesions with central histological reference standard status melanoma or high-grade lesion,
      the relative sensitivity œÅ comparing enrolling dermatologists after MelaFind use with
      enrolling dermatologists if MelaFind were not available is greater than 110%. This represents
      a clinically meaningful increase in sensitivity.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate real-world use and safety and
      effectiveness of MelaFind in a clinical setting.
