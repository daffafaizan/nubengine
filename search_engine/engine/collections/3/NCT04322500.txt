      randomly divided in two groups. One group will receive conservative treatment and the other
      one will receive conservative treatment and a daily supplementation of probiotics. All
      patients will be evaluated at 2-week intervals for 3 months. If the lesion will not disappear
      or decrease in size to 1 mm or less in diameter on subsequent visits, the same procedure will
      be repeated for another 3-months cycle. The follow up periods extend from 3 to 6 months
      according to the results.
