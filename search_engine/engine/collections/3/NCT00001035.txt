    
      IFN alfa-2b has HIV inhibitory properties and has also been approved for treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C. Studies have shown that IFN alfa-2b is effective in asymptomatic HIV-positive
      patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the drug's benefit against hepatitis C in patients
      with advanced HIV infection has not been determined.

      Patients receive interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 6 months. If no
      response is seen after 18 weeks of therapy or if an initial response is followed by relapse
      while on therapy, dose is increased. Patients who require a dose escalation should continue
      on IFN alfa-2b for an additional 6 months. All patients will also receive available
      nucleoside analog therapy ( zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine ) at currently accepted doses
      as clinically appropriate.
