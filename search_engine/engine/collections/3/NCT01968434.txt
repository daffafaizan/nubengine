      cough spells without sedating the reflex. Mucolytic agents have been shown to be helpful but
      side effects have been reported and use has been prohibited under 2 years of age. Therefore,
      a completely safe and effective cough remedy has not been officially reported yet in a
      randomised trial. Looking into other mechanisms for cough management such as protection of
      irritated pharynx mucosa from post nasal drip or other irritating substances is theoretically
      sound and shows practical interesting results.

      A parallel comparison of efficacy and tolerability between such protective mechanism (acting
      through a barrier and radical scavenging action) due to natural substances (honey, plantago
      lanceolata, grindelia robusta and helichrysum italicum) and a mucolytic substance has not
      been done so far, in young children, especially in a time frame of 4 days. The intent of this
      study is to use the protective syrup versus carbocysteine in children with moderate to severe
      night and daily cough, measured with a validated parent questionnaire. The invasiveness of
      cough is followed immediately after one night administration of the study products and daily
      for four days.

      A similar effectiveness of the protective cough syrup as compared to carbocisteine is
      considered very interesting due to the mechanism of the remedy.
