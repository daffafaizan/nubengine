      probiotic supplementation has efficacy in reducing the endogenous systemic innate
      inflammatory state known to exist in newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes and whether this
      reduction correlates with preservation of endogenous insulin production as measured by
      stimulated C-peptide during mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT). The innate inflammatory
      state will be measured by plasma-induced transcriptional assay and quantified as a composite
      inflammatory index. Mixed meal tolerance testing is the gold standard measure of endogenous
      insulin production. During this test, serial blood c-peptide levels are collected over 2
      hours in response to challenge with a nutritional drink containing a mix of protein, fat, and
      carbohydrate and the C-peptide area under the curve is calculated.

      Using a randomized, placebo-controlled design, the investigators will measure changes in
      systemic inflammation (primary outcome) and beta cell function (secondary outcome) after six
      months of daily treatment with either Lp299v supplementation or placebo. These measures of
      plasma-induced transcriptional assay and MMTT will be related to markers of beta cell stress,
      the composition of the gut microbiota, analysis of the plasma metabolome, and levels of
      microbial antigen exposure.
