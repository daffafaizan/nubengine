      Norwich, with participants attending the QI CRF for screening and to collect the capsules for
      consumption (capsules will be randomly allocated, containing either phytin or placebo
      (microcrystalline cellulose)). The participants will be recruited from within a 40-mile
      radius of Norwich and this is clearly stated in the Participant Information Sheet (PIS). In
      this study, male and female participants aged between 18 and 50 years will be recruited until
      14 participants complete the study. The participants will consume the randomly allocated
      capsules (containing either phytin or placebo), and collect their faecal samples at their
      home.

      The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the delivery of phytin to the colon will
      cause a decrease in the proportions of human gut enterobacteriaceae, and a potential
      concomitant increase in the proportion of human gut bifidobacteriaceae, through chelation of
      iron.
