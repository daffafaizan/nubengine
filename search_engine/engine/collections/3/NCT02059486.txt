      Program to the "business-as-usual" school curriculum. The Teen Choice curriculum is designed
      for adolescents aged 12 to 19 and will be delivered in different formats that range in length
      from 6 to 12 weeks. Teen Choice will be offered during the regular school day to middle and
      high school aged youth. This study is being conducted as part of the national Personal
      Responsibility Education Program evaluation funded by Administration for Children and
      Families within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
