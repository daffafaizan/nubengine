    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety, including qualitative and quantitative toxic effects and their
           duration and reversibility, of rituximab and doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with
           relapsed or refractory, indolent or aggressive CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy, including overall response rate and durability of objective
           response, of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate pretreatment functional, phenotypic, and genotypic characteristics of host
           immune effector cells with response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 3-8 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over
      1-3 hours on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
