      renal disease, even when all steps of the treatment are done. Therefore, this study is
      conducted to verify the interference of the stress oxidative in the progression of the renal
      disease with the use of an oxidant drug, N acetyl cysteine (NAC). The investigators selected
      patients with good compliance of the treatment. In these patients the investigators evaluate
      the serum creatinine, creatinine clearance estimated by Schwartz Formula, cystatin C and a
      marker of oxidative stress, TBARS ( thiobarbituric acid substances). The variables are
      analyzed 6 months before the introduction of NAC and the three months after NAC.
