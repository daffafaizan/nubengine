      MBX-2982 treatment groups, 20 to placebo, and 20 to the sitagliptin group. Patients will be
      taking 3 tablets and 1 capsule daily. This sample size provides the minimum number expected
      to ensure a power of at least 80% to detect a 20% decrease in the weighted mean glucose level
      associated with an extended mixed meal tolerance test (with 2 standardized meals) relative to
      placebo after 4 weeks of daily treatment with MBX-2982, assuming a drop-out rate of 20% and a
      common SD of 25%.
