    
      The patient received before the surgery a second line chemotherapy, platinum-based regimen
      with either carboplatine-paclitaxel, or carboplatine-caelyx. At the end of the six courses IV
      chemotherapy, if the disease is still responding and if a complete cytoreductive surgery
      seems possible, the patient is included after signed informed consent and will be operated 5
      to 8 weeks after the last second-line chemotherapy cycle.

      So, during the surgery the patient will be randomized if the complete cytoreductive surgery
      is really done and will then receive:

        -  either treatment A = maximal cytoreductive surgery without HIPEC

        -  or treatment B = maximal cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC

      The HIPEC will be done at the end of the surgery. At the end of cytoreductive surgery, tumor
      residual disease must be null or very limited (Sugarbaker completeness cytoreduction: CC0 (no
      residual)-CC1 (residual < 0.25cm).

      Two methods will be used for the HIPEC: Open or closed abdomen, depends on the site practice.
      Each site will use the same method during the study for all included patients.
