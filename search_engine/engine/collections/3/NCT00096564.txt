      This study will look at how perception and observation of various facial expressions may
      affect the way different areas of the brain function. We hope to gain a greater understanding
      of abnormal movements, such as tics, by investigating how facial expressions affect the
      brain.

      Background Information

      This study is based on prior research that focuses on the activity and changes in different
      areas of the brain depending on what people see others around them doing. An example is the
      feeling of empathy one might have when looking at a sad face, or anxiety and fear when
      looking at an angry face.
