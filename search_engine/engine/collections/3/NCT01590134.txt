      mornings, will receive either an iron tablet (ferrous sulphate 200mg), a dietary iron
      supplement, or no agent.

      Blood and urine samples will be collected pre-dose, and at stated intervals 2.5, 4, 7, 24 and
      48 hours post first dose.

      The standard deviations of data obtained in this pilot study will be used to perform power
      calculations for our future studies in this field.
