      the brain. Anxiety and depression are normally associated with inflammation reactions and
      interleukin (IL) related pathways are most evidently involved. Previous animal studies showed
      that administration of IL-17A induces psoriasis-like inflammation and depression-like
      behavior, and can be relieved by using IL-17A antibody, while in humans, association studies
      showed that serum IL-17A and certain downstream ILs are associated with the severity of
      anxiety. Also, the result of human genetic studies also identified several IL genes
      associated with anxiety and depression. IL-17A is a sentinel cytokine. On binding with
      interleukin 17A receptor (IL-17RA) and interleukin 17C receptor (IL-27RC), it induces
      signaling cascades via nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFÎºB),
      P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs)
      knots, and stimulates subsequent cell secretions of cytokines and chemokines. Many studies
      have demonstrated that consumption of proanthocyanidin-rich or anthocyanin-rich berries,
      berries juice or other secondary products reduce a variety of inflammation symptoms in
      humans. However, these berries do not meet a low-cost requirement for general nutritional
      recommendation and new drug development in Taiwan due to the additional import cost. On the
      other hand, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, the main anthocyanin component of local mulberry,
      competes with IL-17A to bind its receptors and inhibits subsequent downstream cascades.
      Without interfering the on-going treatment of the patients, this proposal plans to use a
      single-blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the auxiliary effect of mulberry juice
      in general anxiety disorder, including differences in psychiatric symptoms (anxiety,
      depression, and functions) and levels of IL-related markers between the experimental and
      control groups, and contribution of IL-related genes in the auxiliary effect.
