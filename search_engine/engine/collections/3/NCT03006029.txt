    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, sequential groups, dose escalation study of TAB08 in
      patients with metastatic or unresectable advanced solid malignancies. The study will consist
      of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part with a standard "3+3" design, followed by a dose-expansion
      part once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined.

      Patients must have documented recurrent or refractory solid tumors; patients enrolled in the
      dose-expansion part of the trial must have least one lesion that may qualify as a target
      lesion based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Following the provision of signed informed consent,
      patients will be screened for entry into the study.
