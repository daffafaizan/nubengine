      one of two groups or ARMs of this study.

      ARM A will receive Abiraterone with ABT-263.

      ARM B will receive Abiraterone with both ABT-263 and Hydroxychloroquine

      In the beginning of the study a total of 18 patients may get one of three dose levels. A
      total of nine (9) patients per each arm will be started at a low dose and given increasing
