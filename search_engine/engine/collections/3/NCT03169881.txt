      60,000 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants born each year in the U.S. Improving
      neurodevelopmental outcomes for these preterm infants continues to be a major goal for
      neonatal care providers. A subset of these infants sustain a grade 3 or 4 intraventricular
      hemorrhage (IVH) resulting in an increase in the incidence of developmental delay. Moreover,
      almost one third of preterm infants with normal head ultrasounds also develop cognitive
      delay. Although a variety of neuroprotective treatment strategies have been evaluated, no
      specific treatment has been identified to reduce or prevent brain injury in these most
      vulnerable preterm infants.

      A potential neuroprotective therapy involves administering erythropoiesis stimulating agents
      (ESAs) such as erythropoietin (Epo) and Darbepoetin (Darbe, a longer acting ESA). In addition
      to stimulating erythropoiesis, ESAs have been shown to be protective in the developing brain
      in animal models, making it possibly beneficial for very premature infants who are at risk
      for intraventricular hemorrhage, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and developmental delay. The
      neuroprotective mechanisms of ESAs include increased neurogenesis, decreased neuronal
      susceptibility to glutamate toxicity, decreased neuronal apoptosis, decreased inflammation,
      decreased nitric oxide-mediated injury, increased antioxidant response, decreased axonal
      degeneration, and increased protective effects on glia. This is a randomized, masked, placebo
      controlled clinical study in which enrolled infants will receive weekly Darbe or placebo
      (sham) dosing.
