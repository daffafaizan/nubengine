      were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. For both groups,
      demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft was used to graft the socket. For the control
      group, Type I bovine collagen was used as a membrane; for the experimental group, human
      amnion-chorion membrane was used. For both groups, the barrier membranes were left exposed,
      and no primary closure was achieved. Patients returned for implant placement after a mean
      healing period of 19.5 weeks, at which time a core bone biopsy specimen 2 mm in diameter was
      obtained for histomorphometric analyses. Clinical ridge dimensions were measured at the times
      of extraction and implant placement.
