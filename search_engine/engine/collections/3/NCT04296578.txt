      Â· To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sodium selenite when given in combination
      with abiraterone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of sodium selenite and
           abiraterone in subjects with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics of sodium selenite

        -  To assess changes in Prostate specific antigen (PSA) To evaluate the anti tumor activity
           of sodium selenite and abiraterone when given in combination as determined by
           biochemical progression free survival (PFS) and radiographic PFS.
