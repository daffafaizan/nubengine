      abdominal cavity. Aconventional approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be first
      udertaken with dissection of calot's triangle. The cystic duct will be pulled laterally to
      facilitate exposure of the anterior wall of the CBDand the CBD will be opened longitudinally
      for adistance of approximately 1to1.5 cm using laparoscopic scissors. A5mm flexible
      choledoscope will be used to identify the CBD stone(s) which will be removed by flushing
      sterile saline, passingastone basket, or electrohydraulic lithotrpsy as necessary to clear
      the CBD. A T-tube will be inserted into the CBD via the choledochotomy which will be closed
      by interrupted resorbable sutures, before completing the cholecystectomy. Cholangiography
      throuh T-tube be performed 14 14 days later and the T-tube will be removed immediately after
      Cholangiography if no residual CBD stones is identified. If residual stones are found then
      will be removed through the T-tube track using A choledoscope Two-stage approach The
      treatment process commenced with intial endoscopic treatment phase. This will be udertaken
      Under General anaesthesia and entailed ERCP and endoscopic sphincterectomy. The CBD stones
      will be removed using a basket or ballon, with lithotrpsy added if necessary. An endoscopic
      nasobiliary drainge will be inserted and kept in place until after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy which perfermed 2 to 5 days later depending on the patients 's condition..
      Surgery will be delsyed if urine amylase is elevated or significant abdominal pain is
      present. 2 to 5 days after the operation, Cholangiography will be performed via endoscopic
      nasobiliary drainge tube. And the endoscopic nasobiliary drainge tube wii be removed if no
      residual CBD stones are seen.
