      dysphagia, leading to aspiration pneumonia, which is the main cause of death in stroke [2].

      It is assumed that normal sensitivity is vital for aspiration-free swallowing and for the
      triggering of the swallowing reflex.

      Ali et al. demonstrated aspiration-free swallowing in healthy volunteers who underwent local
      anaesthesia of oral and pharyngeal structures [1]. Power et al. showed a reduced sensitivity
      of pharyngeal structures in stroke patients prone to aspiration [3].

      By combining measuring sensitivity and flexible endoscopic swallowing studies, this study
      further investigates the role of sensitivity in swallowing Neuropsychological deficits of
      swallowing, such as swallowing apraxia or buccal hemineglect, is assessed by
      neuropsychological testing.

      Additionally, there is no systematic research investigating the change in smell and taste in
      correlation with changes in stroke patients
