      other immunologic parameters at 48 weeks after switching to dual therapy based on
      dolutegravir plus emtricitabine o darunavir/cobicistat plus emtricitabine versus to continue
      on triple therapy based on integrase inhibitor plus 2 analogs Secondary Outcome Measures: to
      evaluate the changes in the CD4/CD8 ratio, immune activation and other immunologic parameters
      at 96 weeks after switching to dual therapy based on dolutegravir plus emtricitabine o
      darunavir/cobicistat plus emtricitabine versus to continue on triple therapy based on
      integrase inhibitor plus 2 analogs

      Method: randomized clinical trial in which adult HIV-infected patients with an undetectable
      plasma HIV-RNA for at least one year on a triple therapy based on integrase inhibitors plus
      two nucleos(t)ide analogs will be randomized in 3 groups (1:1:1) with 4 strata according to
      the previous time with undetectable viral load to:

        1. Continue the previous ART based on Elvitegravircobicistat 150150 mg + tenofovir
           alafenamide 10 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg (Genvoya™) o Dolutegravir 50 mg + abacavir 600
           mg + lamivudine 300 mg (Triumeq™) once daily.

           Or to switch to:

        2. Darunavir/cobicistat (800150 mg) + 3TC (300 mg) once daily or

        3. Dolutegravir (50 mg) + 3TC (300 mg) once daily.
