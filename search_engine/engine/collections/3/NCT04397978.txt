    
      Phase IV prospective non-randomized observational trial (registry trial) for patients with a
      DS-GPA > 1.5 or an estimated life expectancy of >3 months and an established diagnosis on
      dedicated brain MRI of 4-10 BM of any solid primary tumor.

      We plan to deliver a local ablative therapy (LAT) i.e. SRT in 1 to 5 fractions on visible BM
      and post-surgical cavities if applicable.

      Our primary aim is to provide quality of life (QOL) data and our secondary aim is to report
      on several toxicity and outcome parameters for this patient cohort.
