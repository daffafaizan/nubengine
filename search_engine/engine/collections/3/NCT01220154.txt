    
      Phase I study with the primary objective to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      intraperitoneal carboplatin and intravenous weekly paclitaxel given in combination with
      intravenous bevacizumab during the second two cycles of treatment in patients with
      chemo-naive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable patients
      experiences a dose limiting toxicity during the second two cycles of treatment. Secondary
      objectives are to determine response rates and to estimate progression free survival and
      overall survival of this class of patients.
