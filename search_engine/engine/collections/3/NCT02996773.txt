      exception being to progressively substitute post-transplant cyclophosphamide (on Days +3 and
      +4 after BMT) with bendamustine. Six dose levels are planned for the Phase I component of the
      study, consisting of a combination of sequentially reduced doses of cyclophosphamide (PT-CY)
      and increased doses of bendamustine (PT-BEN) initially on Day +4 after BMT, followed by the
      same sequential reduction and increase on Day +3. Phase I Post -Transplant Treatment Regimens
      include cohorts 1-3 with de-escalation of PT- CY and escalation of PT-BEN on day +4 and
      cohorts 4-6 with the same regimen on day +3. Interim analysis will be performed after cohort
      3 and cohort 6 in Phase 1, and include preliminary comparison between treatment and control
      groups.

      Control patients will be patients that have declined to participate in the main trial but
      will receive haploidentical BMT with the current standard of two days of PT-CY (and no
      PT-BEN) and will be consented for the immune monitoring studies only.
