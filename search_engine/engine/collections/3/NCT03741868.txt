    
      The overall primary objective of this pilot study is to describe patient-reported symptom
      burden, unmet supportive care needs, and use of and interest in supportive care services in
      stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing first or second line immunotherapy
      and to identify psychosocial factors associated with these outcomes.

      60 stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients will be recruited through the Wake Forest
      Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center. The study team will use purposive sampling to assure
      representation of patients at different stages in immunotherapy (i.e., initiating treatment,
      anticipating scan results, after onset of immune-related side effects).
