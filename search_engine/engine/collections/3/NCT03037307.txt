      BF measurements over a 12 hour period of a currently marketed denture adhesive cream based on
      carbomer technology (test), with a positive control, and a negative/no treatment control. A
      short questionnaire regarding the flavor and texture characteristics of each denture adhesive
      after a single use will also be used to generate data for these attributes. This study
      included four visits: Visit 1 (screening visit), Visit 2, 3, 4 (treatment visits).
