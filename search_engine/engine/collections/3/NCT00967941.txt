      recommended drug of choice for prophylaxis prior to vascular surgery is Cefazolin (Ancef).
      The exception would be to allow the use of Vancomycin as an acceptable antibiotic for
      patients undergoing cardiac, vascular or orthopedic surgery due to the increasing risk of
      methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The significance of the study is to
      demonstrate that MRSA coverage is needed in vascular surgery with prosthetic graft placement
      in areas of the body that is at high risk for infection. By decreasing post surgical site and
      prosthetic infections, we could significantly reduce vascular surgery mortality and
      morbidity. Cost and amputation rates we feel could also be reduced. patients will be
      randomized in three groups such as cefazolin,vancomycin and cefazolin, daptomycin and
      cefazolin and then patients will be monitored per usual post-operative course (30 days and 90
      days follow-up) with wound and incision evaluation. Outcome measures include hospital length
      of stay, the presence of a graft infection, skin infection at incision site, vascular
      procedure failure secondary to infection, cost, thirty day readmits, amputation, and
      mortality.
