    
      Phase 1 is the open-label dose-finding portion of the study to evaluate safety, tolerability,
      and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 on a 2-dose (separated by approximately 21 days) schedule in
      up to 3 age groups (participants ≥5 to <12 years, ≥2 to <5 years, and ≥6 months to <2 years
      of age). Dose finding is being initiated in this study in participants ≥5 to <12 years of age
      based on the acceptable blinded safety assessment of the 30-μg dose in 12- to 15-year-olds in
      the C4591001 study.

      The purpose of Phase 1 is to identify preferred dose level(s) of BNT162b2 from up to 3
      different dose levels in each age group.

      Phase 2/3 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in each age group at the
      selected dose level from Phase 1. Efficacy will be evaluated across all age groups in which
      immunobridging is successful, depending on accrual of a sufficient number of cases across
      those age groups.

      All participants will have blood drawn at baseline prior to Dose 1 and 6 months after Dose 2.
      Immunobridging to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the C4591001 study will be based on
      immunogenicity data collected at baseline and 1 month after Dose 2. The persistence of the
      immune response will be based on immunogenicity data collected in participants at baseline
      and at 1, 6, 12 (original BNT162b2 group only), and 24 months after Dose 2 (original BNT162b2
      group only). In addition, efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 and against asymptomatic
      infection will also be assessed.

      At the 6-month follow-up visit, all participants will be unblinded. Participants who
      originally received placebo will be offered the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 as part of
      the study.

      Approximately 450 participants (300 in the active vaccine group and 150 in the placebo group)
      randomized in each age group in this phase will contribute to the immunobridging analysis at
      1 month after Dose 2 and will contribute to the overall analysis of the persistence of immune
      response at 6 months after Dose 2. These participants will be enrolled from both US and EU
      sites to ensure this subset is representative of the whole study.

      For the persistence time points of 12 and 24 months after Dose 2, approximately 70
      participants from each age group in the original BNT162b2 vaccine group will have an
      immunogenicity blood draw in order to contribute to the analysis. All approximately 4500
      participants will contribute to the VE analysis for conditional VE and asymptomatic
      infection. Efficacy will be evaluated across all age groups in which immunobridging is
      successful, depending on accrual of a sufficient number of cases across those age groups.
