      be determined at entry phase,. Subjects will be collected large numbers of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART-19 manufacturing. The T cells will be purified from the
      PBMC, transduced with CART-19 lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and then administered to
      subjects.

      Subjects will have blood tests to assess safety and efficacy, and persistence of the CART-19
      cells at regular intervals through four weeks after their last infusion of the study.
      Following the 6 months of intensive follow-up, subjects will be evaluated quarterly for two
      years with a physical examination, blood tests, bone marrow aspirate, minimal residual
      disease (MRD) and persistence of CART-19. Following this evaluation, subjects will be
      evaluated health problems every year for an additional thirteen years.
