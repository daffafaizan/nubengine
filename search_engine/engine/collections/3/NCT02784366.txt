      Secondary objective

        -  Identify biomarkers that may predict GI toxicity in cancer patients undergoing
           immunotherapy

        -  Define the clinical course of intestinal inflammation and identify genetic factors of
           therapeutic response to GI medications

        -  Analyze genotype-phenotype correlations in GI side effects in patients undergoing cancer
