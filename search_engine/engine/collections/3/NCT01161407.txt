      metabolism in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). It is important that the body get
      enough calcium to support many important body functions including bone health. CKD changes
      the calcium balance or how calcium is absorbed and excreted. Because of this, the knowledge
      of calcium absorption and excretion in patients with normal kidney function cannot be used to
      assess patients with CKD. In patients with CKD bone heath is often negatively affected due to
      a combination of poor calcium absorption, increased bone turnover (process where old bone is
      removed and new bone is formed), increased level of parathyroid hormone (PTH [ a hormone that
      acts to increase calcium in the blood]) and decrease in vitamin D levels. This negative
      effect is referred to as Chronic Kidney Disease Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD).

      Treatment to correct CKD-MBD should begin early in the course of CKD. In the normal
      population calcium supplements are frequently used to help prevent age related bone loss.
      Calcium supplements can also be used in CKD patients to help bind phosphate. Maintaining
      correct levels of phosphate in the body is crucial in CKD. However, calcium supplements may
      have adverse effects by promoting calcium phosphate deposits in soft tissues like the
      vascular system which could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

      Therefore this formal balance study is needed to determine if positive calcium balance occurs
      in patients with advanced CKD who are given calcium with meals as a phosphate binder. This
      study will also evaluate how the body handles phosphate.
