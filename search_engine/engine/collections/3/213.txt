correlation between the mast cells and histamine content of the eye incattle .the authors have examined the mast cell content of the eyes of cattleand have established that most of the mast cells are contained in theconjunctiva, the optic nerve and the ocular muscles,. fewer occur in thesclera and iris, and least in the ciliary body and choroid . cornea,lens and retina do not contain mast cells . the histamine content of theocular tissues and their mast cell contents generally run parallel .however, the cornea is exceptional in that its histamine does not occurin a bound state but in some form which is readily available to a mildprocess of extraction (tyrode solution at 4 c) .
