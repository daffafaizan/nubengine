      assigned to be intubated by direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh blade size 3rd (DL, n=196)
      or intubation using the video laryngoscope (VL, n=205). Prior to intubation all patients were
      given a similar regimen of induction of anesthesia. The patients were then intubated, using
      direct laryngoscopy or the VL, by a different anesthetist during which the larynx was
      inspected and given a laryngoscopy score. Time to intubate, failure rate, injuries, personnel
      pleasure and, aspiration rate were measured
