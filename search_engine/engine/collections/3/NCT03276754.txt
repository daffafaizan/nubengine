      increased risk of pneumococcal disease. Pneumonia is frequent among patients hospitalized for
      COPD exacerbations and is associated with increased health care utilization and higher
      mortality. Up to 50%-70% of exacerbations can be attributed to respiratory infections by
      viruses or bacteria, even more in the most severe patients. They are often associated with
      the colonization of airways by multiple bacteria or viruses of low virulence that in normal
      conditions are parts of the normal flora of the upper airway. Current recommendations for
      immunization of patients with COPD include vaccination against influenza and Streptococcus
      pneumoniae. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits of immunization of
      COPD patients with PCV13 and/or against influenza in terms of clinical benefits and quality
      of life.
