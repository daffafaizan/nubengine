      patients with acute renal failure, now known as acute kidney injury (AKI). While we have
      extensive experience with this therapy in critically ill patients, there is no consensus on
      when to start CRRT or a clinical standard as to the best possible way to deliver the therapy.
      Previous studies have examined one aspect of CRRT in detail (for instance the dose of
      delivered therapy, or anticoagulation strategies) or have been small single center studies,
      or large multinational studies examining very basic practice patterns. This is a prospective
      observational cohort study. All patients who receive CRRT as part of their standard of local
      care will be eligible for the study.
