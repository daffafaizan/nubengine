      Caucasian patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome, receiving clopidogrel or
      prasugrel and undergoing PCI. The study will have four arms: African-American on clopidogrel;
      African-American on prasugrel; Caucasian on clopidogrel; and Caucasian on prasugrel. All
      patients will undergo genotyping and platelet reactivity testing with the VerifyNow P2Y12
      assay, at least 6 hours after receiving a thienopyridine loading dose, but before hospital
      discharge. All patients will be treated with aspirin 325 mg/day as well.

      Race determination will be based on a patient's self-report, but patients enrolled in the
      trial must also report that all four of their grandparents were of the same race as theirs.
      Other races (Asian, Native American, et al) will be excluded from this study.
