    
      This is a prospective observational study to identify the incidences and risk factors of
      postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive decline after elderly patients undergoing
      cardiac surgical procedures which require cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative intensive
      care unit (ICU) admission.

      Patients will be screen for POD and POCD with various psychological tests in the
      postoperative period and after hospital discharge.

      Perioperative data and outcomes will be used to identify risk factors of both conditions.
