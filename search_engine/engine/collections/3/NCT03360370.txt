    
      Are selected children with "significant" congenital heart disease (aged from 6 to 66 months)
      in "Nord-Pas-De-Calais" fulfilling inclusion criteria. A reliable and valid questionnaire
      used to screen developmental delays of children aged from one month to 66 months is completed
      by volunteer parents at the time of the study. Data of the questionnaire is collected and a
      scoring by professional is provided ; children at risk for neurodevelopmental delays are
      depicted.

      In parallel, medical and surgical history is also collected to detect risk factors for
      neurodevelopmental disorders.

      The frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in this screened population according to risk
      factors (among neonatal data, severity of congenital heart disease, surgery, length of stay
      at hospital,... ) will be evaluated. The ratio children with neurodevelopmental disorders for
      whom specific care was implemented/ children with neurodevelopmental disorders who did not
      have specific care despite neurodevelopmental disorders will be established.

      Follow-up action will be taken for children at risk for developping neurological disorders
      highlighted by the screening.

      This study will help implementing a specific program for evaluation and management of
      neurodevelopmental disorders for children with congenital heart disease in our region.
