      will not be discontinued before PCI and in the following 48 hours), prospective, single arm
      study.

      In our historical cohort of diabetic patients taking metformin, we observed a mean value of
      lactic acid of 1.2+0.7 mmol/l.

      A total of 150 patients will be enrolled. Patients with any deviations from the study
      protocol will be enrolled in a parallel observational registry.

      The study consists of a screening phase, a 30-day observational phase, and an
      end-of-follow-up visit or phone interview. The total duration of participation in the study
      for each participant is approximately 30 days.
