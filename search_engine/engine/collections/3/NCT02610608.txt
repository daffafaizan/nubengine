      up until 12 months after ovarian stimulation if they get pregnant or until 3 months if the
      stimulation does not lead to pregnancy. Risk factors for thrombosis and ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome will be collected in each woman. At each visit, women will be asked
      whether arterial and/or venous thrombosis had occured.
