        1. Is a regimen of medical abortion with mifepristone using 400mcg buccal misoprostol as
           effective and acceptable as using 800mcg buccal misoprostol up to 63 days since the last
           menstrual period (LMP)?

        2. Are the side effects with buccal use tolerable for women?

        3. Is buccal administration of misoprostol acceptable to women?

        4. When given a choice, do women prefer to take misoprostol at home or in the clinic?
