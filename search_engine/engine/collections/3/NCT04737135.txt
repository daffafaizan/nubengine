      death and heart failure. Myocardial fibrosis has been linked to the appearance of arrhythmias
      and ventricular dysfunction in other patient populations, but this association is poorly
      studied in patients with TF, perhaps because research in congenital heart disease (CHD)
      requires multicenter studies, difficult to carry out. Interstitial myocardial fibrosis
      assessed by molecular and imaging biomarkers is associated with adverse events in patients
      with repaired Fallot tetralogy.
