      Chloroquine combined with a Taxane or Taxane-like chemo agents(Paclitaxel, Docetaxel,
      Abraxane, Ixabepilone).

      The laboratories have developed robust preclinical models utilizing both in vitro systems
      such as the mammosphere (MS) culture and in vivo systems such as human breast cancer
      xenografts allowing the investigators to identify agents which selectively target TICs, as
      single agents or in combination. These models are critical since tumor initiating cells
      (TICs) comprise only a small percentage of the tumor bulk, so that clinical tumor regression
      may not be observed with inhibitors that selectively target TIC self-renewal alone.
      Nonetheless, these agents in combination with conventional therapy may effectively kill both
      actively cycling or fully differentiated cells and the TIC subpopulation, leading to long
      term remission and eradication of cancer cells.
