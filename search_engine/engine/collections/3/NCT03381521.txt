      CTS were inclused and randomized into three groups. Group A, patients received one-session of
      ultrasoung-guided nerve hydrodissection with 10cc normal saline; Group B, patients received
      one-session of ultrasoung-guided nerve hydrodissection with 5cc normal saline; The injection
      syringe was covered to obscure the nature of its contents and patients were asked to turn
      their head away so that they would not see the procedure. As a result, patients were blinded
      to the treatment condition. The primary outcome is Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
      Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes include visual analog scale (VAS),
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the
      median nerve, and global assessment of treatment. The evaluations were performed pretreatment
      as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd and 6th month after injecton.
