      in support provided to survivors from the medical team as well as family and friends. The
      investigators aim to develop and test a Health Education intervention in breast cancer
      survivors. Specifically, the investigators aim to develop the manualized Health Education
      intervention; to assess feasibility; and to provide preliminary data on the effects of the
      intervention. The data from this pilot study will be used to inform future study.
