      decitabine administered twice daily for 5 days maximizes genomic demethylation in patients
      with MDS

      Phase II: To evaluate hematological responses at the dose selected in the Phase I portion of
      the study.

      Note: This study was planned as Phase 1/2 study but only the Phase 1 part was conducted due
      to a change in product development strategy
