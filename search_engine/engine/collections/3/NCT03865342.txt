      million with undiagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2015, and nearly 2 million are
      diagnosed with it every year. By 2050, the CDC estimates that 1 in every 3 people globally
      will have diabetes, a leading cause of death and disability.

      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Noom Coach Diabetes
      Prevention Program mobile platform versus usual medical care. The best intervention to date
      for prediabetes is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Diabetes Prevention
      Program, yet there is limited research investigating a mobile-based delivery of the DPP.
      Pre-diabetes is often discovered during routine medical visitation/annual screening (usual
      care), but face-to-face time with clinicians is often limited. Exploring novel ways, such as
      mHealth interventions to empower patients to pursue lifestyle change and prevent or delay
      diabetes onset is critical to addressing the growing diabetes epidemic.
