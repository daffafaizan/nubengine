      six months and 1000 miles of independent licensed driving. Crash rates decline with driving
      experience, however, no research has demonstrated learning effects on performance due to
      independent driving experience and the extent and variability in driving performance among
      novice young drivers has not been established. The purpose of this study is to assess the
      effect of driving experience on driving performance. We propose to use standard measures of
      driving performance under controlled experimental conditions on a driving test-track and
      vehicle designed for this purpose. Specifically, we propose to test the driving performance
      of a sample of teens within a few weeks after licensure while they are still relatively
      inexperienced drivers and again after greater than 6 months and 1000 miles of driving
      experience test their driving performance. A sample of experience adult drivers would be
      tested in similar fashion to provide an additional comparison group.
