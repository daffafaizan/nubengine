      and death occurs by 2 years. There is actually no curative treatment for this pathology.
      Support and help must be provided from the time of presentation till death and usually this
      period is quite short, about a couple of months. Variations in medical practice have be seen,
      depending on the medical experience and sometimes coupled with differences in family
      resources and values. The aim of the study is to evaluate the needs of the patients and their
      families, the medical practices, and to describe a cohort of SMA type 1 patients with the
      natural history of this disease. For this, a follow-up diary will be done, and this diary
      will be completed by the families and the different practitioners working with the patient.
      Will be noted in it : physical signs, all therapeutic choices and actions, evaluation of the
      pain and treatments. A special part of this follow-up diary will be completed by the medical
      doctors, after the death of the patient, with all the medication used at time of death and
      the conditions of the death. One year after the death of the patient, a questionnaire will be
      proposed to the parents of the child by a psychologist. This questionnaire will estimate the
      benefice of the follow-up diary, and the improvements to give in the diagnostic strategies,
      recommendations for assessment and monitoring, and therapeutic interventions in SMA type 1.
