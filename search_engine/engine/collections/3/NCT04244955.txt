      the criteria of DSM-IV and ICD-10 are not suitable for these children. These symptoms are
      nightmares, sleep problems, compulsive and joyless gambling, regression, hyper attention,
      anxiety over new separation, and new fears. It is also known that the disorders are readily
      more marked at the start of treatment and then subside throughout the first year. Some may
      appear afterwards after treatment.

      To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the prevalence of mental disorders linked to
      diagnosis and care during treatment and their link with the practice of care. This study will
      focus on disorders during treatment. We will study the psychic impact of the announcement of
      diagnosis and care, whether they belong to the traumatic dimension or not. For this, we will
      use the validated French version of the Child Post-Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTS-RI)
      scale. It is the most widely used scale in clinical research of trauma and reactive mental
      disorders in children 6 to 16 years of age. We will also assess the most disturbing elements
      for the child and the main clinical manifestations found in order to improve the detection of
      mental disorders and the care support for these children.

      This research will allow us to assess the prevalence of mental disorders in connection with
      the care practiced within the Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (IHOPe) and,
      subsequently, to establish a another intervention research protocol to improve our practices
      and the care of these patients.
