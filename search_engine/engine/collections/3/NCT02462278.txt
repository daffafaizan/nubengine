    
      Up to 25 healthy female volunteers or females currently trying to conceive will wear the
      continuous temperature sensor for 3 menstrual cycles. Subjects will record their daily oral
      temperature, and record their urine luteinizing hormone (LH) status via ovulation prediction
      kits. Subjects will return to the clinic after a positive urinary LH test to receive
      transvaginal ultrasound scans to confirm ovulation (ultrasounds will be repeated daily until
      evidence of ovulation is documented by follicular collapse). Ovulation will also be confirmed
      by serum progesterone. Subjects will complete an online questionnaire to assess the usability
      and comfort of the continuous temperature monitor.
