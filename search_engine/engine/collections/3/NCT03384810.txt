      of event and etiology of arrest.

      The study aims to evaluate the outcome of in-hospital cardiac arrests, focusing on the
      relationship between etiology and outcome and, in particular, in relation to the length of
      hospitalization prior to the cardiac arrest. The aimed to sought to test the hypothesis that
      cardiac arrests occurring after longer hospitalizations were associated with lower survival
      rates and worse neurological outcomes compared to shorter hospitalizations.
