      to standard dose enoxaparin versus intermediate dose (weight adjusted) enoxaparin
      thromboprophylaxis. Study subjects will be administered enoxaparin during hospitalization in
      a double-blinded manner. Following completion of 14 days, the study arms will be unblinded
      and lower extremity ultrasound performed on the standard dose enoxaparin arm in order to more
      accurately determine the overall cumulative incidence of thrombosis in this group.
