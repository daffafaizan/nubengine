time course of changes in surface tension and morphology of alveolarepithelial cells in co2-induced hyaline membrane disease .atelectasis and hyaline membranes produced by exposure of guinea pigsto 15 percent co2 were found to be associated with disappearance oflamellar bodies in the large alveolar lining cells (granularpneumocytes) and an associated decrease in surfactant as indicated inthe rise of minimal surface tension of the lungs . this process islimited to the uncompensated phase of respiratory acidosis and isreversed during the compensatory phase . the parallel time course inchanges of surface tension and alterations of lamellar bodies in thegranular pneumocytes provides additional evidence for the identificationof the latter as the cells responsible for the secretion of surfactant .
