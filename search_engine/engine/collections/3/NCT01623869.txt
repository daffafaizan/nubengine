      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), defined as complete response (CR) +partial
      response (PR), in patients with advanced, unresectable angiosarcoma treated with trebananib
      (AMG 386).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with
      advanced, unresectable angiosarcoma treated with AMG 386.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate ORR, PFS, and OS with: Baseline and post-treatment changes in expression of
      angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) and TEK tyrosine kinase, endothelial (Tie2) by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC); Serum levels of angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and Ang2; Baseline and post-treatment changes in
      phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase status of TIE2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      2 (VEGFR-2), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase Inhibitor
      (MEK) in tumor tissue; Mutational status of VEGFR-2 and amplification of v-myc
      myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (MYC)/fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 6
      months for 18 months.
