    
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of intracoronary cocktail
      injection combined with thrombus aspiration versus thrombus aspiration alone in ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction patients treated with primary angioplasty. Patients with STEMI will be
      randomized into the cocktail group or the control group. Patients in the cocktail group will
      receive cocktail injection combined with thrombus aspiration. Patients in the control group
      will receive thrombus aspiration alone. The primary outcome of the cocktail I study is the
      composite of death, myocardial infarction or class IV heart failure within 1 year. The
      secondary outcome of the cocktail I study include slow reflow/no reflow during PCI, left
      ventricular function, quality of life, stroke or life-threatening bleeding within 1 year.
