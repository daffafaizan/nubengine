      I. To evaluate the impact of mySmartCheck versus usual care on skin-self-examination (SSE)
      behaviors among individuals at increased risk for developing melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of mySmartCheck versus usual care on patients barriers and benefits
      to conducting SSE, SSE self-efficacy (confidence), level of worry about developing melanoma,
      and number of health care consultations (visits, telephone calls, and emails).

      II. To evaluate whether mySmartCheck effects are moderated by the patient's Total Body
      Photography (TBP) status.

      III. To identify barriers and facilitators to using mySmartCheck.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Participants complete a telephone based usability testing of the online program.
      Participants complete between 1-5 user testing sessions of the mySmartCheck program (about
      45-60 minutes per session) to provide feedback on acceptability, satisfaction, comprehension,
      and usability.

      PHASE II: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. Both the intervention and control
      group complete a baseline survey as well as a 13 weeks post-baseline survey.

      GROUP I: After completing the baseline survey, participants receive access to the
      mySmartCheck program, and continue to receive standard of care. Participants are asked to
      complete another survey 13 weeks post-baseline.

      GROUP II: After completing the baseline survey, participants receive standard of care.
      Participants are asked to complete another survey 13 weeks post-baseline.

      Study duration is 13 weeks for all participants.
