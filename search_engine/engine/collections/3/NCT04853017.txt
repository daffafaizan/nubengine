    
      The study consists of 3 phases: Phase 1A, Phase 1B, and Phase 2. In Phase 1A, Amph modified
      KRAS peptides, Amph-G12D and Amph-G12R (ELI-002 2P) will be evaluated with admixed
      Amph-CpG-7909, with plans to transition to an Amph-Peptide 7P drug product containing all 7
      Amph-Peptides (G12D, G12R, G12V, G12A, G12C, G12S, G13D) for Phase 1B dose expansion and
      Phase 2 studies.

      The Phase 1A portion of the study is an open-label, dose-escalation, 3+3 design in which up
      to 18 subjects will be treated in 3 planned dose level cohorts. In this phase, increasing
      doses of Amph-CpG-7909 will be evaluated sequentially. Safety and pharmacodynamic data will
      be evaluated and a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined in consideration of a
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) if observed.

      In Phase 1B, three dose expansion cohorts (up to 17 subjects in each cohort for a total of up
      to 51 subjects) will be added to evaluate for preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in
      KRAS and NRAS mutated solid tumors (including colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,
      mucinous ovarian cancer, as well as bile duct and gallbladder cancer) and changes from
      baseline in tumor biomarkers.

      In Phase 2, an additional 90 pancreatic cancer subjects will be randomized 2:1 (ELI-002
      versus observation) to further evaluate antitumor activity. Subjects randomized to ELI-002
      will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of ELI-002 during Immunization and Booster Periods.
      Subjects randomized to observation will have the same safety and efficacy evaluations and
      will follow the same assessment schedule as subjects randomized to ELI-002 but will not
      receive ELI-002 treatment. Subjects randomized to observation will be able to cross-over to
      ELI-002 treatment in the event of confirmed disease progression.
