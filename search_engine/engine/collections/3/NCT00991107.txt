    
      Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a new class of therapeutics for the treatment
      of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The investigational drug, HE3286, is a synthetic analog
      of a naturally occurring hormone with a potentially new mechanism of action that may improve
      the current therapeutic options available to a T2DM patient.

      The glucose clamp is the gold standard for measurement of insulin sensitivity. Given the
      observed activity of HE3286 in reducing insulin resistance in both impaired glucose
      intolerant subjects and type 2 diabetic patients, it is necessary to evaluate the
      physiological site of action (i.e. liver vs. skeletal muscle) of HE3286 in order to further
      understand the mechanism of action and to design future clinical trials.
