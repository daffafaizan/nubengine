      (LUTS) in aging men. LUTS is categorized as any combination of symptoms related to storage,
      voiding, or postmicturition. The management of bothersome BPH includes watchful waiting,
      pharmacotherapy, and surgery. The most common surgical approach is transurethral resection of
      the prostate (TURP). TURP can improve voiding symptoms dramatically. However, TURP is
      correlated with a 20% rate of perioperative and long-term complications. In addition, elderly
      patients usually have some comorbidities that require complex medical regimens that may
      further complicate perioperative management. Therefore, new treatments that are more
      minimally invasive and more effective are needed to manage patients with LUTS.The advent of
      Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) has triggered a paradigm shift in the
      surgical management of BPH; with improved functional outcomes, lower complication rates and
      length of stay, and fewer repeat procedures required at 5- 10 years versus TURP, and open
      prostatectomy. HoLEP is now regarded as the gold standard for BPH.Prostatic urethral lift
      (PUL) is a minimally invasive surgery that uses small implants under cystoscopic guidance
      which serve to retract the obstructing lateral lobes and make an open, continuous voiding
      channel through the prostate fossa, from the verumontanum up to the bladder neck. PUL has
      been demonstrated to provide significant symptom improve with low morbidity, including
      preservation of sexual function.
