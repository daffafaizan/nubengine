      54 million adults in the US have doctor-diagnosed arthritis. The number of people expected to
      have arthritis by the year 2040 is more than 78 million. Total joint arthroplasty is
      considered the treatment of choice for end-stage osteoarthritis. Currently, more than 1
      million hip and knee replacements are performed each year in the US. By 2030, primary THR is
      projected to grow 171% and primary TKR is projected to grow by up to 189%, for a projected
      635,000 and 1.28 million procedures, respectively. The incidence of pre-operative
      psychological distress in this group of patients is reported between 30% and 60% and
      preoperative psychological distress is associated with poorer pain and functional outcomes
      after surgery. Resilience, characterized by an ability to bounce back or recover from stress,
      is increasingly recognized as a psychometric property affecting many outcomes' domains
      including outcomes after TJA. Better resilience could improve patients overall satisfaction
      with the procedure.
