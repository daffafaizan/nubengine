      skin disease characterized by scaly erythroderma at birth, abnormal hair and severe
      psoriasiform /atopic dermatitis-like lesions with high IgE levels and allergic
      manifestations. It has considerable impact on the quality of life of patients, as a result of
      inflammatory and painful flares, the chronicity of the lesions, severe growth retardation
      with definitive short stature.

      NS is caused by loss of function SPINK5 mutations which lead to unregulated epidermal
      protease activity : kallikrein 5, kallikrein 7 and elastase proteases are found overactive
      following loss of inhibition. Secondly, KLK5 activates PAR-2 receptors at the keratinocyte
      surface leading to the activation of the NF-KB pathway and the release of different
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such TNF-alpha .

      There is no specific treatment for NS. The different therapeutic attempts by Soriatane
      (acitretin) have worsen the skin inflammation and dryness. The use of topical calcineurin
      inhibitors (Tacrolimus) has sometimes improved skin inflammation but with an important
      systemic diffusion. The use of immune suppressive drugs in severe patients with NS followed
      in our labelized Centre (Cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) have not brought
      a significant and durable improvement. So NS is a very distressing genodermatosis.

      For these clinical and biological considerations, a benefit with anti TNF treatment could be
      expected and the evaluation of such treatment is justified in NS. The clinical case of an
      adult patient with severe NS, improved by anti-Tnf treatment has recently been published in
      the literature
