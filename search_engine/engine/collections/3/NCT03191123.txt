    
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver.For
      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B patients，especially those with Solitary Huge
      Tumor (≥5cm) ，the better therapy between hepatic resection and transarterial
      chemoembolization remains controversial despite extensive studies。 From now on, we
      prospectively collected patients with solitary huge HCC who received hepatectomy or TACE. Of
      the 200 patients，100 patients were surgically treated and the others underwent TACE。After the
      treatment, patients received routine follow-up with physical examination, serum α-fetoprotein
      (AFP) level and ultrasonography at 3-month intervals for the first year and then every 6
      months.The end of follow-up was determined as either the time of last follow-up (July 2019)
      or death. The overall survival，including 1, 2 and 3-year overall survival rates，will be
      analyse. All data are collected prospectively.
