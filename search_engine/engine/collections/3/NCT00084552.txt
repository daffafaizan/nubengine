      Primary

        -  Compare erectile dysfunction in patients with stage T1b-T2c adenocarcinoma of the
           prostate after treatment with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with vs without dose
           sparing for erectile tissue.

      Secondary

        -  Compare biochemical freedom from failure rates, as a measure of prostate cancer control,
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the association of molecular markers and biochemical freedom from failure rate
           and other endpoints in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, single-blind study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (â‰¤ 65 vs > 65), prescription radiotherapy dose (74 Gy vs 76 Gy), and frequency of erection
      during sexual activity within the past 4 weeks (a few times vs sometimes vs most times to
      always). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily
           5 days a week for approximately 7.5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo IMRT with dose restriction to erectile tissue once daily 5 days
           a week for approximately 7.5 weeks.

      Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      metastasis.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 6 and 12 months, and then annually for 4 years

      Patients are followed at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2.5 years.
