      over a period of 6 months.

      Patients will be followed up at 1 month and 1 year Patients should have agreed to participate
      in the observatory, knowing that participation or refusal to participate will not alter the
      therapeutic attitude of the physician responsible for the patient. The study of phenotypic
      characteristics will not change the therapeutic approach of the medical teams.
