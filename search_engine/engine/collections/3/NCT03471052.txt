      that is in an aberrant position. Prevalence is up to 10% on endoscopy studies and 5% on post
      mortem studies. There is thought to be a link with another condition of the lower oesophagus
      called Barrett's oesophagus, although there is limited evidence. Unlike Barrett's oesophagus,
      progression to cancer from an inlet patch is exceptionally rare.

      The inlet patch can produce acid and mucus, and is associated with symptoms including sore
      throat, cough and hoarseness. One particular symptom, called globus pharyngeus (the feeling
      of a ball in the back of the throat) is often associated with an inlet patch.

      There is no recognised treatment for symptomatic inlet patch. Anti-acid medications works for
      some but not all, which may in part be explained by the lack of acid producing cells in some
      inlet patches. Ablation of the inlet patch has been successful in small series using Argon
      Plasma Coagulation. This device is, however, associated with inter user variability and
      unpredictable depth of ablation. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using the BarrxTM System is a
      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and FDA approved device for
      treatment of abnormal oesophageal lining, which has shown to be successful in reversing
      Barrett's oesophagus to normal squamous lining. These devices are advantageous as the depth
      of ablation is controlled. The investigators have previously demonstrated, in a pilot study,
      that these devices are safe and effective for reversal of inlet patch to normal mucosa, with
      improvement in symptoms.

      This study will use the BarrxTM system to treat patients with symptomatic inlet patch that is
      refractory to standard anti-acid medication, in a blinded sham controlled trial.
