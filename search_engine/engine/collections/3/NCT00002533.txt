    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of prophylactic antifungal therapy with fluconazole on the
           incidence and severity of radiation-associated mucositis/thrush in patients with head
           and neck cancer undergoing definitive radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard hyperfractionated radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5-5.6
           weeks. Patients receive oral fluconazole on days 1-4 and 28-31 of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients who develop a
           microbiologically proven fungal infection or clinically evident oral cavity and/or
           oropharyngeal thrush may receive fluconazole as in arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 42 patients (26 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
