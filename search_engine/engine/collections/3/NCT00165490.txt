    
      -  Patients participating in this study must have a tumor biopsy taken to confirm the type
           of tumor.

        -  Outpatient therapy with cetuximab alone will be given intravenously on week 0.

        -  During week 1-8 outpatient radiation therapy will be started and continued once per day
           for 28 treatments or 5 1/2 weeks.

        -  Outpatient chemotherapy (cisplatin, irinotecan and cetuximab) is given once per week on
           weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5. Cetuximab alone will be given on weeks 3, 6, 7, and 8.

        -  A repeat CT scan and PET scan will be performed to restage the tumor on week 8. This is
           to confirm that the cancer has remained localized.

        -  Inpatient surgery is scheduled 4 to 8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and
           radiation therapy.

        -  Cetuximab will be restarted within 4 weeks after surgery and continue weekly for 6
           months.

        -  During chemotherapy and radiation therapy, physical exams and vital signs will be
           performed before each chemotherapy treatment. Routine blood tests will also be
           performed.

        -  Between chemotherapy-radiation therapy and surgery a CAT scan of chest, abdomen and
           pelvis along with a PET scan will be performed.

        -  After surgery a CAT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed every 3 months
           for 2 years then every 6 months for 3 years. An EGD (upper endoscopy) with biopsy will
           be done every 6 months for 2 years and then yearly for 3 years. Physical exam, vital
           signs and routine blood tests will be done every 2 weeks for 6 months, then every 3
           months for 1.5 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
