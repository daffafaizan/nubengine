      critical to realize the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals. Malawi pioneered Option B+ (B+), a novel
      application of test-and-treat that provided life-long ART for HIV+ pregnant and breastfeeding
      women. While maternal ART uptake improved 7-fold, retention and adherence remained
      suboptimal: only 59% were retained after two years, and of these, only two-thirds achieved
      adequate ART adherence. Other B+ countries are observing suboptimal retention.

      VITAL Start (Video-intervention to Inspire Treatment Adherence for Life) is a brief
      facility-based video intervention, created with formative participatory research, applied
      theoretical frameworks, and evidence-based message framing techniques. VITAL Start was
      designed to help optimize retention and adherence to ART among pregnant and breastfeeding
      women in Malawi.

      The study will evaluate the impact, implementation and cost effectiveness of VITAL Start in a
      multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Malawi with the primary composite outcome of
      retention and adherence (viral suppression) 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy
      (ART). The study will also examine the delivery of VITAL Start via surveys and interviews
      with patients and partners and conduct cost-effectiveness analyses.

      If successful, VITAL Start will provide an intervention that (1) standardizes and improves
      counseling at a critical teaching moment through an engaging and culturally sensitive
      experience, (2) is inexpensive and rapidly scalable without decelerating ART expansion, and
      (3) allows more efficient use of health care worker time.
