      glenoid in dry human scapulae bone and correlation to its function.

      The knowledge of normal anatomical features and variations of the shape and size of glenoid
      cavity are prerequisites for complete understanding of the mechanics of shoulder joint, this
      information has clinical application in shoulder arthroplasty, gleno-humeral instability and
      rotator cuff tear management.

      study morphological features of the acetabulum and to measure various dimensions of the
      acetabulum in dry human hip bone and correlation to its function.

      Knowledge of the dimensions of acetabulum are vital to understand the mechanics of hip joint,
      and will assist the prosthetists to construct the suitable prostheses
