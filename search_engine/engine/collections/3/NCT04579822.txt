      immunization for all pregnant women in the 2020-2021 season. This nationwide cohort study is
      proposed to assess the risks of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes following vaccination
      with a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) during pregnancy. We will use the national health
      insurance database from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) linked with the national
      immunization program registry data from the Korea Centers for Diseases Control & Prevention
      (KCDC).
