      emotionally taxing job demands and a high requirement for empathy. Implementing self-care

      psychologists.

      The intervention is a person-directed, individual, primary occupational intervention. It will
      be carried out via videoconference in six weekly sessions of 45 minutes. MAGO is a program
      derived from Self-care Assessment for Psychology (SCAP). From a preventive perspective on
      self-care, items represent strategies or behaviors that may be integrated into one's
      professional and personal life on a more ongoing and proactive basis to promote
      well-functioning.

      Chile has presented a slow but progressive development of e-mental health research, and
      Internet-based interventions are at an early stage of development in this country. Using
      videoconference and web-delivered questionnaires are crucial in reaching psychologists
      considering problems such as long distances of transportation and a tiny budget for mental
      health. Nevertheless, Chile scores 52 in the Global Connectivity Index, while digital
      technologies are highly utilized across all social strata.
