      can cause meningitis, blood poisoning and other serious illnesses. Most people carry these
      bacteria and never become ill, yet a very small proportion go on to develop these illnesses
      which can result in life long disabilities or death. The mechanism by which this happens is
      poorly understood and has been studied in various ways, usually focussing on the bacteria or
      on the individual, but none has given a definitive answer. This study will be the first of
      its kind and will assess the interaction between the host and the bacteria at the genetic
      level, through genetic mapping, helping us to understand what makes some people susceptible
      to this infection.
