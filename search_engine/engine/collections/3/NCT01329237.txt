      Imaging and vasomotion Substudy:

      50 consecutive patients enrolled in the COMPARE II trial at the University of Fribourg
      Medical Center will undergo follow-up re-angiography 14 months after index procedure with
      assessment of Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and vasomotion testing.

      ENDPOINT SUBSTUDY (all at 14 months):

      Primary endpoint imaging: percentage of uncovered stent struts per lesion and mean neointimal
      thickness assessed by OCT.

      vasomotion: coronary vasomotion assessed with quantitative coronary angiography at rest and
      during supine bicycle exercise.
