    
      Following a Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM), this study will assess factors that influence
      parent's willingness to participate in tobacco trials that emphasize cessation or promotion
      of smoke-free homes/cars while identifying barriers for implementing these strategies.
      Information will be obtained from questionnaires completed by parents. This information will
      be used to suggest an appropriate emphasis for intervention, refine our recruitment
      strategies, design interventions that maximize participation rates and retention, and better
      direct our resources and future tobacco control efforts for patients and their families.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the proportion of smoking parents of children with cancer, children with
           sickle cell disease (SCD), and childhood cancer survivors who are willing to participate
           in tobacco trials offered in the context of their child's medical care.
