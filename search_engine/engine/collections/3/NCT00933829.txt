      in clean surgical wounds, ED based studies still need to be conducted to convince ED
      physicians that the use of absorbable sutures to close the skin in traumatic lacerations are
      just as acceptable as traditional non-absorbable sutures. Use of absorbable sutures confers
      several advantages over non-absorbable sutures. For one, patients do not need an additional
      physician visit either in the office, or more often that not, in the emergency department.
      These visits add to ED overcrowding, prolonged length of ED stay and are often not reimbursed
      if seen in the emergency department. Moreover, adult patients need to miss work or school and
      children often have to miss school or daycare to have these sutures removed. The potential to
      avert another traumatic experience from suture removal in children who had been restrained
      for suture placement is another advantage of using absorbable sutures over non-absorbable
      sutures.
