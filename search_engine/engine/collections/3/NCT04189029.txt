      with currently no efficient therapy. This syndrome is likely explained by different
      pathophysiological inputs leading to common symptoms of heart failure. These
      pathophysiological abnormalities can primarily involve the heart but also other organs with
      secondary impact on the myocardium. There is however no clear understanding and diagnostic
      algorithms of the different HFpEF subpopulations. Novel mathematical methods (such as machine
      learning) can help identifying clusters within an heterogeneous population such as HFpEF
      patients.

      A registry (2500 anticipated) will be constituted with patients hospitalized for congestive
      heart failure in the participating centers during the last 3 years. From this registry, 500
      patients will be invited to visit in the hospital for 8-10 hours for physical examination,
      ECG, performance-based tests, blood draw, cMRI, echocardiography (rest and low-level
      exercise), Ultrafast echo (for non-invasive measurement of myocardial stiffness), low
      radiation cardiac CT (for calcium scoring), non-invasive measurement of arterial stiffness.
      They will be asked to fill out questionnaires about dyspnea, depression and about general
      health and quality of life. They will then be equipped with a smart connected garment (with
      cardiovascular & hemodynamic sensors), a connected weight balance and a blood pressure
      monitoring device for telemonitoring collection of cardiovascular hemodynamic parameters in
      real-life conditions (for 14 days).

      Patients included in the registry will be followed-up for 3 years using medico-administrative
      databases and vital status, cardiovascular and heart failure outcomes will be collected.
