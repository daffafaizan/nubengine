      imposes morbidity on HIV-TB co-infected patients, but also facilitates viral replication
      causing faster disease progression. Tuberculosis, being the commonest among the opportunistic
      infections among HIV infected persons deserves special attention. Moreover, disruption of
      latency of TB infection (LTBI) with development of more severe clinical forms at relatively
      early stage of HIV disease when CD4 count still remains above 300/ul, makes TB a unique
      opportunistic infection and negatively influence the outcome of dual infection.This is
      suggestive of impairment of some critical immune function involving relatively less frequent
      fine T cell subsets with functional hierarchy over bulk T cells, so as to weaken the immune
      containment of LTBI resulting in reactivation of M. tuberculosis and manifestation of severe
      forms of TB.HIV has recently been reported to preferentially infect, destroy and incapacitate
      two key immune-regulatory T cell subsets, namely NKT and Treg cells.Therefore, studying them
      along the course of HIV disease and impact of their changes on the function of effector T
      cells directed against M.tuberculosis is important.
