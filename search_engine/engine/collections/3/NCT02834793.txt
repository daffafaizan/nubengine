    
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      perampanel as adjunctive therapy in participants with inadequately controlled seizures
      associated with LGS. The study will consist of 3 phases: Prerandomization (4 to 8 weeks),
      Randomization (18 weeks), and an Extension A (52 weeks). An additional Extension B with
      open-label treatment will be available for optional participation to participants who reside
      in Japan and in countries where an expanded access program (EAP) cannot be implemented or has
      not yet been implemented.
