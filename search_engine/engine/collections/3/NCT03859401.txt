      detected it is often too late to avoid hypoglycemia without the ingestion of rapid
      carbohydrates or the use of rescue injections, such as glucagon. To this avail, the
      investigators propose to add a novel Model Predictive Control module to the proven USS
      system. This module is designed to compute insulin doses every 5 minutes that are designed to
      "optimally" maintain glycaemia around a target of 120mg/dL. The optimality is defined
      mathematically as minimizing deviations from basal rate injections and the distance between
      current and future (up to 2h) glycaemia from a physiologically feasible trajectory back down
      (or up) to a pre-specified target. Furthermore, the novel control system, labelled Multi
      Stage MPC or Ensemble MPC, accounts for a preset number of exercise scenarios during the
      prediction horizon, these scenarios being derived from the user historical record; this setup
      allows the control system to anticipate expected exercise bouts up to 2h in advance while
      maintaining the condition for optimal glycemic control.

      By adding such module to a well validated system, the investigators expect an improvement in
      protection against hypoglycemia during and immediately after physical activity without
      increase in hyperglycemia. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, the novel
      anticipatory system will be compared to a na√Øve AP system during highly supervised hotel
      admissions with afternoon exercise. Participants will be asked to exercise regularly in the
      late afternoon during a month of data collection to generate the patterns to be anticipated.
