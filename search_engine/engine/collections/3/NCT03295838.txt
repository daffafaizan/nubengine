      a growing evidence base, but there is a lack of effectiveness and moderator studies. The
      present study examined the effectiveness of MBT in a naturalistic setting and explored
      psychiatric and psychological moderators of outcome. Method: Borderline and general
      psychiatric symptoms, suicidality, self-harm, alexithymia and self-image were measured in a
      group of BPD patients (n=75) receiving MBT; assessments were made at baseline, and
      subsequently after 6, 12 and 18 months (when treatment ended). Borderline symptoms were the
      primary outcome variable.
