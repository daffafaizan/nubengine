      MarrowStim device (cBMA) injected IM at 25 sites in the leg proximal to the amputation in the
      index limb to prevent ischemic wound complications after surgery. cBMA will be injected into
      the anterior tibialis muscle below the point of amputation in an area approximately 3cm^2 x
      2cm^2 for analytical purposes. Patients will be scheduled for amputation at Days 7, 14, or 21
      post injection. Safety will be evaluated by review of treatment related adverse events (AE)
      during the 52-week follow-up period. The investigator will compare rates of wound
      complications and amputation revisions to historical controls at the institution to assess
      trends in therapeutic efficacy.

      Patients will undergo amputation and injection sites will be harvested at that time.
      Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) will determine capillary density and local host immune
      responses. Angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines will be quantified using a multiplex array
      system and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
