      effect of rTMS on cognitive function in people with Parkinson disease (PD). The primary
      endpoint is the change of cognitive function, and the secondary endpoint is the improvement
      of motor symptoms. All participants need to complete the informed consent before they are
      enrolled into the trial. Preliminary data including age, sex, education, employment, medical
      history, drug history, disease duration, modified Hoehn-Yahr stage, and UPDRS score are
      collected. Cognitive function including mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clocking
      drawing test, Wechsler memory scale (WMS)-world list test and spatial span test, trial making
      test A and B, category fluency test (animal naming), and beck depression inventory-II are
      tested by trained neuropsychiatrists. Gait function are evaluated with time up and go (TUG),
      freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG-Q), and Gait-up device analysis before trial starting.
      Pre-treatment brain image examined by magnetic resonance image (MRI) and blood sampling for
      synapse protein level are performed. The participants are then arranged to receive theta
      burst stimulation for 5 days by using Magstim machine (Super Rapid 2) equipped with air
      cooled coil (D70), stimulating on supplementary motor area (SMA). After the intervention,
      post-treatment evaluation including cognition, motor symptoms, gait function, brain MRI, and
      blood sampling will be performed again with the same methods at 1 month later. Any adverse
      event during the trial period will also be recorded. The trial is expected to be conducted in
      Shuange-Ho hospital, Taipei Medical University.
