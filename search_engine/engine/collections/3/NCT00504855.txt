      evaluated the efficacy of waterproof cast padding with respect to preventing lower extremity
      cast sores.

      Comparison: Non-blinded randomization to waterproof or cotton/cotton-poly cast padding
      material in a pediatric population who have lower extremity casts that include the foot and
      are applied in the operating room. Comparison of cast sore incidence will be made in the two
      randomized groups.
