      Participants: Adult healthy and non-smoker individuals will be recruited. The study will be
      approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the University of Plymouth.

      Main protocol: Participants will visit the laboratory on two different occasions. At the
      first visit, basic anthropometrical measurements will be taken before to collect a blood (6
      mL) and saliva (3 mL) samples under fasting conditions. Then, the nitrate reducing capacity
      of oral bacteria will be measured using a 10 mL of a free-nitrite water solution containing
      sodium nitrate. Participants will rinse their mouth for 5 min. Then, the mouth rinse will be
      collected into a sterile tube to analyse the absolute concentration of nitrite. Following
      this, blood pressure will be taken in triplicate on the left arm using an electronic
      sphygmomanometer. Then, microvascular function will be measured on the left forearm (extensor
      digitorum) using a hyperaemia reactive test. At the end of this visit and following a
      double-blind and non-cross over design participants will be allocated in one group: 1)
      chlorhexidine mouthwash or 2) propolis mouthwash. Participants will be given 14 tubes of 10
      mL of mouthwash to rinse their mouth twice a day for a week before to return to the
      laboratory a week later and to undertake the same measurements.
