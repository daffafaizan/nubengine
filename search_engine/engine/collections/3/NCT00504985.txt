      by rating how severe symptoms are and how they interfere with daily activity. Researchers can
      also compare these ratings to the levels of certain proteins called cytokines that are found
      in the blood while the patient is experiencing symptoms.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete 2 surveys during your
      Emergency Center visit. One survey will measure physical and mental symptoms (such as sadness
      or distress). The other survey will ask you for personal "demographic" information (such as
      your age and marital status). Completing the questionnaires will take about 10-15 minutes.
      During the Emergency Center visit, about 1 tablespoon of blood will be drawn for cytokine
      testing.

      Research staff will also collect other information from your medical record, clinical
      information, and lab results. This information may include cancer diagnosis, cancer
      treatment, performance status (your ability to perform daily activities), disease status, and
      any medications you are taking at that time.

      This is an investigational study. About 520 patients will participate in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
