      treatment, bed time insulin therapy may lead to a parallel increase in abdominal visceral and
      subcutaneous fat, whereas pioglitazone treatment should lead to a stability (or even a
      decrease ) in visceral and an increase in subcutaneous abdominal fat. As visceral fat mass is
      correlated with insulin-resistance and cardio-vascular risk, the evolution of visceral
      abdominal fat in type 2 diabetic patients is of great importance.

      The study hypothesis is that quantity of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue
      should differently evolute comparing a 6 month treatment with pioglitazoneÂ® (30 or 45mg/j) or
      NPH " bed-time " insulin (0.2u/kg/
