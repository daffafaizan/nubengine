      productivity, especially in young adults. Most patients are diagnosed between the age of
      20-40 years. In sarcoidosis, multiple organs are affected by inflammation; the cause of the
      disease is unknown and no curative medication exists. Sarcoidosis invalidates the lives of
      most patient for many years.

      Although curative (pharmaco) therapy is not on hand, immunosuppressive drugs may control the
      symptoms of the disease. These symptoms are caused by the inflammation in multiple organs,
      foremost the lungs and the lymphoid system. However, 90% of the sarcoidosis patients receives
      no immunosuppressive medication at all during the first months after diagnosis, even though
      the immune system is then highly activated and patients suffer from severe complaints like
      malaise, fatigue and pain. This wait-and-see policy is common international practice, but
      scientific grounds and official guidelines are lacking.

      This project examines whether low grade suppression of the initial inflammatory process of
      sarcoidosis by intervention with low-dose dexamethasone therapy achieves significant
      alleviation of (sub-)acute symptoms, improvement in quality of life, increase in work
      productivity, and whether this intervention prevents disease progression and reduces total
      health-care costs.
