    
      Slovenia is highly endemic region for Lyme borreliosis (LB). LB is a tick - borne multisystem
      infectious disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato.

      Solitary erythema migrans (SEM) is a typical clinical manifestation of early localized LB and
      microbiological confirmation of borrelial infection is not required for diagnosis.

      Clinical manifestations of early disseminated LB (multiple erythema migrans (MEM), peripheral
      facial palsy and meningitis) are not characteristic enough to enable a reliable diagnosis,
      indicating the need for laboratory demonstration of borrelial infection which is mainly
      accomplished with serological tests.

      For detection of borrelial antibodies several methods are used, such as immunofluorescent
      assay (IFA), enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblots. Serological tests are not standardized
      and have limited sensitivity and specificity.

      The aim of this study is to specify and compare the sensitivity of IFA and LIAISON
      serological tests in early disseminated LB in children in Slovenia.

      The secondary aim is to determine the influence of early antibiotic treatment of early
      disseminated LB on serological results in children with LB in Slovenia and to compare the
      serological results in children who are treated with antibiotics immediately and those who
      are treated later in the course of the study.
