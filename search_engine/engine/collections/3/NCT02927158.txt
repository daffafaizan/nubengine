      Old Order Amish and Mennonite communities that is accessible to their members with decreasing
      cost and effective diagnostic strategies, and to leverage the genetic information obtained to
      better understand the genetic forces and risks driving the health of these populations. As a
      bridge to do so, next-generation sequencing technology will be used to identify genetic
      defects in Old Order Amish families/individuals who have a clinical picture suggestive of a
      Mendelian disorder but with unknown diagnosis. Investigators plan to develop targeted
      analytical NGS panels optimized for general use in the clinical setting when dealing with
      Plain Communities patients and families, yielding better and more prompt clinical
      intervention and improvement of outcomes. The study also involves use of whole genome
      sequencing for a mutant allele discovery platform to identify novel genetic risks in this
      population not yet identified in patients, and to use this platform to describe genetic
      differences in Old Order Amish communities across Pennsylvania and ultimately across the
      country. With WGS will be used to analyze population genetics by comparing the distribution
      of genetic variants among the various Amish communities and to compare these with their
      European ancestry variants available in 1000 genome project, to study the influence of
      founder-selection and genetic drift in these populations.
