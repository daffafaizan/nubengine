      disease leading to cardiac surgery. Both volume overload and coagulopathy in the immediate
      post-operative period after cardiac surgery are important predictors of clinical course and
      mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated that presence of ESRD is an independent risk
      factor for post-operative respiratory failure and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery, partially mediated through volume overload and prolonged mechanical ventilation, as
      well as coagulopathy attributed to platelet dysfunction and uremia.

      Prolonged mechanical ventilation after cardiac surgery has been shown to be associated with
      higher morbidity and mortality. Fluid overload is a predictor of length of mechanical
      ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Therefore early restoration of volume and
      electrolyte homeostasis and clearance of uremic toxins should be one of the principal goals
      in the immediate post operative period in patients with ESRD. However, to the best of our
      knowledge, the effect of timing of post-operative renal replacement therapy, specifically
      hemodialysis, on clinical outcomes has not been studied in ESRD patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery.

      Accordingly, we are planning to conduct this study to evaluate the effect of early
      hemodialysis treatment after cardiac surgery, on clinical outcomes related to volume overload
      and coagulopathy (i.e. duration of mechanical ventilation, transfusion requirements, and
      length of ICU stay) in patients with ESRD
