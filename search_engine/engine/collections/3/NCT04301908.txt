      and cirrhosis who were treated with antiviral therapy in the Second Department of Liver
      Disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2008 to April 2020
      were enrolled. Patients treated with antiviral drugs including interferon and/or nucleoside
      (acid) analogues lasting more than 6 months were included in the study. Interferon,
      nucleoside (acid) analogue monotherapy, combination therapy, sequential therapy, maintenance
      therapy and drug withdrawal therapy can all be included in the study. HBV DNA content,
      HBsAg/anti-HBs, HBeAg/anti-HBe, biochemical indexes, serum AFP and liver imaging (liver
      ultrasound) were collected before treatment (baseline), during treatment and after treatment.
      The virological response and clinical outcome after antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis
      B were observed for at least 288 weeks, and the main evaluation indicators were the
      occurrence or reversal of cirrhosis complications, hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality.
      Secondary evaluation index: the influence factors of different clinical outcomes. To
