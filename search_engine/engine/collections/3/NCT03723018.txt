      students. Participants will be randomized into one of three groups of roughly the same size:
      two meditation groups and an observational group. All three groups will fill out online
      surveys at several points in the study. The only thing the observational group will be asked
      to do is fill out these surveys. The meditation groups will be asked to meditate for 10
      minutes a day for 8 weeks. Participants will be provided with an app or website that
      instructs them on how to meditate.

      Outcome analyses will be done with an intention to treat approach. Outcomes will be assessed
      using linear regression with the outcome variable as the dependent variable and baseline
      outcome measure, baseline mindfulness, and treatment group as the independent variables.
      Secondary outcomes will be considered exploratory.

      The study is funded by the Jane Engelberg Memorial Foundation
