      high in marine sources of omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish, may lower the risk of developing
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A large prospective study is underway to determine
      whether oral supplementation with 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids is beneficial for subjects
      with dry AMD. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the change in serum omega-3 index
      (blood level of omega-3 fatty acids) after 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
      versus 2 grams.
