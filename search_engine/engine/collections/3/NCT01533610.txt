        1. Stellate ganglion blocks will be performed in a small sample (n = 12) of the local
           patient population that suffers from PTSD in order to replicate other preliminary
           findings.

        2. The parameters that lead to a successful treatment response will be evaluated by
           comparing and contrasting the results obtained in younger (n=6) OEF/OIF generation
           veterans versus older (n=6) Vietnam generation veterans.

        3. The individual difference variables that might lead to successful treatment responses
           will be studied by obtaining correlative measures of psychological and psychometric data
           and responses to standardized tests.

      Research Design:

      This is an open label unblinded clinical pilot case series study to determine the efficacy of
      stellate ganglion blockade for relief of PTSD symptoms in the Long Beach VA healthcare
      population.
