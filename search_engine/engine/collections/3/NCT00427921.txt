      adalimumab 160 mg subcutaneous (SC) at Baseline and 80 mg SC at Week 2, followed by
      maintenance dosing of 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4 in subjects with
      moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease (CD) who were eligible to receive biologic
      therapy or who had failed to respond to, lost response to, or were intolerant to infliximab.
      Failure of prior therapy was determined by the Investigator. Subjects were to have an 8-week
      wash-out period prior to Baseline from the last dose of infliximab.
