      control is assessed by means of force platforms. However, most of these devices are
      stationary, that is the patient is the dynamic element which can generate an evaluation with
      high subjectivity index. Therefore, this study aimed at developed a reaction force to the
      ground platform which provides mechanical stimuli controlled to quantify the distribution of
      the mass center as a function of the angular variation in the elderly ankle in the upright
      position. The construction of the prototype was divided into 3 steps, based on the
      two-dimensional movement of the ankle joint. In the 1st stage the construction of the
      mechanical assembly; in the 2nd stage development of the electronics; and 3rd stage the
      development of the supervisory system (control system). The force plataform was evaluated
      following the engineering functional tests such as: characterization and calibration of the
      sensors, the definition of the transfer function and accuracy of tests of angular movements
      (+ 10 ° and -10 ° to the movements of inversion and eversion, + 15 and -15º to the movements
      of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion). For the tests with volunteers were selected 30
      volunteers.
