      clinical features, imaging, cognition and dopamine blood levels. The study consists of four
      parts (plus an optional fifth part) that will be completed over two-three separate days
      within a 30 day span. The four parts will not necessarily be performed in this order. Part
      one will be clinical and written questionnaire assessments of PD and FOG followed by 3D
      motion capture evaluations. Part two are cognitive or neuropsychiatric assessments. Part
      three is a magnetic resonance image (MRI) to examine the brain structure. Part four is
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging scan that measures norepinephrine transporter
      levels. The optional part 5 is a lumbar puncture that will measure cerebrospinal fluid
      catecholamines and proteomics.
