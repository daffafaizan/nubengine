      in China. A significant proportion of lung cancer patients suffer from cancer related pain,
      however few studies have reported the prevalence and clinical features of such pain,
      especially in China.

      This study is a cross-sectional survey in 20 hospitals in Northern China. We designed two
      separate series of questions to be answered by patients and cancer management professionals.
      In the patient questionaire, we collect information on the prevalence, location, intensity,
      impact on life of lung cancer related pain. Questions on how doctors evaluate and manage the
      pain are included in both the patients' and physicians' surveys. In the doctors'
      questionaire, we also assess current situation of cancer pain educational programs attended
      in medical schools and post graduation through related questions.
