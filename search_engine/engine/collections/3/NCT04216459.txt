      on inflammatory response (represented by change in MCP-1 level), Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment (SOFA) Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) in
      trauma patients at high risk of sepsis. Secondary goal is to assess if the predictive ability
      of MCP-1 plus LAR to determine high risk of sepsis in major trauma intensive care patients
      and if there is correlation between LAR and MCP-1.
