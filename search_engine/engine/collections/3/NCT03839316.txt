      adults. In addition to established means of facilitating motor recovery after stroke such as
      physical and occupational therapy, a variety of experimental rehabilitation approaches have
      been tested. Recent developments include noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS). The use of these tools is based on neurophysiologic studies demonstrating
      an imbalance of interhemispheric interactions which appears to interfere with the recovery
      process.

      The model of interhemispheric imbalance provides a framework for developing hypotheses based
      on its 2 facets: 1) upregulating excitability of intact portions of the ipsilesional motor
      cortex and 2) downregulating excitability of the contralesional motor cortex to modulate its
      unrestrained inhibitory influence on ipsilesional regions. Studies to date have shown have
      shown the beneficial effects of tDCS on motor skills and motor learning.

      Bihemispheric tDCS may potentiate the effects of anodal stimulation to the lesional
      hemisphere through additional modulation of interhemispheric interactions via cathodal
      stimulation to the contralesional motor cortex.

      The primary aim of this prospective, randomized, sham controlled study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applications on
      the upper extremity motor functions of patients with stroke.
