    
      Following data would be determined after 5 min-exposure volume controlled ventilation
      employing tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and 6 ml/kg with low PEEP (with 2 mmHg) and moderate PEEP
      (7 mmHg) during remifentanil-based anesthesia (1.0 mcg/kg/min) for cardiac surgery (n=12)

        1. sum of forward hepatic venous flow

        2. sum of backward hepatic venous flow

        3. peak velocity of diastolic hepatic venous flow

        4. lung compliance

        5. peak airway pressure

        6. mean airway pressure

        7. other pressure derived hemodynamic parameters:heart rate; systolic, diastolic, and mean
           blood pressures; systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary artery pressures; central
           venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary
