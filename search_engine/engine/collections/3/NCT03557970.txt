    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Evaluate preliminary efficacy of JNJ-40346527 in participants with relapsed/refractory AML.

      I. Best objective response rate (> PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Assess safety and survival associated with JNJ-40346527 to treat participants with
      relapsed/refractory AML. Assess the duration of disease response associated with
      JNJ-40346527.

      I. Overall incidence of treatment-related and non-treatment related toxicity. II. Duration of
      response. III. 12-month event-free survival. IV. 12-month overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-40346527 and effective inhibition of CSF-1R in marrow
      aspirates using plasma inhibitory assays, with established CSF-1R-sensitive cell lines.

      II. Identify the effect of JNJ-40346527 on leukemia cells and the immune microenvironment.

      III. Identify and quantify the specific subpopulation of cells that express CSF-1R in
      participants and correlate these with clinical response to JNJ-40346527.

      IV. Analyze the frequency of mutations using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from
      leukemia participants to determine if there is a genetic signature that predicts response to
      JNJ-40346527.

      V. Using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), identify an expression signature in
      CSF-1R+ cells that predicts patient response.

      VI. Evaluate the effect of JNJ-40346527 on immune cell populations (cytotoxic T cells, etc.)
      and phospho-signaling proteins by mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis in pre- and post-treatment
      samples in order to identify biomarkers that predict patient response and prioritize
      potential combination strategies for future clinical trials.

      VII. Determine how leukemia cells change in response to CSF-1R inhibition by assessing cells
      collected pre- and post-treatment using an ex vivo sensitivity to a panel of small molecule
      inhibitors to determine what new drug sensitivities may emerge in AML cells after CSF-1R
      inhibition.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive JNJ-40346527 orally (PO) twice a day (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up within 2 weeks, at 4-6
      weeks until death or minimum of 12 months.
