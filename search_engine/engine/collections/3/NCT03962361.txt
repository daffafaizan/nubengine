      prospective, non-randomized. Patients recovered from sudden cardiac death of ischemic cause
      and remain comatose will be included in the protocol if they fit the pre-specified inclusion
      criteria. Biological samples will be collected (at admission, at 24 and 72 hours) and stored
      in the Biobank of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau for further analysis. In addition
      demographic, clinical and analytical variables will be collected. At the end of the
      recruitment period, we will analyse the concentrations of circulating microparticles
      according to ICCC-IIBSantPau methodology in the samples obtained. The primary outcome
      variable will be the neurological status at Coronary Care Unit discharge and at 6 months. The
      objective of the study will evaluate the relationship between the neurological status and the
      blood concentrations of circulating microparticles.
