      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of azacitidine in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) with myeloid
           metaplasia.

        -  Evaluate the safety of azacitidine in these patients. Secondary

        -  Evaluate pertinent biologic characteristics of MF before and during therapy with
           azacitidine.

        -  Assess the effects of study treatment on constitutional symptoms in these patients.

        -  Estimate time to event distributions for overall survival and progression. OUTLINE:
           Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
           every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
