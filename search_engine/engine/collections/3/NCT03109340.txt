    
      Objective: To show the effectiveness of walking with ECE PEDO (Equipment for Clever Exercise)
      comparing supervised treadmill walking corresponding moderate aerobic exercise intensity on
      abdominal obesity and cardiorespiratory capacity.

      Methods: Twenty-eight women with overweight and obesity were assigned to two groups:
      supervised treadmill walking (Group I,n=14) or walking with ECE PEDO (Group II,n=14). Target
      heart rate(HR) corresponding to values of 50-70% VO2max were determined by the submaximal
      treadmill test. Group 1 was instructed walking at their target HR on a treadmill. The number
      of steps taken in a minute corresponding to target HR was determined by a criterion pedometer
      and group 2 was instructed walking in these step range recorded to ECE PEDO giving audible
      feedback. Before and after a 12-week exercise program, participants were evaluated by BMI and
      waist circumference(WC); ultrasonographic visceral fat thickness(VFT) and ergospirometric
      VO2max.
