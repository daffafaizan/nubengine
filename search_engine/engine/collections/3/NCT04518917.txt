      visit will include participants wearing wearable sensors during the following tasks: walking
      with no cues (UNCUED), walking while listening to music (MUSIC), walking while singing out
      loud (SINGING), and walking while mentally singing (MENTAL SINGING). The wearable sensors
      will measure gait parameters including gait speed, stride length, and stride time
      variability.
