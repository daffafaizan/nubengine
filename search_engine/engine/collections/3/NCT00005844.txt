        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin in children with advanced solid
           tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and toxicity of this regimen
           and response in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-tumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 (every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses) OR
      on days 1, 14, and 28 (every 6 weeks for up to 3 courses). Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Once the MTD for dose levels 1-4 is determined, an additional cohort of 3-6 patients is
      accrued and treated with oxaliplatin as above every 2 weeks (for up to 9 doses).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3.3
      years.
