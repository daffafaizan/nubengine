    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, multi-center study of therapy
      optimization related to the Inspire UAS System (implanted in a commercial setting under
      current labeling).

      Comparison of outcomes between two (2) groups of patients (both implanted with the Inspire
      UAS system) who undergo different post-implant care algorithms throughout follow-up, in order
      to determine whether home sleep monitoring may be used as a surrogate for an in-lab PSG
      titration in a sub-set of patients.

      Subjects who have been identified as candidates for Inspire therapy (implant of the Inspire
      UAS system), according to commercial labeling, will be recruited to participate in the study.

      A maximum of 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 clinical centers. A total of 60
      subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of two study arms.
