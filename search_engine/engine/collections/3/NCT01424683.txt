      and quality of life (Qol) the treatment provides. This enables them to calculate effect in
      the generic Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). Patients' Qol can be estimates by having
      patients' answer the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. However, when performing a post hoc health
      economic evaluation, data is often incomplete. Often there is no information available
      regarding the patients' Qol and some health economic researchers therefore resort to various
      conversions of other measurements of effect to Qol. Such conversions thereby enable them to
      calculate effect in QALYs even though they had incomplete information. However, no method has
      been developed for converting eg. VAS pain scores to Qol and the methods currently used are
      arbitrary. With this study the investigators wish to develop such a method and in the process
      evaluate our own arbitrary Qol conversion from a prior study by asking the same type of
      patients. The study is an observational study with no intervention.
