      permanent disability rates. Decompressive craniectomy, which is beneficial in patients with
      malignant middle cerebral artery infarction, may indirectly relieve the mass effect, decrease
      perihematomal tissue pressure, improve blood flow, reduce secondary brain damage and improve
      outcome without further damage to the brain due to surgery. Early therapy with either
      surgical clipping or neuroradiologic intervention with endovascular coiling is the primary
      treatment for aSAH. But whether decompressive craniectomy should be employed during the
      clipping surgery or immediately after coil embolization still have considerable controversy.
      80 patients will be recruited to the trial over 12 months. Follow-up will take 6 months with
      analysis and reporting taking 6 months.
