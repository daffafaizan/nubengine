role of the liver in the glycoprotein mobilizing property ofparathyroid extractstudies were carried out to de-termine the action of hepatectomy on theglycoprotein action of pte as well as onpte-induced renal calcification and deposi-tion of glycoprotein.  our data showed thatin hepatectomized rats, pte no longer causedan elevation in serum glycoproteins.  how-ever, hepatectomy did not alter the forma-tion of glycoprotein tubular casts producedby pte administration.  the data suggestthat the liver is the major source of the ele-vated serum glycoproteins found in rats re-ceiving pte.  in addition, it is possible thatpte may have a direct stimulating actionon biosynthesis of glycoprotein by the kidney.
