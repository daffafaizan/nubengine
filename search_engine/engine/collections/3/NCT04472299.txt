      catheters placed prior to surgery. Prior to surgery, these patients will have 5ml of 1.5%
      lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine injected in each catheter. Ropivacaine 0.2% will be
      administered via programmed intermittent bolus of 7ml every 60 minutes through each catheter
      during and after surgery. Patients in the control group will receive no block and undergo
      surgery with routine anesthetic care guided by their cardiac anesthesiologist.
