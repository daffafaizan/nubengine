      pharmacological breakthroughs, comprehensive models of health care, and targeted HIV testing
      initiatives, over 160,000 persons are still unaware of their HIV serostatus. Emerging adult,
      sexual minority, men of color are disproportionately affected. Premised on the National AIDS
      Strategy's focus on identifying new HIV infections through increased HIV testing, the purpose
      of this formative pilot study is to develop and test an integrated HIV self-testing strategy
      that utilizes a simplicity-model approach to HIV self-testing in emerging adult sexual
      minority men of color.

      The overall study will focus on: (a) understanding facilitators and barriers to HIV
      self-testing among emerging adult MSM, (b) designing a HIV self-testing infographic that
      utilizes a simplicity model, (c) finalizing the HIV self-testing infographic with input from
      a leadership group of HIV community members, (d) conducting a pilot clinical trial with 300
      emerging adult (ages 18-34), sexual minority, men of color to test if a
      collaboratively-designed HIV self-testing infographic can facilitate accurate and effective
      understanding of how to self-test for HIV when compared to paper-based, HIV self-testing
      information.

      By conducting this study, we will gain beneficial insights necessary for presenting HIV
      self-testing instructions in a meaningful, relevant, and comprehensible way. The results of
      this pilot study have the potential to inform strategies regarding how self-testing
      instructions can be worded or visually presented in order to break both literacy and language
      barriers that affect testing utilization and results accuracy.
