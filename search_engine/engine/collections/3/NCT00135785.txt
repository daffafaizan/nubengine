      norepinephrine to be released into the brain. This overload produces unusual alertness and
      feelings of elation. When the body undergoes methamphetamine withdrawal, it experiences a
      reduction in dopamine and norepinephrine. Bupropion is an antidepressant used for the
      treatment of depression and smoking cessation. Because it functions by increasing the release
      of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, bupropion is likely to decrease the negative
      effects of methamphetamine withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy
      of bupropion combined with contingency management (CM) and cognitive behavioral counseling
      (CBT) as a means of treating methamphetamine dependence.

      An initial 2-week screening process will involve participants providing urine samples and
      completing physical and psychological assessments. If deemed eligible for the remainder of
      this double-blind study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either bupropion
      or placebo over the course of 12 weeks. Participants in both the bupropion and placebo groups
      will receive contingency management and cognitive behavioral counseling. Participants will
      report to one of two clinical research sites three times per week. At each visit,
      participants will be examined by the study staff, provide a urine sample, and receive
      individual cognitive behavioral counseling sessions. At the end of 12 weeks, treatment will
      be stopped. Participants will return to the study site 30 days later for evaluation and to be
      assessed for any possible lingering side effects.
