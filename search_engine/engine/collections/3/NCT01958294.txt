      adverse neurological effects. Most major clinical studies of CAS have used distal filters for
      cerebral protection and have compared the neurologic complication rates with those of carotid
      endarterectomy (CEA). Many currently available embolic protection devices, however, have
      limited efficacy in capturing microembolic debris liberated during stenting, pre-dilatation
      and post-dilatation. Furthermore, distal protection systems are limited by the need to cross
      the lesion prior to deployment. Some studies have shown a relatively high incidence of
      cerebral infarction even when distal protection devices are employed.

      Cerebral protection with carotid flow reversal is a method that was developed by Parodi, et
      al. (2005), as an alternative to the use of distal protection devices. While novel in its
      approach, this method too has its limitations. Criado, et al. (2004), developed a derivative
      technique that employs carotid flow reversal prior to traversing the stenosis that can be
      accomplished by directly accessing carotid anatomy without the use of the transfemoral
      approach. Major benefits to this method include the ability to perform the procedure on
      patients with severe carotid tortuosity and difficult aortic arch anatomy.
