      contribute to an impaired insulin-mediated glucose transport and metabolism that eventually
      results in insulin resistance and the clinical features of metabolic syndrome. According to
      this, both compounds -L-carnitine and dietary fiber- interacting by different mechanism of
      action could improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the health
      beneficial effects of the combination of both compounds are not shown and confirmation of the
      functionality of such products must be accomplished by conducting the appropriate studies
      intervention nutrition.
