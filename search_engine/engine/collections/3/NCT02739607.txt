      group using a randomized control trial (RCT) design in a culture where this has not been
      tested before. The treatment approach is mainly emotion-focus, teaching participants how to
      confront and experience uncomfortable emotions, and how more adaptive coping mechanisms could
      be used. Because internet-delivered interventions represent an effective way to disseminate
      evidence-based programs, investigators decided to present our intervention online.
