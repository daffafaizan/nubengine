    
      This study was conducted in 43 schools in the New York City (NYC) School district in the
      spring of 2012. The new regulations for school lunches were scheduled to roll out nationally
      in the fall of the same year, so this study was designed to provide an indication of the
      impact the new regulations would have.

      In addition to the regulations, the investigators also tested additional behavioral
      interventions, in conjunction with the regulations, to determine how the behavioral
      interventions might offset, or magnify, the impacts of the regulations.
