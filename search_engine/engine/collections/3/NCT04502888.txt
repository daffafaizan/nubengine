    
      This Phase 1 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor
      activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 when administered as an intratumoral
      injection (ITI) and identify the dose and schedule i.e., recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for
      future development. Eligible subjects must have unresectable or recurrent, locally advanced
      or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or head and neck, that is not amenable to
      curative surgery or radiotherapy. The study design consists of four sequential
      dose-escalation cohorts and an optional pharmacodynamic cohort to obtain additional
      pharmacodynamic data at one or more dose levels that have completed evaluation for safety
      without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
