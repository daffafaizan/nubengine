    
      IAB2M is an approximately 80 kDA molecular weight antibody fragment (a "Minibody") chelated
      with Desferroxamine and radiolabeled with 89Zr. [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M targets the extracellular
      domain of Prostate Membrane Specific Antigen (PSMA) expressed on most primary and metastatic
      prostate cancer lesions.

      [111In]-capromab pendetide (Prostascint®) is an FDA approved imaging agent targeting the
      intracellular domain of PSMA. It is anticipated that [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M will outperform
      Prostascint® because of this targeting difference.
