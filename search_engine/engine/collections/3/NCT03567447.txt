      Parkinson's disease (PD) both in terms of human suffering and economic losses. Overall annual
      fall incidence rates range from 50-70% for PD patients, and recurrent falls are a major cause
      of disability in PD. Approximately 20% of patients with Parkinson's disease develop NOH which
      can lead to falls. Although the mechanisms underlying impaired postural stability and falls
      are not well-known in patients with PD, attention is focused on the noradrenergic system.
      L-DOPS, a drug that enhances norepinephrine levels in peripheral and central nervous system,
      has been shown to moderate NOH, and often improve symptoms concomitant of PD and falls.

      This study will help to determine the effect of L-DOPS in reducing falls and fall severity by
      using an instrumented walkway to induce slip perturbations can assess the propensity for
      falls and fall-related outcomes. It will assess fall events from the point of initiation
      through recovery. The effect of L-DOPS on gait and balance parameters will also be measured
      using force plate and inertial measurement unit (IMU) testing, and improvement in clinical
      scores such as the MDS-UPDRS will be monitored.
