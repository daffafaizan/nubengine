      sporadic heritable retinoblastoma (RBL). The study has a matched case-control design with a
      sample size of 255 pairs. Cases will be children with sporadic heritable (RBL) identified
      from eight hospitals that together treat most of the RBL patients in the U.S. and Canada. We
      will use regional controls matched on year of birth and state/province of residence
      identified by randomdigit-dialing (RDD). Fathers and mothers of cases and controls will be
      interviewed by telephone about their occupational, medical, dietary, and personal exposures
      before the index child's conception. Blood samples will be obtained on cases and their
      parents for DNA isolation. The case's DNA will be used to characterize the disease-causing
      RB1 mutation. The parent's DNA will be used to detect the few instances in which a parent
      also has the RB1 mutation, i.e., the child's RBL is familial rather than sporadic.
