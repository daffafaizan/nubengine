      options are limited, and surgery is often associated with incontinence and recurrence.

      The biological properties of stem cells derived from adult tissues make them candidates for
      the treatment of pathologies requiring tissue regeneration or in diseases where the healing
      process is altered.

      A proof-of-concept study, a phase 1 study and a phase 2 study [Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
      NCT00115466] have all suggested that this approach is promising, even in patients whose
      fistula is associated with Crohn's disease.

      The present multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study aims to confirm the efficacy and
      safety shown in the previous phase 1 and phase 2 studies in the treatment of complex perianal
      fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease after 24 weeks from initial administration. Fistula
      closure is defined as absence of suppuration through the external orifice with complete
      re-epithelization of the external orifice and absence of collections >2cm directly related to
      the fistula tract treated, as measured by MRI.
