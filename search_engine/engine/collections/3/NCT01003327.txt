      supine position, age>18 years, ASA I-II; Exclusion criteria are: difficult airway, pregnancy,
      history of reflux or gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal or thoracic surgery; In this
      cross-over trial both airway devices are inserted in the same patient, the order of insertion
      is randomized. Patient receive monitoring with blood pressure, ECG and pulse oxymetry during
      operation. Anaesthesia is induced intravenously using fentanyl (0.001 mg/kg) and propofol
      (3-5 mg/kg). The I-gel laryngeal mask is inserted with a gastric tube. The classic laryngeal
      mask was cuffed after insertion with a cuff pressure of 60 cmH2O. The first device is removed
      5 minutes after insertion and replaced by the second device. Ease of insertion is graded as
      very easy=1, easy=2, difficult=3 and very difficult=4. Leak pressure is measured by two
      tests: In the first test the spill valve is closed at a fresh gas flow of 6l/min and the
      minimum airway pressure at which gas leaked around the airway device is recorded by listening
      for an audible leak. In the second test leakage is measured during pressure controlled
      ventilation. Therefore we administer a fresh gas flow of 3l/min, FiO2 of 50%, inspiration to
      expiration ratio of 1:2 and a frequency of breathing of 12. Leakage can be measured by the
      respirator. We record inspiration pressure, mean pressure, plateau pressure, tidal volume and
      peep at which the first measurable leakage occurred.

      For statistical analysis we will use t-tests with a power of 80% and a p < 0.05.
