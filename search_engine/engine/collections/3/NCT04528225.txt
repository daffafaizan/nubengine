      Thyroid function is evaluated mainly by the measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),
      free triiodo-thyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4). Thyroid function is regularly assessed
      before and after radiotherapy. The radiation technique and thyroid dose parameters are
      assessed. Development of subclinical or biochemical hypothyroidism is noted. The incidence
      and risk factors of hypothyroidism is analyzed. The dose-volume constraints that correlate
      with functional impairment of the thyroid in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy
      is discussed.
