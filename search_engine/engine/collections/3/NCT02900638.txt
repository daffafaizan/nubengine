      participants are drawn from a population of undergraduate students. Participants are also
      randomly assigned to either being a mentee or a wait list control. These participants are
      drawn from a population of Chicago Public School children. In total, there will be 30
      mentors, 30 control mentors, 30 mentees, and 30 control mentees. Participants will come for a
      laboratory visit in which cardiovascular health measures will be taken (details below).
      Visits will occur once at baseline (before the intervention starts), and once
      post-intervention. The protocol will be the same at the two study visits. Participants in the
      intervention group will engage in one-on-one mentoring sessions (between mentors and mentees)
      once a week after school for the school year
