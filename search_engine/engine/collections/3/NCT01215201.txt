    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the adjunctive use of diode laser with
      scaling and root planing is more effective than scaling and root planing alone in clinically
      reducing periodontal pocket depth (PD), reducing bleeding on probing (BOP) and gaining of
      clinical attachment level (CAL). It also assesses whether diode laser with scaling and root
      planing will have an effect on cytokines and inflammatory biomarkers compared to root planing
      alone.

      Any adult who is currently a routine periodontal maintenance patient and has one or more ≥
      5mm pockets with BOP will be invited to participate in the study. If they choose to
      participate, they will sign an informed consent. Crevicular fluid samples from each test site
      and another non-involved site in the mouth will be collected utilizing the standard protocol
      and frozen for later analyses of the presence of certain inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β).
      Baseline data (i.e., PD, CAL, BOP, suppuration, supragingival plaque, subgingival restorative
      margins, smoking status) will be collected. The involved teeth will then be randomly treated
      with scaling and root-planing with hand instruments and diode laser (test) or scaling and
      root-planing with hand instruments alone. The patient will return 3 months later for
      follow-up data collection. He/she will then receive his/her regular 3 month maintenance
      therapy.

      The changes between baseline and 3 months for the clinical parameters and gingival crevicular
      fluids' inflammatory biomarkers will be compared between test and control experimental sites.
