      to compare markers of nutritional, inflammatory and oxidative status, cardiovascular and
      neurological health as well as microbial status in subjects consuming a novel
      multivitamin/multimineral/phytochemical (MVM/phytochemical) supplement compared to subjects
      consuming a placebo tablet. In addition, this study will evaluate whether the
      MVM/phytochemical supplement improves subjects sense of well-being as evaluated by a
      quality-of-life survey. The study will aim to enroll 112 consenting men and women
      characterized as having metabolic syndrome. Potential subjects will be recruited through
      flyers, newspapers and advertisements placed throughout the community. Consented subjects
      will undergo a 28-day washout, followed by a 56-day trial period. Biological samples (blood,
      urine, stool, saliva) will be collected at baseline (day 0) and at day 56. Diet and exercise
      history, as well as a quality of life survey, will be collected at these time points as well.
      Risk to participants is expected to be minimal and will be outlined through an informed
      consent.
