      4-compartment modeling to assess body composition in SCI adults. In comparing body
      composition analyses techniques in 20 individuals with SCI, we found Total Error to be 8.0%
      with Dual X-ray Absorptiometry, 8.4% with hydrodensitometry, 11.5% with bioelectrical
      impedance analysis, and 21.8% with standard skinfold equations when compared to 4-compartment
      modeling, the currently accepted gold standard for body composition assessment. To date there
      is no gold standard for the determination of body composition in SCI individuals.
