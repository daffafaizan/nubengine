      intrabony defect and requiring extraction of one vital tooth were consecutively enrolled.
      Defects were randomly assigned to test or control treatments which both consisted of the use
      of minimally invasive surgical technique. The dental pulp of the extracted tooth was
      mechanically dissociated to obtain micro-grafts rich in autologous DPSCs. Test sites (n=15)
      were filled with micro-grafts seeded onto collagen sponge, whereas control sites (n=14) with
      collagen sponge alone. Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline, 6 and
      12 months postoperatively.
