      rumination. The intervention is based on a just-in-time, adaptive-intervention (JITAI)
      design. A JITAI is "an intervention designed to address the dynamically changing needs of
      individuals via the provision of the type/amount of support needed, at the right time, and
      only when needed ." This study is also to address one major concern regarding designing JITAI
      interventions: the burden on participants in having to be engaged with the intervention
      through diaries, self-reports, and other forms of assessment procedures daily. To reduce this
      burden, we first pilot test an interactive narrative form. An interactive narrative is an
      essential form of storytelling that involves certain interactive features such that audiences
      or readers of the story can have the feeling that they are actively engaging in certain forms
      of interactions with the story characters.

      To test the efficacy of such an intervention, there will be a one-month three-arm clinical
      control trial to reduce depressive rumination. There are three conditions: a JITAI
      interactive narrative condition, a non-narrative JTIAI condition, and a wait-list control
      condition. This study could contribute to our knowledge in designing more effective
      interventions in curbing depression using mobile technology. It can also advance our
      theoretical knowledge of the role of interactive narratives in reducing user burden in mobile
      health.
