    
      This is a randomized device efficacy trial. Patients with a supratentorial intracerebral
      hemorrhage (ICH) admitted to the Cleveland Clinic Neurointensive Care Unit within 1 day of
      symptom onset and who have not experienced episodes of temperature elevation will be enrolled
      after consent. Patients randomized to the experimental arm, will have Artic Sun cooling pads
      applied to the torso and thighs for five days. The Arctic Sun device will keep the body
      temperature at the normal range of 35.5 - 37.5 degrees Celsius. Patients randomized to the
      active comparator arm will receive a standard of care treatment at the discretion of the
      treating physician. Patients will have hourly measurement of blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, urine output, temperature (from the urinary catheter) shivering scale, and
      nursing neurological assessment. Glasgow coma scale, NIH Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS),
      telemetry monitoring and labs will also be performed daily. The investigators will also
      collect demographic information about the patients (i.e. age, gender, medical risk factors)
      and information regarding their current disease process.
