      treatment algorithm for patients with multifocal or large intrahepatic lesions of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not eligible for surgical resection, transplantation, or local
      ablative therapy. The use of balloon assisted TACE has been proposed recently and it could be
      one of the possible ways to improve the effectiveness of drug delivery to the target tumor
      and therefore leading to improved treatment outcome.
