      device such as the device Everion® in pediatric patients. It is not known if children
      tolerate the device and if data quality sustains with smaller arm circumferences or when worn
      on the upper leg. Neither is it known if parents and/or patients can and are willing to
      handle the device in ambulant setting. Therefore, this pilot study assesses the feasibility
      of continous monitoring of health data with a small, on-skin wearable device (the Everion®,
      by Biovotion, Zurich) in pediatric patients under chemotherapy for cancer.
