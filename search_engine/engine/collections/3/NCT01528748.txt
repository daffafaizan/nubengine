      Psychotherapy (CBASP) in reducing both alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms in adults
      who are chronically depressed and alcohol dependent. Participants will receive a 20-session
      course of CBASP psychotherapy over a period of 21 weeks and will be assessed for severity of
      pretreatment psychological abuse and trauma as well as pre and posttreatment interpersonal
      functioning. Two primary hypotheses are to be tested: 1) demonstrate that CBASP is effective
      in reducing depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-24 ratings) and alcohol
      consumption (drinks per drinking day) in this chronically depressed alcohol dependent cohort
      when posttreatment ratings are compared to pretreatment levels; and 2) demonstrate that
      acquisition of feeling safe with the therapist and acquisition of the ability to perceive the
      interpersonal consequences of one's behavior will significantly increase from pre to
      posttreatment levels and will be associated with reductions in drinking and depressive
      symptoms.
