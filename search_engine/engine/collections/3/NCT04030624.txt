      related to the cancer and its treatment. Unfortunately, patients commonly require hospital
      admission or urgent clinic visits to help manage uncontrolled symptoms. For this study, the
      investigators seek to determine if a program that entails remote electronic monitoring may
      improve the overall care experience of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who have urgent
      care needs.

      The investigators are asking the participants to take part in this research study because the
      participants are currently hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital or recently
      presented to the oncology clinic for an urgent visit, and are receiving treatment at the
      Cancer Center. The goal of this study is to test a program that involves remote electronic
      monitoring of vital signs and patient-reported health outcomes. This study is a pilot study,
      and the investigators are evaluating the feasibility of delivering the program, the
      acceptability and satisfaction with the program, changes in the quality of life and symptoms
      of patients who receive the program, as well as the frequency of urgent hospital visits while
      the patient is in the program.
