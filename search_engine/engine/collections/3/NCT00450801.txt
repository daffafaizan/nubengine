      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with previously untreated mantle
           cell lymphoma treated rituximab in combination with methotrexate, doxorubicin,
           cyclophosphamide, leucovorin, vincristine, ifosfamide, etoposide, cytarabine and mesna
           (MACLO/IVAM) followed by thalidomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: During cycle 1, patients will receive rituximab intravenous (IV), granisetron IV,
      decadron IV, doxorubicin IV bolus, vincristine intravenous pyelogram (IVP) on day 1;
      cyclophosphamide IV on day 1-5; vincristine IVP on day 8; methotrexate IV, methotrexate by
      continuous infusion, then leucovorin IV until methotrexate level is below 0.01 nanomolar (nM)
      on day 10. Patients will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning
      on day 13 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      When absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches1,500/mm^3, patients will start cycle 2. Patients
      will receive rituximab IV on day 1; cytarabine IV on day 1 and 2; ifosfamide IV, mesna IV,
      etoposide IV on day 1-5; and G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until ANC is
      greater than 1,000 cells/mm^3.

      Approximately 2-3 weeks later, patients receive another course of therapy as above.After
      cycle 4, patients in complete remission will take oral thalidomide until progression of
      disease. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months,
      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3-5 years, and then annually thereafter or at
      study termination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study.
