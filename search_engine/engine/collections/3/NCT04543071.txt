      has been made towards effective treatment. This is a Phase 2 open-label, multi-center study
      for patients with treatment-na√Øve metastatic PDAC. The goal of the study is to assess the
      preliminary efficacy of a CXCR4 antagonist (motixafortide), (cemiplimab), gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel compared based on the response rate to historical controls in first line
      metastatic PDAC. Subjects will be treated with 5 days of motixafortide daily alone in the
      priming phase, followed by motixafortide twice a week, cemiplimab once every three weeks and
      and standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel).
