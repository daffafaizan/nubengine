      programming methods to:

        -  Increase the rate of patients responding to CRT

        -  Provide appropriate hemodynamic cardiac effect, as expected from the Ritter method.

      The identification of CRT responders, as defined by echocardiography, generally refers to a
      significant reduction of the LV End-Systolic Diameter (LVESD) and/or LVESV during Follow-Up
      (FUp).

      Patients will be considered as responders to CRT if their LVESV decreased by > 15% after 6
      months of CRT therapy as compared to baseline. The percentage of CRT responders will be
      compared between the two study arms.

      SoC is defined as the standard CRT system programming/optimization method currently used by
      physicians in study centers and any method may be used in the study if considered as routine
      practice in the study center.
