      low-dose dexamethasone. This combination therapy is being tested to treat people who are
      newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma and non-eligible to autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT). This study will assess the ORR during induction therapy in specific
      timepoints.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. All participants will receive:

      Ixazomib citrate 4 mg + Thalidomide 100 mg and Dexamethasone 40 mg.

      All participants will be asked to take their study medication at approximately the same time
      each day.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Brazil. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      will be contacted by telephone or will make a final visit 30 days after receiving their last
      dose of drug or resolution of serious adverse event (SAE), whichever occurs later for a
      follow-up assessment.
