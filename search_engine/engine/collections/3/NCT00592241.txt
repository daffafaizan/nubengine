      effectiveness of the NiliMedix Adi Insulin Pump, in order to validate safe and effective use
      by intended users. The study objectives are as following:

        -  Validate the safe and effective use while using the ADI Insulin Pump by intended users.
           This objective will be assessed by carrying out list of tasks (operating the device,
           programming the appropriate flow rate and volume-to-be-infused parameters, and reacting
           to hazard massages) independently and successfully.

        -  Evaluate user's satisfaction. Study Design Orientation, consent, and pre-test
           questionnaire Participants will receive a short, scripted verbal orientation explaining
           the purpose of the usability test.

      Prior to any study related procedures participant will provide written informed consent.

      Performance evaluation The performance evaluation will consist of a list of tasks that
      participants will attempt to complete. The tasks were designed to explore the usability
      concerns. Participants will be provided with the Adi Insulin Pump and the user manual.

      All participants will be guided by the investigator how to use the ADI Insulin Pump
      independently, how to read and interpret the display readings, how to program the device
      including insulin Basal and Bolus settings as well as how to maintain the device. In
      addition, participants will be given sufficient time to read carefully the user manual.

      After ensuring that the participant has perceived the directions for use he will be asked to
      operate the Adi Insulin Pump by performing list of tasks.

      All tasks will be conducted by the participants independently. The investigator will not
      guide the subject during this phase- unless the subject asked him to.
