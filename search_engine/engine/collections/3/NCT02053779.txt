      (OHSS) was eliminated when GnRH agonist was used to trigger ovulation and the delivery rate
      has improved after modified luteal support especially when a small bolus of hCG is used on
      the day of oocyte retrieval. (OMEGA/HCG 1500 IU).

      However, a risk difference of 7% in delivery rates is still in favor of HCG trigger. Thus,
      further modifications in the luteal phase supplementation are required in order to optimise
      the reproductive outcome after GnRH-agonist triggering.

      Recently, many papers showed, that independently of the GnRH analogue used to prevent the
      premature LH surge, the addition of GnRH-agonist during the luteal phase seems to be
      beneficial in terms of pregnancy. Nevertheless, their use in practice is not yet admitted
      because of controversial results in terms of efficacy and safety particularly on the
      conceptus.
