      reducing scar formation in patients undergoing Mohs surgery for skin lesions in the forehead
      area following a single treatment of EB-001 when injected into the muscles underlying the
      incision area.

      The safety objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of single treatment of
      EB-001 when injected into facial muscles underlying a surgical wound during Mohs surgery.

      The efficacy objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a single treatment of EB-001 when
      injected into the facial muscles (frontalis) underlying the surgical wound in improving wound
      healing, and reducing scar formation.
