    
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, post-authorization, multi-centre cohort study in
      patients treated with levocetirizine.

      The baseline data will be collected at the visit to the physician when levocetirizine is
      prescribed for the first time for the patient for Persistent Allergic Rhinitis. The data will
      then be collected during 2 visits occurring within the first 6 months of treatment, as
      usually scheduled in normal clinical practice in the Czech and Slovak Republics. This is
      after approximately 4 weeks and 6 months of treatment or earlier, if the treatment is stopped
