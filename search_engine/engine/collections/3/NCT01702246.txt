      inflammatory state leading to progressive multi-organ injury. The pathophysiology of SCD is
      related to endothelial dysfunction driven largely by impaired nitric oxide (NO) homeostasis
      and chronic inflammation. Through multiple mechanisms, including upregulation of NO, statins
      have been shown to confer protection from endothelial injury, independent of their
      cholesterol-lowering properties.

      By inhibiting inflammation and several common pathways leading to vascular damage,simvastatin
      may help prevent the acute and chronic complications of SCD. The objective of this study is
      to determine whether our preliminary results showing simvastatin-associated reductions in
      plasma markers of vascular injury will translate into a reduction in vaso-occlusive pain
      episodes in patients with SCD. A web-based, smartphone-accessible electronic pain diary will
      be used to monitor frequency and intensity of vaso-occlusive pain in SCD patients treated
      with a single daily dose of simvastatin.
