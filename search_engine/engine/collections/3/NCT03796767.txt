      I. To assess response to treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess additional measurements of response to treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      II. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression free-survival following treatment
      of oligometastatic disease.

      III. To assess time to disease recurrence following treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      IV. To assess time to initiation of antiandrogen therapy (ADT) for metastatic prostate cancer
      following treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      V. To assess the rate of undetectable PSA following treatment of oligometastatic disease in
      subjects who have previously undergone prostatectomy.

      VI. To assess safety. VII. To assess the impact of study treatment on change in quality of
      life over three years.
