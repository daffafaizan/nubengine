      straight forward, two-stage design with tumor biopsies scheduled at screening and again at 4
      weeks. FLT-PET scans are performed at screening and again at day 28, following initiation of
      treatment in the first 10 patients. Patients are assessed for adverse events every two weeks
      for the first month and monthly thereafter. Patients are assessed for response by PSA every 4
      weeks and when applicable, for objective response every 2 months. If 4 or more responses are
      seen in the first 39 patients then the study will expand to 60 patients.
