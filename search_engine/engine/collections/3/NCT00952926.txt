      and a permanent stoma.

      Over the past 2 years Vejle Hospital examined patients with rectal cancer during their course
      of treatment and we have developed a method to predict complete response.

      Patients in this study are treated with chemotherapy and external irradiation supplemented
      with an endorectal boost (2 fractions). At the start of treatment and weeks 2, 4, and 6 of
      the treatment course an endoscopy is performed to evaluate the response. The final evaluation
      is performed 6 weeks after end of treatment. Patients with complete remission are offered
      observation. Patients with residual tumor are advised to be operated.

      Follow-up is performed every 2 months the first year and every 3 months the second year. 2
      follow-up visits are planned for the third year. A yearly follow-up is scheduled for the
      fourth and fifth year.
