      to either a short "information centered psychoeducation" (ICP) of 8 sessions or a "cognitive
      behavioral treatment" (CBT). CBT includes 8 sessions of psychoeducation, 8 sessions of
      computer based cognitive training, 8 sessions with relatives and 20 sessions of focusing on
      stress management, relapse prevention and coping with persistent symptoms.

      The primary endpoint is relapse at the one and two year follow up.
