      military personnel served in the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War (GW1). Migraine like HA and
      diffuse body pain were detected in 64% of Gulf War Veteran (GWV) diagnosed with Gulf War
      Illness (GWI). Likewise, depression carries a very high co-morbid rate (50%) in patients with
      chronic pain, and in GWV with GWI related chronic HA and body muscle and joint pain
      conditions (GWI-HAP). Unfortunately, conventional pharmacological treatments for GWI-related
      pain has not been shown to be effective and drugs such as narcotics contain many long term
      untoward psychosomatic and abusive side effects. This study is assessing the effectiveness of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), non-invasive treatment option, in
      alleviating pain and other co-morbid symptoms of GWI.
