      fibrosus is required. It is known that the anterior portion of the annulus limits the
      movement in extension and axial rotation, so removal of this section of the annulus fibrosus
      will increase the range of movement in extension and axial rotation. As far as the
      investigators know, this increase in movement ranges has not been measured objectively in
      alive patients. Also the investigators would like to know if the postoperative prevertebral
      scar reduces an to what extent these abnormal movement ranges. This could help the
      investigators to decide when patients should be allowed to regain normal activities and
      specially, when the patients should be allowed to start working again. The investigators also
      aim to see if repairing intraoperatively the anterior portion of the annulus has any
      advantage in the final result achieved, and thus represents an improvement or not in the care
      of these patients
