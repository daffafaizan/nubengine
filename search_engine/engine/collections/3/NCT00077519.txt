      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of tipifarnib when
           administered with radiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 3-month clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib once or twice daily on weeks 1-8. Patients also undergo
      concurrent radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 2-8.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15
      months.
