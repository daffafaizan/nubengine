      conjunctival inflammation , treatment of which has been demonstrated to improve the Ô¨Ånal
      outcome . It has been shown that persistent conjunctival inflammation around the surgical
      site after pterygium surgery is present in 31-84% of cases with amniotic membrane
      transplantation, and in 15% of eyes with conjunctival autograft . However, the rate of
      conjunctival inflammation after pterygium surgery with a bare-sclera technique has not been
      reported in literature . Also, it has been suggested that higher recurrence rate after
      pterygium with amniotic membrane transplantation compared with conjunctival autograft may be
      due to higher rate of postoperative conjunctival inflammation . Therefore, it may be
      speculated that higher recurrence rate after pterygium surgery with a bare-sclera technique
      is partly due to higher rate of postoperative conjunctival inflammation .
