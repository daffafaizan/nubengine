      ejaculate on two separate occasions) will be enrolled in a single-arm pilot trial of daily
      oral therapy of 20 mg twice daily of 13-cis retinoic acid for 32 weeks. The impact of
      treatment on the appearance of sperm in the ejaculate will be determined by monthly semen
      analyses.
