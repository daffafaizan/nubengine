      considered as potential pharmaceutical intervention to limit acute tissue injury. TH (via its
      regulation of stress induced p38 MAPK activation) exerts antiapoptotic action and protects
      tissue from injury, with additional favorable effects on immune system and on viral load in
      infected tissue. This may be a novel and more effective treatment for critically ill viral
      infected patients.

      ThyRepair is the first study which is underway and investigates the safety and efficacy of
      high dose T3 treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary
      angioplasty. The preliminary reports show that this treatment is safe and the efficacy on
      tissue repair is promising. This therapeutic modality could also be tested in the acute
      setting of sepsis in which thyroid hormone is involved in the pathophysiology of multi-organ
      dysfunction. The safety and efficacy of T3 on heamodynamics in sepsis has been previously
      demonstrated in a small trial.

      The present study is phase II, parallel, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo
      controlled trial which aims to investigate the potential effect of T3 intravenous use in the
      recovery of critically ill patients admitted in ICU due to COVID19 infection.
