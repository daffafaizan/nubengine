      helminths. Iron deficiency appears to affect the immune response against schistosomes and
      intestinal helminths. It therefore follows that correcting the iron deficiency anaemia will
      improve the efficacy of anthelminthics such as praziquantel (against schistosomiasis) and
      albendazol (against soil transmitted helminths) and ability of the host immune system to
      resist reinfection with schistosomes and soil transmitted helminths.

      The aim of this study is to identify factors necessary for a successful weekly iron
      supplementation programme in schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths control
      programmes. In addition impact of weekly iron supplementation programme n haemoglobin levels,
      efficacy of praziquantel, and schistosomiasis re-infection will be studied.
