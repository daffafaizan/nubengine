      cancer types and are increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in
      combination. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can occur. Here the investigators
      use VigiBase (http://www.vigiaccess.org/), the World Health Organization (WHO) database of
      individual safety case reports, and in the Base Nationale de PharmacoVigilance (BNPV) which
      is the french pharmacovigilance database, to identify cases of adverse drug reaction
      including arthiritis, auto-immune induced diseases, cardiac diseases, endocrinologic
      diseases, following treatment with ICIs.
