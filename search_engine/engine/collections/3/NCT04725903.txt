      I. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity compared to historical
      photon treatments.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity compared to historical
      photon treatments.

      II. To assess the feasibility of extended-field proton irradiation of high-risk prostate.

      III. To demonstrate safety of proton therapy followed by high dose rate (HDR) boost.

      IV. To determine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo pelvic proton beam therapy daily on Monday-Friday for 5-7 weeks. Patients
      may receive a high-dose rate brachytherapy boost.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months,
      and 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 years.
