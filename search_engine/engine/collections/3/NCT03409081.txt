      ongoing in FLT3-mutated AML patients.

      Patients will be administered treatment over 28-day cycles. Patients will complete visits on
      cycle 1 days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 days 1, 15; day 1 of cycles 3 through 6; and day 1 of every
      2 cycles thereafter until discontinued from the program.

      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of medicinal
      product (gilteritinib [ASP2215]), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy,
      whichever occurs earlier, followed by a 30-day follow-up.
