    
      This is a prospective, single center, double blind, randomized, two-arm feasibility study of
      oral ketamine versus placebo for the prevention of depression in non-depressed patients with
      head and neck or pancreatic cancer undergoing curative intent cancer therapy. Approximately
      40 patients with head and neck cancer or pancreatic cancer about to undergo cancer therapy
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive study treatment with one of the following regimens:

        -  Arm A: weekly oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine

        -  Arm B: weekly oral administration of placebo

      Consenting patients will undergo screening procedures, and if eligible, a baseline interview
      and brief questionnaires regarding depression, mental and emotional health, and quality of
      life assessments.

      Study treatment will be administered for 12 weeks unless the patient experiences unacceptable
      toxicities, exhibits moderate to severe depressive symptoms, or withdraws consent. Patients
      on the placebo treatment arm will not be eligible to cross over to the ketamine arm at
      evidence of depression but will be removed from the study and treated with standard medical
      management for depression.

      Patients will be asked to complete psychosocial measurements every two weeks, before study
      medication/placebo administration, while on study treatment and monthly during a five-month
      follow-up period.
