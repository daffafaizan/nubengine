      from chronic back pain. The study is a randomized, partially blinded trial examining the
      effectiveness of a mind body intervention in reducing disability from back pain and
      alleviating back pain in participants as compared to usual care (control arm) and an active
      control arm. The investigators will secondarily investigate whether the intervention
      alleviates anxiety related to the pain and other quality of life parameters.
