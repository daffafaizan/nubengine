    
      After approval of medical ethical committee at Ain-Shams University and obtaining written
      informed consent, 148 adult ASA II-III patients aged between 40 and 60 years old admitted to
      Ain-Shams university hospitals for blepharoplasty will be enrolled in this study.

      Patients will then be randomly and evenly divided into two equal groups (74 patients each)
      using computer-generated list:

      Group N: Patients' nasal mucosa will be anaesthetized and vasoconstricted. K-Y gel will be
      applied to the tip of nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) of appropriate size. The NPA will then be
      advanced into the dominant nostril along the septum horizontally.

      Group L: K-Y gel will be applied to the tip of the laryngeal mask (LMA) of appropriate size.
      The LMA will be introduced along the hard palate towards the hypopharynx until resistance is
      felt.

      Anaesthesia will be maintained by sevoflurane 3-4% and propofol infusion 0.5-1
      mg.kg-1.hr-1.All patients will receive local infiltration anaesthesia given by the surgeon.

      At the conclusion of surgery, sevoflurane and propofol infusion will be discontinued and
      patients will inhale 100% O2 till spontaneous recovery.

      Recovery time will be recorded (defined as the time from discontinuation of anaesthetic drugs
      till response to verbal command).

      Incidence of postoperative soar throat, unsteadiness, nausea and vomiting will be recorded as
      well as patient and surgeon satisfaction.
