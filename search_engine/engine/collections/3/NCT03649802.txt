      vascular disease with aggressive lipid lowering combined with brachial BP regulation, but has
      only achieved a modest degree of success. There is a need to intervene at a much earlier
      stage. Increased arterial stiffness is a marker for subclinical vascular disease and a
      sensitive predictor of ischemic stroke in the elderly. Vitamin D deficiency is linked to an
      increased risk of vascular disease.

      There is an urgent need for well controlled randomized interventional studies in healthy
      elderly individuals demonstrating that vitamin D levels can improve vascular function in
      healthy elderly with vitamin D insufficiency. High dose vitamin D (5000 IU) replacement is
      required to improve systemic inflammation which may contribute to arterial stiffness and
      vascular aging.

      The hypothesis is that daily 5000 IU vitamin D3 will regress or at least prevent progression
      of arterial stiffness as assessed by the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Furthermore,
      investigators postulate that this improvement will be linked to improved oxidative and
      inflammatory status. Investigators will measure plasma measurements of Sulforaphane and
      plasma F2-isoprostane to assess the anti-oxidative mechanisms by which vitamin D could
      influence arterial stiffness.
