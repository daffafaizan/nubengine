      Americans. This excess risk of kidney failure is largely attributable to mutations in
      apolipoprotein L1 gene. While 10-15% of African Americans in the United States possess kidney
      disease-associated ApoL1 mutations, nearly 40% of African Americans on dialysis have these
      mutations. There are significant gaps in the understanding of the pathophysiology of
      ApoL1-nephropathy. Only some of the people with ApoL1 mutations develop kidney failure. The
      pathways that link ApoL1 mutations with end stage kidney failure are not understood. Because
      kidney biopsy is generally obtained from patients with evidence of kidney disease-whose
      kidneys have experienced significant damage and sclerosis-access to the relevant kidney cells
      is very limited. However, recent advancements in biomedical research have made it possible to
      develop kidney-like cells from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which were derived
      from blood cells of individuals. This innovative technique will allow us to generate
      iPSC-derived cells from the blood of individuals who have developed ApoL1-nephropathy for the
      purpose studying them in research lab so as to decipher the cellular mechanism of their
      kidney failure.
