further studies of agents isolated from tissue cultures inoculatedwith human leukaemic bone-marrowd. a. woodsmycoplasmas were isolated from tissue cultures inoculatedwith bone-marrow from leukaemic patients.all cultures which showed a cytopathic effect containedmycoplasmas.there was no evidence of mycoplasmas in control cultures.the mycoplasmas isolated seemed biologically and serologic-ally to be of one strain which was different from any previouslyreported as being isolated from human sources although therewas some relationship to a rodent mycoplasma, m. pulmonis.mycoplasmas cannot readily be distinguished from viruseselectron-microscopically.the relationship of mycoplasmas to leukaemia is not yetclear.
