    
      This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tezepelumab in adults with moderate to very
      severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving triple inhaled maintenance
      therapy, and having had 2 or more documented COPD exacerbations in the 12 months prior to
      Visit 1. Approximately, 282 subjects will be randomized globally. Subjects will be stratified
      by region and prior number of exacerbations (2 vs. 3 or more). Subjects will receive
      tezepelumab, or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection at the study site, over a 52
      week treatment period. The study also includes a post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks.
