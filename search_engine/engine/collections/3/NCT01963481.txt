      fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Low dose
      cyclophosphamide may also stimulate the white blood cells, including natural killer cells,
      for instance by decreasing the suppressor (regulatory) T-cells. Giving exemestane with
      cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone
      receptor-positive, and HER2-negative stage IV breast cancer.
