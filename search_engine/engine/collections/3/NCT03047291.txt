      to either the control or the test group, so that 11 patients received placebo and 11
      probiotic treatment. After the baseline clinical, radiological and microbiological
      examination, and once the study group was randomly assigned (probiotic or placebo),
      supragingival prophylaxis was performed in the mucositis group and subgingival mechanical
      therapy in the periimplantitis group. Then they get a container with 30 probiotic or placebo
      tablets and instructions on how and when to take them. At 30 and 90 days after beginning the
      treatment, a clinical, radiological and microbiological examination was performed.
