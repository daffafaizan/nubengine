    
      There will be three groups in total.

        -  The first group will take 36 participants in remission from major depression (rMDD)
           through the 8 week MBCT program.

        -  A control group of 36 rMDD participants will not receive the intervention.

        -  A group of never depressed healthy control participants will also be recruited.

      Research visits for participants not undergoing MBCT will be separated by an 8 week gap.

      All participants will be seen before and after the 8 weeks for completion of
      neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires.

      rMDD participants will be followed up over the following 12 months to identify any predictors
      of relapse.
