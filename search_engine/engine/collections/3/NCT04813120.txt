    
      Part I: Validation of Treatment Efficacy of the New Digital MT System with Different MVF
      Conditions and Training Modes

      In this new MT system, 3 different types of MT in different MVF conditions and training modes
      can be provided: unilateral MVF with unimanual training mode (UM-UT), unilateral MVF with
      bimanual training mode (UM-BT), and bilateral MVF with bimanual training mode (BM-BT). In the
      part â…  study, an estimated total of 80 patients with stroke will be recruited. In addition to
      the original rehabilitation interventions of patients, each participant will be randomly
      allocated to 1 of 4 intervention groups (i.e., UM-UT, UM-BT, BM-BT, or traditional MT using a
      mirror box) for 15-hour therapy sessions. Outcome measures will be administrated at
      pre-treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 1-month follow-up after treatment.

      Part II: Investigation of the Electrophysiological Mechanisms Underlying Different MVF
      Conditions by EEG

      Twenty stroke patients will be recruited for examining the brain electrophysiological
      mechanisms underlying different types of MVF and training conditions of this new system by
      using electroencephalography (EEG). Three experimental conditions, including UM-UT, UM-BT,
      and BM-BT conditions, will be conducted in the EEG study.
