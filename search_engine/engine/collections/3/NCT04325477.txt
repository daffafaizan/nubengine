      the Nolix device by measuring a reduction of SUI following a modified 1-hour PWG test and to
      measure the safety of the Nolix device based on adverse events that were reported by subjects
      during the study. The secondary objective was to assess usability and patient satisfaction
      using the Nolix device.
