      parallel-group trial. Potential study participants will be recruited among all overweight or
      obese breast cancer patients previously treated at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO).
      Potential study participants will be recruited after breast cancer treatments (surgery,
      chemotherapy and and/or radiation) will be completed. Study participants will be randomized
      to one of the 4 arms: DI - Dietary Intervention; PAI - Physical Activity Intervention; PADI -
      Physical Activity and Dietary Intervention; LII - Less Intensive Intervention. Enrolled
      patients will receive a 6-month intervention and will be followed until the end of the study
      period with two additional follow-up visits at 12- and 24-month. The main aim of the study is
      to evaluate the impact of the intervention programme on body weight change in overweight or
      obese breast cancer patients.
