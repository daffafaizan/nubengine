      to viral and bacterial pneumonia. Influenza vaccine is effective in the prevention of
      influenza infection and is recommended by the Canadian National Advisory Committee on
      Immunization (NACI). The annual influenza vaccine is suggested for transplant patients as the
      standard of care starting from 3 months post-transplant. Most recent guidelines now suggest
      that it is reasonable to get a flu shot starting earlier at 1 month post-transplant.
      Anti-rejection drugs are now tapered more quickly and it is possible that antibodies will be
      produced against the flu shot as early as 1 month post-transplant. The study hypothesizes
      that kidney and liver transplant recipients in the early post-transplant period (31-180 days)
      will have similar immunogenicity as those in the late post-transplant period (>180 days).
