      benign lesions such as lung bleb or bullae, lung cyst, benign tumor, infection (necrotizing
      pneumonia, lung abscess, aspergilloma) etc. One of the most common procedure is pulmonary
      lobectomy. The surgical method for dividing parenchyma when performing lobectomy was divided
      in two methods. In the past, the investigators used hand-sewn technique but this procedure
      was time-consuming, high risk of air leakage, infection and re-operation, long length of
      hospital stay and high total cost of treatment. In the present time, the investigators use
      stapling device which has been used worldwide in various field of surgery since 1995. Many
      studies proved that using stapling devices can reduce post-operative complication, length of
      hospital stay and total cost of treatment and also became the standard instrument for lung
      surgery. In Thailand, these devices have been used for at least 5 years but they were not
      included in all of Health Insurance of Thai Government. Many patients had to pay for these
      devices by themselves, approximately 323-484.5 USD. Therefore, the investigators try to prove
      the hypothesis that using stapling devices for lung surgery would reduce the cost of
      treatment, post-operative air leakage, re-operative rate, length of hospital stay and time of
      surgery. The result of this study may effect the decision for including these devices in the
      Health Insurance of Thai Government.
