      I. To assess the pharmacokinetics profile of nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension (NDLS) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of NDLS in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive lowest dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension intravenously (IV)
      over 1 hour.

      ARM II: Patients receive low dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension IV over 1 hour.

      ARM III: Patients receive high dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension IV over 1 hour.

      ARM IV: Patients receive highest dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension IV over 1 hour. In
      all arms, treatment may repeat every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
