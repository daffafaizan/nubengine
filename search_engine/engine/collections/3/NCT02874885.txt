      I. To establish the rate of circulating tumor elements (CTE), including but not limited to
      circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection in
      patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), relative to other stages.

      II. To assess changes in detected CTEs associated with neoadjuvant therapy in patients with
      LARC.

      III. To correlate CTEs with neoadjuvant treatment response as an indicator of disease risk.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and healthy participants undergo collection of blood sample at baseline. Patients
      may also undergo collection of blood sample collections during tumor surgery, 4 weeks after
      surgery or after completion of treatment if you are not surgery, 8 weeks after the last dose
      of chemotherapy, 1 year after surgery or 1 year after completion of treatment if not having
      surgery, 2 years after surgery or 2 years after completion of treatment if not having
      surgery, and within 6 years after treatment or at the end of the 6 year follow-up if the
      disease gets worse with treatment or comes back.
