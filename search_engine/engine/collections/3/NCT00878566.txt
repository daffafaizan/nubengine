      randomization as the patient. Participants will be randomized to enhanced pharmacist care
      (patient identification, assessment, education, close follow-up and prescribing/titration of
      antihypertensive medications or usual care. Participants will be patients in Alberta with
      undiagnosed or uncontrolled BP as defined by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program. The
      primary intervention will be enhanced pharmacist care. Pharmacists will assess patients with
      regards to cardiovascular risk reduction including reviewing BP control, treatment goals and
      determining lifestyle modifications for the patient to undertake to help manage their BP. The
      primary outcome will be a comparison of difference in change in systolic BP between enhanced
      care and usual care at 24 weeks follow-up. Secondary outcomes include the number of patients
      at their BP target at 24 weeks, number of new antihypertensive medication starts, number of
      antihypertensive dosage changes, number of antihypertensive medication changes and number of
      new prescriptions for ASA and cholesterol medications.
