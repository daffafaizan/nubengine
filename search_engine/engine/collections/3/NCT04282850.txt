      ejection fraction (HFrEF) have shown improvement in systolic ejection fraction, exercise
      capacity, quality of life, and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. The PVI
      procedure has been shown to be safe and comparably effective in treating Atrial Fibrillation
      (AF) in HFpEF patients, but no studies have yet demonstrated the effects of catheter ablation
      on exercise capacity or clinical outcomes.

      The investigators propose a prospective, non-blinded randomized control pilot study to assess
      the feasibility of conducting larger scale studies to determine if there are differences
      between catheter ablation with medical management on exercise capacity and quality of life in
      HFpEF patients with AF. The investigators' study will be powered for AF burden reduction, and
      the investigators hope to use the effect size on exercise capacity and heart failure events
      to help determine power for larger clinical studies that will follow to shed light on how
      invasive management of atrial fibrillation may impact the natural history of individuals with
      these two cardiovascular conditions.
