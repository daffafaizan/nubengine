    
      HOBSCOTCH (Home Based Self-management and Cognitive Training Changes lives) is a home-based
      self-management program to treat cognitive symptoms and improve quality of life, while
      minimizing the barriers of access to care. The program is based on Problem Solving Therapy
      (PST) and teaches problem solving strategies and compensatory mechanisms to help manage
      cognitive dysfunction and enhance quality of life.

      HOBSCOTCH Phase III is a study to examine an entirely virtual version of the program. While
      HOBSCOTCH was shown to be effective as an in-person and telephone-based program in previous
      trials (HOBSCOTCH Phase I and II), this study aims to test a version of the program adapted
      for entirely virtual delivery. This is a single-center study, with the HOBSCOTCH intervention
      being delivered by staff affiliated with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, NH.
