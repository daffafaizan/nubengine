      NAFLD patients. These two algorithms showed a very good >80% diagnostic accuracy for advanced
      fibrosis and a very low <15% rate of liver biopsy requirement. The eLIFT-FMVCTE had a
      significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (84.6% vs 80.6%, p=0.15), was more specific, and
      provided higher negative and positive predictive value and higher non-invasive diagnostic
      accuracy. Finally, these preliminary results suggested the eLIFT-FMVCTE was most suitable for
      clinical practice than the FIB4-FS. However, because almost all these patients from this
      preliminary comparative study came from the population where the eLIFT-FMVCTE was developed
      with thus an optimism bias, the results from this direct comparison require further
      validation.

      Therefore, FIB4-FS and the eLIFT-FMVCTE algorithms must now be evaluated and compared in an
      independent population of NAFLD patients to determine which strategy is the best one for
      clinical practice.
