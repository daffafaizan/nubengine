      United States. Due to its widespread use, it is important to develop an effective treatment
      for cocaine dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine how impulsivity and
      prefrontal cortical function are related to treatment response in cocaine dependent
      individuals.

      Participants in this study will complete four separate experiments, each with a different aim
      and testing panel [cognitive function tests with and without functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI)]. The first experiment will examine memory, attention, cognitive function, and
      impulsivity; the aim is to determine the relationship between impulsivity and cognitive
      function in cocaine dependent individuals receiving treatment. The second experiment will
      examine the relationship between impulsivity and the prefrontal cortical structure and
      function. Participants will complete an fMRI during the second experiment. The third
      experiment will consist of cognitive function tests and will examine the prefrontal cortex in
      relation to treatment response, based on four different treatments: 1) L-dopamine, 2)
      naltrexone, 3) modafinil, and 4) placebo. The fourth experiment will examine the effect of
      cocaine dependence treatment on prefrontal cortex, focusing on participants receiving
      modafinil.
