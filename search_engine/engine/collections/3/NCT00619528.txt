        1. To remove all immunosuppressive therapy from recipients of HLA-identical sibling renal
           transplants within 24 months of transplantation.

        2. To detect and follow cellular (macro) chimerism of donor hematopoietic stem cell (DHSC)
           lineages and the generation of T-regulatory cells using specialized immunomonitoring
           assays for these donor/recipient pairs to demonstrate specific immunologic
           unresponsiveness.

        3. To investigate the safety and efficacy of a treatment regimen consisting of induction
           therapy with Campath-1H and steroid-free low dose maintenance immunosuppression,
           consisting of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus converted to sirolimus. This is
           to be followed by complete withdrawal of immunosuppression beginning at one year, at a
           minimum, post transplant, in recipients who have also been given four infusions of
           purified donor hematopoietic Cluster of Differentiation (CD)34+ stem cells (DHSC).
