    
      AGAVE-201 is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of axatilimab at 3 different dose levels in patients with recurrent
      or refractory active cGVHD who have received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy due
      to progression of disease, intolerability or toxicity. Disease progression is defined 1) by
      the NIH 2014 consensus criteria, either in terms of organ specific algorithm or global
      assessment or 2) as active, symptomatic cGVHD for whom the physician believes that a new line
      of systemic therapy is required.
