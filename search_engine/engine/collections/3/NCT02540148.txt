      with dry AMD. 60 subjects will be randomly divided into two groups. A ratio of 1:3 will be
      maintained between control and the experimental groups. In the treatment group, subjects will
      undergo a treatment session to the enrolled eyes daily for three days during week 1, followed
      by a single treatment session during weeks 2, 14 and 26 with the Nova Oculus device. A second
      group of subjects will act as the control group. This group will undergo sham treatment at
      the same treatment intervals with a non-functional Nova Oculus device. ETDRS visual acuity
      will be performed on all subjects at enrollment prior to each treatment and at four weeks
      from enrollment. The effect of treatments with the Nova Oculus device compared to sham
      treatment on the ETDRS visual acuity of subjects with dry AMD will be determined.
