    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric
      (conducted in more than one center), non-randomized and single-arm study of long- acting
      risperidone microspheres in participants with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders.
      The duration of this study will be 6 months and will include following parts: Screening (that
      is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1), run-in period (that is, Week 1 to 3) and
      Treatment period (that is, Week 1 to 24). Participants will receive previous medication for
      the first three weeks during run-in period and previous medications will be tapered off
      during the third week. Participants will receive long-acting risperidone microspheres
      starting at a dose of 25 milligram (mg) every two weeks by intramuscular injection (injection
      of a substance into a muscle). Efficacy of the participants will be primarily evaluated
      through Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.
