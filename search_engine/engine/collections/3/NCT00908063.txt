      evaluate the safety and tolerability of Oxycyte in patients with severe non-penetrating
      Traumatic Brain Injury administered in conjunction with 50% to 80% oxygen and standard of
      care treatment.

      At each dose level, patients receiving Oxycyte will be compared to a control group of
      patients who will receive Normal Saline (NS); all patients will receive 50% oxygen or
      greater, if per standard of care for a particular patient based on his / her condition, up to
      a maximum of 80%.

      Ischemic brain damage is found in 80% of patients who die from severe head injury and studies
      have shown that early, transient cerebral hypoperfusion of unknown origin is present in about
      40% of these patients. In several early research studies, it is documented that about
      one-third of severe head injured patients have reduced brain oxygen tension (<25 mm Hg)
      especially during the first 6 to 12 hours following severe head injury. In this group of
      patients with low brain oxygen, the clinical prognosis is poor with death being a frequent
      outcome.

      Based on a belief that increased brain oxygen levels would prove beneficial in the TBI
      patient, it is theorized that perfluorocarbon-enhanced oxygen delivery may provide the same
      or greater benefit. PFCs are especially attractive in this setting for several reasons;
      first, because they transport oxygen without the need for erythrocytes and hemoglobin and can
      thus perfuse and oxygenate "peri-contusional" brain tissue in which it has been shown that
      capillaries are so narrowed as to impede red blood cell (RBC) transport; secondly,
      perfluorocarbon (PFCs) actually increase oxygen transport and oxygen tension in the tissues,
      which cannot be achieved with normobaric hyperoxia alone.
