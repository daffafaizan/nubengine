      influences patients' quality of life and carries poor prognosis.The pathophysiological basis
      of development of acquired AA include immune-mediated attack, inherent hematopoietic stem
      cell insufficiency and telomere defects. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only
      curative treatment for AA. Unfortunately it is unavailable for many patients due to lack of
      matched donors furthermore others are ineligible for BMT due to old age or co-morbid
      conditions. Immunosuppressive therapy was the mainstay of treatment for AA for many years,
      however many patients developed resistance or refractoriness. Immunosuppressive therapy was
      in the form of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) which gave hematologic response in nearly 50% of
      patients , adding cyclosporin A increases this response to 70%. Why some patients became
      resistant to immunosuppressive therapy ? The answer is not known.

      Thrombopoietin mimetic (Eltrombopag) was firstly FDA approved for treatment of immune
      thrombocytopenic purpura. Numerous clinical trials proved the efficacy of anthropometric
      mimetic in patients with refractory severe AA, leading to its FDA approval for this group of
      patients. Some researchers proven the efficacy of thrombopoietin mimetic in patients with
      moderate aplastic anemia.

      This study aimed to asses the combination of thrombopoietin mimetic and immunosuppressive
      therapy in patients with AA.
