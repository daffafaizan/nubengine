        -  The patient will undergo a diagnostic knee arthroscopy. This procedure would have been
           performed regardless of enrollment in the study. During the diagnostic knee arthroscopy,
           the surgeon will determine whether the patient is eligible to participate in the study.

        -  If the patient has a torn meniscus, inflamed joint lining or loose fragments in the
           knee, this will be removed and treated and he/she will still be eligible for the study.

        -  If, however, the physician determines that the patient needs more invasive treatments
           (such as cartilage transplantation, meniscal repair, removal of a substantial amount of
           your meniscus), then he/she will be excluded from the study and will not have fat tissue
           suctioned from his/her abdomen. The standard of care treatment will then proceed based
           on the physician's judgement.

        -  After the surgeon completes the arthroscopic procedure, the recommended amount of
           fat-derived stem cells (about 2 teaspoons) will be injected into the knee. There will be
           approximately 1 teaspoon of excess fat derived stem cells, which will be transported to
           our research facility so that the contents can be stored for later examination.

        -  After surgery, 5 visits are required by the patient over the following 12 months: at 2
           weeks after surgery to monitor his/her incision, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and then
           finally 12 months.
