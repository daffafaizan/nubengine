      lymphoma. It represents approximately 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. Although
      the peak age of onset of multiple myeloma is 70 years of age, recent statistics indicate both
      increasing incidence and earlier age of onset.

      The historical control 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) is assumed to be 35%. The
      proposed therapy of fludarabine, melphalan and bortezomib is expected to improve the PFS by
      20%.
