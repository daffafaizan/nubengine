      reproductive technologies (ART) in order to achieve their desire to become parents. However,
      these techniques are not guaranteed solutions and still many couples with unexplained
      infertility fail to conceive. One of the reasons might be the relative selection of
      spermatozoa for the following ART. To minimize a poor selection made by the operator and to
      standardize spermatozoa selection, we suggest a new method might be used in combination with
      the routine spermatozoa selection techniques.

      Thermotaxis might be used in the ART setting as a tool to select the best spermatozoa as
      human spermatozoa after capacitation responds positively to a temperature gradient change.
      Moreover, this might be the possible navigation mechanism of spermatozoa in the female
      genital tract. We hypothesize that spermatozoa selected by thermotaxis behavior might
      increase the morphologically normal spermatozoa number in the cohort used during ART.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if thermotaxis is a good method for selecting
      morphologically normal sperm for ART.
