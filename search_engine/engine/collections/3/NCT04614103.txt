      manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI and further optimized by Iovance
      for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. The cell transfer therapy used in this
      study involves patients receiving an NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed
      by infusion of autologous TIL, then finally followed by the administration of IL-2.
