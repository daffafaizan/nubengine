    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency of topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOPO2A) gene copy number alterations
      (including deletions, gains, and amplification), immunohistochemical expression, and
      chromosome 17 polysomy in tumor tissue samples from patients with advanced or recurrent
      endometrial carcinoma treated with anthracycline-based therapy on Gynecologic Oncology Group
      (GOG)-0177.

      II. To assess the relationship between TOPO2A gene copy number alterations, TOPO2A protein
      expression, chromosome 17 polysomy, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
      status in tumor tissue samples from these patients.

      III. To assess the association between TOPO2A status (TOPO2A gene copy number alterations and
      TOPO2A protein expression), or chromosome 17 polysomy and clinical covariates (e.g., age,
      race/ethnicity, cell type, histologic grade, disease stage, regimen type).

      IV. To assess the association between TOPO2A status or chromosome 17 polysomy with measures
      of clinical outcome including response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
      patients treated with this regimen.

      V. To evaluate the potential identification of cut points for TOPO2A protein expression with
      potential prognostic value in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for topoisomerase 2-alpha gene alteration and
      expression and chromosome 17 polysomy by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and
      immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical information associated with each endometrial carcinoma
      sample (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, cell type, histologic grade, disease stage, and regimen
      type) is also collected.
