      common. At this time, healthcare providers look at patient's skin and remove a sample of
      suspicious areas of the skin (biopsy) to test for cancer.

      This research study will inspect cotton and cloth swabs of normal skin and suspicious areas
      of the skin that are going to be biopsied just before the biopsy. The swabs will be looked at
      with a very sensitive chemistry lab analyzer to see if the lab analyzer can confirm
      conventional lab test findings.
