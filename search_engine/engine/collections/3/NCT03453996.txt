    
      Overview: Randomized stepped-wedge trial to evaluate the impact of implementing a
      computerized decision support strategy that incorporates CI-AKI risk prediction and
      calculation of safe contrast dye limits and intravenous fluid recommendations.

      Study Population: Adult patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional coronary angiography
      procedures will be eligible if not already receiving dialysis. Patients receiving emergency
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction will
      be excluded.

      Intervention: Multivariable clinical risk prediction model to estimate risk of CI-AKI and
      safe contrast limits for patients above the median (>5%) predicted risk of CI-AKI.
      Intravenous fluids recommendations based on weight and left-ventricular end-diastolic
      pressure will also be provided for patients identified above the median risk of CI-AKI.

      The National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) Cath-PCI Registry AKI risk model will be
      used to estimated the predicted risk of CI-AKI, and safe contrast limits will be estimated
      using the ePRISM, Acute Kidney Injury Model with Contrast Sensitivities and Dialysis Risk
      (Health Outcomes Sciences) software, incorporated within the Alberta Provincial Project for
      Outcomes Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) Cardiac Catheterization software.

      Study Design: Using a stepped-wedge design, clusters of cardiologists who perform diagnostic
      or therapeutic cardiac catheterization in each centre will be randomized to be introduced to
      the intervention at sequential time points spaced over 20 months. At each step, cardiologists
      who have not yet been randomized will serve as controls.
