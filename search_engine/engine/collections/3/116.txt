ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation clinical, hemodynamicand surgical considerations .the clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and anatomic findings infifteen patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by aorticregurgitation are presented . in this combination of malformations theaortic regurgitation is acquired and results from prolapse of an aorticvalve leaflet into the septal defect . the strategic location of theseptal defect in relation to the aortic leaflets appears to be moreimportant to the development of this complication than the size of thedefect or the magnitude of the shunt through it . the onset of aorticregurgitation occurs during early childhood and, once present, tends tobecome more severe . careful observation of patients with these defectsis indicated following the appearance of aortic regurgitation sincerapid progression to severe left ventricular failure is not uncommon .ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation must be distinguishedfrom other cardiovascular abnormalities producing a wide pulse pressurewith a continuous or to-and-fro murmur . cardiac catheterization andthoracic aortography are the diagnostic procedures most helpful in thisdifferentiation . the operative treatment of ventricular septal defectand aortic regurgitation is reviewed and, on the basis of the presentand previously reported results, suggested plans for surgical managementare presented .
