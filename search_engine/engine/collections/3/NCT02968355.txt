    
      The FilmArray Global Fever (GF) Panel, developed by BioFire Defense in collaboration with the
      U.S. Department of Defense and NIAID, uses an automated, multiplex PCR system to evaluate
      whole blood samples for 19 pathogens simultaneously in under an hour. Targets of the GF Panel
      are Chikungunya virus, CCHF virus, dengue virus (serotypes 1-4), Ebolavirus, Lassa virus,
      Marburgvirus, West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Zika virus, Bacillus anthracis,
      Francisella tularensis, Leptospira spp., Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A,
      Yersinia pestis, Leishmania donovani complex, Plasmodium spp., P. falciparum, and P.
      ovale/vivax. BioFire Defense is conducting a prospective clinical study to evaluate the
      sensitivity and specificity of the GF Panel when used to test blood collected from subjects
      with fever or who have recently had fever. This multi-center study is being conducted at
      locations around the world.
