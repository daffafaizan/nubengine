      develop two non-invasive screening tools to detect mitochondrial defects in Diabetes Mellitus
      and Metabolic Syndrome patients.

      The device call Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy develope at Beckman Laser Instituteis is
      non-invasive measurement technique, to measure the properties of the muscle tisuue and
      vascular activity (calf, bicep, or the brain)to evaluate the patient's metabolic status and
      and to assess muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS function.
