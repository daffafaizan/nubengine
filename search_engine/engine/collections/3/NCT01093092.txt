    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral calcitriol when combined with a standard
      dose of gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and cisplatin in a 28-day cycle.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the toxicity of this combination using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      II. Study the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in an
      expanded cohort of 6 patients.

      III. Describe the clinical activity associated with this regimen in this advanced solid tumor
      population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive calcitriol orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 2; and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on
      days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
