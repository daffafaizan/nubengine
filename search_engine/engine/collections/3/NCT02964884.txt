    
      Neurofibromitosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome. The
      most common concern of NF1 is learning disabilities (LDs). Approximately half of children
      with NF1 have LDs, the most common of which are reading disabilities (RDs).The purpose of
      this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and treatment of RDs
      in NF1.

      The Investigator will evaluate four different groups (see list below) to determine if there
      are differential outcomes in these groups of children with NF+RD. The first two groups will
      consist of NF1 patients, and the second two groups will consist of participants with RDs but
      without NF1.

        1. Reading tutoring program and a medication called Lovastatin (NF1 patients)

        2. Reading tutoring program and no Lovastatin (placebo) (NF1 patients)

        3. Reading tutoring program (RD participants)

        4. Other Academic "Sham" tutoring (eligible to receive reading tutoring after study
           participation is complete) (RD participants)
