      surgical practice. Breast feeding is very important both mother and the child. For the
      infant, breast feeding has an important role on the maturity of immune system. In the
      literature search, there are a little studies about the relationship between the breast
      feeding and appendicitis. In the literature, some studies suggests that the breast feeding
      may possibly give protection against the development of appendicitis. But the number of the
      patients and the control groups are limited. Because of that the investigators have planned
      to make this study with a lot of number of patients.
