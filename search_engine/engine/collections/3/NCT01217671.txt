      a genetic disorder characterized by the production of an abnormal amount of AAT protein and
      reduced circulating levels of this protein. Subjects with AAT deficiency are at increased
      risk for developing Emphysema. It is believed that this is the result of the chronic activity
      of elastase released by cells continually present in the lungs in low numbers.

      Three blinded interim analyses have shown that there are no safety issues and no concerns
      regarding tolerability.
