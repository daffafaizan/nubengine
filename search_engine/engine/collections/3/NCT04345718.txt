      with opioid use disorder (OUD) moderate or severe and who have not been taking prescribed
      medication for OUD (MOUD) for 14 days or more prior to hospitalization. Eligibility will be
      determined over one or more assessments during the index hospitalization. Once eligibility
      has been determined, participants will be randomized 1:1 to either a single injection of
      extended-release buprenorphine or TAU, which will include methadone, sublingual
      buprenorphine, or naltrexone. Connection to OUD care and ongoing MOUD following
      hospitalization will be per community standard. Participants will be assessed for engagement
      in OUD treatment by the presence of a legitimately prescribed MOUD on day 34 following
      hospital discharge. Further outcomes will be assessed at 90 and 180 days following hospital
      discharge.
