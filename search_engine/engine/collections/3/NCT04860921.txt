      not related to hypertension, congenital, valvular and pericardial diseases. The most common
      type of cardiomyopathy is dilate cardiomyopathy.

      Dilated cardiomyopathy usually manifests as chronic systolic heart failure leading to
      arrhythmias and sudden death.

      Trace elements are known to have a key role in myocardial metabolism. The human heart
      requires energy from micro and macro nutrients both to regenerate proteins and cells, and to
      support cyclic contractions. Heart failure is associated with neuro-hormonal activation
      leading to elevated levels of inflammatory markers and oxidative stress.

      Zinc is an essential micronutrient that impacts the cardiovascular system. There are multiple
      potential pathophysiologic causes for zinc deficiency in heart failure as result of impaired
      micronutrient consumption, hyper inflammatory state, diminished absorption and hyperzincuria
      from heart failure medications. Zinc deficiency may play a role as primary and possible
      reversible cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.

      Plasma zinc levels have been reported in multiple observational studies of patients with
      heart failure particularly in studies of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, serum zinc levels
      have been found to be low.

      A small but growing body of evidence suggesting the role for oral zinc supplementation in the
      management of dilated cardiomyopathy however further evaluation of the impact on outcome is
      needed.
