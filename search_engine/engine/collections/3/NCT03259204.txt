      prevention for VTE in hospitalized patients and used in daily practice. IPC is, however, not
      currently used on outpatients and it is currently unknown if it reduces the risk of VTE
      during long term leg-immobilization. Plaster cast and orthosis treatments are currently used
      in daily practice on Achilles tendon ruptures and ankle fractures. At present there is no
      consensus about using VTE prophylaxis in leg-immobilized patients. Since pharmacoprophylaxis
      has shown low- or no VTE preventive effects in leg-immobilization, is not recommended by some
      guidelines.

      Furthermore, since all patients will undergo clinical examinations and have DVT-screening
      performed with compression Doppler ultrasound (CDU) removal of leg immobilization this will
      comprise an extra security for the included patients to detect a VTE. If a VTE is detected
      clinical guidelines will be followed by initiating chemical VTE-treatment.
