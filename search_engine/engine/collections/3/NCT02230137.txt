      60% of them aged 12 to 17 years. Compliance is a major issue during adolescence. Mobile text
      message is one of the strategies to enhance adherence. The main aim of this study is to
      assess HbA1c reduction after a 6 month SMS support among adolescents with poorly controlled
      type 1 diabetes. Adherence and quality of life will also be assessed at the end of the trial.
      This study is a prospective randomized monocentric trial. Sixty adolescents with type 1
      diabetes and HbA1c equal or higher than 8.5 % will be randomized according to the method of
      Zelen in two groups : standard treatment versus standard treatment plus support by SMS. The
      patients will receive one SMS before each injection of insulin.
