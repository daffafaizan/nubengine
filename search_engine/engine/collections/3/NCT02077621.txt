      patients who are scheduled for palliative abdominal surgery for cancer will be randomly
      assigned to the control or treatment group. Each group will have at least 20 patients and be
      treated as follows: 1) control group: patients will accept placebo 1 dose a day (POD-1)
      before surgery and 1 dose a day for 3 days after surgery (POD+0 to POD+2); 2) treatment
      group: patients will accept PG2 1 dose a day (POD-1) before surgery and 1 dose a day for 3
      days after surgery (POD+0 to POD+2).
