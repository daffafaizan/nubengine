      CCT-NAPN-18918) using combined training-modules for parents and teachers showed positive
      effects on children's behaviour in the intervention-group. These effects in teacher's view
      were stronger than in the control-group but could not be proved to be statistically
      significant. Moreover after this first step of evaluation there remain unanswered questions
      concerning the stability of effects after transferring the program in routine care. Therefore
      the study is continued by an effectiveness-study.
