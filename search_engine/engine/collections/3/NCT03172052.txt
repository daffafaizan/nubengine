      fluid from the pleural space and to allow the treatment of the underlying disease. Despite
      the improvement in the management options of pleural effusion; intrapleural adhesions remain
      a significant problem in many patients with pleural disease. The presence of adhesions carry
      a poor prognostic factor in patients with exudative pleural effusions that it may render the
      drainage of pleural fluid difficulty inspite of tube being patent and correctly positioned.

      Two options are currently available to deal with the problem of pleural adhesions, the first
      is chemical and the second is mechanical adhesiolysis . Chemical adhesiolysis means lysis of
      the adhesive bands medically by instillation intrapleural chemical agents e.g. streptokinase,
      urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, streptodornase, deoxyribonuclease (human recombinant
      [hr]DNAase), single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator and the uncommonly used MESNA
      (2-mercaptoethane sulfonate Na) . Mechanical adhesiolysis means breaking up the adhesive
      bands and removing it by pulling and dissecting via medical thoracoscope, minimally invasive
      video assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) or more invasive thoracotomy.
