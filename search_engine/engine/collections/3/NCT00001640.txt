      Parkinson's disease will be enrolled. We will also be enrolling people with sporadic
      Parkinson's disease. Known disease genes will be sequenced to look for mutations. In the
      event that no mutations are detected and there are samples from multiple family members,
      linkage analysis will be undertaken in an effort to identify a region or regions of the
      genome harboring defective genes that cause inherited Parkinson's disease. Candidate genes
      that reside in regions linked to the disease will be sequenced in effort to find mutations
      responsible for the disease.

      Genetic linkage studies will include all available, informative family members, while gene
      sequence analysis will be performed on affected individuals and spousal controls. In the
      event that we identify a mutation of clear pathogenicity in one of the known Parkinson's
      genes, we will contact all participating family members to notify them of the discovery of
      the gene that causes PD in their family and offer them individual counseling and testing in a
      CLIA approved lab. To assess any impact caused by the offer and subsequent pursuit of genetic
      testing we will be administering a questionnaire assessing psychological well-being prior to
      and following testing.
