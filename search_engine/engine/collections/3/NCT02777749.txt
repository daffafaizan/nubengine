      with expectations for greater than 4 million/year by the year 2030. Since the onset of TKAs
      in the 1960's, there have been developments that have improved both functionality and patient
      satisfaction. In the last decade, a focus has been made on multimodal pain management
      protocols, more rapid functional recovery, reduced length of hospital stay, and minimizing
      side effects of treatment while maintaining function and durability. The widespread use of
      regional anesthesia has led to improvements in pain control, more rapid functional recovery,
      and reduced length of stay. In recent years many surgeons have transitioned from femoral
      nerve blocks (proximal femoral nerve) to adductor canal blocks (distal femoral nerve) to
      maintain a sensory block for pain control, while minimizing any motor blockade that is
      typically seen in proximal femoral nerve blocks, which would hamper rehabilitation, and
      increase risk of falls. In addition to regional blocks, which are typically performed in the
      preoperative setting, some surgeons favor an intraoperative periarticular anesthetic
      injection (PAI), typically with bupivacaine or the long acting form liposomal bupivacaine,
      either in conjunction with an adductor canal block, or independently. In theory, PAI has the
      advantage of a comparable sensory nerve block as an adductor canal block, without the
      disadvantages and risks, which include prolonged quadriceps weakness, fall risk, and
      neurologic dysfunction.

      The purpose of this randomized control trial is to compare the efficacy of adductor canal
      blocks versus periarticular bupivacaine injections for pain management in total knee
      arthroplasty.
