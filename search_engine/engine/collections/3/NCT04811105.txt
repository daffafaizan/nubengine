      treatment which found by Hippocrates , involves seton insertion into the tract of fistula .
      Todaymost of surgeon still use the same technic but PF is really hard disease to treat.
      Recurrence rate of PF is really high and there are lots of complication about this disease.

      The most scary complication during the surgery or postoperatively is anal disfunction. Ä±n PF
      surgical technics involves ;fistulectomy (coring out), lay open (fistulotomy), Ligation of
      Intersphincteric Fistula Tract), advancement flap and laser ablation of the fistula tract .
      The popularity of laser ablation of the fistula tract is increasing day by day.This surgical
      procedure is applied with the laser device which use in varicose vain ablation in vascular
      surgery.In this study the investigator are trying to find out the effect of steam ablation in
      PF on rats.This new procedure has to be tried on rat firstly and the studies is very
      important which tried on rats.

      Our research includes 32 rats and Firstly the investigator created perianal fistula tract
      with 2.0 silk suture material on 3 o'clock in perianal region.1 month will wait for the
      maturation of fistula tract. After that the suture materials removed from the fistula tract
      and one fistula tract will treat with steam ablation device (3 o'clock )in 16 rats and the
      other 16 rats will be the control group .1 month will be wait for the examination of
      treatment of fistula tract in steam ablation group.Evaluation of fistula tract will define
      with microscopic examination after the excision.End of the study the investigator will be
      find out the effect of steam ablation on perianal fistula .
