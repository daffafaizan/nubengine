      genotype information may increase adherence to dietary recommendations.

      The main aim of the project is thus testing the effectiveness of a genotype-based
      personalized dietary intervention targeted at decreasing caffeine intake.

      Specific aims of the study include:

        -  Implementation of the application for mobile devices which will be designed to assess
           caffeine intake.

        -  Testing whether providing information on CYP1A2 polymorphism affects effectiveness of
           the dietary intervention aimed at decreasing caffeine intake.

        -  Testing whether changes in dietary behavior can persist over time To accomplish the
           study goals a group of healthy adults will be enrolled. Participants will complete an
           informed consent procedure. As we aim at decreasing caffeine intake, we plan to first
           screen for people drinking at least 2 cups of coffee or with total caffeine intake over
           200 mg/day. Then genotype screening will be performed and eligible volunteers will be
           randomly assigned to one of the study groups which receive either dietary advice or
           dietary advice and genotype information.
