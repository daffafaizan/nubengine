    
      The current non-interventional study aims to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and
      safety of a decongestant Xylometazoline-containing nasal spray in comparison to use of a
      decongestant Xylometazoline-containing nasal spray together with an Ectoin-containing nasal
      douche in patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis.

      Efficacy will be studied by documentation of the following symptoms:

        -  oedema, redness (assessed by rhinoscopy)

        -  nasal obstruction, nasal secretion, headache/face pain, loss of sense of smell/taste

        -  sore throat, cough

      In parallel, participating patients will document their symptoms and the their quality of
      life over the entire study duration in patient diaries.

      Patients of both genders aged 6 years and above can take part in the study if diagnosed with
      acute viral rhinosinusitis. The assignment of a patient to a particular treatment is not
      decided in advance but falls within current practice, and is clearly separated from the
      decision to include the patient into the study.

      Study therapy will be applied in accordance with the respective instructions for use.

      Study duration is 7-14 days, depending on the improvement of symptoms. At the end of the
      study, both the investigators and the patients are asked to judge the efficacy and
      tolerability of the treatments.
