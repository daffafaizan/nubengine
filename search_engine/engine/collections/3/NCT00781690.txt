      characteristics of the extracorporeal circuit in term of reduced activation of the
      coagulation system and lower deposits of clot components.

      The aim is to provide a system (hemodialyzer and extracorporeal circuit) with a low
      thrombogenicity and that can be used with low heparin dose in order to reduce the patients'
      bleeding risk at the end of HD treatment.

      Measurements of TAT (Thrombin-Antithrombin), the marker of the activation of the coagulation,
      will be performed during the study in order to evaluate the thrombogenicity of the system.

      The ionic clearance will be collected during all treatments to evaluate the performance of
      the hemodialyzer.

      The study will be divided into three steps

        -  Period 1: Usual heparin dose with usual hemodialyzer and standard blood lines
           (baseline),

        -  Period 2: Decrease of heparin dose with Evodial hemodialyzer and standard bloodlines

        -  Period 3: Lowest heparin dose defined in step 2 using the system Evodial hemodialyzer
           and SMA bloodlines.

      Each patient included into the study will perform the three steps. As the risk of
      extracorporeal circuit clotting will be rather important, no control group (usual
      hemodialyzer with heparin decrease dose) will be performed.
