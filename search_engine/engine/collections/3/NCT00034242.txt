      hereditary and sporadic cerebellar degeneration. The objective of this study is to show
      clinical improvement or stabilization in ataxia using treatment with intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. This study is a clinical, randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial of IVIG in adult patients with cerebellar ataxia. Patients will be selected from the
      motor control clinic based on a diagnosis of sporadic or hereditary cerebellar degeneration.
      Study drug (placebo versus active) will be given in an intravenous infusion over a 2-day
      period while the patient is hospitalized. This will be repeated monthly for 2 months.
      Efficacy measurement will include clinical ataxia rating scales, motor speed testing and
      clinical gait evaluation. These will be performed at baseline, during each hospitalization,
      and 1 month following final IVIG infusion. Main outcome measure will be difference from
      baseline in score on the NINDS ataxia rating scale 1 month following 2 treatments of 2 mg/kg
      IVIG (total 4 mg/kg).
