      cancer is an aggressive disease with extremely low 5-year survival rate. For advanced
      pancreatic cancer patients who failed with first-line treatment, subsequent treatment options
      are limited. SHR-1020 combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel could through multiple
      mechanisms such as block tumor mitosis, inhibit tumor angiogenesis, inhibit interstitial
      fibrosis to achieve anti-tumor effect.

      The safety and efficacy of this study will be assessed through ORR, DCR,PFS, OS , and adverse
      effects as graded by CTCAE 5.0.
