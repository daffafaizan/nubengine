      screening mammography and improvements in treatment has resulted in a substantial decrease in
      mortality which explains why more women diagnosed at a younger age are becoming long-term
      survivors.Consequently, quality of life (QL) issues have become increasingly important in the
      contemporary multidisciplinary management of breast cancer. Standard of car survivorship
      program has evolved over several years to include 3 facets: (1)clinical surveillance program
      to include routine follow up exams; (2) local support group programs; and (3) rehabilitation
      program offering physical and occupational rehab, along with lymphedema prevention and
      treatment.

      Many studies have reported on successful interventions (listed in our references) with
      improvements in quality of life; however the effects did not last long after intervention.
      This has brought into question the real value of such interventions. The proposed class will
      focus on teaching life skills that have shown long-lasting effect in the corporate world of
      change. Thus, our goal is to determine if the impact of the class will be similar in the
      healthcare arena, specifically cancer survivorship. Our last study on assessing quality of
      life revealed that patients were suffering deficits in quality of life, specifically with
      regard to the emotional scale despite the standard of care approach available. We therefore
      propose this intervention to be studied as proof of concept so that depending on the results
      of the proposed trial, this class can become a routine part of the survivorship program.
