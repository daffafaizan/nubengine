      action at peripheral sites and at central sites as they relate to sensory transmission and
      pain. This is the last of 4 studies to accomplish generation, validation, and application of
      a PK/PD model for oxytocin in the periphery. Its goal is to apply the PK/PD model generated
      in previous protocols and Validate a pharmacodynamic model of oxytocin for peripheral
      analgesic effects to a more complex sensory stimulus that stimulates nerve fibers which
      result in pain from a heat stimulus and those which reduce pain from vibration, similar to
      brushing or rubbing an area of pain. The investigators do this because oxytocin in animals
      affects these nerve fibers in the periphery in different ways - it increases the activity of
      the vibration/rubbing sensitive fibers and decreases the activity of the pain fibers. As
      such, The investigators expect that the effect of oxytocin on pain from this mixed stimulus
      of heat and vibration will be much more pronounced than that seen with the purely painful
      stimulus used in previous studies in this series.

      This is a double-blind, crossover study in which oxytocin or placebo is infused. In this
      study healthy people are recruited for a 2 day double-blind, crossover study. They will come
      to the Clinical Research Unit and one intravenous catheter (IV) inserted in the forearm for
      oxytocin or placebo infusion. Participants will be given a steady rate intravenous infusion
      of oxytocin at a targeted dose or placebo for 30 minutes. At 5, 15, and 30 minutes after
      starting the infusion, pain report to the 47°Celsius, 30-second stimulus alone or with ½ VT
      vibration (randomized order) will be obtained. Participants will return at least 24 hours
      later and receive the opposite infusion and testing.
