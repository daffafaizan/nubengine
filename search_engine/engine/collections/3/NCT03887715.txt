    
      A prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, blinded trial of subjects implanted with
      VNS Therapy. Active treatment and no stimulation control are randomized, at least two weeks
      after implantation and observed for 12-months.

      After completing the 12 month endpoint in the RCT portion of the study, all RECOVER subjects
      will transition into the prospective, open-label, longitudinal portion of the study. Subjects
      in the control arm of RECOVER will be activated after completing the 12 month endpoint.

      After completion of enrollment in the RCT portion or meeting of interim success criterion
      (whichever comes first), up to 5,800 new subjects may enroll directly into the
      open-label,prospective, longitudinal study. These subjects will participate in the study for
      approximately 5 years.

      The study has been designed in accordance with The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
      coverage with evidence development (CED) decision entitled "Decision Memo for Vagus Nerve
      Stimulation (VNS) for Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) (CAG-00313R2).
