    
      Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a combined exercise and tDCS treatment for improving
      cognitive outcomes in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.

      Study Design: Eligible participants will be randomized to one of three interventions:
      Exercise primer with tDCS, Treatment as usual (TAU/exercise education) with tDCS, or Exercise
      primer with sham tDCS. Participants randomized to an exercise group will undergo exercise,
      followed by either sham or active tDCS. Participants randomized to TAU will receive written
      information in accordance with the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for older adults and
      tDCS for the same duration. Cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms and fasting blood samples
      for biomarker analysis will be collected.
