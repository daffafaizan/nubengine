    
      This is a multi-center (3-5) single-arm study that will compare the performance of the
      Spectra Optia Apheresis System's MNC protocol to that of the historical performance of the
      COBE Spectra MNC protocol. In order to demonstrate the substantial equivalence of the two
      devices, a non-inferiority design will be used. The study will enroll patients with multiple
      myeloma who are to be treated with myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by bone-marrow rescue
      with an autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplant. Peripheral blood stem cells will be
      collected using the Spectra Optia MNC protocol and re-infused following myeloablative
      chemotherapy.
