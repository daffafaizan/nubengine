        1. To evaluate the association between glucose utilization and neuropsychological
           performance on tests of verbal memory and attention among patients with a history of
           depression, but who are euthymic, at baseline;

        2. To evaluate changes in neuropsychological test performance among patients with a history
           of depression and who have insulin resistance who are treated with open-label
           mifepristone and,

        3. To explore interactions between changes in patients' glucose tolerance profiles and
           changes in verbal memory and attention. An exploratory aim is to explore the interaction
           of changes in cortisol awakening response and changes in verbal memory and attention
           within subjects with and without IGT, as well as the potential mediating effects of
           gender.
