      Taiwan, STEMI patients from July 2009 to December 2011 who received aspiration thrombectomy
      during PPCI were defined as the thrombectomy group, and the remaining patients were defined
      as the PCI alone group. ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify underlying comorbidities. Data
      regarding the prescription of in-hospital and outpatient medications and the utilization of
      medical devices were also extracted from the NHIRD using ICD-9-CM procedure codes and
      pharmacology and device codes.

      Study outcomes The primary endpoints of this study were all-cause mortality and stroke during
      hospitalization and at 30 days and 1 year of follow-up. Ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes of
      stroke were further identified according to ICD-9-CM codes. All patientswere followed for 1
      year or until the outcomes were achieved, whichever came first.

      Statistical analysis Propensity score weighting was used to reduce potential differences
      between the two study groups. The incidence rates of all-cause mortality and stroke were
      estimated as the total number of events during the follow-up period divided by the
      person-months at risk. For all-cause mortality, a Cox proportional hazard model was used to
      obtain hazard ratios (HRs). For stroke, Fine and Gray's competing-risk regression was used to
      obtain sub-hazard ratios (SHRs). The cumulative incidence of stroke versus follow-up time was
      plotted rather than the event-free rate, because cumulative incidence function can take the
      competing risk of death into account. For the thrombectomy group, 95% confidence intervals
      (CIs) of the HRs and SHRs were calculated using the PCI alone group as the referent group.
