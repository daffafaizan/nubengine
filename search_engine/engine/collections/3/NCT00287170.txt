      administration of novel, delayed-release test formulations, for targeted delivery to the
      ileum in Crohn's Disease patients. The local delivery drugs (delayed-release formulations of
      6-mercaptopurine or calcitriol) will be compared to standard Purinethol treatment after 12
      weeks of treatment to evaluate:

        -  (1) local intestinal mucosal inflammation and damage as shown by markers of biopsy
           tissue (CDEIS and pathologist review of biopsies);

        -  (2) Clinical symptoms of active Crohn's Disease [CDAI scores- remission <150; response-
           a drop of 100 points from baseline; IBDQ scores- >= 180 indicative of remission]; and

        -  (3)Systemic improvement as shown by blood immunological and inflammatory markers (CRP
           and ESR).

      It is hypothesized that since CD is a localized autoimmune inflammation of the intestinal
      mucosa, a far more effective, and potentially safer treatment would be targeted, local
      delivery of effective drugs directly to the disease site. The drug would be concentrated in
      the specific area of disease, while unwanted systemic side effects would be minimized. The
      drugs selected for evaluation are 6-MP (a mainstay of CD treatment for over 30 years) and
      calcitriol, a synthetically manufactured Vitamin D derivative, which is being evaluated in
      many studies for its impressive immunomodulatory effects in cancer, MS and other autoimmune
      disorders.
