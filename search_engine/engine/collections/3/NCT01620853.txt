      hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) tissue specimens. The FDA approved ALK kit is designed to detect rearrangements
      involving the ALK gene (2p23). Results from the ALK Kit are intended for use, in conjunction
      with and not in lieu of current standard diagnostic procedures, as an aid for the pathologist
      in the identification of patients eligible for treatment with XALKORIÂ® (crizotinib).
