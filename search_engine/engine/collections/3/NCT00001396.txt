      obstruction and improves symptoms in most adult patients with obstructive hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM). It is however, uncertain whether DDD pacing will be efficacious in
      children with obstructive HCM, because of evolving cardiac morphology and increased LV
      hypertrophy and outflow obstruction associated with rapid body growth. We propose to monitor
      clinical progress, and cardiac morphologic and hemodynamic changes over several years
      following implantation of a DDD pacemaker in children who present with obstructive HCM
      between the ages of 5 to 15 years. Functional status, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and
      LV outflow obstruction will be evaluated by exercise tests, echocardiography, thallium
      scintigraphy, Holter monitoring, electrophysiologic and cardiac catheterization studies. The
      results of pacemaker therapy will be compared with the findings in a cohort of young patients
      with obstructive HCM who elect not to be treated with DDD pacemaker.
