      falciparum pre-erythrocytic thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP). The 'ME' is a
      string of 20 epitopes fused to the thrombospondin-related adhesion protein. TRAP was selected
      as it is well characterized and has a protective homologue in rodents. We have safely
      administered ME-TRAP to over 700 volunteers in the UK and Africa.

      MVA vector proved to be non-contagious and avirulent. Viral replication is blocked late
      during infection of cells but importantly viral and recombinant protein synthesis is
      unimpaired even during this abortive infection. Replication-deficient recombinant MVA has
      been viewed as an exceptionally safe viral vector. When tested in animal model studies
      recombinant MVAs have been shown to be avirulent, yet protectively immunogenic as vaccines
      against viral diseases and cancer. Recent studies in macaques severely immuno-suppressed by
      SIV infection have further supported the view that MVA should be safe in immuno-compromised
      humans.

      Simian adenoviruses have not been used previously in a clinical trial in humans. However,
      they are under active development as vaccines for HIV, (by GSK), and for HCV, (Merck).
