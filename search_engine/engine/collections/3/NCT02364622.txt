      remains a great challenge for anesthesiologists. Although new upper airway devices, such as
      flexible Trachway (R), a video-assisted intubating stylet, had been developed for
      facilitating airway management, the larger size and the complexity of DLT makes the
      difficulties for accurate placement of DLT blindly. Therefore, the investigators designed
      this study to investigate the effects of flexibleTrachway(R) intubating stylet in the
      placement of left-sided DLT in the trachea.
