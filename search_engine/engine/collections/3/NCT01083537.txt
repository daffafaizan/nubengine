      prospective randomized control trials evaluating the impact of defined multidisciplinary
      treatment arms (surgical, chemotherapeutic, supportive care approaches) on important clinical
      outcomes including resolution of bowel obstruction, survival endpoints and validated quality
      of life outcomes. In order to improve patient outcomes, we must define which patients will
      benefit from palliative surgery, which patients are appropriate candidates for chemotherapy
      and which patients will benefit most from best supportive care. This study will determine the
      safety, feasibility of chemotherapy and BSC in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
      presenting with MBO who are initially deemed non-surgical candidates and will identify the
      impact of chemotherapy and BSC on quality of life and resolution of bowel obstruction, in
      preparation for future prospective randomized studies to determine the optimal management of
      MBO.
