      Primary

      Compare the biochemical relapse free survival (DFS) of patients with prostate cancer treated
      with hypofractionated regimens 70 Gy in 28 fractions and 60 Gy in 20 fractions
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using helical Tomotherapy.

      Secondary

      Compare time to local progression, freedom from biochemical recurrence, and disease-specific
      and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      Determine the incidence of gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxic effects in patients
      treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to TNM ( T1-3N0M0),
      Gleason score (6,7 (3+4), 7(4+3), 8). Before radiotherapy patients receive hormone therapy
      from 3 months to 6 months. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm 1 hypofractionated dosing 28 fractions x 2,5 Gy over 38 days (prostate 28 x 2,5Gy - 70Gy,
      seminal vesicles 28 x 2Gy - 56 Gy, node lympaticus ( if Rouch formula> 15% or N1) 28 x 1,8 Gy
      - 50,4 Gy).

      Arm II hypofractionated dosing 20 fractions x 3 Gy over 26day (prostate 20 x 3Gy - 60Gy,
      seminal vesicles 20 x 2,5Gy - 50 Gy, node lympaticus ( if if Rouch formula> 15% or N1 ) 20 x
      2,2 Gy - 44 Gy).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
