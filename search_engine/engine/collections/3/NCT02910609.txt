      and birth weight, is one of the the most common conditions among preterm infants.

      In recent years, the use of antenatal steroids, postnatal surfactant, noninvasive ventilation
      strategies and low oxygen saturation targets have affected the incidence of hemodynamically
      significant PDA (HSPDA). There is not any consensus about the best approach on the clinical
      management of PDA in preterm infants. Over past years, the management of HSPDA shifted to
      aggressive medical and surgical intervention from conservative treatment, but conservative
      treatment approach has been mainly concerned again nowadays.

      Today, the three options for the treatment of PDA in preterm infants are conservative
      approach, pharmacological intervention and surgical ligation. There is not any
      randomized-controlled trial that demonstrates the superiority of these approaches in preterm
      infants. Many countries including developed countries only give recommendations, instead of
      publishing guidelines, on screening, timing of treatment and treatment choices of PDA,
      because of the differences on management of PDA between the centers even within a single
      center.

      Timing of PDA treatment and treatment choices at preterm infants born before 28 gestation
      weeks' differ in our country also in many countries over the world. In this study, it is
      aimed to record the managements of PDA detected beyond postnatal 3 days, to compare the
      effects of the managements at postnatal 3-7 days and after 7 days on closure, surgical
      ligation rates and side effects of drugs.
