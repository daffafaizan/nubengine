    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose for the combination of TAS-102 and nanoliposomal
      irinotecan (nanoliposomal [nal]-IRI). (Phase I)

      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of TAS102 and nal-IRI in previously treated
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of TAS-102 and nal-IRI.

      II. Evaluate the response duration, progression free, and overall survival of the combination
      of TAS-102 and nal-IRI in previously treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and
      pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive nanoliposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 and
      trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 8 or
      12 weeks thereafter.
