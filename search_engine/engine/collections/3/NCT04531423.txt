      cytokines such as TNF-Î±, finally alleviating depressive symptoms in TRD.

      Primary objective: This study was designed to address the role of PKC-mediated microglial
      activation in the clinical outcome of first episode depression.

      Secondary objective: To illustrate the impact of PKC-mediated microglial activation on
      impaired cognition, social function and neuronal plasticity.

      The investigators adopted randomized design to test placebo-controlled antidepressant
      augmentation. Patients were randomized (1:1) into one of the following 2groups: "SSRI
      +golimumab"," or "SSRI +placebo". The total study duration is 12 weeks
