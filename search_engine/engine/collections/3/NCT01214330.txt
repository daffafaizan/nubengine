      convenient and private way to collect samples and ship them to a laboratory for processing.
      The current study is pilot/pre-cursor study for a larger subsequent study that aims to
      determine whether SoloPap is truly noninferior to clinician-collected Pap smears in detecting
      cervical pathology. It will also determine user preference and willingness to perform a self-
      test.
