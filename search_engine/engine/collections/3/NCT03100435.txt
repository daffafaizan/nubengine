      decontamination with Er:YAG laser and carbon fiber curette.

      In the first phase of the study, custom mouth guards that holds multiple titanium discs will
      be fabricated. Experimental subjects will be instructed to wear this mouth guard for 72
      hours, during which time a natural bacterial biofilm will form on the disc surfaces.

      The second phase of the study will be performed ex vivo after collecting the discs from the
      subjects. Discs retrieved from each mouth guard will be randomized over the 4 treatment
      groups, so that each subject will contribute two discs to each treatment group: 1) Er:YAG
      laser, 2) carbon fiber curette, 3) combination of carbon fiber curette and Er:YAG laser, and
      4) no treatment (control). The biofilm will be stained and the residual biofilm will be
      visualized under fluorescence microscopy. Statistical methods will be used to determine the
      significance of each treatment modality.

      The primary outcome of the study is the percent area of the titanium disc covered by biofilm.
