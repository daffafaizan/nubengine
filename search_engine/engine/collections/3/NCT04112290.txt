    
      Adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and without known atrial fibrillation or
      pacemaker/implantable cardiac defibrillation will undergo implantable loop recorder
      implantation. No direct interventions will be performed. Prospective observation of atrial
      and ventricular arrhythmia incidence and burden will be assessed, with additional analyses
      performed based on the presence or absence of obstructive sleep apnea.
