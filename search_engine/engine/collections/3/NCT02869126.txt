      abnormalities of stress and rest myocardial perfusion. This examination can be performed with
      semiconductor gamma cameras that are more performant than conventional cameras regarding
      spatial resolution, detection sensitivity and energy resolution.

      The amelioration of energy resolution could allow the realization of simultaneous recordings
      of a dye injected at rest and another injected during stress (double isotope recording),
      while conventional examination needs 2 different recordings, stress and rest, separated from
      several hours.

      In this study patients undergo a conventional examination with D.SPECT camera with 2
      recordings, the first after injection of a little activity of 99mTc-sestamibi at stress (≤
      100 MBq) and the second, 2 hours later, after injection at rest of a 3 time bigger activity
      of 99mTc-sestamibi (≤ 300 MBq). An activity of thallium-201(≤ 50 MBq) is injected at rest
      after the first recording of stress. 5 minutes later, a supplementary double isotope
      recording is realized with D.SPECT camera (99mTc-Sestamibi-stress / thallium201-rest).

      The demonstration of the hypothesis of this study could considerably diminish the duration of
      the examination (from 3 to 4 hours to less than 1 hour).
