    
      A prospective registry of patients undergoing clinically indicated coronary angiography with
      fractional flow reserve evaluation for vessels with intermediate coronary lesions defined as
      visual diameter stenosis between 30% and 70%. A motorized fractional flow reservepullback
      evaluation will be performed at the discretion of the operators. The objective of the present
      study is to describe the physiological patterns of coronary artery disease using motorized
      coronary pressure pullbacks during continuous hyperemia in patients with stable coronary
      artery disease.
