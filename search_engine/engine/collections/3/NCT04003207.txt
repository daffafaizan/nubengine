    
      BACKGROUND: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a genetic form of autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) associated with developmental delay and hypotonia. IGF-1 promotes brain vessel growth,
      neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis.

      The research team previous clinical trial of IGF-1 in patients with Phelan McDermid Syndrome
      has shown improvement in core ASD symptoms using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and
      the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). Growth hormone (GH) binds to its receptor and
      initiates a cascade of events which directly increases synthesis and release of IGF-1 levels.
      HYPOTHESIS: The study team hypothesize that rise in IGF-1 stimulated by growth hormone (GH)
      administration should produce improvement in behavior in children and adolescents with PMS as
      previously demonstrated with use of IGF-1.

      RESEARCH PLAN: The study team seek to recruit 10 patients with PMS and administer growth
      hormone as once daily subcutaneous injections for 12 weeks at standard doses. The study team
      will monitor baseline anthropometric measures, laboratory parameters for growth, IGF-1
      levels, and bone age prior to therapy and continue to monitor safety laboratory parameters
      during and after therapy. The goal of therapy would be to maintain IGF-1 levels between 1-2SD
      above the mean for age and puberty. Evaluations will include validated behavioral scales.
      Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) will be used as biomarkers of visual sensory reactivity.
