      following abdominal imaging. Traditionally, experts have recommended that complex cystic
      lesions (also known as Bosniak III - IV cysts) should be surgically removed, but recent
      evidences suggest that many are benign or have low metastatic potential. Thus, active
      surveillance which involves close follow-up of a patient's condition, was proposed as a
      tradeoff option to surgery.

      Design: Multicenter observational longitudinal prospective cohort study

      Objectives: The goal of this multicenter project is to conduct a prospective study with a
      5-year follow-up to confirm the oncologic outcomes of active surveillance in the management
      of complex cysts. The main objectives are: 1) to compare the 5-year cancer specific survival
      between cysts managed by surgery and active surveillance; 2) to evaluate disease progression;
      3) to evaluate patient's well-being according to each management strategy; and 4) to compare
      the 5-year healthcare cost of both management approaches.

      Study population: Patients incidentally diagnosed with a Bosniak III and/or IV cysts, who are
      deemed to have at least 5 years of life, and who opted to be managed by either surgery or
      active surveillance. (N=330)

      Follow-up: Patients will DECIDE if they want to have a surgery or to be followed by active
      surveillance. All patients will be followed as per standard of care with either semi-annual
      and annual visits. Research visits will serve to evaluate vital status and quality of life
      scores (through validated questionnaires). Patients on active surveillance will also be
      assessed for cyst progression and will be offered invasive or systemic therapy if progression
      is observed.
