      15-month study is to determine the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in improving
      memory and the ability to live independently in postmenopausal women with Alzheimer's disease
      and without other dementias.

      Patients who volunteer for this study will either receive a patch containing 17-ÃŸ-estradiol
      or will receive an inactive placebo patch. In addition, patients will be given either
      medroxyprogesterone or an inactive placebo pill. Neither the volunteers nor the study staff
      will know which type of patch or pill a patient receives. Patients must be generally healthy
      and have mild-to-moderate dementia. There must be a patient caregiver who can watch for side
      effects and ensure that the patient takes the study medications on schedule. Patients will
      undergo neuropsychological tests and an evaluation of the ability to live independently at
      each visit as well as laboratory evaluations, such as the taking of blood. Each visit will
      last approximately 3 hours. A total of 160 participants are being recruited.
