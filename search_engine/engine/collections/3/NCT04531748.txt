    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects
      of a 14 day intervention of toremifene plus melatonin or melatonin in adults with mild
      COVID-19.

      The study will evaluate the progression of clinical signs and symptoms (fever, dyspnea,
      cough, fatigue daily score) and any adverse outcomes in comparison to placebo for 30 days.

      The successful completion of this project offers high potential to identify effective
      treatment (e.g., toremifene plus melatonin and/or melatonin) rapidly for patients with early
      COVID-19 and to provide, important, fundamental mechanistic insights.
