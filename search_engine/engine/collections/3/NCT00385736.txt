      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody
      adalimumab for the induction of clinical remission in participants with moderately to
      severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

      Adult participants with moderate to severe UC (Mayo score of 6 to 12 points with endoscopy
      subscore of 2 to 3 points), confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy or by flexible sigmoidoscopy
      with biopsy, were enrolled at 80 sites worldwide. The study enrolled 576 participants,
      including 186 participants under the original protocol and protocol Amendments 1 and 2, and
      390 participants under protocol Amendments 3 and 4.

      Participants enrolled in the study prior to Amendment 3 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive adalimumab or placebo during the 12-week DB induction period. Participants received 4
      injections of adalimumab 40 mg (160 mg) or 4 injections of placebo at Baseline (Week 0),
      followed by 2 injections of adalimumab 40 mg (80 mg) or 2 injections of placebo at Week 2,
      followed by 1 injection of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo at Weeks 4 and 6. At Week 8,
      participants randomized to placebo received 4 injections of adalimumab 40 mg (160 mg)
      followed by 2 injections of adalimumab 40 mg (80 mg) at Week 10. Participants randomized to
      adalimumab received 3 injections of placebo and 1 injection of adalimumab 40 mg at Week 8 and
      1 injection of placebo and 1 injection of adalimumab 40 mg at Week 10. All participants
      continued to receive 1 injection of open-label (OL) adalimumab 40 mg every other week
      beginning at Week 12 up to Week 52 (or the early termination visit). Starting at Week 14,
      participants who had inadequate responses to treatment (as defined using partial Mayo scores)
      were permitted to dose escalate to adalimumab 40 mg weekly. Participants with persistent
      inadequate response while on weekly treatment could be discontinued from the study at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      In August 2007, the study design was amended to incorporate an additional adalimumab
      induction dosing arm of 80/40 mg. Earlier that year, both 160/80-mg and 80/40-mg induction
      regimens had been approved in the EU as induction treatment for Crohn's disease. The
      adalimumab induction dosing regimen of 80/40 mg was therefore included so that both of these
      approved induction regimens would be evaluated for the induction of remission of UC.

      Participants enrolled in the study after Amendment 3 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive adalimumab (1 of 2 regimens) or placebo during the 8-week DB induction period.
      Participants received DB therapy from Baseline until Week 8 and OL therapy from Week 8 until
      the end of the study. In the first adalimumab dosing arm (adalimumab 80/40), participants
      received 2 injections of adalimumab 40 mg (80 mg) and 2 injections of placebo at Baseline
      followed by 1 injection of adalimumab 40 mg and 1 injection of placebo at Week 2, and 1
      injection of adalimumab 40 mg every other week thereafter. In the second adalimumab DB
      induction dosing arm (adalimumab 160/80), participants received 4 injections of adalimumab 40
      mg (160 mg) at Baseline followed by 2 injections of adalimumab 40 mg (80 mg) at Week 2, and 1
      injection of adalimumab 40 mg every other week thereafter. Participants randomized to placebo
      received 4 injections of placebo at Baseline followed by 2 injections of placebo at Week 2,
      and 1 injection of placebo at Weeks 4 and 6. Beginning at Week 8, but after the Week 8 study
      assessments had been completed, all participants received 1 injection of OL adalimumab 40 mg
      every other week until Week 52 or early termination. Starting at Week 12, participants who
      had inadequate responses to treatment (as defined using partial Mayo scores) were permitted
      to dose escalate to adalimumab 40 mg weekly. Participants with persistent inadequate response
      while on weekly treatment could be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      For the analysis of efficacy parameters during the DB Period through Week 8, only
      participants randomized under Protocol Amendment 3 or later were considered ("Efficacy
      Analysis Set - Induction" in the participant flow). For the analysis of efficacy parameters
      during the OL Period through Week 52, all randomized participants (under any version of the
      protocol) who received at least 1 dose of study drug were considered ("Efficacy Analysis Set
      - Maintenance" in the participant flow). For the analysis of safety parameters, all
      participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug were considered ("Safety Analysis
      Set" in the participant flow).

      Twelve ranked secondary variables during the DB Period through Week 8 were to be tested in a
      hierarchical order to account for multiple testing. These variables are identified as "Ranked
      Secondary Endpoints" in the results section below. Additionally, non-ranked secondary
      variables during the OL Period through Week 52 were tested and are presented after the ranked
      secondary endpoints in the results section below.
