      disease. GSK2434735 is a bispecific antibody to IL-13 and IL-4. The purpose of this open
      label, sequential cohort, exploratory First Time in Human (FTIH) study is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of GSK2434735 after a single low intravenous or subcutaneous
      dose in healthy male volunteers, and to assess if the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters can be
      scaled from monkey to man. In addition, the safety and tolerability will be monitored and the
      study will assess if antibodies are generated to GSK2434735.
