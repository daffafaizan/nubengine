    
      METHODS OF RECRUITING THE SUBJECTS Healthy subjects, individuals with type 1 and type 2
      diabetes and those who are at risk of developing diabetes will be enrolled. Enrollment was
      approved by the University of Florida Ethics Committee within the NPOD project, Network for
      the Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes.

      Duration of the study: 5 years.

      EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:

      The following analyses will be performed on the collected and received samples:

        -  Study of TMEM219 expression and of other TMEM219-related markers by immunohistochemistry
           and immunofluorescence and western blot

        -  Study of TMEM219 expression and of other TMEM219-related markers by molecular biology
           analysis

        -  Analysis of the proteomic profile on collected biological liquids The above analyses
           will be performed at the Pediatric Clinical Research Center Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi
           at the Sacco Hospital - University of Milan.

      PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES The investigatore expertise in manipulating / studying the signaling
      involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes has been widely recognized in several
      publications in recent years (Diabetes 2013, Diabetes 2014, Diabetes 2015, Science
      Translational Medicine 2017) as well as the characterization of marker expression including
      TMEM219 (Cell Stem Cell 2015).

      RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY The study offers the possibility to acquire new information on the
      pathogenesis of diabetes and to identify new target mechanisms for designing innovative
      therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes.
