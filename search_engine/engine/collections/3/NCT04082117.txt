    
      African American (AA) women with a family history of breast cancer who are eligible for
      genetic counseling and express an interest in participating in the study will be consented
      and complete a brief survey before and after viewing an educational video on genetic
      counseling. Survey questions will be read to each participant. The questions capture data on
      the following constructs regarding genetic counseling: knowledge, attitudes, normative
      beliefs, motivation, perceived social norms, intention, efficacy beliefs, skills,
      environmental constraints and opinions on the video. The research team will conduct a review
      of the UI Health Electronic Medical Record (EMR) 3-6 months after study enrollment to
      determine if the participant attended a genetic counseling session.
