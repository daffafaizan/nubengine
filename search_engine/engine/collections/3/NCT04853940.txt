    
      PURPOSE: To evaluate post-ICU clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 ICU survivors.

      DESIGN: A prospective observational study conducted in public hospital in Madrid, Spain.

      METHODS:

      Participants: patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 who have survived ICU admission for
      invasive mechanical ventilation and have been discharged from hospital.

      Intervention: Patients will be invited to attend follow-up visits at the hospital for
      assessments 3 months and 6 months after ICU discharge.

      Outcome measures: Tests of respiratory muscles function will include ultrasonography of the
      diaphragm muscle to measure diaphragm thickness (DT), diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) and
      diaphragm excursion (DE); respiratory muscle strength measurement to obtain Maximal
      Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) and Maximal Sniff Nasal
      Inspiratory Pressure (SNIP); functional exercise capacity will be assessed with the Six
      Minutes Walk Test (6MWT); dyspnea and health-related quality of life will be evaluated with
      the Modified Medical Research Council Scale (mMRC Scale) and the Saint George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ). Data on participants' demographics and clinical data will also be
      collected.

      Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise data. Spearman's
      correlation coefficients will be used to explore associations between variables.

      CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH: Understanding post-ICU clinical outcomes in
      patients with severe COVID-19 may help develop future prevention, therapeutic and follow-up
      strategies that improve quality of care and outcomes
