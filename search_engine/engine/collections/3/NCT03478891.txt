      Human Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-EBOMAB092-00-AB (MAb114), Administered Intravenously to
      Healthy Adults

      Study Design: VRC 608 is the first-in-human Phase I study to examine safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of the monoclonal antibody (MAb), VRC-EBOMAB092-00-AB (MAb114). MAb114 will
      be administered as a single dose. The hypotheses are: 1) MAb114 administration to healthy
      adults will be safe by the intravenous (IV) route; and 2) MAb114 will be detectable in human
      sera with a definable half-life. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MAb114 in healthy adults. Secondary objectives will evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of MAb114 and the potential to detect an anti-drug antibody response to
      MAb114.

      Product Description: MAb114 is a human IgG1 MAb targeted to the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV)
      glycoprotein (GP). It was developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH and manufactured at Cook Pharmica
      LLC d.b.a. Catalent Indiana, LLC (Bloomington, IN) under current Good Manufacturing Practice
      (cGMP) regulations. MAb114 is supplied as a lyophilized product in a glass vial at 400 mg per
      vial with target overfill to 425 mg per vial.

      Subjects: Up to 30 healthy adults, 18-60 years of age.

      Study Plan: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of MAb114 administered by IV
      infusion at dosages of 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg (Groups 1-3). Enrollment will begin with the lowest
      dose group. Following the first product administration in each group, the study team will
      wait at least 3 days before administering MAb114 to a second subject within the same group.
      Dose-escalation evaluations will occur to ensure the safety data support proceeding to the
      higher doses. Solicited reactogenicity following product administration will be evaluated
      using a 3-day diary. Assessment of safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of
      serum hematological and chemical parameters at defined timepoints throughout the study.

        -  Group 1: 3 subjects; 5 mg/kg IV

        -  Group 2: 5 subjects; 25 mg/kg IV

        -  Group 3: 10 subjects; 50 mg/kg IV

        -  Total* 18 subjects

             -  A minimum of 18 subjects will be enrolled. Enrollment up to a total of 30 subjects
                is permitted if additional subjects are necessary for safety or pharmacokinetic
                (PK) evaluations.

      Study Duration: Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks after the study product
      administration.
