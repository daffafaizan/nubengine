      gynecologist or urologist will make the diagnosis. Central randomization will be performed by
      the Clinical Evaluation Center of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing.

      Sample size: Sample size is based on the primary outcome. According to literature, the
      investigators predict that MUI patient's average 72-h incontinence episode frequency of the
      week 1-12 will decrease by 60% from the baseline after treatment of PFMT plus solifenacin.
      The number of the acupuncture group is 57%. For the assessment of noninferiority, 250
      participants will be needed for each group allowing for a 15% dropout (α=0.05，β=0.2，δ=15%).

      Quality control: A 3-level monitoring system (monitors responsible for one center, monitors
      responsible for all centers and monitors responsible for the whole trial) will be established
      to check the performance of the trial in time. Outcome assessment, completion of case report
      forms and data management will be under strict supervision.

      Data management: The Remote Dara Capture (RDC) system will be used for data entering. Both
      paper and electronic case report form will be reserved. A data verification plan is made.
