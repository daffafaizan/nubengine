      (XR-NTX) for treatment of opioid use disorder in HIV primary care. The CTN-0067 CHOICES
      scale-up study builds on lessons learned from the pilot and uses the Consolidated Framework
      for Implementation Research to advance understanding of XR-NTX adoption in HIV primary care
      clinics. The study is an open-label, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial of
      office-based XR-NTX for 24 weeks (6 monthly injections) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in
      HIV-infected participants with untreated opioid use disorder. Each participant will be
      engaged in the overall study for 25 to 28 weeks, depending on the speed of screening and
      enrollment procedures.
