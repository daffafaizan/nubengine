      (chemo) versus T alone followed by the addition of chemo at disease progression has not been
      properly studied.

      The trial compared efficacy, toxicity and quality of life of sequential administration of T
      followed, at progression, by combination with chemo (T>TChemo) versus the upfront combination
      of T and chemo (TChemo) in patients with HER2+ advanced breast cancer.
