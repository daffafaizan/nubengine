      ocular diseases. The introduction of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has enabled
      clinicians to reliably detect small changes in macular thickness and to quantitatively
      evaluate the efficacy of different therapeutic modalities. In this study using the spectral
      domain-OCT, we examined the variations of macular retinal thickness and macular volume in
      normal eyes and in eyes with various ocular diseases.
