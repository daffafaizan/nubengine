      Depression is a common disease mostly treated in general practice. Diagnose and evidence
      based treatment in general practice today is not optimal (e.g. lack of continuity in disease
      management and lack of treatment opportunities).

      International studies show effect of collaborative care on depression, but is not directly
      applicable into a Danish context.

      A Danish model for collaborative care treatment of people with depression, generalized
      anxiety disorder, social phobia and panic disorder (the Collabri Model) is developed. The
      Collabri model consists of a multi-professional approach to treatment, scheduled monitoring
      and review, enhanced inter-professional communication and a structured treatment plan.

      Objectives:

      to investigate the effect of the Collabri model for depression and further investigate two
      methods for detection of depression; standard detection and case finding.

      Methods:

      Two researcher-blinded cluster-randomized controlled studies with an intervention group
      (treatment according to the Collabri model) and a control group (TAU). Participants are 480
      patients with depression consulting their general practitioner.

      Results:

      Primary outcome for the collaborative care study on depression is depression symptoms,
      measured with BDI at 6 months.

      Discussion:

      The results will contribute new knowledge on collaborative care for depression and anxiety in
      Danish conditions.
