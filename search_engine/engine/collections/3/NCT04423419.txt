      every year , due to the widening range of indications, as femoroacetabular impingement,
      labral tears, chondral injuries, loose bodies, osteonecrosis and septic arthritis Pain after
      hip arthroscopy due to several factors. divided in two regions. First the intra-articular
      where pain originates from the joint capsule (capsulotomy), a repaired labrum or bony
      resection. Outside the joint caused by traction, the portal tracts and extravasation of
      irrigation , soft tissue swelling.

      the hip joint found to be innervated from the femoral nerve for its anterior part, the
      obturator nerve for its antero-medial part, the sciatic nerve for its posterior part, and the
      nerve to the quadratus femoris muscle for its postero-medial par

      Pericapsular Nerve Group (PENG) Block aims to block the articular branches of the accessory
      obturator and femoral nerve Also, it could spread to block the obturator nerve and its
      articular branches the high articular branches from FN and AON are found between the anterior
      inferior iliac spine(AIIS) and the ilio pubic eminence (IPE), whereas the ON is located close
      to the inferomedial acetabulum.

      The fascia iliaca compartment is a virtual space anteriorly limited by the posterior surface
      of the fascia iliaca, posteriorly by the iliacus muscle and is cranially in continuation with
      the space between quadratus lumborum muscle and its fascia . Three important nerves for hip
      innervation are located in this space, the femoral nerve, obturator nerve and lateral femoral
      cutaneous nerve
