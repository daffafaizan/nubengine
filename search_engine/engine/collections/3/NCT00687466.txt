      by a condition defined as glucose intolerance, during which a significant decay of patient's
      general conditions is observed. A slow release insulin (glargine) has become available in the
      market for diabetic patients: its characteristics allow for a single daily dose, and no need
      of repeated daily monitoring of glycemia.

      In this randomized controlled clinical trial we evaluate whether the anticipated use of
      glargine in CF patients with glucose intolerance may prevent the worsening of nutritional
      status and pulmonary function.

      Eligible patients who will accept to participate to this study will be randomly allocated in
      the group who will or will not receive glargine as additional supportive therapy. Patients
      will in any case continue the CF therapy prescribed by their treating physicians and their
      usual diet. All the patients will be evaluated every three months to assess their
      nutritional, pulmonary and glycometabolic status. The follow-up will continue until the 18th
      month after the study entry.
