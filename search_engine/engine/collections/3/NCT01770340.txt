    
      In this prospective randomised and single-blind, clinical phase-IV study, 60 patients are
      randomized into the treatment group and the control group. The follow-up is at least 24
      months.

      The inclusion criteria were localized prostate cancers cT3 and/or Gleason score ≥ 7 (a or b)
      and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 20 ng/ml and furthermore an erectile function with
      an IIEF ≥ 21 (IIEF-6).

      The operation carried out is a standardised, robot assisted laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomy with total excision of both neurovascular bundles.

      The Outcome measurement is done with the "quality of life questionnaire before and after
      prostate surgery" that includes the "International Index of Erectile Function" (IIEF)
      questionnaire.

      The limitations are a small cohort, a short observation period and the lack of statistical
      analysis due to a still low number of patients.
