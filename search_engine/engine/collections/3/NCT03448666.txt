      of tumor-derived antigens by APCs to T-cells, particularly CD8+ antigen-specific T cells.
      Anti-PD-1 mAb reverts T-cell exhaustion induced by PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L2 engagement on CD8+ T
      cells. Moreover, it may also be beneficial in the priming phase of the antitumor immune
      responses, inducing long-lived tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell effectors.

      The main hypothesis is to establish if concomitant treatment of Pembrolizumab and ECT is able
      to lead to a 20% increase of the ORR using as a reference the proportion of success available
      in the literature for Pembrolizumab.

      The investigators will perform a proteomic analysis of sera of treated patients, collected
      before and after treatments, with particular emphasis on cytokines and chemokines, to
      evaluate possible markers associated with a better clinical outcome.
