    
      This is a Phase I, FIH, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, to evaluate the safety
      and PK of MEDI8367 as single ascending doses (SAD) in healthy subjects and as a single dose
      in healthy subjects of Japanese-descent and in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      Six cohorts, Cohorts 1 to 5 (healthy volunteers including Japanese subjects in Cohort 5) each
      consisting of 8 subjects (total 40 subjects), and Cohort 6 (subjects with CKD) consisting of
      30 subjects, will participate in the study. The starting dose is dose A of MEDI8367 with up
      to 3 dose escalations planned (provisional doses of dose B, dose C, and dose D).

      The study will comprise of:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;

        -  A Treatment Period during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical
           Unit/non-clinical sites from the day before investigational medicinal product (IMP)
           administration (Day -1) until at least 72 hours after IMP administration; discharged on
           Day 4; and

        -  A Follow-up Period (out-patient) with 8 visits; the final Follow-up Visit (Visit 10)
           within 90 Â± 4 days after the last IMP dose. The study day for the last visit may be
           adjusted based on PK/PD results from the current and previous cohorts.

      Dosing for Cohorts 1 to 4 and Cohort 6 will proceed with 2 subjects in a sentinel cohort,
      such that one subject will be randomized to receive MEDI8367 and one subject will be
      randomized to receive placebo. The blinded safety data from the sentinel subjects up to 3
      days post-dose will be reviewed by the site Principal Investigator (PI) before the remaining
      subjects in the cohort are dosed. Dosing is proposed to continue based on a lack of
      significant safety findings in the first 2 subjects dosed per cohort. The remaining 6
      subjects in Cohorts 1 to 4, respectively, and 28 subjects in Cohort 6, will be dosed at least
      3 days after the sentinel cohort.
