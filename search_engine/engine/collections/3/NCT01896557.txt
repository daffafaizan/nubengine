      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Age > 18 years old

        -  Coronary artery disease, defined as previous myocardial infarction and/or coronary
           angioplasty and/or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery and/or coronariography
           showing obstruction of at least 50 % in one of major epicardial vessels

        -  Treatment with Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) 100 mg/day

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Use in the last 7 days of oral anticoagulant or any other antiplatelet drug beside ASA

        -  Previous utilization of PPI or ranitidine in the last 7 days before randomization

        -  Active bleeding

        -  Pregnancy or woman of childbearing age without contraceptive method

        -  Hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or hematocrit < 30 %, hematocrit > 50 %, platelets < 100.000/mm3 or
           > 500.000/mm3; creatinin clearance < 50 ml/minute

        -  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the last 30 days before randomization (or
           PCI on the last year when drug-eluted stents are used); CABG surgery on the last 90
           days; acute coronary syndrome on the last 60 days

        -  Active malignant neoplasm

        -  Active peptic ulcer disease on the last 60 days or upper gastrointestinal bleeding any
           time in life

        -  Known allergy to the drugs clopidogrel, ranitidine or omeprazole

        -  Refuse to participate in the study]

      Methodology: The study has a double-blind, double-dummy prospective design. Clopidogrel
      action is evaluated by platelet function tests: VerifyNow, bioimpedance aggregometry and
      Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100). The patients have measurements of platelet function
      on three moments: before starting clopidogrel; 1 week after DAPT with clopidogrel (without
      loading dose) plus ASA; and after 1 week of randomization to ranitidin 150 mg bid or
      omeprazole 20 mg bid.
