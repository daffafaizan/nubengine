    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 20 patients with a diagnosis
      of stage I hypertension without DM2.

      They will be assigned randomly two groups of 10 patients each to receive 10 mg of
      Dapagliflozin (Forxiga, Astra Zeneca) or placebo, one per day before breakfast during 12
      weeks.

      There will be calculated indices of VBP: 24 h, daytime and night-time standard deviation
      (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), 24 h weighted SD, Day-to-nigth BP changes and average
      real variability (AVR). On the other hand, AASI will be calculated with a linear regression.

      This protocol it's already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed
      consent it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.

      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for
      variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2 o exact fisher test, will
      be used for differences inter-group. Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon Test for the
      within-groups differences. It will be considered statistical significance p â‰¤0.05.
