      acute renal allograft rejection rate and graft survival in renal transplant patients. Gengraf
      a microemulsion formulation of CsA though granted an AB-rated equivalent to Neoral, because
      of concerns over the use of generic drugs in transplantation, we undertook this study to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Gengraf.

      We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open labeled study to establish the equivalence
      between Gengraf and Neoral in stable renal transplant recipients for a treatment period of 6
      months. 6 months post transplant patients with stable graft function and receiving a stable
      dose of neoral were recruited into the study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to
      remain on Neoral or convert to an equal milligram-for-milligram dose of Gengraf. The primary
      end-point was serum creatinine at 26 weeks.
