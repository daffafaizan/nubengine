    
      This was a single-centre, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted in Canada to
      determine the feasibility and efficacy of an exercise and education "pre-habilitation" (i.e.,
      Prehab) program before elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). We recruited 17
      patients who were scheduled to undergo elective CABG surgery from February 2011-May 2012.
      Enrolled patients were assessed at baseline, one week pre-operatively, and three months
      post-operatively.
