3752. steroid excretion in early breast cancerpatients with advanced breast cancerwho subsequently fail to respond to adrenalec-tomy or hypophysectomy have beenfound to excrete abnormal amounts of theurinary metabolites of androgen andcortisol.  when similar measurements arecarried out on patients with early breastcancer, it is found that approximately halfthe cases presenting for mastectomy arealso excreting abnormal amounts of thesesteroids.  subsequent follow-up shows thatthese cases tend to have a poor progno-sis, and a trial had therefore been startedin which the abnormality is being cor-rected.  in addition, it seems possible thatthe deficiency in adrogen excretion mayprecede the onset of the disease.  thisproblem is being investigated in a trialinvolving urinary steroid estimations in5000 normal women.  the measurementsare being compared with the subsequentdevelopment of breast cancer.
