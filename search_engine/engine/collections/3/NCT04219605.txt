      level, microscopic examination and laboratory examinations (vaginal cultures and sexually
      transmitted infections).

      One additional sample will be taken intended for the Gyniâ„¢ system diagnosis. This additional
      examination will be performed in the clinic by pulling the cytobrush through a dedicated
      cartridge and scanning it in the Gyni table-top scanner. The result diagnosis will be
      anonymously kept in the cloud.

      The diagnosis suggested by the Gyni system will not be visible to the physician in order to
      prevent any bias. Results from the physician, from the device and from the lab will be
      summarized and compared by the chief investigator
