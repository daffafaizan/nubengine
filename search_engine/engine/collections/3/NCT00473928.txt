      fifty-five years of age that live in the industrialized world. It affects 5-10 million people
      in the US and as many as 30 million worldwide. There are two forms of the disease, both of
      which cause a loss of central vision. Approximately eighty-five percent of patients have the
      less severe dry form that produces gradual but rarely complete vision loss. The remaining
      fifteen percent have the severe wet, or exudative, form that causes rapid, disabling
      blindness. Wet AMD is further characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a growth
      under the macula of abnormal blood vessels originating from the choroidal capillary bed.
      Research has linked chronic inflammation to both forms of AMD.

      Only recently, unrestrained complement activation was identified in genetic studies to be one
      of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AMD. It has also been demonstrated that
      complement activation plays a crucial role in the development of CNV. Therefore, the use of
      intravitreal complement inhibitors may be beneficial in participants subjects with
      neovascular AMD.

      This prospective, uncontrolled, non-randomized, dose-escalating, pilot Phase I study will
      provide initial safety and tolerability information on intravitreal complement inhibitor
      (POT-4) therapy in AMD patients with subfoveal CNV.
