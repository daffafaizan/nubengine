      without sufficient understanding of its likely risks and benefits. In surveys, many patients
      receive palliative chemotherapy without expressing an understanding that cure is unlikely.

      The root of this problem is undoubtedly complex, but may relate to gaps in communication and
      patient education about the risks and benefits of treatment. Patients are routinely asked to
      sign an "informed consent" document prior to starting chemotherapy, indicating they
      understand the risks and benefits of treatment. Although this could be a strategic moment to
      equip patients with information they need to make truly informed medical decisions, many
      patients and caregivers note that these conversations are less useful than they could be. The
      informed consent process and its associated documents suffer several limitations: 1) risks
      are emphasized over benefits; 2) educational materials focus on individual drugs instead of
      regimens; 3) information is presented in written instead of alternative written/audiovisual
      format; and 4) the patient perspective is lacking.

      The overarching objective of this trial is to test a suite of patient-centered videos and
      booklets to support informed consent for common chemotherapy regimens used to treat advanced
      gastrointestinal cancers. In this study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, locally
      advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer considering treatment with first or second-line
      palliative chemotherapy were randomized to the usual process of chemotherapy informed
      consent, or usual care supplemented by access to the appropriate investigational chemotherapy
      informed consent video and booklet. Patients were surveyed at baseline, 2-weeks
      post-treatment initiation, and 3 months regarding their understanding of chemotherapy risks
      and benefits, decisional conflict, and other metrics of informed decision-making.
