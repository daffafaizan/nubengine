      care to receiving a cochlear implant. There will be no interference with this process in any
      way. Those patients that are unfortunate to be affected by facial nerve stimulation following
      receiving their cochlear implant however will be contacted and with the aim to help improve
      their symptoms as indicated in prior animal studies
