    
      INTRECIS is a prospective multicenter registry using data from 60 centres in the North China.
      Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who are treated with intravenous rtPA,
      urokinase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in 60 centres of the North China will be eligible
      for this registry. Patient involvement in the registry shall not influence any treatment
      decision. Patients will undergo a complete diagnostic work up including a clinical
      neurological examination using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score,
      laboratory examination, brain and neurovascular imaging, echocardiography, 24-hours ECG.
      Clinical outcome will be evaluated on day 1 and day 14 using the National Institute of Health
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, evaluated at 3 months using modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) and
      assessing adverse events. The proportion of patients with excellent outcome (mRS 0 to 1) at 3
      months after treatment will serve as the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures will
      include independent functional outcome (mRS 0 to 2), changes in NIHSS at 1 and 14 day
      compared with baseline, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, recurrent stroke and all-cause
      mortality.
