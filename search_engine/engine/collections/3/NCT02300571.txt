      many hematological malignancies. In allogeneic HCT the donor immune system through the donor
      lymphocytes exerts both a beneficial and detrimental effect. Graft versus host disease (GVHD)
      represents the major complication and cause of mortality of allogeneic HCT. The principal aim
      that clinical transplant research must accomplish in the next years is to elaborate a
      transplant strategy devoid of any GVHD but still capable of generating, through donor
      lymphocytes, the graft versus tumor effect (GVT). The most used GVHD prophylaxis regimen
      remains the association of a calcineurin-inhibitor (CNIs) for six months and four low-doses
      of methotrexate (MTX) but the long length prophylaxis impacts on the process of
      post-transplant immune reconstitution slowing it down and exposing patients to a high risk of
      developing severe infections. The use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide looks the most
      promising among the new approaches to GVHD control. The study design is an observational
      retrospective/prospective Study in Patients Eligible to Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplant using Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) from unrelated or related, HLA-identical
      or partially mismatched donors. In case of unrelated donor, donor selection will be done
      accordingly to Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (IBMDR). This protocol and the treatment
      plan outlined below are limited to the plan or GVHD prevention.

      The treatment plan for all patients including pre-conditioning therapy, TBI/chemotherapy,
      central nervous system prophylaxis and other planned therapies, is described in the primary
      transplant protocols which the patient has been assigned by the investigational site.
