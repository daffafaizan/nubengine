      I. To determine if mixed hematopoietic chimerism can be safely established using a
      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients > 65 years of age with chronic myeloid
      leukemia (CML) in chronic or accelerated phase who have human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      identical related donors.

      II. To determine if mixed chimerism, established with non-myeloablative conditioning
      regimens, can be converted to full donor hematopoietic chimerism by infusions of donor
      lymphocytes (DLI), and thereby produce an immunologic cure of the malignancy.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      (PBSCT) on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV BID or
      thrice daily (TID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 77 or 180, and mycophenolate mofetil PO
      or IV BID on days 0-27.

      DLI: At least 2 weeks after completion of immunosuppression, patients with > 5% donor cluster
      of differentiation (CD)3+ T cells and no evidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) receive
      donor lymphocytes IV over 30 minutes. Patients may receive up to 3 DLIs at increasing cell
      doses in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
