      There is laboratory evidence for an immune mechanism and most patients respond to
      corticosteroids. However the relapse and failure rate are high, and corticosteroids are
      associated with many short and long term side effects. Patients who do not respond or who do
      not tolerate corticosteriods require lifelong red blood cell transfusion and iron chelation
      therapy. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is an option for those with a related
      histocompatible donor, but this procedure is associated with high mortality and morbidity.
      Other therapies have been tried without general success. Occasional responses to either ATG
      or cyclosporine have been reported, but no study has used both ATG and cyclosporine. In other
      blood/bone marrow disorders of immune etiology these drugs have synergistic effects. We
      propose a Phase II study to explore the combined use of ATG and cyclosporine as a rational
      approach to the treatment of Diamond Blackfan anemia.
