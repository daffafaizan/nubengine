      consecutive single-dose treatment periods. The washout period between doses was to be at
      least 14 days. On each treatment period, after completion of pre-dose assessments, BIA
      9-1067/Placebo was to be administered concomitantly with the dose of SinemetÂ® 100/25;
      post-dose assessments were to be completed and subjects were to be discharged 72 h post-dose.
      Subjects were to attend four treatment periods and were to receive a different dose of BIA
      9-1067 (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) or placebo during each of these treatment periods.
