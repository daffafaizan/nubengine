    
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 using a centralized randomization software, assuring
      concealment, with a minimization program controlling for the following factors:

        -  Histological subgroups: leiomyosarcoma versus synovial sarcoma versus other histological
           subtype

        -  Response to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy: partial response versus stable disease

        -  Centers

      The treatment will be administrated as long as it appears beneficial. Evaluations will be
      made every 8 weeks until 6 months and then every 3 months
