      DRF is surgery with volar plating using the modified Henry's approach. In some cases the
      fracture mechanism has injured the PQ muscle and subsequent reconstruction of the muscle can
      be difficult. When the PQ muscle is not injured the plate is fixated through a radial and
      distal release of the PQ muscle and resuture/repair of the PQ muscle is attempted by most
      surgeons.

      The clinical relevance of repairing the PQ muscle has not previously been investigated in a
      randomised clinical trial and we hypothesise that there is no difference in functional
      outcome whether the PQ muscle is repaired or not.
