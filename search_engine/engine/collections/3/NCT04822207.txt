      recurrent implantation failure. In order to explore the effect of acupuncture on the clinical
      outcome of IVF-ET in patients with recurrent implantation failure, the patients divide into
      the experimental group or the control group. In the experimental group, those patients
      undergo acupuncture at the beginning of embryo transfer cycle three times a week until 14
      days after embryo transfer. In the control group, those patients do not receive any
      treatments during embryo transfer cycle. Both of two group patients are checked including
      endometrial receptivity index and fill in SAS anxiety scale form. Statistical analysis of the
      two groups of primary endpoint (clinical pregnancy rate) and secondary endpoint (embryo
      implantation rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, early pregnancy loss rate, ongoing pregnancy
      rate, live birth rate)are done.
