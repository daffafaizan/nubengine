    
      Research volunteers are seen in the Outpatient Research Center by the Principal Investigator
      or another physician. A detailed history is obtained, a physical examination is performed,
      and blood (usually 4 tablespoons) is obtained for additional tests. The research volunteer's
      previous medical records will be requested. Upto 5 additional blood samples may be obtained
      in a subgroup of patients.
