      mevalonate pathway. Although the clinical benefits of statins are undisputable, they have
      been shown to increase insulin resistance and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the
      mechanism of which is currently not clear.

      The main function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is non-shivering thermogenesis (i.e. heat
      production through energy dissipation) in brown adipocytes. There has been a growing interest
      in BAT as a novel therapeutic approach to increase energy expenditure in order to facilitate
      weight-loss and increase insulin sensitivity.

      BAT activity will be assessed using calorimetric test and [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
      positron emission tomography (PET).

      We speculate that statins inhibit BAT function and that this mechanism may contribute to the
      above mentioned increase in insulin resistance.
