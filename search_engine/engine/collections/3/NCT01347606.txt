      and vascular or neural (such as recurrent nervus) injuries are most important ones. This
      research is aim to prevention of these via intraoperative methylene blue using. In the
      operation when thyroid lobes manipulated to medially, methylene blue will be sprayed to this
      area. Dying patternes of tissues (thyroid tissue, oparathyroid tissues, arteries, venules and
      neural structures) will ensure to identification the tissues.
