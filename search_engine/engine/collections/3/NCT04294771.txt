      increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and in combination. Thus, irAEs can
      occur and risk factors for such events have been scarcely described. Here, the investigators
      will use VigiBase (http://www.vigiaccess.org/), the World Health Organization (WHO) database
      of individual safety case reports, to identify risk factors for cases of cardiovascular
      adverse drug reaction following treatment with ICIs, the investigators will also use two
      french databases : APHP Entrepot de Données de Santé (EDS), French Système National Des
      Données de Santé (SNDS) Databases and a retrospective international multicenter registry of
      ICI-associated myocarditis
