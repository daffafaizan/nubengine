    
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of a 90-day intravaginal ring
      (IVR) containing tenofovir (TFV) in healthy, HIV-uninfected individuals assigned female sex
      at birth.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive an IVR containing either 1.4 g TFV or
      placebo. The IVR will be inserted at the enrollment visit (Day 0) and used continuously for
      approximately 91 days.

      Additional study visits will occur at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 91, and 92. Study visits may
      include behavioral assessments, physical examinations, blood and urine collection, and pelvic
      and rectal specimen collection.
