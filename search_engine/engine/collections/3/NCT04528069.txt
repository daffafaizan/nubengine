      astigmatism will be implanted first. The second eye will be implanted within 7-14 days of the
      first eye.

      Subjects will attend 10 scheduled visits as follows: 1 screening visit, 1 operative visit and
      2 post-operative visits for each eye, and 3 postoperative visits where both eyes will be
      evaluated.

      This study will be conducted in Australia.
