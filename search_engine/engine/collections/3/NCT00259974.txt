      supra), a test of double-knowledge versus placebo is justified. Acting of a chronic
      polyneuropathy, the clinical evaluation must be led over one one year period. Acting of a
      sensitive polyneuropathy and the awaited benefit being the IMPROVEMENT OF the CLINICAL SIGNS,
      the principal criterion is a sensitive score in addition validated in chronic sensitive
      polyneuropathies immunodeficiency syndrome.

      The patients answering the criteria of inclusion and none inclusion (see V-2) will be
      randomized in 2 groups: the first group will receive a perfusion IV of rituximab to the
      amount of 375 mg/m2 of body surface, once per week, during 4 weeks (see VII-3); the second
      group will receive 4 perfusions IV of placebo according to same methods'. The evaluation (see
      VI-1) will be carried out at the time of the randomization, then repeated in 3 months, 6
      months, 9 months and 1 year.
