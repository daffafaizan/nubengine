      risk for HIV is 1 in 2 for Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and 1 in 4 for Latino MSM.
      In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Truvada as pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) to help prevent HIV infection. However, PrEP uptake and adherence among
      MSM of color in particular remains low. Part of the challenge of increasing PrEP uptake and
      adherence among MSM of color is related to a historical lack of ethnic and sexual minority
      engagement in health care systems, perceptions of racism and negativity, and inequities in
      treatment.

      In order to engage, recruit, link, and retain MSM at substantial risk of HIV infection, this
      study proposes a randomized controlled pilot trial among 100 HIV-negative MSM of color (50
      per arm) in Baltimore City to determine differences in engagement, retention and adherence to
      Truvada along with PrEP services. In the intervention, a virtual, PrEP Care Anywhere
      Telemedicine approach supported by virtual peer-navigator will be compared to standard
      clinic-based PrEP services with face-to-face peer navigation. The study will evaluate whether
      PrEP Care Anywhere, as a more client-centered approach, will improve adherence and retention.

      The specific aims of the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) pilot are:

        -  To explore differences in linkage, engagement (uptake) and retention in PrEP services
           between traditional clinic-based PrEP services compared to the PrEP Care Anywhere (i.e.,
           virtual) approach

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe engagement with the smartphone application, PrEP me, in the PrEP Care
           Anywhere arm

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and scalability of the intervention package by measuring the
           number of peer intervention contacts (e.g., text message, email, phone, in person,
           mobile app chats) per participant over 12 months

        -  To evaluate biological markers of adherence among a subset of HIV-negative participants
           and all participants who seroconvert

        -  To evaluate agreement in self-reported daily adherence (app-based reporting) to standard
           quarterly clinic-based self-report and to correlate self-reported adherence with
           biomarkers of adherence including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma
           levels of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in a subset of participants

        -  To compare longitudinal changes in sexual risk behavior, health care utilization,
           intimate partner violence, stigma, substance use and mental health between the two study
           arms over 12 months by administering questionnaires at baseline, month 1 and quarterly
           visits

        -  To assess feasibility and acceptability of virtual self-testing for HIV and sexually
           transmitted infections

        -  To compare the experience of and satisfaction with linkage to and engagement in ongoing
           HIV prevention services among participants by conducting and analyzing exit interviews
