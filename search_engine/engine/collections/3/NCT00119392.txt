      I. To assess the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of treating patients with B-Cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, combined with HLA-matched related
      or unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) followed by, no more than 4 hours
      later, indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (for imaging) IV over 10 minutes on day -21.
      Patients undergo gamma camera imaging on day -19. Patients receive rituximab IV followed by,
      no more than 4 hours later, yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day -14.
      Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30-60 minutes on days -7 to -5 and
      undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0. After TBI, patients undergo
      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0. Patients who undergo
      PBSCT from a related donor receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 56 followed by
      a taper to day 180 in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These patients also
      receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0 to 27. Patients who undergo PBSCT
      from an unrelated donor receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 100 followed by a
      taper over 11 weeks in the absence of GVHD. These patients also receive oral mycophenolate
      mofetil three times daily on days 0 to 40 followed by a taper to day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and
      then annually thereafter.
