      I. To evaluate the feasibility of enrolling patients with hormone receptor positive
      (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor negative (HER2-) breast cancer onto a trial
      evaluating investigational agents prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in patients with
      HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses to tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients with
      HR+/HER2- breast cancer who receive the combination therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pathologic response in patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer receiving
      tremelimumab plus durvalumab prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo a biopsy and receive standard of
      care neoadjuvant chemotherapy before undergoing surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until the time of surgery.
