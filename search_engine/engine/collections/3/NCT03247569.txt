      December 2016) for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF
      with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age â‰¥ 75
      years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Treatment of deep
      vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in
      adults.

      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the NVAF indication, Daiichi-Sankyo Thailand proposed this non-interventional
      study (NIS) to gain insight into the safety (bleeding, liver adverse events, all-cause
      mortality and other adverse events) of edoxaban use in non-preselected patients with NVAF.

      Real world evidence data of routine clinical practice use of edoxaban up to 2 years will be
      collected and evaluated in approximately 300 patients, treated by specialized as well as
      non-specialized physicians in hospital centres.
