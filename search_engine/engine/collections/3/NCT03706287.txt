    
      Anlotinib, an oral highly potent tyrosine-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR、PDGFR、FGFR and
      c-kit，has demonstrated improved survival in previously treated patients with advanced
      non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC).

      In the phase Ⅲ study ALTER0303, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic
      chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or
      placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group
      PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,we envisage using anlotinib plus
      platinum plus pemetrexed treat the EGFR wild-type metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      patients who were failure in the treatment of chemotherapy with platinum containing drugs, to
      further improve the patient's PFS.

      The study is divided into two stages，phase I use a dose escalation trial design to explore
      the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities(DLT), Maximum Tolerable Dose(MTD), A
      cohort of 3~6 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level, If 0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects
      experience a DLT, the phase I trial will move ahead to the next dose until ≥ 2 of 6 subjects
      experience a DLT，and the current dose will be considered the MTD. Following completion of the
      dose escalation trial and determination of MTD（Phase I）, a single arm study including 44
      subjects may be enrolled to further evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of anlotinib
      in combination with platinum plus pemetrexed in the same target population（phase II）. Phase
      II is to designed to explore the anti-tumor activity of anlotinib combined with platinum plus
      pemetrexed in T790M mutation negative metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung
      cancer(NSCLC) after the failure of EGFR-TKI.
