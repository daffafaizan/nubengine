    
      Toward this objective, this study involves the following:

        -  Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone "12-lead
           equivalent" ECG on patients presenting with chest pain in which the STEMI protocol was
           activated.

        -  Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone "12-lead
           equivalent" ECG on patients presenting to the Emergency Department for evaluation of
           chest pain, not necessarily presenting with STEMI.

        -  Reading of ECGs (standard 12-lead and iPhone) by three independent cardiologists, who
           are blinded to the initial clinical ECG readings, the type of ECG equipment used, and
           the patient's clinical information.

        -  Assess the operational feasibility of using the Smartphone to obtain "12-lead
           equivalent" ECG recordings in patients suspected to have STEMI, and

        -  Determine the possibility of pooling the data obtained from this study with data from
           other institutions conducting identical studies, and developing a future IRB-approved
           protocol and statistical analysis plan to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive
           predictive value and the negative predictive power of the iPhone ECG, using a paired
           standard 12-lead ECG as the gold standard.

      There will be no therapeutic interventions. A single research-related procedure will be
      required, i.e. an iPhone ECG. Effort will be made to ensure that the performance of this
      procedure will not delay any treatment and/or diagnostic procedures that are part of usual or
      specialized care that the patient requires. Effort will be made to enroll 1 STEMI patient for
      every 2 non-STEMI patients.
