      20% of women presenting with anovulatory infertility. A significant proportion of these women
      will ultimately need assisted reproductive techniques. Various protocols of ovarian
      stimulation such as step up protocol, coasting, GnRH antagonists et al have been proposed for
      optimizing IVF results in patients with PCOS. The results of these studies have shown it not
      to be satisfied. The preliminary studies have proven that Letrozole, a potent and highly
      specific nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, could successfully induce ovulation in women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome. In spite of only a little study research of letrozole in IVF/ICSI
      cycle, for poor ovarian responders, addition of letrozole improved ovarian response to FSH
      and reduced gonadotrophin dose required for COH without having a negative impact on pregnancy
      rates. These reports prompted us to hypothesize that adjunctive use of letrozole in COH
      protocol for patients with PCOS would minimize the gonadotrophin dose, and consequently the
      cost, and lower the risk of OHSS in a IVF/ICSI treatment cycle.
