    
      Women with urinary stress incontinence developed after radical vulvectomy will be enrolled
      and randomized in two groups (arm 1 and arm 2). Patients of group 1 will be treated with the
      tension free vaginal tape, whereas in patients of arm 2 will be used the bulking agent
      injection.

      All eligible patients will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      clinical, and urodynamic evaluations. During the study, the surgical outcomes, the clinical
      subjective and objective efficacy data, and the adverse experiences will be evaluated in each
      patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
