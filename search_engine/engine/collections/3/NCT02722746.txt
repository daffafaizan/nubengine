      surgery will be approached for their willingness to participate in the study. Participants
      undergoing major thoracic, abdominal, or orthopaedic surgery for whom thoracic or lumbar
      epidural block would be indicated and planned for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia
      as per the University of Florida Acute Pain Service (APS) usual and routine practice will be
      included in this study.

      All participants will receive a standardized continuous epidural block at the appropriate
      level for the planned surgery by the APS physicians in the block room that day. For the
      standardized continuous epidural block, placement will be confirmed with loss of resistance
      technique (LORA), wave form analysis or nerve stimulation.

      Participants will be randomly allocated by computer-generated randomization to one of four
      groups. This will be a quintuple blinded prospective study. The anesthesiologist managing the
      intraoperative anesthesia, the anesthesiologists (APS) placing the blocks and following the
      participants on the floors, the research nurse taking the measurement, the surgeons, nor the
      participants will be aware of what combination of drugs are used for the epidural block
      infusion.

      The three groups will consist of:

        1. Group A (Ropivacaine 0.2% infusion; Control group)

        2. Group B (Ropivacaine 0.2% + 2 mcg/mL epinephrine)

        3. Group C (Ropivacaine 0.2% + 5 mcg/mL epinephrine)
