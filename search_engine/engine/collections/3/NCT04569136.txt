      with postpartum women in key positions for managing women for symptoms of mastitis. This
      study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a physical therapy program for mastitis. The
      data the investigators collect from this study will provide evidence on effective and
      targeted strategies to achieve the goals of acceptable, effective and low risk physical
      therapy treatment of mastitis in postpartum women. Once these perspectives are known,
      recommendations on mastitis management can be made.
