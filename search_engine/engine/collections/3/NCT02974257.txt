      and high lactate are associated with worse outcome. Thiamine is a B vitamin necessary to
      maintain the body's ability to use oxygen effectively, and the investigators have found that
      many patients are thiamine deficient after cardiac arrest. The investigators have also found
      that thiamine can decrease lactate in thiamine-deficient patients who are critically ill.
      Patients in this study will be randomized to receive either thiamine or placebo every 12
      hours for 2 days after surviving an in-hospital cardiac arrest. The investigators will
      measure oxygen consumption continuously during that time with a monitor attached to the
      ventilator tubing, and will also measure lactate and other lab values at several time points.
