      providers must address. At this time, chiropractors, the most commonly used complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners, have not been systematically involved in either
      interventions for or research related to fall prevention and risk factor reduction. However,
      it is possible that body-based CAM practitioners such as chiropractors might make important
      contributions to decreasing fall risk through affecting musculoskeletal function and managing
      chronic pain, factors which may affect balance, an important risk factor for falls.
