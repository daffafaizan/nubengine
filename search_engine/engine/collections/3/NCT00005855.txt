        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of efaproxiral (RSR13) when
           administered concurrently with carmustine in patients with progressive or recurrent
           malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RSR13 when administered with carmustine in
           this patient population.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Estimate the efficacy of this regimen at the MTD in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      efaproxiral (RSR13).

      Patients receive RSR13 IV over 30 minutes followed 30 minutes later by carmustine IV over 1-2
      hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of RSR13 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 or 5 of 12
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are accrued to receive treatment with RSR13 and carmustine at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 48 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study. A maximum of 47 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.
