      benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care alone was suggested in a trial that
      randomly assigned 90 patients with advanced pancreatic or biliary cancer (37 with bile duct
      cancer) to fluorouracil (FU)-based systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care alone
      (median survival 6 versus 2.5 months, respectively) (1).

      The literature regarding treatment results with specific regimens is limited because most
      series are small, and many reports consist of a mix of bile duct cancers, gallbladder cancer,
      ampullary cancer, and either pancreatic or hepatocellular cancers. Although they arise in
      similar locations, these cancers all have a unique natural history and response to
      chemotherapy. In general, no single drug or combination has consistently increased median
      survival beyond the expected six to eight months.
