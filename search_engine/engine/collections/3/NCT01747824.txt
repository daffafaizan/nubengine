      from severe pain, agitation, drug overdose, and excited delirium in order to compare markers
      of acidosis in patients at risk for unexplained-in-custody-death (UICD) in order to determine
      the relationship of these markers to what has been found in simulated law enforcement
      encounters. This information will help clarify the levels of stress associated with arrest
      and restraint conditions, allowing us to determine what aspects and levels of stress may be
      associated with the fatal mechanisms of UICD, and to identify markers that would inform death
      investigators of the mechanism of UICD. At the conclusion of this project, we will be able to
      report details explaining the relationship of the physiologic and metabolic effects of stress
      from restraint in excited delirium to other peri-arrest conditions and our previous work in
      simulated law enforcement encounters.
