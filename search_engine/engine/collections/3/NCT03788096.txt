      discharge; 2) baseline data post-hospital discharge and before the start of the weekly peer
      support intervention; 3) post-intervention at the conclusion of the 90-day weekly peer
      support intervention; and 4) follow-up at 6-months post-hospital discharge. The weekly peer
      support intervention will be delivered by a small pool of critical illness survivor peers
      (mentors) recruited from the study site from previous research. Peer support mentors will be
      trained in peer support and MI, and will deliver 3 months of weekly MI interventions
      (phone-based) to CCI survivors randomized to the intervention group. Participants randomized
      to the usual care group will not receive the weekly peer support/MI intervention but will
      receive the usual discharge planning services currently provided at hospital discharge.
      Participants in both groups will be contacted by the research team for 4 telephone-based
      assessments. The design will allow us to test the feasibility and potential impact of the
      PS-PICS intervention on social relationship measures, depression and self-management. Data
      collection and analyses are guided by the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory. The
      Individual and Family Self-Management Theory illustrates the interaction of the process of
      self-management with risk and protective factors, and short-term and long-term outcomes.
