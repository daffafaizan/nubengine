      documenting the use of topically-applied opioids. When 1-5 mg morphine were injected into the
      knee joint, patients experienced pain relief for up to 24 hours, whereas similar doses given
      systemically (i.e. intravenously) were effective for 2-4 hours. Furthermore, the analgesic
      effect was reversed when the opioid antagonist naloxone was injected into the knee joint.
      Both these findings indicate that the effect is mediated by local opioid receptors in the
      knee joint.

      Peripheral analgesic effects of opioids are not detectable in normal tissue but appear
      minutes to hours after initiation of inflammation. This suggests that opioid receptors are
      already present in the peripheral nerve terminals but under normal conditions they are not
      functional.

      Research on application of opioids to skin wounds is very sparse and has primarily been
      performed in palliative care patients. These reports demonstrate that topical opioid gel
      (morphine or diamorphine) provided rapid and effective relief. In some patients pain subsided
      within 20 minutes after application with a long-lasting (7-8 hours) effect. Fundamental
      aspects regarding topical application of opioids onto skin wounds are still lacking. For
      example, issues such as optimal dose and dose-effect relationships have not been
      investigated. We hope to determine these in this study.
