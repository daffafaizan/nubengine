      I. Assess the overall response rate (ORR; complete responders [CR] + partial responders [PR])
      using the Cheson et al parameters of this novel combination regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of incorporating prospective geriatric assessments in patients >=
      70 years of age diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and treated in a
      multi-center setting.

      II. Quality of life (QOL) based on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L)
      scale on all enrolled patients.

      III. Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 and 3 years. IV. Overall survival (OS) at 2 and 3
      years.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      2, obinutuzumab IV over 4 hours on days 1 or 2, 8, and 15 (on both days 1 and 2 in course 1
      only), dexamethasone orally (PO) daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 40 months.
