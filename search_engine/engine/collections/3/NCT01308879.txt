      evidence-supported treatments (ESTs) in community services. However, this approach has not
      produced clear cut results of effectiveness. A recently developed alternative is to improve
      outcomes through routine measurement and feedback to clinicians and supervisors. The
      investigators used a cluster randomized experiment with 28 sites affiliated with a national
      behavioral health organization to assess whether clients of clinicians who were scheduled to
      receive weekly feedback on their clients' progress would improve faster than clients of
      clinicians who were not scheduled to receive weekly feedback.
