      Mother-father-fetus trios of pregnancies complicated by idiopathic non-immune fetal hydrops
      will be identified. These patients will be counseled by a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist
      as would be the routine. As part of the routine work-up, amniocentesis will be recommended
      for karyotype, CMA and an infectious work-up. Amniocentesis will be performed by the
      Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist of the referring institution. The patient will also be
      offered genetic counseling (routine). Subjects will be offered enrollment when inclusion
      criteria are met. After enrollment, the following samples will be collected: (1) maternal
      blood (2) paternal blood, (3) fetal DNA isolated from amniocytes (4) neonatal blood when
      referral is done postnatally. The WES results will be reported to the genetic counselor
      dedicated to the study. The parents will be contacted by the genetic counselor and counseled
      on the findings whether they were positive or negative. The result will also be communicated
      to the patient's primary MFM provider or pediatrician and appropriate referrals to pediatric
      genetics specialists will be made by the primary provider. In cases where no genetic disorder
      is identified, the sample will be stored and then subsequently whole genome sequencing will
      be performed.
