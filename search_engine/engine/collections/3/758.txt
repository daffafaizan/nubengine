the immunological development of the humanfetusthe normal human fetus is said not to be engaged in the formation of immuno-globulins; the immunoglobulins present in the serum of the fetus and thenewborn are considered to be of maternal origin.  in favor of this opinion isthe observation that directly after birth the serum of the newborn contains anappreciable amount of igg, with gm groups identical with those of the mother(68-70).  the level of the igg of the neonate decreases gradually during thefirst 3 months (3,27,71), which is generally explained by the catabolism ofthe maternal igg, whereas the formation by the newborn infant is stillinadequate to maintain the original level (16,27).  the best evidence for thetransplacental passage is the almost complete absence of igg in the serum ofnewborn infants from mothers with agammaglobulinemia (3,27).the transfer of the immunoglobulins appears to be a selective process(13, 15).  while igg is readily transferred, there is little, if any,transfer of iga and igm, as has been shown by ultracentrifugation andimmunoelectrophoretic studies of the serum (12, 16, 19, 20) and the analysisof maternally-transferred antibodies (31-33).  with more sensitive techniquessuch as the double diffusion test in agar or quantitative immunochemicaltechniques, however, minute amounts of both igm and iga have been detectedin fetal blood as well as in cord blood from mature and immature neonates(12, 19, 20, 23, 26).  since large molecules do not pass the placenta, thismay indicate that the trace amounts of igm originate in the fetus itself, buttransplacental passage has not been completely excluded.the absence of immunoglobulin formation has been associated with the absenceof plasma cells in the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow of the normal humanfetus and the newborn.  it has been reported that these cells do not appearuntil a few weeks after birth (2, 3, 14, 25, 34).  however, in pathologicalconditions such as congenital syphilis and toxoplasmosis the human fetus hasbeen found to respond to the antigenic stimulus with intrauterine formation ofplasma cells after about the sixth month of gestation (24,25).
