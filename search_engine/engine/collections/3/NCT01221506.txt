    
      Overall objectives PRIMARY: - Assessment of early changes in DCE-MRI and ultrasound measures
      of tumor perfusion in the setting of pazopanib therapy for patients with metastatic clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma SECONDARY: - Correlation of baseline DCE-MRI and ultrasound
      parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of early (48 +/- 24 hr after treatment) changes
      in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of baseline (and
      changes) in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters with VHL status in tumors and histocytometric
      analysis of endothelial cell activation in archival nephrectomy specimens - Provide an
      insight in the respective predictive values of DCE-MRI and US for pazopanib treatment
