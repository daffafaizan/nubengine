      I. To evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of copanlisib administered in combination
      with nivolumab in patients with transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of copanlisib administered in combination with
      nivolumab in patients with transformed CLL/NHL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the T-cell repertoire and activation patterns following dual targeting of PI3K
      and PD-1.

      II. To establish if PD-1/PD-L 1 expression correlates with response to the combination of
      copanlisib and nivolumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib.

      Participants receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days for 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 4-6 months thereafter.
