      Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody (LymphoScan) in patients with low, intermediate, and high
      grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Define the safety of an initial administration of
      technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody in these patients. III. Demonstrate that diagnostic
      imaging with this agent can correctly stage patients who have been diagnosed with this
      disease similarly to noninvasive conventional diagnostic modalities (CDMs), primarily CT scan
      and bone scan. IV. Demonstrate that imaging with technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody is
      at least as sensitive for detecting disease in various body sites as any other standard
      diagnostic imaging method. V. Compare patient management plans based on CDMs alone,
      technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody alone, and both CDMs and technetium Tc 99m LL2
      monoclonal antibody. VI. Describe the human antimouse antibody production in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. After all other diagnostic studies have
      been completed, patients receive an infusion of technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody by
      IV injection or infused over 20-30 minutes as part of their staging procedures. Planar images
      are acquired between 4-8 hours and 18-24 hours following antibody injection, and single
      photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging is performed between 4-8 hours
      following antibody injection. Patients may receive a repeat injection of technetium Tc 99m
      LL2 monoclonal antibody. Patients are followed for 3 to 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 100 patients will be accrued into this study.
