      combination of raltegravir plus darunavir boosted with cobicistat or ritonavir as dual
      therapy, due to the existence of toxicity or intolerance to nucleoside analogues, to
      evaluate:

        -  efficacy, measured as percentage of patients free of virological failure after 48 and 96
           weeks (ITT-e, snapchot analysis) and improvement in CD4+ count

        -  tolerance (rate of discontinuation and cause, and frequency of adverse events)

        -  evolution of different comorbidities (renal, bone, cardiovascular events)

      Patients will included if they have received at least 1 dose of the dual therapy
