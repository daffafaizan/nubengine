      diabetes for centuries. Gynostemma Pentaphyllum (GP) Makino (Family Cucurbitaceae) is a
      perennial creeping herb growing wild in the mountainous regions of Vietnam, China and some
      other Asian countries and was widely used in Southeast Asian countries as an herbal medicine
      and being beneficial for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. We have previously
      published the evidences that GP tea possessed anti-diabetic effect with good safety data in
      newly diagnosed T2D patients, and had effect on insulin sensitivity. In addition extract of
      GP had been shown to reduce both hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic Zucker Fatty
      rats. So the present study was to investigate the effects of Gynostemma Pentaphyllum tea in
      insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients.
