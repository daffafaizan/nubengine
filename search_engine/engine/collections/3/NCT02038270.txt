      will additionaly be connected. All data will be recorded for at least 30 minutes. NIBP will
      be measured every 5 minutes The evolution of the NIBP, IBP and Nexfin-derived blood pressure
      will be analysed to determine the evolution of inaccuracy due to incomplete vascular
      unloading and to determine the accuracy of Nexfin compared with NIBP to determine IBP.
