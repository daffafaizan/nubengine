      untreated advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with pegylated interferon
      alfa-2b. II. Determine the effects of this treatment regimen on the immune system by
      measuring T-cell subsets and NK cells in this patient population. III. Determine event-free
      and progression-free survival in this patient population treated with this regimen. IV.
      Evaluate the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly for 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon completion of
      treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be initially accrued for this study.
      Additional patients will be accrued if acceptable responses are seen in the first cohort.
