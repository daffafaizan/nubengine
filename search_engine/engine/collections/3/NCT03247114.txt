      regulation of temperature. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive
      method, which detects transient haemodynamic changes in the brain, using blood oxygen level
      dependent (BOLD) signal differences.

      In order to investigate the role of hypothalamic neural activity in response to different
      sweeteners, fMRI will be performed before, during and after ingestion of 300 ml plain water
      or 300 ml water containing 50 g glucose, 50 g fructose, 50 g sucrose or 0.33 g sucralose
      (high intensity sweetener not providing energy). All beverages will be consumed at 22 Â°C.

      The study uses a randomized cross-over design in 16 healthy male subjects with a normal body
      weight. There will be an interval of at least one week between the five occasions.

      Blood Oxygen Level Dependent signal intensity of the hypothalamus will be continuously
      measured for 21 minutes (5 minutes baseline, 4 minutes during drinking and 12 minutes after
      drinking).
