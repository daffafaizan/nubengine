      may lead to improved mental health treatment initiation and engagement among child
      welfare-involved (CWI) youth. CWI youth have high rates of mental health symptoms relative to
      youth in the community, and are disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities, only
      perpetuating disparities in this population's mental health access and engagement. The
      proposed project will develop and test a family-based navigator intervention, the Foster Care
      Family Navigator (FCFN), a natural fit for improving CWI youth mental health service and
      clinical outcomes. The study will start with identifying the feasibility and acceptability of
      the FCFN intervention. Then, the study will determine whether the FCFN intervention improves
      CWI youth mental health treatment initiation and engagement, relative to standard of care
      (not participating in FCFN intervention). Finally, the study will characterize patterns of
      pre- and post-service outcomes along the behavioral health services cascade of care, to
      further evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the FCFN model.
