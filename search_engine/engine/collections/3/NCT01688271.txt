      in a standardized one-day workshop comprised of two sessions; 1) a didactic lecture and model
      scanning session and 2) a simulation session. Quantitative and qualitative assessments will
      be performed using video analysis by two blinded reviewers after equipment orientation
      (baseline), following first session, and following second session. Performance times, number
      of attempts, and composite scores for procedural performance and ergonomics will be analyzed
      within and between groups. Every 3 months for one year, subjects will be surveyed to assess
      implementation of PNB in practice and identify remaining barriers.
