1560. the ultrastructure of the lungs of lambs.  the relation of osmiophilicinclusions and alveolar lining layer to fetal maturation and experimentallyproduced respiratory distressthe lungs in 69 fetal and newborn lambswere studied.  osmiophilic inclusion bodiesfirst appeared at about 121 days gestationand their total number increased withmaturation.  normal surface activity oflung extracts was detectable a few daysfollowing the appearance of inclusionbodies.  the excretory nature of the type iialveolar epithelial cell, the phospholipidnature of the inclusion body content, thedecrease in the number of inclusionbodies and their loss of density associatedwith respiratory distress and with theloss of normal surface activity of lung ex-tracts provide strong evidence thatinclusion bodies are the source of pulmonarysurfactant.  a dense osmiophilic alveolarlining layer in mammals is described.since the presence of such a layer iswell correlated with surface tension valuesand the number of inclusions, it issuggested that this layer consists of surfaceactive substances.  the difficulty indetecting such an osmiophilic layer in othermammals is thought to be, at leastin part, due to species differences in the compo-sition of materials constituting thepulmonary surfactant.  cytologic immaturityexists until lamb fetuses reach 135days gestation.  this is considered to be thebasis for the susceptibility of immaturelambs to respiratory distress.  fibrin with230 a periodicity is a component,although a small one, of hyaline membranes inlambs.  in view of the fact that maturefibrin appearing as bundles of fibrils is rare-ly found, it is suggested that the bulkof the hyaline membrane is not a mature fi-brin, but probably consists of polymersof fibrinogen and serum protein.
