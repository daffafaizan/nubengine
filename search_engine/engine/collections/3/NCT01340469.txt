      flora (probiotics) with regard to the host defense against infection. In vitro and in vivo
      studies have shown that probiotics such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have inhibitory
      effects on other pathogenic bacteria.This evidence, along with the results of recent clinical
      studies, has demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics in the prevention of NEC in
      VLBW infants.However, most of the studies reported nosocomial infection as a secondary
      outcome and the findings were controversial regarding probiotics efficacy in preventing
      nosocomial infections. There is only one study that was aimed to investigate effects of
      probiotic on the incidence of nosocomial infection.

      Given the potential benefit of probiotics against infection and the lack of clinical studies
      in this regard, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine whether probiotic
      supplementation (in the form of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis) could
      reduce nosocomial infection rate among preterm VLBW infants in a intensive care nursery
      setting.
