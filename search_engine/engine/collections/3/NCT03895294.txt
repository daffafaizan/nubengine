      there will be an intervention group and a control group formed naturally before the
      investigation. In order to reduce the possible selection bias due to the lack of
      randomization, the propensity score method will be used. 62 patients will be included in each
      arm.

      An estimation and comparison of the direct costs of the care of patients with Hepatitis C,
      before and after the implementation of the strategic purchase and the Clinical Pathway will
      be made, using a "top to bottom" method.

      A questionnaire will be applied to the patients of the intervention group in order to
      identify barriers and facilitators to Hepatitis C health care and patient satisfaction with
      health care process under the Clinical Pathway.
