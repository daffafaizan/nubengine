      morbidity and mortality mainly due to cardiovascular disease. The precise mechanism of
      cardiovascular disease in PHPT is not well understood and probably multifactorial. Functional
      or structural alterations of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells may impair the
      vascular reactivity and lead to accelerated atherogenesis. Several cardiovascular risk
      factors such as obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia are more
      prevalent in PHPT compared with controls.Patients with severe form of PHPT had a greater
      probability of metabolic syndrome (MS) and insulin resistance than patients with mild PHPT
      and eucalcemic subjects. Although the excess in cardiovascular mortality is significantly and
      independently related to serum calcium, the connection between the biochemical disturbances
      and the cardiovascular disorders in PHPT patients is not necessarily a cause-and-effect
      relationship. Indeed, the impact of surgical cure of hyperparathyroidism on cardiovascular
      risk factors and mortality is controversial. Some studies suggest that hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, and derangement of glucose metabolism improve after removal of overactive
      parathyroid tissue. Others have shown that cardiovascular risk markers remained unaltered
      after parathyroidectomy (PTX).

      The aim of this study was to evaluate whether successful PTX is associated with decreased
      cardiovascular risk. We investigated indices of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance as
      well as various cardiovascular risk factors in patients with manifest PHPT before and one
      year after successful PTX.
