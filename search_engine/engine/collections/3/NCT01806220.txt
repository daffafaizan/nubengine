      a number of neoplastic and chronic diseases, but there are no reports in literature regarding
      its expression in chronic laryngitis associated to Gastroesophageal Reflux isease (GERD),
      also known as Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR). The current study compared the expression of
      EGFR in the esophageal and laryngeal mucosa of adults with GERD and LPR. Study Design:
      Prospective based on imunohistochemical analysis of parafine embedded biopsy specimens and
      clinical data. Methods: From August, 2004 to February 2007 a total of 24 adults with
      confirmed diagnosis of LPR and no other clinical conditions or habits known to cause chronic
      laryngitis were studied at a University Hospital. Biopsies of the distal esophagus and the
      retrocrycoid laryngeal mucosa were obtained during upper digestive endoscopy. Data were
      analyzed statistically comparing samples in each individual and between individuals using the
      severity of histological signs of inflammation on hematoxacillin and eosinophillin (HE)
      stains to immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of EGFR. Other independent variables
      were severity of symptoms and signs, gender and age. FishersÂ´s exact test and multivariance
      ANOVA tests were used with significance level established at 95%.
