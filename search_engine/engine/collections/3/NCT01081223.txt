      provide cells for the vaccine. Second, the patient will be vaccinated twice with those cells
      and GM-CSF. Third, the patient's blood will be filtered for white cells which will then be
      cultured and stimulated to reach a higher (killer) activity level. Fourth, the activated
      white blood cells will be infused into the patient's bloodstream so that they will be able to
      attack the cancer. Finally, the entire process starting with vaccination will be repeated,
      for a total of two rounds of therapy.
