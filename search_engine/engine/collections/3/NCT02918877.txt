    
      Randomized, controlled trial involving 45 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients will be randomized to receive either inhaled anesthesia with
      sevoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol for the maintenance phase of
      their cardiac anesthetic. Assessment of lung inflammation will take place using fiberoptic
      bronchoscopic sampling of lung fluid as well as serum collection before and after exposure to
      cardiopulmonary bypass, and the incidence of compositive postoperative pulmonary
      complications will take place in the postoperative period.
