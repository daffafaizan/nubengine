    
      The present study is an explorative, observational study, which will include in total 60
      participants divided over 3 groups; healthy young adults, healthy older adults and patients
      with a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm (i.e. 30-50 mm), who are currently under threshold
      for repair. When participants meet the criteria, they will be informed about the study and
      they will be asked for their written informed consent, when they are willing to participate.
      Every participant only need to visit one time, which takes approximately 30 minutes.
      Participant characteristics will be registered, including traditional risk factors and CV
      history. Subsequently, the investigators will perform the CAR-test, which takes approximately
      15 minutes. Prior to the CAR-test, participants should follow some instructions with regard
      to food and fluid intake according to a physiological guideline, which can influence this
      test.
