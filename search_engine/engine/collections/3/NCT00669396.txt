      EC. This will be accomplished by offering all women who present for EC at participating
      Planned Parenthood Association of Utah (PPAU) clinics during the study period the option of
      having the copper IUD or Plan B. Women who agree to study participation will be followed for
      6 months. The primary outcome for the study is the use of a reliable method of contraception
      6 months after presenting for EC.

      Secondary outcomes measured will be pregnancies, abortions, repeat Plan B use, presence of
      gonorrhea or Chlamydia infection at the time of presentation for EC, number of days to first
      bleeding episode and duration of that bleeding episode, further bleeding patterns, frequency
      of unprotected intercourse, use of a barrier method for prevention of sexually transmitted
      infections, patient satisfaction with the chosen method and symptoms possibly related to
      contraception use. Patients selecting the IUD will be assessed for IUD expulsion,
      perforation, and removal.
