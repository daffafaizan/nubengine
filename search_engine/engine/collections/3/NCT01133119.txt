      transferability of research findings from the adult literature. For example, the majority of
      pediatric cardiac catheterizations are performed under general anesthetic, and femoral
      sheaths are removed while under general anesthetic and at the end of the procedure. In
      contrast in adult clinical practice, procedures are not performed under general anesthetic,
      and femoral sheaths are removed when patients are awake and often 4 to 6 hours after the end
      of the procedure. These differences limit the ability to apply research findings in adults to
      pediatrics, warranting further study of the effects of local anesthetic on femoral site pain
      in children. As well, studies in adults have examined pain only up to 20 minutes after sheath
      removal. We seek to investigate the impact of bupivacaine up to 6 hours after cardiac
      catheterization in children.
