    
      Primary outcome: Screening of clinically significant fibrosis with FibroMeter blood score.
      Screening for hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses.

      Secondary outcome: Clinically significant fibrosis confirmed with FibroScan®.

      The means for this study are a clinical questionnaire, a virological screening, a blood score
      for liver fibrosis: FibroMeter according to cause of the fibrosis and FibroScan® is referent
      and independent examination.

      The expected results from this study are the knowledge of the prevalence of hepatopathies
      with hepatic fibrosis will be able to justify, possibly, a screening politic of them. This
      study will permit to evaluate the feasibility of noninvasive screening of the liver fibrosis
      in the goal to suppress the liver biopsy in a population having numerous drawbacks.
