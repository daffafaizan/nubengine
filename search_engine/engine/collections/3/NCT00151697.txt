      administration of a mixture of short- and longacting insulin. Although this improves glycemic
      control, it is generally accompanied by a substantial gain in body weight. This may lead to
      an increase in body fat resulting in a worsening of insulin resistance, leading to an
      increase in insulin dose needed to maintain glycemic control.

      The combination of glimepiride(amaryl) and short-acting insulin (novorapid) is thought to
      attain glycemic control with a smaller increase in body weight.

      In this randomized controlled trial, 150 diabetics failing on maximal oral treatment will be
      randomized to preprandial use of Novorapid combined with Amaryl at 20.00 hours, twice daily
      Novomix 30, or once daily Lantus. Metformin will be continued.

      In the year after randomisation, patients will be followed for glycemic control, body weight,
      body composition, recorded number of hypoglycemic events, plasma lipid levels, basal and
      stimulated C-peptide levels and adverse effects.
