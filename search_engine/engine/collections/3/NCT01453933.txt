      belonging to the class of protease inhibitors (PIs). PIs are associated with an increased
      risk of myocardial infarction. However, data is available suggesting increased levels of
      plasma lipids are not the sole explanation for this observation. Treatment with LPV/r might
      lead to a decrease of endothelial function as well, thus explaining the increased risk of
      myocardial infarction besides increased plasma lipids. Raltegravir is a registered
      antiretroviral drug with no known cardiovascular side effects. We hypothesize that switching
      LPV/r to raltegravir in HIV-infected patients with suppressed plasma viral load (<50
      copies/ml) will lead to an improvement of endothelial function.

      Objective:

        -  First, to assess the effect of the switch of lopinavir/ritonavir to raltegravir on
           endothelial function.

        -  Second, to assess the effect of the intervention mentioned above on markers of
           endothelial function; immune activation; chronic inflammation; and, on plasma HIV-RNA
           below the cut-off of 50 copies/ml.
