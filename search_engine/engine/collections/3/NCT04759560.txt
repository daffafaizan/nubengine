      globe. Recognition of microcornea/microphthalmia may be important as a potential contributor
      to the development of aphakic glaucoma after cataract surgery. Biometrics characteristics of
      eyes with m/m before and after removal of the cataractous lens can justify the occurrence of
      postoperative complications, including glaucoma.

      Aim of the study: to report on the changes in the anterior segment biometric characteristics
      after cataract extraction in eyes with microcornea/microphthalmia with congenital cataract.

      Methods:

      The study will be a prospective cohorte. Biometry of eligible eyes with congenital cataract
      in one or both eyes with horizontal cornea diameter less than 11mm and/or axial length less
      than 2standard deviation for age will be compare to otherwise normal eyes with congenital
      cataract before and after cataract extraction. The anterior segment biometric characteristics
      using ultrasound biomicroscopy to measure anterior chamber depth and angle.Cataract surgery
      will be conducted with or without intraocular lens implantation.Postoperative follow up will
      be scheduled at the first week and first month, third and sixth months
