      with non-genetic factors influence risk for MH in children who had general anesthesia with
      triggering agents and develop reliable predictive MH risk algorithms. Rationale: Once the
      factors responsible for MH risk are determined, it will be possible to better predict risk
      and develop better individualization of anesthetics such as tailored selection of intravenous
      anesthetics, regional anesthesia and avoidance of all triggering agents. The long-term goal
      is to tailor and improve safety of anesthetic and clinical care and to reduce mortality,
      morbidity and cost of care due to MH with right anesthetics and muscle relaxants for
      endotracheal intubations for an individual child.
