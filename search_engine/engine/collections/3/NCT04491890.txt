      followed by cross-cultural adaptation. Ten Chinese Medicine Practitioners (CMPs) and 30
      patients will be recruited from the community and the outpatient clinics of Hong Kong Baptist
      University (HKBU) to evaluate the Constitution in TCM Questionnaire (For Old Person)
      (Cantonese version) (CTCMQ-C) for content validity by the cognitive debriefing interviews.
      The content validity indices (CVI) of clarity, relevance and appropriateness of each item of
      the questionnaire rated by CMPs and patients will be quantified. The interpretations of items
      and suggestions of rewording by the patients and CMPs will be analyzed qualitatively to
      identify any item of the questionnaire that is not valid for the Chinese population in Hong
      Kong. Secondly following the validation study, 264 patients will be recruited. A validated
      CTCMQ-C will then be generated and will be endorsed by expert panel to use in the subsequent
      cross-sectional and cohort studies to evaluate the preventive effect with Chinese Medicine
      approaches. The psychometric properties including construct validity by scaling assumptions,
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and reliability of the CTMCQ-C will also be tested.
