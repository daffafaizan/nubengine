      interpreters' ability to cope with difficult encounters. We propose to (1) identify the needs
      of medical interpreters working with cancer patients, and (2) develop and test a
      psychoeducational resiliency program at 3 DF/HCC cancer centers: MGH, DFCI, and BWH) intended
      to enhance interpreters' skills to effectively manage stressful encounters and to cope with
      the personal effects of encounters.
