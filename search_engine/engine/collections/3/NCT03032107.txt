      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved the combination of Pembrolizumab and T-DM1 for use in patients, including people
      with your type of cancer.

      This study will determine what amount (or dose) of Pembrolizumab and of T-DM1 is safe for
      people to take and what effects, good or bad, this combination may have on participants and
      their disease.

      The FDA has not approved Pembrolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved in
      the United Sates for the treatment of other types of cancer.

      The FDA has approved Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) as a treatment option for this type of
      breast cancer

      The combination of Pembrolizumab and T-DM1 is investigational. It is thought that together
      these drugs to help get the immune system to attack tumor cells and kill cancer cells that
      have the HER2 protein. However, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same
      time will have a better anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own.
