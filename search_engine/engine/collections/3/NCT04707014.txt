      single center willbe randomised to receive hypnosis (intervention group) or
      attention-distracting techniques (control group). Endpoints will be the sedative dose
      (propofol) during surgery, and the need for analgesia (paracetamol and others) immediately
      after surgery (recovery) and after 24 hours. Randomization will be systematic in blocks
      depending on the day the surgery is programmed. Hypnosis will be delivered by an experienced
      anesthesist trained in the technique. Patients and families will be informed of the special
      treatment during surgery, but will be unaware of whether the patients are experiencing
      distraction or hypnosis techniques. Distraction is already a useful technique, and it is
      expected that patients will be satisfied with the procedure; however, the hypothesis to be
      tested is that hypnosis reduces the need for sedation and analgesia compared to distraction
      techniques, as well as improves satisfaction.
