      for developing cardiovascular disease and consequent increase in oxidative stress and chronic
      inflammation. Polymorphisms in the gene that encodes the vitamin D receptor (VDR) can
      influence the cellular responses supplementation of vitamin D. The study objective is to
      evaluate the influence of supplementation of 200,000 in a single high dose of vitamin D3 in
      the inflammatory status and oxidative stress elderly and the influence of polymorphism of the
      VDR gene in this response. One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, designed with
      non-institutionalized elderly in northeastern Brazil will be held. All volunteers will sign
      the Instrument of Consent and will undergo clinical, nutritional, anthropometric and
      biochemical evaluation. The purpose is to produce new knowledge helping to unravel the
      beneficial effects of vitamin D3.
