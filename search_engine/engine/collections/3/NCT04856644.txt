      mortality, and improve outcomes by increasing patient adherence to treatments and decreasing
      duration to cure, in addition to reducing costs to the health system and the patient. The
      purpose of this prospective, three year, single arm study is to evaluate whether a short
      course, four-month regimen containing rifapentine and moxifloxacin (2HZPM/2HPM) are as
      effective and/or as tolerable as the standard six-month regimen for the treatment of
      drug-susceptible, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). A historical group receiving the standard
      six-month regimen is used as control. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of
      rifapentine in Asian patients. Analysis of of histocompatibility leucocyte antigen (HLA)
      associations with adverse events and changes in biomarkers will be done.
