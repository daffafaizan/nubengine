      refractory to the treatment in around 25 % of the cases. There is therefore a need to develop
      new therapy with novel synaptic targets.

      New antiepileptic drugs emerge as potential drugs for SE. Perampanel (PER) is a new drug
      available for add-on therapy in patients with a focal epilepsy. The mechanism of action of
      this drug is original, as it is a non-competitive
      Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist. Several studies
      suggested that AMPA-mediated glutamatergic transmission plays an important rule during the
      SE.

      In this study the investigator will focus on patients suffering from early focal motor SE,
      for several reasons:

      (i) There is no randomized controlled double-blind trial in this population, and therefore no
      evidence to help physicians.

      (ii) The investigator aims to perform a trial on early SE, after failure of only one drug (a
      benzodiazepine, recommended as first line treatment), in order to properly evaluate the
      effect of the tested drug (add-on of perampanel).

      (iii) The perampanel is available only for oral administration. Focal SE usually does not
      affect the vital prognosis and can be treated less aggressively. Use of oral loading doses of
      antiepileptic drugs is frequent, and therapies may be changed or adapted in the time-frame of
      hours or days.

      (iv) Patients with a focal SE, presenting motor symptoms, can be included without the need of
      an EEG. Similarly, the primary end-point, cessation of the motor events, does not require
      specific exam, and can also be done clinically.
