      aminocamptothecin (9-AC) in chemotherapy naive patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach or
      gastroesophageal junction. II. Characterize the nature of the toxicity of 9-AC on this
      schedule in this patient population. III. Determine the duration of response, time to
      progression, and survival of this patient population. IV. Study the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of 9-AC on this schedule in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive intravenous
      aminocamptothecin by continuous infusion over 120 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12 followed by 1
      week of rest for a 3 week cycle. Therapy continues for a minimum of 6 weeks (2 full cycles)
      unless there are unacceptable toxic effects or rapid disease progression. Dose escalation may
      occur in patients who complete 3 cycles of therapy without unacceptable toxicity. All
      patients will be followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14-40 patients within 18 months.
