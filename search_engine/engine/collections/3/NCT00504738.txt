    
      The lung diseases are disorders associated with functional and/or structural derangements to
      the alveolar structures, airways, pulmonary blood vessels, pleura and/or mediastinum. The
      purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic materials from the blood and lungs from these
      patients in order to: (1) develop an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of these
      disorders; and (2) identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for other protocols
      such as those involving investigational new drugs. As such, this protocol is part of the
      "infrastructure" for all of our human lung-related studies such as genomic/gene expression
      studies of airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages in all individuals with chronic
      obstructive lung disease (COPD), asthma, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pulmonary fibrosis
      compared to normal non-smokers and smokers, and studies of mediators in bronchoalveolar
      lavage fluid.

      This protocol, to be carried out at Weill Cornell Medical College - Qatar and Hamad Medical
      Corporation, Qatar, parallels a similar approved protocol IRB #0005004440, entitled,
      "Evaluation of the Lungs of Individuals with Lung Disease with Segmental Bronchopulmonary
      Lung Lavage, Bronchial Brushing, and Bronchial Wall Biopsy", ongoing at Weill Cornell Medical
      College - New York.
