    
      Six dose-group trials are planned: 1 mg,4 mg,10 mg,20 mg,30 mg,and 45 mg.When the dose
      reaches 45mg, if the standard of increasing dose termination is still not reached, the
      researcher and the sponsor shall decide whether to continue the increasing dose after
      reviewing the previous study data, and each increasing dose shall not exceed 33.3% (e.g.,
      60mg) of the previous dose group. In the process of dose increasing, when the dose exceeds 20
      mg, if the dose level reaches the dose termination standard, an intermediate dose is set
      between this dose and the previous dose, and the study is returned to the intermediate dose
      group.In this study, a parallel design was adopted, in which each subject received only one
      dose of drug from one dose group, which ensured the safety of the subject to the greatest
      extent, and also avoided the interference of safety and PK results caused by possible
      insufficient elution or other factors.Among them, 1 mg dose group was the starting dose
      group, and 6 subjects were randomly assigned into sy-007 group for injection or placebo group
      at a ratio of 2:1. Only 2 subjects were given the drug for the first time. One day after the
      first two subjects were given the drug, after ensuring the safety of the first two subjects,
      the drug was given to the remaining 4 subjects.In other dose groups, sentry administration
      was also used. The first 2 subjects received sy-007 injection or placebo respectively. After
      3 days of hospitalization observation, the safety data of the first 2 cases were reviewed by
      the researcher and the sponsor, and the remaining subjects in this dose group were determined
      accordingly.Pharmacokinetic biological samples were collected from all dose groups and their
      safety was assessed.A total of 66~90 healthy subjects will be enrolled.
