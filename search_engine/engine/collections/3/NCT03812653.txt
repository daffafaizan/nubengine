      a multi-site, parallel-group superiority trial that compares 6 months of OSA treatment to
      usual care. The study includes two trials: a prevention study with an embedded recovery
      trial. 3062 subjects will be randomized over 5 years at 110 sites within the NINDS-funded
      StrokeNet clinical trials network.
