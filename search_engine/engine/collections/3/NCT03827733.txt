      impact on the behavior and brain pathology consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      neuropathogenesis. The objective of this study is to assess whether the gut/oral microbiome
      and feces beta-amyloid of AD patients are different from those of the participants without AD
      and their partners. The investigators plan to recruit 150 subjects, including three groups of
      normal elders, AD patients and the partners of the AD patients. The cognitive function will
      be assessed and the feces and oral samples will be collected to determine whether there are
      differences or correlations.
