      considerable socioeconomic weight for society. Knowledge of the components, the diversity and
      the scalability of post-stroke life pathways is currently not sufficient. Moreover the link
      between post-stroke pathways and patient sequelae have not yet been clearly defined.

      The main purpose is to identify the post-stroke life pathways components associated with
      sequalae at 3 months and 1 year after the acute stroke episode. The secondary objectives are:
      1) To define a typology of the life pathways of stroke patients, , 2) To analyze the social
      and geographical inequalities in the management of stroke, 4) To estimate the cost of the
      pathway elements of stroke management; 5) Measure the sequelae of stroke patients at three
      months and one year after the acute episode.

      The design is a prospective multicenter cohort study with a follow up to 1 year after the
      acute episode, managed in several hospitals in the Aquitaine region (France).
