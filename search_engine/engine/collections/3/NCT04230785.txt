      stroke (IS). The purpose of this protocol will investigate the differentiated expression
      pattern of circular RNA (circRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA) by
      next-generation sequencing in acute ischemic stroke patients before and/or after endovascular
      treatment. The candidate circRNA/lncRNA/miRNA will be verified as the biomarker and regulator
      for progression and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment. Further,
      the candidate non-coding RNA will be used to evaluate the effect of endovascular treatment on
      both peripheral and central immune after stroke. Distinctive expression patterns of
      circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be identified by the next-generation sequencing and individual
      quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A predictive model will be
      established using logistic regression. The panel of these altered ncRNAs may be associated
      with the immune status after acute IS and could serve as a regulator for progression and
      prognosis of acute ischemic stroke with endovascular treatment.
