      to spontaneous ventilation often undergo an spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) before
      extubation and liberation from mechanical ventilation. During the test, which lasts from 30
      minutes to 2 hours , the patient receives minimal support from the ventilator, and the ICU
      team observes if the patient develops any signs or symptoms of discomfort or respiratory
      distress. If the patient tolerates the test, he or she is considered ready for extubation.
      The Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a new mode of ventilation, shown to
      improve patient-ventilator synchrony. It has not been tested during SBTs. Our objective is to
      compare the performance of NAVA with the commonly used Pressure Support ventilation, during
      an SBT. Patients considered to be ready for an SBT by the ICU team will undergo two SBTs in
      random order: one in pressure support, and the other on NAVA, with a 1-hour interval between
      the tests. Ventilatory parameters and patient-ventilator interaction variables will be
      compared among the two tests.

      This study will help us understand if NAVA can be used during an SBT, which might be
      important for patients who are being ventilated with NAVA before the SBT is suggested,
      especially those how present a high asynchrony rate when ventilated with Pressure Support
      Mode.
