      bowel sound of critically ill patients with ICU. This technology added the intestinal sound
      characteristic database to the data processing center, analyzed and identified the intestinal
      sound data through the intestinal sound recognition algorithm, further analyzed the
      parameters such as audio frequency, spectrum and power spectrum, and observed the changes of
      biomarkers such as citrulline and intestinal fatty acid binding protein.
