      patients who suffer from both, adrenal insufficiency and type I diabetes more frequently
      report hypoglycemia, particularly after strenuous activities this study investigates the
      counter-regulatory hormonal response to physical stress and the impact on cognitive function
      in subjects with and without Addison's disease, type I diabetes and healthy subjects.
      Patients will perform ergometer training with an individualized intensity and fulfill
      cognitive function testing (stroop test and fatigue inventories) before and after strenuous
      activity.
