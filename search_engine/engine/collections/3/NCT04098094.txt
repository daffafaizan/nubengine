    
      Observational study in patients with chronic respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive
      pulmonary diseases, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung diseases, neuromuscular diseases,
      obesity-hypoventilation syndrome...) admitted in intensive care unit for acute respiratory
      failure.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Chronic respiratory disease (COPD, ILD, OHS...)

        -  Admission in ICU for acute respiratory failure

        -  Patient's non-opposition

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Patients < 18 year-old

        -  Protected patients

        -  Pregnant women The main objective is to determine the prevalence of right ventricular
           (RV) dysfunction in this population and to analyze the impact of such a complication on
           outcomes (survival at day-28, duration of non-invasive or mechanical ventilation,
           duration of hospital stay). RV function will be assessed by echocardiography at
           admission, after 3 days and at discharge. Plasma NT-proBNP and troponin levels will be
           collected.
