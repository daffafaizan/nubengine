      autoimmune diseases. Many studies have shown that the drug contributes to the expansion of
      regulatory T cells and preserves the highly suppressive function of autoreactive T cells.
      Patients with RITP often display a decreased proportion of regulatory T cells by flow
      cytometer, therefore, the investigators will examine the efficacy of rapamycin in RITP
      patients.
