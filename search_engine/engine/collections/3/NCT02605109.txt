      Korea. In June 2015, a female patient visited our emergency department (ED) for care of femur
      fracture. She was suspected of having MERS-Cov and isolated after 10 hours from the visit of
      our hospital because her clinical feature was not concordance with typical MERS-Cov infection
      and she denied the any contact of MERS-Cov patient. Before the transport to the isolation
      room, she stayed at ED during 8 hours, and admitted the general ward during 2 hours.
      Approximately 150 including the healthcare providers, patients and laypersons were exposed to
      the case-patient directly or indirectly. The investigators monitored all possible contacts in
      the hospital during that time, and analysed the CCTV data of hospital and interviewed all
      risk-persons. After the hospital outbreak ended, The investigators analysed the data of all
      behavior and contact history of MERS patient, epidermic and clinical data of infected
      patients and data of personal protective equipments (PPE) of all exposed persons.
