      bronchiolitis has a high prevalence, there is a lack of a unified inpatient treatment plan
      beyond supportive care of supplemental oxygen and intravenous hydration. There have been many
      different approaches to the treatment of bronchiolitis, but none have conclusively proven to
      be beneficial. Several early studies show promise for the use of nebulized hypertonic saline,
      however the majority of these studies are done outside the United States and with adjunctive
      therapy. To date, the data suggesting that nebulized hypertonic saline is safe and effective
      for reducing length of stay in bronchiolitis is strong but not generalizable for the United
      States. The objective of this study is to conduct the first double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial in the United States of nebulized hypertonic saline without adjunctive
      therapy, including infants with bronchiolitis, including those with prior history of wheeze,
      to assess the effect on length of stay and therefore resource utilization.
