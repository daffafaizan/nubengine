      is an effective method for treatment of the hypersplenism and portal hypertension. Existing
      researches show that endoscopic therapy + PSE is more effective than endoscopic therapy alone
      in prevention of esophageal varices bleeding recurrence in the patients with liver cirrhosis.
      However, there is few articles which proved long-term effectiveness of endoscopic therapy +
      PSE, it needs further research on this issue. This study compares the efficiency of partial
      splenic embolization +endoscopic therapy with endoscopic therapy alone in the treatment of
      gastroesophageal variceal haemorrhage accompanied with splenomegaly or hypersplenism in the
      patients with hepatocirrhosis and portal hypertension.
