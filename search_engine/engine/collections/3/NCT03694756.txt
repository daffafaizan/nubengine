      management of breast cancer. Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis - Magnetic Resonance
      imaging (TMEM-MRI) has the ability to detect tumor areas with more leakiness (perfusion),
      where cancer cell enter blood vessels to travel to other sites. This novel TMEM-MRI has
      potential to be used in clinical practice to identify tumors with high leakiness that might
      have higher chances to recur after breast cancer treatment. In addition, TMEM-MRI can
      potentially be used to assess response to preoperative treatments (chemotherapy, hormonal
      therapy) over time.
