      colon. Inadequate bowel preparation is the predominant threaten to the efficacy of
      colonoscopy.Unfortunately, about 30% of patients were reported to suffer inadequate bowel
      preparation. In order to improve adequate bowel preparation rate, it is desirable to
      prescribe personalized regimen according to patient characteristics. We intend to create and
      verify a predictive model for inadequate bowel preparation. Then, in order to improve
      adequate bowel preparation rate, we aim to establish a bowel preparation strategy guided by
      the predicted model and verify it.
