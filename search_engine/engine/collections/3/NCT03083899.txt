      are randomized to two groups: (i) Patients randomized to the control group receive their
      standard diabetes care and are seen in the out-patient clinic with regular intervals
      (typically a diabetes nurse every 3-4 month and a diabetes doctor once a year. (ii) Patients
      randomized to the intervention group are not called for at fixed time points. They can
      arrange visits in the diabetes clinic whenever they feel the need to do so. The have a
      guarantee for a consultation with a diabetes nurse within one week and with a diabetes doctor
      or diet physician within two weeks. Questionnaires (a specific questionnaire focused on
      patient satisfaction developed for the study and AddQoL) are filled in at time 0 and 24
      month. Blood samples for diabetes-related variables (HbA1c, lipid status), blood pressure,
      body weight etc. are likewise recorded at time 0 and 24 month. Economic and time requirements
      are evaluated at 24 month.
