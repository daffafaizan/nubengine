    
      Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is the most common medical condition of pregnancy,
      also known as morning sickness which affects up to 80% of pregnant women. Lillipops Iced
      Soothies are naturally flavoured freezies developed in the United Kingdom for women with
      morning sickness. They are available in 5 different flavours: grapefruit and tangerine, lemon
      and mint, chamomile and orange, lime and vanilla, and ginger. The flavours are derived from
      steam distillation of the peels (grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, orange, lime), mint leaves,
      and chamomile flowers to release and collect their essential oils. Vanilla pods and ginger
      are macerated and their resin is used. These flavours are chosen because they may provide
      relief of symptoms as they are either traditional remedies for NVP, such as ginger, or
      soothing and refreshing flavours, such as chamomile, vanilla and citrus.

      This study hypothesizes that using Lillipops Iced Soothies will reduce the severity of NVP
      symptoms according to the PUQE-24 (pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea)
      scoring system for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, we hypothesize concurrent
      symptoms that may intensify NVP, such as metallic taste or gastrointestinal disorders (e.g.
      heartburn, acid reflux, indigestion and gas), will be alleviated. We hypothesize that
      improvements to NVP and concurrent symptoms will be greater with Lillipop freezies compared
      to another commercially available freezie.
