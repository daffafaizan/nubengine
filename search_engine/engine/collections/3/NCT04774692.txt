    
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSA) is one of the most frequent chronic disease
      presenting with or without symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and being
      accompanied by neurocognitive, cardiovascular and metabolic complications.

      The first line therapy of obstructive sleep apnoea is continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP). CPAP is highly effective in symptomatic patients for reducing EDS and improving daily
      functioning, cognitive function, mood and quality of life. However, success of CPAP treatment
      is hampered by long term nonadherence in nearly half of patients. Non adherence to CPAP is
      less and less related to technical problems, but rather to users' profile, their
      representations of OSA and the benefits experienced from CPAP. Cognitive-behavioural and
      motivation enhancement therapies can promote adherence to CPAP treatment. In addition to
      health professionals, patients and public involvement (PPI) is more and more advocated in the
      field of education and research. Nevertheless, the level of evidence regarding efficacy of
      PPI and patient researchers remains to be demonstrated. The aim of this randomized clinical
      trial is to evaluate the role of patient researchers in promoting the resumption of CPAP
      therapy in apneic patients who had previously stopped CPAP
