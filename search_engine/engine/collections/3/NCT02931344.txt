      including a low-calorie diet and dietetic counselling, after which they will be randomised to
      receive either liraglutide 3 mg or liraglutide 3 mg placebo as an add-on to dietetic guidance
      on re-introducing regular foods and a focus on continued motivation to engage in a healthy
      lifestyle.
