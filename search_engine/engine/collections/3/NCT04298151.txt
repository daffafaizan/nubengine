      glass ionomer restorations ( Zirconomer improved) under stress bearing posterior area (class
      I or claa II cavities) in geriatric population in comparison to Conventional viscous glass
      ionomer restorations (Ketac molar Aplicap) using the modified United States Public Health
      Service (USPHS) criteria

      P: Geriatric Patients with posterior Caries lesions I: Zirconia reinforced GI (Zirconomer
      Improved) C: Conventional viscous GI, (Ketac Molar Aplicap) O: The Clinical performance of
      the Glass Ionomer restorations Using USPHS Criteria
