    
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS:

      In patients with no response to CRT and significant FMR (grade ≥2, 100%), the MitraClip
      system will be associated with improved functional class, LVEF recovery and reduced LV
      volumes. To our knowledge, no registered randomized studies with a similar design are being
      conducted.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE:

      To compare the efficacy and safety of optimal medical treatment and MitraClip versus optimal
      medical treatment alone (control) in non-responders to CRT and symptomatic FMR ≥2.
