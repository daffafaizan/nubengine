      abdominoplasty or bilateral breast reduction with a Wise pattern skin excision (inverted T
      inframammary scar) Informed consent will be obtained from volunteers at their next
      consultation, during which the preoperative preparation is finalised and the surgery is
      booked.

      Participants will receive injections for the first time three weeks to four months before the
      operation and for the second time five to nine days before the operation, in tissue that will
      be removed during the surgery.

      In each session, through one single access point, a linear retrograde, subcutaneous injection
      will be performed with 0,5 ml of each of the studied hyaluronic acid gels, each in an
      opposite direction, each parallel to the skin surface.

      Both sessions will be monitored by ultrasound examination. After the injections, the 2 cm of
      injected area which is most remote from the entrance point of the cannula will be remodelled
      by finger pressure and tissue pinching, to simulate remodelling as commonly performed after
      filler injection.

      At the beginning of the operation, the injected subcutaneous fat will be removed with the
      overlying skin, to be sent for histologic examination.

      The objective of the histologic examination is to assess the tissue response at one week
      versus three weeks to four months after the injection, as well as to assess the spread of the
      products, with and without remodelling after injection.
