      of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the vast majority of patients will develop secondary
      resistance to these agents.

      The therapeutic options of patients with advanced GIST with resistance (or intolerance) to
      imatinib and sunitinib remain then very limited and prognosis of patients are very poor.

      Nilotinib has an inferior activity in first line setting as compared to imatinib. Sorafenib
      has been evaluated in off-label and compassionate use studies with a median PFS close to 3 to
      4 months, and a median overall survival close to 9 months with few prolonged tumor control
      and limited availability.

      Regorafenib was tested in a phase II and a randomized phase III trial (GRID) in this setting
      , and provided a significant PFS advantage with no significant improvement in OS.

      There are no recognized standard options in patients whose tumors progress after 3 or more
      TKIs. The recently updated guidelines from ESMO in 2014, included the reintroduction of
      imatinib in an attempt to control the progression of the sensitive cell clones, and on the
      basis of the results of the RIGHT study.

      This is therefore a situation with a clear unmet medical need.

      Lenvatinib is a broad spectrum TKI targeting oncogenes KIT and RET and receptor tyrosine
      kinases, PDGFRA, VEGFR 1-3 and FGFR 1-4. It has demonstrated activity in iodine resistant
      metastatic thyroid cancers. Whether lenvatinib would be a useful agent in patients with GIST
      is not known but there is a rationale to investigate its activity in patients with advanced
      GIST.

      In the present study, we propose to analyze the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in patients
      with GIST failing to at least imatinib and sunitinib in a randomized setting, vs placebo.
