      destruction of normal epithelial structure, proliferation of fibroblasts, and deposition of
      connective-tissue matrix proteins. There are currently no effective therapies for IPF. Over
      the past two decades, preclinical studies of inhaled low dose carbon monoxide (CO) have shown
      that this biologically active diatomic gas possesses properties that would make it a viable
      novel therapy for IPF. CO therapy has been well tolerated in Phase I and Phase II human
      trials to date. This phase II study is designed to investigate whether IPF patients show
      evidence of decreased peripheral blood levels of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) and
      stability of secondary indicators of disease progression after 3 months of inhaled therapy.
