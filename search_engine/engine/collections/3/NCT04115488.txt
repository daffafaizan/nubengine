      ratio, to receive a total of twelve intravenous (IV) infusion of either PB006 or Tysabri at a
      dose of 300 mg at each intravenous (IV) infusion administered with every single one
      intravenous (IV) infusion administereds every 4 weeks of either PB006 or Tysabri at a dose of
      300 mg starting at visit 1 (week 0) through visit 12 (week 44), for a total of 12 infusions.
      The End-of-Study Visit (visit 13, week 48) will be performed 4 weeks after the last infusion
