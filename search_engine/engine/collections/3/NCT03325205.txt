      randomized to receive either active anodal tDCS or sham tDCS. The performance on
      neuropsychological tests will be the primary outcome variables in the present project. In
      addition, whole brain MRI volume measures will be used to measure specific effects of tDCS
      treatment. Electrode placement is individualized for each participant with brain modeling
      techniques.
