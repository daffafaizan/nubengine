      physical therapy (PT) groups (ten sessions) during two weeks. Multimodal PT program included:
      ultrasound therapy (US), transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) and massage. Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS), range of motion and (CROM) PPTs in sub-occipital and upper trapezius
      muscles were measured at baseline, at the end of treatment and at 1 month follow-up. T-tests
      and a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (RM-MANOVA) were used for VAS, CROM
      and PPTs, respectively.
