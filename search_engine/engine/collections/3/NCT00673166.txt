      paid to the staff based on performance indicators. All children < 5 years of age admitted to
      the ward will be registered and followed-up until two months after the consultation. Data on
      the level of mortality before and after the study period will be collected. Furthermore,
      interviews on quality perception of the parents will be carried out before and after the
      study.
