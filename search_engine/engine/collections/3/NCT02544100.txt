      Neonatal Neurologic Intensive Care Network in China with neonatal systematic information
      mainly including demographic, medical history, family condition, perinatal stage information,
      birth, growth & feeding status, imaging, biological samples and genomics & genetic data on
      neonates born with neonatal severe encephalopathy. It also can predict brain injury as
      cerebral function monitoring through big data and recommend appropriate treatment. There are
      seven children's hospitals from 6 provinces in China to join in the collaboration network in
      first recruiting. In addition, the following biological samples will be collected in a
      bio-bank for future studies: blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.
