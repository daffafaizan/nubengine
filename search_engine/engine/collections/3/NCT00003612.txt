        -  Compare the response rate associated with two different treatment schedules of
           paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in women with overexpressed HER-2
           growth factor receptor and metastatic breast cancer. (Schedule A closed to accrual
           effective 05/16/2003).

        -  Compare the time to progression and median survival in patients treated with these
           schedules.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these treatment schedules in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior adjuvant
      therapy (none vs less than 6 months vs at least 6 months), estrogen receptor (ER) status and
      progesterone receptor (PR) status at initial diagnosis (ER positive/PR positive or unknown vs
      ER positive/PR negative vs ER positive or unknown/PR negative), menopausal status (pre vs
      post), and performance status (0 or 1 vs 2). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      schedules.

        -  Schedule A: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over
           30 minutes and then trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of week 1.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive trastuzumab IV over 30
           minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression. (Schedule A closed to accrual effective
           05/16/2003).

        -  Schedule B: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over
           15 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-3 and trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes immediately after
           carboplatin on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive trastuzumab IV
           over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-92 patients (18-46 per treatment schedule) will be accrued
      for this study within 7-18.5 months. (Schedule A closed to accrual effective 05/16/2003).
