        -  Determine the efficacy of autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation
           for marrow reconstitution after high-dose carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and
           cyclophosphamide in children with relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the dose effect of autologous PBSC on engraftment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy mobilization comprising cytarabine IV every 12 hours
      on days 1-5. When blood counts recover, autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are
      harvested and selected for mononuclear cells, granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units,
      and CD34+ cells.

      Patients receive preparative regimen comprising carmustine IV on days -8 and -3, cytarabine
      IV every 12 hours and etoposide IV every 12 hours on days -7 to -4, and cyclophosphamide IV
      on days -2 and -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) beginning after PBSC transplantation. Male patients undergo
      radiotherapy to the testes before transplantation. Patients with a history of CNS leukemia
      undergo craniospinal irradiation before transplantation.

      Patients are followed at 100 days, 6 months, and 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
