      been reports that the weight gain is less or absent when patients are treated with Insulin
      Detemir. Patients with diabetes have increased total body sodium and increased extracellular
      volume. We hypothesize that part of the weight gain seen is due to increase in extracellular
      volume and that the lesser weight gain seen in patients treated with Detemir is due to an
      lesser increase in extracellular volume. We believe that the cause of this difference is the
      different pharmacokinetic properties of insulin Detemir. Insulin Detemir i protein bound and
      is therefore not excreted in the kidneys. This may cause less sodium reabsorption, than with
      other insulins, and therefore less increase in extracellular volume.

      We test this hypothesis by examining urinary sodium excretion, extracellular volume by GFR
      measurements, Body composition by DEXA scan, body weight, and 24 hour blood pressure.In
      patients that are changed from Insulin Insulatard to Insulin Detemir and back.
