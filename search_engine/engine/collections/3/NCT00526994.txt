      participants will be screened, and if disclosing IPV, will receive information on available
      resources in the community. In arms two and three, participants will not be screened, but one
      group will receive information on available resources in the community and the other will
      not. All three groups will be assessed for quality of life (SF-12;standardized and validated
      scale with 12 questions that measure overall health (1 item), physical functioning (2 items),
      role limitations due to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (1 item),
      energy/fatigue (1 item), social functioning (1 item), psychological distress (1 item), and
      well being (1 item) in the past 4 weeks; items are summed to form a physical health composite
      scale and a mental health composite scale; each scale is standardized to have a mean of 50
      and a standard deviation of 10 for the U.S. population with a possible range from 0 to 100;
      higher scores represent a better health state); disability; and utilization of health care
      and IPV services at baseline and at a 12 month follow-up. A pilot study, also using a
      randomized controlled trial design, will establish the feasibility, acceptability, and impact
      on disclosure rates, use of referral resources, and potential harms of three screening and
      referral strategies.

      *sample size calculation based n needed to detect a standardized effect size of 0.3 with an
      α=.05 (1-tailed)and ß=.20 if there's a 20% IPV (+) rate and 30% lost-to-follow-up rate.
