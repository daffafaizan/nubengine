      such dietary recommendations for hypertension focus on a diet rich in high K⁺ food sources
      such as fruits and vegetables. An important theme to be addressed is the safety of achieving
      high dietary K⁺ intake in hypertensive individuals who are also receiving medical therapy
      that might predispose to elevated serum K⁺ levels (hyperkalemia).

      The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of aggressively increasing dietary K⁺ on
      serum K⁺ concentrations in hypertensive individuals with intact renal function medicated with
      RAAS blocking drugs. The investigators hypothesized that dietary K⁺ supplementation would not
      provoke hyperkalemia despite treatment with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEi) or
      an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

      The investigators conducted an open controlled clinical trial in 20 hypertensive subjects
      with normal renal function who were randomized to a usual diet group (UD n=10), or a high
      potassium diet group (HKD, n= 10). Fruits and vegetables were used to increase potassium
      intake. All participants were on an ACEi or and ARB. Serum potassium concentration, 3- day
      food records and 24 Hour urine collections were completed at baseline and at the end of the
      4-week study.
