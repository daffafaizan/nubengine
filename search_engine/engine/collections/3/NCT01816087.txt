      care institution and a specialised geriatric unit that aims to develop a brief assessment
      tool (BAT) adapted to the primary care setting. The objective of this study is to assess the
      performances of the BAT to identify major geriatric syndromes: cognitive impairment; mood
      disorder; functional impairment; urinary incontinence; malnutrition; gait and balance
      impairment; osteoporosis; hearing impairment; visual impairment.

      In order to achieve our objective, we plan to recruit 155 patients > 70 years old in primary
      care settings for which primary care physicians will perform the BAT (composed of specific
      questions and clinical exams). At the end of the consultation, the primary care physician
      will fill a questionnaire where the absence/presence of syndromes will be recorded (according
      to the findings of the BAT). Each patient will be then seen a second time by expert
      geriatricians that will perform a full geriatric evaluation (90 minutes). This will allow to
      calculate the performances of the intervention (BAT) in terms of sensibility /specificity,...
