      safety of HIPEC. The target population for this study is patients with primary or recurrence
      ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers undergoing CRS. 'Platinum-sensitive' recurrence
      is defined as recurrence 6 months after the completion of the primary platinum-based
      chemotherapy. A single dose of lobaplatin 40mg/m2 will be administered via HIPEC , and will
      be administered at the time of surgery, 3 days after surgery and 5 days after surgery.
      Patients of group A will undergo CRS plus HIPEC and then go on to receive standard
      platinum-based combination doublet intravenous chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel,
      carboplatin and gemcitabine, or carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin) for 6 cycles. Patients
      of group B will undergo CRS and then go on to intravenous chemotherapy.
