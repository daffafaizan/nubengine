      style changes, pharmaceutical treatment is a keystone in the treatment of cardiovascular
      disease. Despite the strong evidence for the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy, less
      than half of the people eligible are treated. With specific medication searches in the
      community pharmacy database, an easy tool for detecting patients who are undertreated is
      available. Based on this tool, a pharmaceutical care model for improving underprescription
      and treatment persistence regarding lipid-lowering medication in patients with cardiovascular
      disease was constructed.

      Moreover, it is not known yet how to implement this pharmaceutical care model in community
      pharmacies effectively. With multifaceted interventions the behaviour of health professionals
      can be changed. In this study the effectiveness of a maximal support strategy, including
      interactive educational meetings, reminders, audit and feedback, is compared to a minimal
      implementation strategy.
