2366. the excretion of oestrone,pregnanediol and pregnanetriol in breastcancer patients.  ii. effect of ovariectomy,ovarian irradiation and corticos-teroids.the urinary excretion of oestrone,pregnanediol and pregnanetriol was determinedin breast cancer patients at differentstages of their endocrine treatment.  theresults demonstrate that corticosteroidsin substitution doses (cortisone 50 mg. dailyor prednisone 10 mg. daily, divided in 4daily doses) are very effective in depressingthe excretion of all 3 steroids in postmenopausalpatients.  this is in agreement withthe clinical impression that these easily toleratedsmall doses of corticosteroids havethe same therapeutic effect as adrenalectomy inpatients with breast cancer.  theresults indicate that the ovaries may contributeto the production of oestrogens formany years after the menopause, and that thisproduction is depressed by ovarianirradiation.  this is in agreement with the clinicalobservation that ovarian irra-diation has a therapeutic value in postmenopausalwomen with breast cancer.
