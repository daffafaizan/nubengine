      participation in HealthCall to brief motivational interviewing alone on non-injection drug
      and alcohol use. HealthCall involves 2-3 minutes of daily smartphone use to track drug use,
      drinking behaviors and other aspects of health, followed by personalized feedback in a graph
      after 30 and 60 days of using the smartphone.
