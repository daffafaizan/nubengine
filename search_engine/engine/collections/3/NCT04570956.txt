      risk of breast cancer (BC) (~1-2 % per year). Over two decades ago, placebo-controlled
      randomized trials established that oral tamoxifen (20 mg/day) reduces breast cancer risk by
      50% in generally defined high risk women, with ~70% reduction in women at high risk
      specifically due to atypical hyperplasia.[1] Years later, the side effects and toxicity of
      oral tamoxifen at 20 mg/day remain a significant barrier to its uptake and longterm
      compliance.[2, 3] To address the issue of toxicity, two main strategies have been pursued: 1)
      using a lower dose of oral tamoxifen, and 2) using a topical formulation of tamoxifen to
      avoid systemic side effects. The investigators will perform a prospective study of women with
      AH or LCIS who will take a short course of prevention therapy; breast tissue samples will be
      evaluated pre- and post-therapy to identify and evaluate very early biomarkers of response.
      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate short-term changes in background breast tissue
      induced by either low-dose oral tamoxifen or topical 4-OHT gel in women with AH or LCIS.
