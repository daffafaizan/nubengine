    
      This is a prospective project in collecting and assessing clinical outcomes data related to
      molecular profiling of tumors based on samples from peripheral blood, primary tumor, and
      adjacent normal colorectal tissue.

      Objectives:

        1. Validation of predictive value of known markers CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)
           and microsatellite instability (MSI) in the response to 5-fluorouracil-based
           chemotherapy in patients with stage III colorectal cancer.

        2. Exploratory evaluation of the potential predictive values of known genetic variations
           including, but not limited to, KRAS mutations, BRAF mutations, PIK3A mutations, and EGFR
           mutations, etc.

        3. Exploratory identification and evaluation of the predictive value of novel methylation
           aberrations identified by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.

        4. Exploratory identification and evaluation of the predictive value of novel genetic
           aberrations discovered by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or genome-wide association study
           (GWAS).

      Outline:

      Blood is collected at baseline and examined for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
      expression level of specific gene. Tumor and corresponding normal tissue at surgical
      resection and assessed for gene methylations, mutations, and expressions.
