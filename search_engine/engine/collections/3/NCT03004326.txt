      forms of idiopathic vasculitis. Patients with cutaneous manifestations of vasculitis will be
      evaluated by teams of primary vasculitis care providers and Dermatologists in order to
      facilitate optimal selection of patients and sampling of lesions.

      A punch skin biopsy at a site of active vasculitis will be the source of material for
      histopathologic and transcriptomic evaluation. The histopathology of cutaneous vasculitis
      will be characterized using a standardized approach.
