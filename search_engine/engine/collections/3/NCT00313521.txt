      Primary

        -  Determine tumor response to adjuvant thiotepa followed by radiotherapy in pediatric
           patients with newly diagnosed malignant astrocytic tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of thiotepa in these patients.

        -  Determine the variability in thiotepa metabolism by measuring plasma and cerebrospinal
           fluid pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa in these patients.

        -  Develop a phase II study framework model, to determine the chemosensitivity to new,
           single-agent regimens in the treatment of high-grade (malignant) astrocytic tumors,
           including anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, giant cell glioblastoma, and
           gliosarcoma.

        -  Determine the incidence of distant neuraxial metastases in patients at the time of
           relapse.

        -  Determine the 1-year disease-free survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by age (3-15 vs 16-20 years of
      age).

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive thiotepa IV continuously over 168 hours on days 1-7.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses. Patients then proceed to
           radiotherapy after blood counts recover.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for
           approximately 6 weeks.

        -  Post-radiation chemotherapy: Patients with complete, partial, or objective response, or
           stable disease after 2 courses of thiotepa may receive thiotepa alone for up to 8 more
           courses at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
