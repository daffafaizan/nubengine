    
      This is a non-interventional, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team
      work on a medical research study), prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient
      number of persons over a sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates
      subsequent to the selection of the study group), observational (clinical study in which
      participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the
      investigator does not assign participants to specific interventions) study. This
      observational study will focus on chemotherapy-naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) participants initiating abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) therapy for the treatment
      of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease. All treatment decisions will be made at the
      discretion of the Investigator per clinical practice and in accordance with approved local
      Product Monograph and treatment algorithms. The planned study duration will be three years
      from initial first participant enrolment. Participants will be followed for a maximum of 72
      weeks from the time of initiation of abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) treatment, or up to the
      time of early study withdrawal/termination. Data will be collected in both paper-based and
      electronic data capture (eDC) and primarily collected for PROs and clinical outcomes.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
