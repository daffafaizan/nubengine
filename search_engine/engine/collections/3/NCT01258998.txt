      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in patients
      with relapsed/refractory lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the progression free survival (PFS) of MK-2206 in patients with relapsed/refractory
      lymphoma.

      II. Assess the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 monotherapy. III. Examine pretreatment
      phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (pAkt) protein expression by
      immunohistochemistry, and correlate the results with treatment response.

      IV. Examine the effect of therapy on serum cytokines and chemokines that regulate the
      tumor-promoting inflammatory process and/or immunity in patients with relapsed/refractory
      lymphoma, and correlate the results with treatment response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) once weekly. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
