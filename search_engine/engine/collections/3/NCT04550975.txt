      dementia-a global epidemic. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the only
      non-pharmacological therapy recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence for improving cognition for mild to moderate dementia. However, there is little
      guidance on how to maximise cognition for severe dementia. Advanced Cognitive Stimulation
      Therapy (ACST) will be the first evidence-based complex intervention for moderate to severe
      dementia developed within the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework and building upon
      CST's key principles. This feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to 1) evaluate
      the feasibility of ACST 2) explore if ACST can improve the cognitive function, and QoL, as
      well as other outcomes including behaviour, engagement, and communication, for people with
      moderate to severe dementia. A sample of 32 participants will be recruited, where 16 will be
      randomly allocated to ACST, and 16 to treatment as usual (TAU). Data will be collected pre
      and post the 7-week intervention period. Improving cognition and QoL for people with moderate
      to severe dementia is vital because dementia's prevalence is projected to reach 152 million
      by 2050, resulting in excessive excess disability.
