      shorter hospitalization and a more rapid return to daily activities. Robot-assisted
      laparoscopic surgery have facilitated a higher proportion of minimally invasive surgery first
      and foremost within gynecologic oncology.It is not clear whether or not this is true for less
      advanced surgery where a vaginal approach or a traditional laparoscopic approach is possible.

      Robot-assisted surgery is associated with additional cost due to investment and more
      expensive surgical equipment. The study is performed to investigate whether or not performing
      hysterectomy for benign conditions with robotic surgery will be advantageous in terms of
      shorter operating time, less complications, less conversions to open surgery, and shorter
      hospital stay in comparison to other minimally invasive procedures such as vaginal
      hysterectomy and traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy.
