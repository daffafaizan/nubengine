    
      The MRI guided stereotactic radiotherapy of hepatic lesions with an MRIdianÂ® Linac tested in
      this study will allow:

        -  to see the tumor target in live with a non-irradiating imaging

        -  a reduction of the volume of non-tumor liver irradiated at high doses

        -  An progession of the dose delivered to the tumor lesion to allow tumor control to be
           increased.

        -  a new dosimetric plan adapted each day to the new contours to avoid a risk of severe
           digestive toxicity while ensuring optimal treatment, at an appropriate dose, of the
           tumor volume.
