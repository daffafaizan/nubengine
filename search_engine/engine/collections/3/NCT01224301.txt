      influenza vaccination for all children 6 months to 18 years of age. While many school-aged
      children will be vaccinated in the medical home, the large number of children for whom the
      vaccine is now recommended exceeds the capacity of many primary care settings. Schools have
      been recommended as potential sites for influenza vaccination, yet little is known about the
      feasibility, implementation requirements, costs, or effectiveness of school-based influenza
      vaccination (SIV) programs. This project will implement and rigorously evaluate the
      feasibility, acceptability, billing and reimbursement components, costs, cost-effectiveness,
      and overall effectiveness of an SIV program that targets diverse populations and different
      intensity of interventions.
