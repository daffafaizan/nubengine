    
      This is a phase I study of melanoma tumor antigen peptide vaccines. The nine amino acid
      peptides representing HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitope of the melanoma antigen, gp100 will be
      administered to patients emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant, (IFA). The study is
      designed to evaluate the toxicity, immunologic effects and potential therapeutic role of
      repeated doses of gp100 peptide vaccines administered subcutaneously.

      Immune reactivity to the gp100 epitope peptides will be monitored in all patients by analysis
      of melanoma-specific T cell precursor frequency prior to and after immunization.
