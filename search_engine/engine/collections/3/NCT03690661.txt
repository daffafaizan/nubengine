      intervention game to an placebo control game, and will assess outcomes at multiple time
      points (pre-, post-, 6-month follow-up). These outcomes will include a wide range of
      behaviors that are measured along a continuum from controlled lab-based tasks to real-world
      social interactions between dyads. The aims are evaluating 1) changes in the target
      mechanisms (social attention to faces, sensitivity to eye gaze cues) for the intervention
      relative to active control group, 2) engagement of intermediate mechanisms, including
      face-processing behaviors and real-world social communication behaviors, and 3) the relation
      between engagement of the target and intermediate mechanisms and symptom outcomes. Evidence
      of changes in autism social symptoms resulting from changing visual attention to faces and/or
      improved ability to understand eye gaze cues will provide clear evidence to inform a "go"
      decision about the therapeutic target for further clinical development.
