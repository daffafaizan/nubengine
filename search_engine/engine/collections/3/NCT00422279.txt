      include lack of adequate bone volume limiting the possibility of optimal patient treatment.
      Typical limitations include severely resorbed alveolar ridges (height and width) in patients
      following long-term edentulism. In other cases, the alveolar ridge may have become
      compromised due to advanced periodontal disease, traumatic extractions, and other trauma
      disallowing Endosseous dental implant placement to meet aesthetic and functional demands.
      Conversely, placing Endosseous dental implants to optimally meet aesthetic and functional
      demands in sites exhibiting alveolar ridge aberrations often results in partial exposure of
      the Endosseous dental implant bone-anchoring surface. In some cases clinicians have attempted
      to overcome the deficient bone volume by augmenting the anticipated Endosseous dental implant
      site using bone biomaterials, commonly originating from human or animal cadaveric sources, or
      synthetic biomaterials. The biomaterials have been used alone and in combinations including
      autologous bone grafts. Non-resorbable and bioresorbable barrier devices have been used to
      prevent dislocation of implanted biomaterials. The ability of the Bone Inductive Implant to
      form new bone above the level of the resorbed alveolar ridge to immerse the exposed portion
      of the Endosseous dental implant in bone (Treatment group 1) and the ability of the Bone
      Inductive Implant to induce bone formation around stable Endosseous dental implants placed
      into tooth extraction sockets (Treatment group 2) without the use of bone grafts, bone
      biomaterials, or barrier devices will be assessed.
