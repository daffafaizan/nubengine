      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT for insomnia, CBT for pain, and combined insomnia & pain)
      diminishes insomnia symptoms in patients with chronic pain compared to a group not receiving
      CBT. This will be evaluated in a randomized trial with before and after evaluations using
      standard sleep diary measures of sleep continuity.

      The investigators' secondary goal is to assess whether treatment responses to any of the
      interventions are associated with alterations in immune function.

      The investigators' tertiary goals are to evaluate whether improved sleep has effects on
      patient reports of pain severity, frequency, and tolerability as well as on mood and quality
      of life.
