      not only in the early and recurrent phases of the disease, but also in progressive multiple
      sclerosis. However, its role on the immune and nervous systems has hardly been studied,
      although these studies suggest that CoA may exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective
      actions. Thus, the objective is to better understand/describe how cladribine acts during MS
      and to demonstrate whether CoA: (1) is able to effectively modulate pro-inflammatory immune
      processes and (2) has powerful neuroprotective properties. Ultimately, it will provide proof
      of concept that cladribine can be used not only in the early but also in the progressive
      phase of MS.

      To address this hypothesis, the goal is to study the beneficial
      immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory effects of cladribine on multiple sclerosis.

      The main objective of this project is therefore to study and thus better understand the
      immunomodulatory / anti-inflammatory effects of cladribine during multiple sclerosis.

      Most current and developing therapies targeting the immune system have no effect on the
      progressive phase of MS, during which neurodegeneration plays a predominant role. As
      mentioned above, the very promising results of clinical trials with cladribine tablets for
      the early and progressive phase of the disease have revealed immunomodulatory properties and
      suggested potential neuroprotective effects.

      It therefore plans to further dissect one of these two parameters by designing in vitro
      studies with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and MS patients.
