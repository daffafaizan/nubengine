      individual responses to naltrexone. A critical question remains: under what circumstances and
      for which patients will naltrexone be most beneficial? Recent work at our center provides
      evidence that the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene polymorphism A118G (Asn40Asp) imparts a
      significant change in treatment response. We have shown that patients with Asn40 variant
      (absence of heavy drinking -73.9% v/s 49% response). To further consolidate our knowledge, we
      wish to test the relationship between A118G polymorphism and the subjective/objective
      measures to alcohol among alcoholics treated with naltrexone. This work is focused on
      subjects of European or Asian decent as the A118G polymorphism occurs in less than 1% of
      those of African decent.

      Up to 40 subjects will be recruited. The subjects were admitted to the UPenn Translational
      Research Center and receive two alcohol challenge sessions after pretreatment with naltrexone
      or placebo.
