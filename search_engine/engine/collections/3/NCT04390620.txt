    
      In this non-interventional study (NIS) a polyamide non-absorbable suture (Dafilon) will be
      evaluated for oral surgery (mucosal closure after e.g. wisdom teeth extraction, implant
      surgery, etc.) in adult patients.

      The aim of this NIS is to collect systematically and proactively different clinical
      parameters regarding safety, effectiveness and performance of Dafilon suture material under
      the daily routine clinical practice when is intended to be used for oral surgery. All
      patients enrolled will be prospectively followed until suture removal, which takes place 10 Â±
      5 days post-operatively (and post-operatively depending on routine clinical practice of each
      hospital).
