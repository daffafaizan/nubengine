        -  Determine the overall survival in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung
           cancer immunized with adjuvant mutant p53 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells
           after standard therapy.

        -  Assess the safety and immunological efficacy of this regimen in terms of inducing or
           boosting a mutant p53-specific immune response in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo p53 gene mutation analysis. Patients without a suitable gene
      mutation receive no vaccination. Patients with a suitable p53 gene mutation receive mutant
      p53 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells IV over 1-2 minutes weekly for 5 weeks.
      Patients achieving an immune response with no evidence of progressive disease may receive
      additional vaccinations every 2 months for a maximum of 10 immunizations.

      Patients are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 120 patients (40 on the vaccination arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
