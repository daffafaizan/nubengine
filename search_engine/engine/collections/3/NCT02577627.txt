      predictions by comparing them to the actual patients outcome. Study population will be
      composed of patients diagnosed with advanced stage disease, and divided according to the
      indications and treatment protocols. Retrospective data collected from patients' files will
      enable Optimata to compare the PrediCare Technology predictions of the pattern of metastatic
      and primary tumor growth and dynamics of oncological markers over time with the actual
      outcomes in each individual patient.
