      hospitals from different parts of China will take part in this study, and about 20,000
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are inadequately controlled with OADs and
      willing to accept basal insulin (BI) treatment will be consecutively enrolled during a 12
      months period.

      The study participants will include at baseline (0 month), 3 month and end point (6 month) to
      collect the study information. The project will probably last for about 18 months.
