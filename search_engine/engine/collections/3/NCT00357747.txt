      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and define the recommended phase II dose of
           AEG35156 in combination with docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of AEG35156 and docetaxel and
           define duration and reversibility of those toxicities.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen.

        -  Assess, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in patients with
           measurable disease.

        -  Assess the pharmacodynamic effects of AEG35156 administration on X-linked inhibitor of
           apoptosis protein (XIAP) levels and apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and,
           in selected patients, in tumor tissue.

        -  Evaluate M30/M65 cytokeratin 18 level, a marker of apoptosis/necrosis of epithelial
           tumors, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of AEG35156.

      Patients receive AEG35156 IV continuously on days -2 and -1. Patients then receive AEG35156
      IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Beginning with course 2, patients also
      receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AEG35156 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Blood is collected at baseline and periodically during study treatment for pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic assessment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
