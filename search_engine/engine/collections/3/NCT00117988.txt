      I. Determine the complete and partial response rates and time to treatment failure in
      patients with relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or
      classical Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the biologic effect of
      this drug on selected molecular targets in primary lymphoma cells from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type
      (anaplastic large cell lymphoma vs mantle cell lymphoma vs Hodgkin's lymphoma).

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 1 hour on days 1,
      4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing disease regression after
      completion of 8 courses may receive 2 additional courses of treatment beyond their maximal
      response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression.
