      preliminary efficacy of a Smartphone-based CBT treatment for adults with BDD. This project
      aims to solve two healthcare problems: poor access to empirically-supportive treatment for
      BDD, and challenges of generalizing CBT skills outside therapy sessions. Inadequate treatment
      access is due to limited professionals offering this specialized treatment, economic
      barriers, and shame preventing sufferers from seeking in-person care. Mobile app-based CBT
      would solve this access gap by addressing each of these barriers. Among those who obtain CBT,
      practicing skills outside of therapy is critical for treatment effectiveness, as BDD symptoms
      occur around-the-clock and can be most impairing at home. However, BDD patients struggle to
      use skills without therapists' in-person support. App-based CBT that provides on-hand skills
      coaching addresses this treatment generalization challenge.

      This study involves developing the app-based CBT for BDD treatment, and then investigating
      the initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the app-based treatment
      in an open pilot trial (N = 10), consisting of 12-weeks of active treatment plus a 6-month
      follow up period.
