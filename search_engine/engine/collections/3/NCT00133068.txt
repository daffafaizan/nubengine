      interventions aimed at reducing barriers to blood pressure (BP) control in an indigent and
      African-American population. Specifically, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial
      comparing BP control using either: (1) reimbursing patients for filling prescriptions
      (reimbursement arm); (2) a computer-based behavioral intervention (behavioral arm); (3) both
      the reimbursement and behavioral arms (combined arms); or (4) neither.

      The ultimate goal of this study is to reduce the incidence of HTN-related CVD among these
      populations thereby reducing cardiovascular health disparities. Specific aims of the study
      are to:

        1. test whether receiving money each time the patient fills a prescription for medications
           improves BP control by a clinically significant amount.

           H1: Reimbursing patients for filling prescriptions will significantly improve BP
           control.

        2. test whether a computer-based behavioral intervention improves BP control by a
           clinically significant amount.

           H2: A computer-based behavioral intervention will significantly improve BP control.

        3. test whether the two interventions are more effective in improving BP control than
           either alone.

           H3: The effect of improving BP control of administering both interventions together will
           be greater than the sum of the individual effects of each intervention alone.

        4. examine the relative cost effectiveness of reimbursement for filling prescriptions, a
           computer-based behavioral intervention, and the combination of the two.

      H4: Both interventions will be cost-effective relative to other commonly-covered services.
