      second leading cause of cancer-related death. Unfortunately, the therapeutic strategies are
      still limited for HCC. For HCC patients at advanced stage, up to now, sorafenib and
      regorafenib are applied for palliative therapy to prolong the patients' life. PD-1 blockade
      has became a promising immunotherapeutic strategy in many cancers. While it showed limited
      efficacy in liver cancer. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC) has been widely studied as
      a new anti-tumor drug and recent study showed that polyIC and PD-L1 mAb has a quite
      synergetic effect on the treatment of HCC. This study is aimed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the combination of PolyIC and PD-1 mAb in unresectable late-stage HCC patients.
