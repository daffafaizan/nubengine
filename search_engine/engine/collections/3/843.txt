the haemophilic pseudotumouror haemophilic subperiosteal haematomathe case history of a haemophiliac in whom a large haematoma of the thigh wastreated by amputation of the limb is described.examination of the available radiographs and of the histology led to theconclusion that the cyst was subperiosteal in origin.evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that haemophilic pseudotumoursare always associated with subperiosteal haemorrhage, and that thosehaemophilic cysts which are confined to muscle have little or no effect on theadjacent bone.
