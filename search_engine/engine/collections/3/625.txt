evolution of a characteristic speech disorder injuvenile cerebral lipidosisjuvenile cerebral lipidosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency inthis country, especially in schools for the visually handicapped.  themanifestations of rapidly developing loss of vision, seizures, muscularrigidity, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and eeg abnormalities are well known inthis disorder.  a speech disorder described as a "lolling, stammering speech"was mentioned by sjogren (1931) in his comprehensive descriptionof juvenile amaurotic idiocy, but this has not been emphasized inrecent descriptions.  this report, based upon an analysis of 5 cases,describes the evolution of a characteristic form of speech pathology thatis invariably present in juvenile cerebral lipidosis.the initial speech abnormality seen early in the disorder is a hesitancy ofspeech and occasional repetition of words.  in time, dysarthria becomesevident with slurring, nasality and impairment of phonation similar to thatseen in pseudobulbar palsy.  in addition to the dysarthria, a highlycharacteristic perseverative speech appears which often has a close resemblanceto true stuttering.  this stuttering-like speech has been observed in 4 of the5 cases at some time during the course of their illnesses.  as the speechpatterns deteriorate, the patient becomes less communicative and finally lapsesinto mutism.  the speech disorder is often the most disabling aspect of thissyndrome.
