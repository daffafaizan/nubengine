      topical antifungal solution of itraconazole. CRS patients that meet the defined inclusion
      criteria will begin topical itraconazole antifungal irrigations on Day 1. This will consist
      of Itraconazole in Sterile Water 100 mg/1000 ml, irrigating each nostril with 20 ml of
      solution twice daily, with a bulb syringe as directed. The patient will return on Day 7 for
      repeat examination and nasal secretion collection. Two patients will be randomly selected to
      have blood drawn at the completion of day 7 testing to determine the concentration of
      itraconazole in the blood.
