      Diabetic patients have a 25% risk to develop foot ulcers during their life, and one
      diabetes-induced amputation is performed every 30 seconds in the world. Textbook-case of
      perforating foot ulcer (Malum Perforans Pedis) is caused by a mechanical impairment : only a
      thoroughly observed discharge may lead to good wound care and, ultimately, healing. Thus,
      this study proposes the utilization of an nonremovable windowed Fiberglass Cast Boot, a
      technique which has led to healing in 6 to 8 weeks for 95% of neuropathic foot ulcers treated
      that way.

      As 80% of amputations are caused by non-healing ulcers, it appears obvious that enhancing
      foot wounds healing could reduce amputation rate and in that way fairly improve diabetic
      patients' quality of life.
