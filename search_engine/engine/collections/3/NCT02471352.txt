    
      Background:

        -  Skin diseases represent one of the most common medical problems in the-United States,
           affecting 1 in 3 people at any given time.

        -  Complex interactions between genetic background and the environment are-relevant to
           understanding skin disease.

        -  By studying dermatoses, we may gain insight into the complex host
           environment-interactions that give rise to or exacerbate these skin-conditions, and into
           links between inflammation and cancer.

      Objective:

      -To procure biologic samples for exploratory cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic
      biological studies from subjects with dermatologic conditions, subjects at risk for
      developing dermatologic conditions and healthy volunteers in the support of NIH biomedical
      studies

      Eligibility:

      -Subjects with or at risk for developing dermatologic diseases, family members of subjects
      with dermatologic diseases, or healthy volunteers, including adults and children.

      Design:

        -  The purpose of this study is to examine, in an exploratory fashion, a variety of
           biologic assays relevant to the investigation of dermatologic diseases.

        -  Approximately 50 subjects are anticipated to consent to the study each year with an
           accrual ceiling of 500 consented subjects planned over 10 years.
