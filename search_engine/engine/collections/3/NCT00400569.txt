      therapy dose for Sunitinib malate, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor. The study drug will be
      taken orally once daily on days 1 through 28 of each 42 day cycle. Treatment will be
      continued until there is either disease progression or cumulative/acute toxicity which in the
      opinion of the treating physician or the trial Principal Investigator (PI) compromises the
      ability of the patient to receive treatment or the patient desires to stop treatment.

      All patients with unresectable or metastatic STS: leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma,
      and MFH seen at the Moffitt Cancer Center will be screened for eligibility to be enrolled in
      the study.

      An office visit will be required before the beginning of every cycle every 6 weeks to assess
      toxicity and for physical examination. Complete blood count (CBC) and differential,
      comprehensive metabolic panel, and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained at every
      scheduled visit.
