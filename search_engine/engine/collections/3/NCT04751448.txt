      prior to scheduled colonoscopy or surgery along with dietary intake and blood samples; the
      relative abundance of microbes from those samples along with dietary data will be used to
      predict the presence or absence and severity of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Microbiome and
      diet based predictions from blinded samples will be combined to map the diet-microbiome
      changes during treatment to the changes in immune markers and risk of chemotherapy-induced
      diarrhea.
