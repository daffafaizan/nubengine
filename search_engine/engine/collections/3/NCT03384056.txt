      chosen device to enable the investigators to analyze the performance parameters of the two
      devices with greater authority. The study will be done on anesthetized paralyzed adult female
      patients undergoing elective gynecological operations that require neuromuscular block but
      not necessarily tracheal intubation. The investigators will recruit 40 adult female(18-55
      years old, ASAI&II) patients to a prospective randomized crossover clinical trial. Patients
      with history of upper respiratory tract infections, obstructive sleep apnea , potentially
      full stomach( trauma, morbid obesity BMI> 35, pregnancy, history of gastric regurgitation and
      heart burn), those with esophageal reflux (hiatus hernia), and those of coagulation disorders
      will be excluded from the study. All patients will be assessed pre-operatively El-Ganzouri
      airway score to assess the expected difficulty of intubation and patients with airway scores
      â‰¥ 5 will be excluded from the study.The patients will be randomly allocated into two
      groups(the SP-Blocker group & the P-LMA group; each group is 40 patients) using computer
      generated program . An online randomization program (http://www.randomizer.org) will be used
      to generate random list and to allocate patients into the study groups. Random allocation
      numbers will be concealed in opaque closed envelops. The patient and investigator assessing
      study outcomes will all be blinded to the study groups allocation.
