      efficacy of haemorrhoid embolisation. Patients with advanced hemorrhoidal disease (grade
      II-IV) will be identified through the colorectal clinic with a recruitment target of 24
      patients. The duration of patient participation in this study is 24 months. During this time
      the patient will have to attend 4 appointments (including the treatment session).

      All cases in this study will be performed as day case procedures. The patients will be
      admitted to the interventional radiology day unit in the morning, where a standard
      pre-assessment will take place. The main intervention will be the embolisation of their
      hemorrhoidal arteries. The embolisation will be performed using a standard approach with a
      right femoral puncture and after inserting a 5 Fr introducer sheath. The inferior mesenteric
      artery will be catheterized using a Simmons catheter (radiofocus-Terumo). The superior rectal
      arteries will be then catheterized with a rapid transit microcatheter Progreat microcatheter
      (Radiofocus-Terumo) and then embolised with a number of coils. The arteries will be packed
      with coils until there is complete blood flow stasis within the target artery bilaterally.
      The technical success of the procedure will be assessed by achieving stasis of blood flow
      distally to the site of the embolisation. This will be assessed fluoroscopically. CE marked
      coils will be used for the embolisation of the arteries feeding the haemorrhoids.

      Following the procedure, patients will be discharged to their usual place of residence after
      6 hours of observations in the interventional radiology day unit. The patients will be
      followed up in the colorectal clinic after 3 months, 12 months and 24 months.
