      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus in combination with imatinib
      mesylate in patients with synovial sarcoma. (Phase I) II. To determine the overall response
      rate (RR = CR + PR). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine RR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). (Phase I) II.
      To determine predictors of response. (Phase II) III. To obtain tissue biopsy and plasma
      samples for correlative studies pre- and post-treatment. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily and imatinib mesylate PO once daily on
      days 1-28. Course repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients undergo blood and tumor tissue sample collection at baseline and
      periodically during study for correlative biomarker and protein expression studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.
