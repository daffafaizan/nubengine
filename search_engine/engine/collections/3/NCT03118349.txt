    
      Open label, nonrandomized, dose escalation trial of MVT-5873/MVT-1075 to evaluate safety,
      dosimetry, determine the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose, and define the pharmacokinetics of
      MVT-1075. The population consists of subjects with CA19-9 positive malignancies (i.e.,
      predominately pancreatic adenocarcinoma) who may benefit from a CA19-9-based
      radioimmunotherapy.

      The study will utilize a 3+3 study design to identify the MTD. The RP2D will be no higher
      than the MTD. An expansion group will receive MVT-5873/MVT-1075 at the RP2D in order to
      obtain initial estimates of response and additional information on safety.
