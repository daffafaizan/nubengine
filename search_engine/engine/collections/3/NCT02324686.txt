      patients often take warfarin to reduce this risk. Warfarin is a drug that is used to prevent
      clots in the bloodstream. The dose of warfarin varies from person to person, and its effect
      is measured using a blood test called the international normalized ratio (INR). In most
      patients with atrial fibrillation the goal is to keep the INR between 2 and 3. Patients on
      hemodialysis often have unstable INR levels. Vitamin K supplementation has been shown to
      improve INR control in patients on warfarin but has not yet been studied in hemodialysis
      patients.

      In this study, patients on hemodialysis receiving warfarin for atrial fibrillation will
      receive vitamin K 400 mcg orally three times a week on dialysis days for 4 months. INR levels
      in the four months before and the four months while receiving vitamin K will be reviewed.

      The primary end point will look at INR stability and be measured by calculating the standard
      deviation of INR values before and after receiving vitamin K. The goal of this study is to
      determine whether vitamin K supplementation improves INR control in patients on hemodialysis
      taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation.
