      and arise or recur in adults. A consequence of an infection and/or Eustachian tube
      dysfunction, it manifests as an effusion that disrupts the normal impedance matching function
      of tympanic membrane-ossicular chain system. Eustachian tube dysfunction prevents the
      equilibration of middle ear pressures and drainage of the accumulated effusion. It is thought
      that middle ear status modulates the function of the Eustachian tube via afferent signals
      processed centrally resulting in changes in its tonus or muscular function. This pilot study
      of right-handed 21-35 year olds of either sex will validate a published fMRI method for
      visualizing cortical brain activation in response to external ear canal pressure changes
      (N=5). The outcome measure is intensity changes of the cortex associated with applied
      stimuli.
