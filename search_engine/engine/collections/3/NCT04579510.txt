      response for cVDPV2 also offers the opportunity to close immunity gaps to polioviruses types
      1 and 3. Furthermore, GPEI might have to respond to two poliovirus outbreaks in the same
      geography. For either scenario, it would be important to get data on the immunogenicity of
      co-administered nOPV2 and bOPV, compared to either vaccine given alone.

      This clinical trial assesses and compares the immunogenicity of nOPV2 given with or without
      bOPV. Healthy infants 6 weeks of age will be enrolled in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and randomized to
      one of three study arms Ã¢ " Arm A: nOPV2 only, Arm B: nOPV2 and bOPV, or Arm C: bOPV only.
      Infants will be followed-up until 18 weeks of age through clinic and household visits. Blood
      specimens will be collected to test for immunological response. Stool specimens will be
      collected from infant vaccine recipients and one sibling household contact each to assess
      viral recombinants and nOPV2 household transmission.
