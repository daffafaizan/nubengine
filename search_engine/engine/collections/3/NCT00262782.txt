        -  Identify prognostic factors that predict a short survival in patients with stage 0-II
           B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine or observation only.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to risk (high risk vs
      low risk). Patients in the low-risk group undergo observation only. Patients in the high-risk
      group are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 880 patients will be accrued for this study.
