lactate and pyruvate in the brain of rats during hyperventilation .experiments on anesthetized and curarized rats under artificialventilation show that during hyperventilation lactate and pyruvate aremarkedly increased both in blood and in brain . the lactate/pyruvateratio which remains in blood the same as in control conditions, issystematically decreased in brain . during hypoxia (ventilation with 7oxygen in nitrogen) lactate rises markedly in blood and in brain . thelactate/pyruvate ratio which is strongly increased in blood shows asmall rise in brain . these observations could indicate that a differentmechanism is responsible for the rise of lactate in brain during hypoxiaand hyperventilation . the important augmentation of lactate in brainduring hyperventilation can give an explanation for the delayed risewhich is seen in the lactate level in cerebrospinal fluid in theseconditions .
