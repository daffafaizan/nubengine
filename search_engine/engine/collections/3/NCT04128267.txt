        -  To correlate structural and functional MRI signature with one of three pain phenotypes
           in head and neck cancer survivors: 1) no pain, 2) central pain, and 3) nociceptive pain.

        -  To correlate the presence of chronic systemic symptoms with pain phenotype

      Exploratory objectives:

      - DNA, RNA, and plasma will be collected for genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies.
      Results will be vertically integrated along with the results of clinical studies described
      within this protocol to identify targets for future correlative studies.
