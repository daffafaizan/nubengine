      for gastric examination. However, there still exist blind spots under MCCG, particularly in
      the esophagus and duodenum. Although the anatomy of the esophagus and duodenum can be the
      main cause, MCCG still needs technical improvement. In addition, the gastric examination time
      under MCCG can be further optimized.

      Therefore, a new-generation MCCG is developed with a higher frame rate improved from 0.5-2 to
      0.5-8 frames per second, image resolution improved from 480 x 480 to 720 x 720, view angle
      improved from 140° to 150°, wireless anti-jamming technology is applied as a more effective
      and stable information transmission method.

      This is a prospective, single-centered, blinded randomized controlled pilot study. Subjects
      receiving MCCG at Changhai Hospital will be randomly allocated into two groups with a ratio
      of 1:1 before the procedure, the first-generation or the second-generation MCCG. After
      passage through the esophagus, the gastric examination and transpyloric passage of the
      capsule is conducted under magnetic steering, and then examination is continued in the small
      bowel under intestinal peristalsis.
