      participants (i.e. students, teachers) will be recruited from 6 regions in Tanzania. In each
      region two primary schools from different districts will be included. From each school 80
      pupils and minimum 20 teachers will be recruited. The final sample will comprise 960 pupils
      in the age-range between 9 and 12 years and at least 240 teachers from 12 different primary
      schools.

      From each region one primary schools will be randomly allocated to the intervention group
      (that will receive the ICC-T intervention training) and the control group (that will receive
      no training). The study will have two data assessment points: baseline assessment prior to
      the intervention and follow-up assessment three months after the intervention. In addition,
      feasibility data will be assessed in the intervention group at the beginning and the end of
      the intervention.

      Study measures will cover the following topics: socio-demographic data, common disciplinary
      measure used at school, attitudes towards violent discipline measures, students' mental
      health problems.
