      providing informed consent, participants will be questioned using standardized questionnaires
      assessing symptoms of reflux, dysphagia, gastrointestinal symptom burden and depression.
      Participants will be tested using our advanced protocol for high resolution esophageal
      manometry. This protocol includes individual liquid swallows, free drinking of water, a
      standardized test meal (200g rice) and a postprandial observational period. Normal values for
      liquid and solid swallows will be determined.
