      registered at a public university between December 2018 and March 2019. The sample of the
      study included 78 second grade students who gave consent after being informed about the aim
      of the study and who met the inclusion criteria. Control (n=39) and experimental (n=39)
      groups were determined through randomization using simple numbers table. Urinary
      catheterization application skill was taught with the standard curriculum (demonstration on
      the model) to the control group while it was taught with haptic-controlled computer based
      simulation technology to the experimental group. Data were collected using "Structured
      Student Introduction Form," "Skill Checklist for Teaching Urinary Catheterization Skill" and
      "Questionnaire for Satisfaction with Training Methods."
