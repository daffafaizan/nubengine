      noted above from our laboratory would imply that inhibitors of this enzyme could be more
      effective in the elderly patient population. In addition, we have convincingly demonstrated
      that diabetes in the elderly is metabolically distinct from diabetes in middle aged patients
      (1). Thus, it is clear further studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness of drugs
      in this class in elderly patients with diabetes. We propose a series of studies with your DP4
      inhibitor sitaglipitin to determine its efficacy and safety in an elderly patient population
      with diabetes.
