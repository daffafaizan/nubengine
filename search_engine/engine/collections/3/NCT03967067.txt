      perioperative management has dramatically improved the safety of liver resection patients. It
      has also led to a concomitant extension of indications for a growing number of patients with
      complex benign or malignant hepatobiliary diseases and/or high risk surgeries.

      Published complication rates and risk prediction models and recommendations for patients
      undergoing liver resection primarily stem from far East or Western high-volume specialized
      centers. In developing countries, including those in North Africa, specific constraints
      (e.g., endemic indications, such as liver cystic hydatidosis, blood shortage, and the
      scarcity of liver surgeons and intensive care providers) may impact liver resection outcomes
      but they are rarely addressed in the literature.

      The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for major complications following
      liver resection in the setting of a general surgery-teaching department in Morocco, North
      Africa
