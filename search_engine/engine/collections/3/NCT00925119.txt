      who develop CVD. Beta-blockers are medications used to treat high blood pressure, angina
      (i.e., chest pain), arrhythmias, and other CVD conditions. While beta-blockers are effective
      at treating these conditions, they may also have damaging effects on cholesterol or glucose
      levels, thereby possibly lessening their ability to prevent CVD events in people with
      diabetes. It is important to identify which patients may not benefit from receiving
      beta-blocker medications. Genetic factors may influence how people respond to beta-blocker
      medications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of genetic variation on
      beta-blocker-induced changes in insulin sensitivity, fat breakdown, and heart function in
      people with type 2 diabetes.

      This study will enroll people with type 2 diabetes. At a series of up to three baseline study
      visits, participants will have a blood collection, a glucose tolerance test, an
      echocardiogram to obtain images of the heart, and biopsies of muscle from the thigh and fat
      from the stomach. All participants will then receive atenolol once a day for 8 weeks. During
      Week 1, participants will receive a low dose of atenolol. They will then attend a study visit
      at the end of Week 1, and study researchers will examine how well participants are tolerating
      the medication. If the atenolol is well tolerated, the dose will be increased. Study
      researchers will call participants 1 week after any dosage changes to monitor for side
      effects. Blood collection will occur again at a study visit at Week 4. At Week 8,
      participants will then attend up to three study visits for repeat baseline testing.
      Participants will then be slowly tapered off of atenolol over a 1-week period.
