        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y90 monoclonal antibody m170
           administered with paclitaxel and cyclosporine followed by autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate
           cancer.

        -  Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody
      m170 (Y90 MOAB m170). Patients are assigned to one of four cohorts.

      After the first occurrence of hematologic dose-limiting toxicity in a patient, all subsequent
      patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 4 days prior to undergoing
      apheresis and continuing until 6 million CD34+ cells/kg are collected. After 2 patients in a
      cohort group experience hematologic dose-limiting toxicity, subsequent patients undergo
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.

        -  Cohort I: Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody (MOAB) m170 IV over 5 minutes
           followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 monoclonal antibody m170 (In111 MOAB m170) IV
           over 5-10 minutes on day 0 and unlabeled MOAB m170 IV followed by Y90 MOAB m170 IV on
           day 7. Patients also receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to 25. Patients
           may undergo autologous PBSC transplantation on day 21 and receive G-CSF SC daily
           beginning on day 21 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Cohort II: Patients receive treatment as in cohort I. Patients also receive paclitaxel
           IV over 3 hours on day 9.

        -  Cohort III and IV: Patients receive treatment as in cohort I without In111 MOAB m170.
           Patients also receive paclitaxel as in cohort II.

      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB m170 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.
