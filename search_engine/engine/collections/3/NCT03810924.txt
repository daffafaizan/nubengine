      cue-reactivity and relapse risk. Here, we aim to identify stress- and alcohol cue-related
      physiological markers in a lab experiment to assess interactions between acute psychological
      vs. physical stress exposure and alcohol cue-exposure regarding their effects on (1) alcohol
      craving and related markers (attentional bias to alcohol-cues, implicit association task,
      neural cue-reactivity), (2) their predictive capacity for future alcohol intake, (3) the
      identification their neural correlates in brain circuits of motivational, cognitive, and
      affective processing. In addition to applying established stress-related markers (cortisol in
      saliva, heart-rate variability, systolic blood pressure and electrodermal activity), (4) we
      will integrate portable sensors (wearables) to allow a future integration in ambulatory
      assessments and to test innovative measures currently under investigation (e.g. voice stress
      analysis) to identify whether these additional parameters increase the predictive
      significance. Our long-term aim is the definition of a setup of mobile sensors and their
      integration in a mobile infrastructure that allows the prediction of stress related alcohol
      intake in an ambulatory setting.
