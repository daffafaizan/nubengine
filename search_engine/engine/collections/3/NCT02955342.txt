    
      In two settings (school, clinics) back and neck pain of 10 to 16 years old adolescents will
      be assessed by the German Version of the Young Spine Questionnaire at 6 points in time during
      one year.

      Validity, reliability and responsiveness of the G-YSQ will be determined and the development
      of back and neck pain within a year will be described.
