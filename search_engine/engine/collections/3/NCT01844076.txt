      I portion of our study will aim to determine the tolerability of both agents in combinations
      when used at established clinical doses. This portion of the study will more closely resemble
      a pilot study or feasibility study rather than a dose escalation Phase I trial. The objective
      is to determine toxicities and adverse reactions, not a maximally tolerated dose. The
      investigators hypothesize that there will be no toxic interactions at the pharmacokinetic or
      pharmacodynamic level, and want to know the feasibility of using quinacrine and capecitabine
      at their respective recommended single agent doses. Because capecitabine is already regarded
      as standard treatment for colorectal cancer, the investigators will begin the study with a
      full dose of capecitabine combined with a slightly lower dose of quinacrine. If the
      safety-interim analysis does not detect an excess of toxicity, then subsequent patients will
      be enrolled using the full dose of both drugs.
