    
      Two different situations will be considered:

        -  in NSMGCT patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the objective is to
           maintain a 2-year progression-free survival rate >80% despite a limitation of the number
           of course of chemotherapy (â‰¤4) after the achievement of a clinical and biological
           response (primary endpoint);

        -  in children over 10 years with testicular or extragonadal NSMGCT, the objective is to
           improve the overall survival by systematically classifying the patients in high-risk
           group to allow a dose intensification.
