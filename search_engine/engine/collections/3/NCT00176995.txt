      is that it reduces the rate of cell growth within the hair follicle by inhibition of the
      enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). In preclinical studies eflornithine hydrochloride was
      shown to inhibit ODC and decrease hair mass. In sheep, systemic inhibition of ODC by
      eflornithine hydrochloride markedly altered not only the length and diameter of hair fibers,
      but also the portion of the hair fiber cross-section occupied by paracortical cells, which
      are primarily found in straight hairs. In a Phase II study evaluating the effect of the drug
      in the treatment of female hirsutism, it was anecdotally noted that those who also had PFB
      showed an improvement in this condition.
