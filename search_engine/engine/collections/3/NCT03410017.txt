    
      The primary objective is the assessment of listening skill acquisition in normally-hearing
      children aged between 0 and 6 years with the Functional Listening Index - Paediatric (FLI-P).
      The FLI-P has been developed to address a substantial gap in the current tools available to
      measure the development of auditory skills in children. The FLI-P provides a measure of
      listening skills acquisition in children from birth to six years of age (0 - 72 months). The
      FLI-P will be administered by an investigator who has received appropriate training in its
      use or completed by parents/caregivers themselves. The FLI-P assessment will be conducted
      using an application running on a Personal Computer, tablet or online device. There are no
      specific medical or surgical procedures involved in this clinical investigation and the FLI-P
      is a non-interventional application.
