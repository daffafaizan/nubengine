      non-surgical options to those at high risk for having surgery and its attending morbidity. In
      characterizing substantive differences in the vaginal environment of successful and
      unsuccessful pessary users, the investigators can identify elderly patients at higher risk of
      adverse events with pessary use as well as novel targets for the pharmacologic treatment of
      the altered vaginal microbiota and endogenous AMP levels, potentially allowing patients to
      continue with non-surgical therapies rather than pursuing surgical intervention.
