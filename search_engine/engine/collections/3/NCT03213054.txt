      therapy for 6 weeks. At Day 1, Day 18 and Day 32, OBP-301 is directly injected to the
      location of the lesion. From Day 4, patients receive radiation therapy. Patients will be
      automatically entered follow-up period for 12 weeks to be observed tolerance and safety.

      This study is designated as standard 3 + 3 dose escalation study. The first 3 patients will
      be evaluated with low-dose of OBP-301 and then the study move onto the high-dose cohort of
      OBP-301. When the DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) is observed, 3 more patients will be enrolled
      in the dose level.
