      continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in our society. The problem will
      become even more significant as an increasing proportion of the population ages. The goal of
      the proposed project is to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of
      atherosclerosis. We propose to identify genes selectively expressed in peripheral monocytes
      of patients with atherosclerosis and in macrophages and endothelial cells of atherosclerotic
      plaques. We will examine gene expression profiles in purified subpopulations of cells using
      Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) that requires only minute amounts of RNA, enabling
      the study of small homogeneous populations of cells. This sequence-based high-throughput gene
      expression profiling technique has the advantage of not requiring prior knowledge of the
      expressed gene sequences, allowing the discovery of new genes. With the completion of the
      human genome sequence, the SAGE technique is an ideal tool for comprehensively characterizing
      the transcriptomes of the important cells involved in atherosclerosis. This proposal is an
      exploratory study to find candidates, both known and unknown genes, which will be used for
      more extensive and statistically powered projects in the future. The insights obtained will
      be used for elucidating the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and for developing new simple,
      sensitive and specific tests for early disease diagnosis. In addition, the new insights
      obtained may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for disease prevention
      and treatment.
