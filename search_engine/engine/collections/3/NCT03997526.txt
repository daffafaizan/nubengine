    
      This is a prospective, observational, longitudinal, claims-based study with a historical
      control group. Data will be collected via claim forms and will be extracted directly from the
      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Research Identifiable Files (RIFs),
      which contain all medical claims for 100% of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare
      fee-for-service program. The study will be conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines
      of a central institutional review board (IRB), relevant informed consent regulations, and all
      other applicable regulatory requirements.
