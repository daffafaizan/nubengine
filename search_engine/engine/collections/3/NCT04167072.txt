      surgical candidates that will be treated with EUS guided cholecystoenterostomy with
      endoscopic stone extraction. Patients will be randomized to stent removal immediately after
      gallstones have been removed or to observation for 1 year with the stent in place. Outcomes
      to be measured include recurrence of stone disease and rate of complications from the
      procedure in both groups
