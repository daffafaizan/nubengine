      is cardiovascular disorder. However, investigations and surveys such as DCCT, UKPDS and
      KUMAMOTO-study, etc. clarified that strict control of blood sugar level prevented development
      and progress of diabetic microangiopathy, but could not show a significant effect on great
      vessel disorder. Recently, the DECODA-study, DECODE-study and Honolulu-study have
      demonstrated that postprandial high blood sugar is involved in great vessel disorder.
      Therefore, possible prevention of great vessel disorder in diabetic patients is suggested by
      improving the postprandial blood sugar level as achieved using ultrarapid-acting type
      insulin, which has become available recently. Even with results in Europe and the US
      obtained, the life-style and incidence of complications in Japanese people are different, and
      there are many points that remain uncertain with respect to the direct application of foreign
      results to Japanese people. Therefore, in Japan also, it is necessary to conduct a
      large-scale clinical study and to establish high-level evidence using mainly Japanese people
      through hospitals having many patients.
