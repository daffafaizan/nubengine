      inability of your blood vessels to properly enlarge and shrink, known as vascular endothelial
      dysfunction (VED), is an early event leading to CVD and can be caused by postprandial
      hyperglycemia (PPH) [1] or short-term increases in blood sugar that occur after you have
      eaten. Although we do not know how this occurs, research shows that temporary increases in
      blood sugar impair the blood vessel's ability to properly enlarge and shrink. We also know
      that impaired vessel function is an early event leading to CVD and that research shows that
      short-term increases in blood sugar impair blood vessel function, even in healthy people [2].

      Because high blood levels of cholesterol increase CVD risk, this has triggered flawed
      guidelines to restrict cholesterol in our diet [3], including limiting egg consumption. The
      misguided fear towards eating eggs has been routinely challenged by large-scale studies
      failing to associate eggs with heart disease risk [4-8]. Research shows that eggs improve the
      functioning of insulin to reduce blood sugar [9]. They also contain bioactive peptides that
      may attenuate oxidative stress [10-11]. This provides rationale for their study as a dietary
      strategy to reduce PPH and VED. Thus, the objective of this study is to define the potential
      benefits of eggs and its components (egg yolk and egg whites) on blood vessel health in
      adults with prediabetes.
