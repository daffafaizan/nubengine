    
      On Day 1 of each treatment cycle, topotecan 0.4 mg/m^2/day will be administered via
      continuous infusion for 9 days beginning on Day 1 of every 21 day cycle. Additionally,
      patients will receive erlotinib 150 mg daily Days 1-9 in a cycle of 21 days. Thereafter both
      drugs will be given as long as patient benefit continues. Treatment will be administered on
      an inpatient or outpatient basis, repeating administration on an every 3 week cycle.

      A cycle will be one three-week course of the erlotinib-topotecan regimen (the cycle could be
      extended to 4 weeks if blood studies at 21 days result in treatment delay).

      The dose of topotecan will be calculated as follows:

      BSA (m^2) X drug dose (mg/m^2) = dose (mg)
