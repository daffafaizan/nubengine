      vision and papilledema which may lead to permanent visual loss. Definitive diagnosis of IIH
      usually requires the measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) via lumbar puncture (LP)
      which is an invasive technique. In our study, the relationship between ICP and optic nerve
      sheath diameters (ONSD) were examined. Thus it was investigated whether optic nerve
      ultrasonography (USG) is a useful tool instead of LP for the diagnosis of IIH.

      Methods: A total of 25 patients who applied to the neurology clinics of Ankara Numune
      Training and Research Hospital between May 2014 and December 2015 and were diagnosed with IIH
      were included in the study. The control group consisted of 22 individuals who applied with
      other complaints than headaches. ONSD was measured from both eyes before and after the LP.
      After pre-LP measurements were taken, opening and closing CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) pressure
      was measured. In the control group, ONSD was measured with optic USG.
