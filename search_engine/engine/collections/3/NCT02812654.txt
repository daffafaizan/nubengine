    
      Prospective phase II non controlled study. Staging: All patients will be submitted to a local
      Magnetic Resonance (MR), Chest Tomography (CT) and Positron emission tomography-computed
      tomography (PET CT) previous to treatment. After the first cT cycle a new PET CT will be
      provided and one more at the end of the neoadjuvant treatment. Chemotherapy: cT neoadjuvant:
      Doxorubicin 75mg/m2 (cycles 1,2 and 3), and ifosfamide 9 g/m2 (cycles 1 and 3). Radiotherapy:
      RT 25 Gy / 5 x 500 cGy/day, beginning at Cycle 2/Day1. The surgery will be performed after
      4-6 weeks from cycle 3. The remain of viable cells in surgical specimen will be analyzed and
      whether the the percentage value is less than 30% the patient will receive more 3 cycles of
      cT. A boost of RT is indicated if margins are considered R1 (microscopic positive margin).
