      effect to reduce macrophage yet increase adipocyte inflammation in adipose tissue along with
      reducing adipose tissue mass. Disordered adipose tissue metabolism may dysregulate adipokine
      secretion, which could contribute to metabolic abnormalities in GH deficiency. Adipokines,
      peptides expressed and secreted by adipose tissue, exert important local adipose tissue and
      systemic metabolic effects. This study will combine direct assessment of adipose tissue with
      assessment of body composition. Adult GHD can be associated with central adiposity, insulin
      resistance, dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular (CV) risk.
