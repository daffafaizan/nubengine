      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to evaluate the anti-tumor activities and safety of abiraterone acetate in
      participants with prostate cancer who have failed androgen deprivation and docetaxel-based
      chemotherapy. Abiraterone acetate oral tablet will be administered as a total dose of 1000
      milligram (mg) orally (by mouth) once daily after an overnight fast and
      prednisone/prednisolone will be administered as 5 mg oral tablet twice daily. Participants
      will be enrolled and treated up to 12 cycles (or longer, if they have not progressed and
      continue to benefit from treatment). The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening (14 days),
      Open-label Treatment; and follow-up (up to 60 months). Participants will be evaluated
      primarily for prostate specific antigen response according to Prostate Specific Antigen
      Working Group (PSAWG) criteria. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
