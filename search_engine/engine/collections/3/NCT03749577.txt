      vasoconstriction of extremities in response to a cold or emotional stress. Microvascular
      dysfunction and alteration of the endothelial NO-dependent vasodilatation pathway through NO
      synthases (NOS) represents one of the main mechanisms.

      A pharmacological treatment in RP is proposed to patients when conservative measures are not
      efficient enough to control the symptoms: calcium channel blockers remains the first line,
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors as a second line treatment, while intravenous iloprost
      remains restricted to patients with digital ischaemia. Vasodilator therapies are commonly
      associated with side effects due to the non-specific systemic vasodilation that often result
      in permanent discontinuation. Many patients prefer complementary and alternative therapies,
      but none has proven its efficacy. Therefore, there is still room for improvement in the
      treatment of RP, and research is needed in this area.
