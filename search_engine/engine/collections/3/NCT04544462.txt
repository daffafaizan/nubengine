      testing. Genomic Prediction Clinical Laboratory will perform testing and issue a report per
      routine clinical procedures. Upon completion of issuing a report, the patients' medical
      records will be obtained from the IVF Center providing care to the patient. Information
      obtained may include: history of miscarriage, embryo transfer outcomes, preeclampsia, small
      for gestation age baby, or thrombophilia disorders.

      In addition to obtaining records related to history of pregnancy complications, carrier
      couples will be offered the use of preimplantation genetic testing for M2 carrier status
      (PGT-M2) in their embryos. Patients electing to perform PGT-M2 will receive PGT-A according
      to standard clinical practice, along with M2 carrier status.

      A total of 500 patients will complete the study and may be recruited from any IVF clinic in
      the United States. Patients will undergo ovarian hyper-stimulation, oocyte retrieval,
      fertilization and embryo culture per standard clinical protocol determined by each clinic.
