      the Functional status of the hip joint is rated with the Harris Hip Score (HHS), Visual
      Analogue Scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Timed Up & Go
      test.

      The Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (CTSIB) uses different conditions to test
      how people adapt to changing sensory conditions during the maintenance of stance. We used the
      modified CTSIB by NeuroCom to perform the test on a computerized force plate to measure the
      body sway. Static postural stability [displacement of Centre of Pressure (CoP)] was measured
      during standing on a single force platform (Stabilometer, ZWE-PII) for 20-s periods in a
      quiet room. Signals were amplified and sampled at 16 Hz via an analogue-to-digital converter.
      Subjects stood barefoot on the platform, with the feet positioned side by side and arms
      hanging freely at their side. Toe-out was positioned to subjects' comfort. The CoP excursions
      along antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) axes were performed both on firm (the
      stable surface of the platform) and foam surfaces [an Airex Balance Pad (dimensions: 50 cm
      length x 41 cm width x 6 cm height) placed on the platform], always starting with standing on
      the stable surface. In each condition, subjects had to stand first with the eyes open (EO),
      when subjects had to look at a target fixed at eye level at a distance of approximately 1 m,
      and then measurements were also performed with closed eyes (EC).
