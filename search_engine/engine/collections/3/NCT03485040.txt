      and will have research visits spanning the post-stroke care continuum at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, and one year. These research visits will accompany comprehensive clinical visits to
      the Stroke Motor Recovery Clinic of the Center for Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery (CNTR,
      cntr.mgh.harvard.edu). The study will collect clinical outcome measures, video and
      robot-kinematic data, smartphone usage patterns, and EEG data in order to quantify the course
      of motor recovery. The goal is to rigorously understand the behavioral, neuroanatomic, and
      neurophysiologic underpinnings of motor recovery toward developing personalized strategies
      and neurotechnologies to facilitate neurorehabilitation and enable better recovery for people
      with stroke.
