      of brain metastases. Patients with multiple brain metastasis showed poor prognosis and
      displayed an untreated median survival of only 3-6 months, and most patients died due to the
      progression of brain metastases. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of icotinib combined with whole brain radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases.
      The primary endpoint is intracranial objective response rate .
