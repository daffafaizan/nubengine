      scarring. Frequently this scars cover large areas, tend to retract, present pigmentary
      changes and are disfiguring, producing significant life quality impairment.

      Unfortunately, there are very few therapeutic options for treating these scars, which can be
      secondary to reconstructive surgery or after spontaneous healing. In the last decades most
      reports in scar treatment have included, pressure garments, chemical peeling, dermabrasion,
      ablative and non-ablative laser therapy and surgery with varying degrees of success. There is
      only one report treating burn scars with fractional laser, with good results.

      The aim of our study is to determine the effect of of a second-generation erbium-doped
      1,550-nm fractional photothermolysis laser (Fraxel SR laser, Reliant Technologies Inc.) in
      the treatment of burn scars.
