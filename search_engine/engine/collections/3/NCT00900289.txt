        -  To determine if DNA methylation patterns and expression of differentially methylated
           genes taken before chemotherapy can predict patient outcome with regard to
           progression-free survival.

        -  To evaluate whether DNA methylation can predict response assessed by RECIST criteria and
           CA 125 response.

        -  To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of predicting methylation changes in tumor
           from the changes at the corresponding CpG islands in plasma.

      OUTLINE: Tumor samples are collected at the time of initial laparotomy and blood is drawn
      prior to surgery for DNA methylation and biomarker studies.

      Changes in DNA methylation will be examined globally using DNA methylation hybridization to
      microarrays and methylation specific PCR, as well as expression of genes shown to be
      differentially methylated.
