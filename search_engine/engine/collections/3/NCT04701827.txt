      disorder remains largely unchanged. Consequently, the field needs new intervention strategies
      especially targeting the patient groups having impaired functioning.

      The core idea in the AWARE project is to focus on improving functioning and quality of life
      in patients with affective disorders every-day life using a comprehensive 360 degrees
      intervention. The present AWARE intervention represent an integrated treatment avenue to
      improve functioning in patients with affective disorders.

      The aim of the study is, in a pragmatically Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), to investigate
      the effect of a 360 degrees intervention based on the ICF Brief Core Set for BD and unipolar
      disorder targeting functioning.

      The participants will upon inclusion, be randomised to participate in either 6 months AWARE
      treatment or standard care. The control group will receive standard care consisting of the
      standard out-patient mental health service routines in The Capital Region of Denmark.

      The AWARE intervention targets multiple aspects of the described enhancers of functioning
      based on on the ICF Brief Core Set, including ADL ability as a part of carrying out daily
      routines.

      The study carried out in a randomized design. The investigators who assess the patients are
      blinded to whether the patient has participated in the active or passive treatment arm, so
      the results will be valid. In addition, validated standardized survey methods according to
      all the outcomes is applied.
