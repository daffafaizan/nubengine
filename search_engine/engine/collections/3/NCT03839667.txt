      Research Network. Eligible criteria include men and women aged 40-70 years; newly-diagnosed
      type 2 diabetes mellitus; BMI â‰¥25 kg/m2 and <40 kg/m2. Main exclusion criteria include known
      type 1 diabetes, usage of insulin; symptomatic cardiovascular diseases, and other serious
      illness. The proposed trial has 90% statistical power to detect an absolute 0.5% reduction of
      HbA1c changes between intensive intervention and standard education groups at a 2-sided
      significance level of 0.05. To achieve the proposed study objectives, we plan to perform the
      following specific aims:

        1. Recruit 324 study participants who meet the eligibility criteria and randomly assign 108
           to the intensive diet intervention group, 108 to the enhanced physical activity
           intervention group and 108 to the standard education group for 12 weeks;

        2. Employ a study-wide strategy to encourage standard of care for all participants for the
           treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders;

        3. Obtain clinical data on study outcomes for up to 12 months of follow-up among all trial
           participants;

        4. Perform strict quality control procedures for intervention and data collection;

        5. Conduct data analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle;

        6. Disseminate the study findings to influence clinical practice and clinical guidelines.

      The results will be analyzed to examine the pan-omics changes after the interventions and
      clarify their predictive benefits on the effects of the interventions.
