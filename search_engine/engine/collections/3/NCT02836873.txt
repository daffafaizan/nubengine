      investigative sites in the US, Japan, France and Spain. Approximately 300 subjects were to be
      randomly assigned to receive bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, or placebo in equal ratio for 24
      weeks.

      The study was to enrolled male and female participants who had T2DM with an HbA1c between 7.0
      and 10.5% (inclusive) and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) as defined by an eGFR of ≥ 30
      and< 60 mL min-1 per 1.73 m2 at the screening visit and one additional time of measurement
      between 1 and 12 months prior to screening. Subjects were either treatment naïve or were
      treated with a stable regimen of anti-diabetic medications.

      All eligible subjects were to enter a one-week single-blind, placebo run-in period. Subjects
      who were compliant in taking run-in medication, had screening eGFR ≥ 30 and< 60 mL min-1 per
      1.73 m2, and had stable GFR (no more than 20% change in eGFR between a historical value and
      the value determined at the screening visit) were eligible for randomization. Randomization
      was stratified by HbA1c level (7.0 to 8.5% or 8.6 to 10.5%), anti-diabetic treatment regimen
      and eGFR (30 - 44 mL min-1 per 1.73 m2 or 45 - 59 mL min-1 per 1.73 m2). At least 135
      subjects in each of the eGFR groups were planned.

      Study subjects were to schedule clinic visits at weeks 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 for safety and
      efficacy evaluation. At weeks 2 and 18, the visits were to be conducted via phone interviews
      unless an in-person visit was considered clinically advisable. A final follow-up visit was to
      be conducted at week 26 or two weeks after the last dose of investigational product if the
      subject withdrew prior to week 24.
