      effects of prism adaptation treatment on two visual-spatial recovery components. After a
      stroke, an "internal GPS", locating where objects or people lie in a particular area of
      space, may be impaired. Alternately, a stroke may impair precise visual-spatial hand and body
      aiming movements. The research team wishes to discover whether prism adaptation treatment
      (two weeks of daily 20-min sessions of goal-directed movement with prism goggles) affects
      visual-spatial where or aiming errors selectively after stroke.

      This research represents one of the first attempts to apply what we know about the brain from
      neuroscience research, to modern clinical rehabilitation practices.
