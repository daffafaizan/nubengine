      termed idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP). IOP is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of
      <200,000 affected premenopausal women in the United States.

      Women with IOP completing at least one year and up to three years of denosumab (Protocol
      AAAN0161) will be offered participation in this open-label study in which they would choose
      whether to take oral alendronate 70 mg weekly for 12 months or a single intravenous dose of
      zoledronic acid 5 mg. Subjects and study personnel will be blinded to BMD outcomes until 12
      months.

      Discontinuation of denosumab is followed by substantial increases in bone turnover markers to
      well above baseline, bone resorption reaching twice baseline levels for about 6 months. Over
      the first 12 months off therapy, all the bone density gained on treatment is lost. Studies
      done at the institution has demonstrated the occurrence of multiple vertebral fractures in
      some patients who have stopped denosumab. Based upon these new fracture data, the Prolia
      label is currently recommending that consideration should be given to transition to another
      antiresorptive drug in patients stopping denosumab. The main goals of this extension study
      are to determine rates of bone loss and incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures during
      one year of bisphosphonate therapy (oral alendronate or intravenous zoledronic acid)
      initiated after completing denosumab.
