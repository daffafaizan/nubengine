      for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. All participants will undergo a sequential cord
      blood transplant using a well-known myeloablative regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide,
      and total body irradiation, which is appropriate for those individuals who are likely to
      benefit from an ablative regimen. Tacrolimus will be combined with mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF) for the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      will be added to this regimen in an attempt to improve engraftment. PTH is an approved drug
      with minimal side effects in individuals with osteoporosis; the dose of PTH has been
      determined from a phase I study in individuals with hematologic cancer.
