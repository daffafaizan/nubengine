      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% is type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected, placing an ever
      increasing burden on families and the health care system.

      SYR-619 is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is
      thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo degradation of 2 peptide hormones
      released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the dose-response efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      treatment with SYR-619 in subjects with type 2 diabetes who do not previously achieve
      adequate glycemic control with lifestyle modification (diet/exercise) or metformin or
      sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic monotherapy.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 14 Weeks. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine
      collection, vital signs including sitting and standing blood pressure and pulse, body height
      and weight, physical examinations, electrocardiogram.
