      hAESCs are accurately transplanted into the lateral ventricle. Therapeutic effect and safety
      of hAESCs on PD will be evaluated. hAESCs are derived from placental amnion donated after
      cesarean section in healthy women. hAESCs is developed from the epiblast as early as 8 days
      after fertilization, recent reports indicate that hAESCs have some neural stem cell
      characteristics, can differentiate into dopaminergic neurons and secrete dopamine and various
      neurotrophic factors, which could be seen as one of the best potential stem cell source for
      treating Parkinson's disease.
