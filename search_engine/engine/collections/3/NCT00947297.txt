    
      This was a one year long-term safety study of HPN-100 in UCD subjects. Subjects were assessed
      regularly for safety and control of their venous ammonia. Hyperammonemic events were
      characterized with respect to contributing factors, such as intercurrent illness, diet, and
      noncompliance with medication.

      Forty subjects with a diagnosis of UCD who completed Study HPN-100-006 were enrolled.

      Twenty additional UCD subjects â‰¥ 6 years of age were enrolled. These subjects included those
      who did not qualify for HPN-100-006 [e.g., subjects between the ages of 6-17; subjects with
      other UCD subtypes or adult subjects who have not taken sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) in the
      past 6 months, etc.]. For adult subjects not receiving NaPBA in the past 6 months, subjects
      must, in the judgment of the investigator, be anticipated to benefit from the addition of a
      nitrogen-scavenging agent to their current treatment. See the inclusion criteria for examples
      of clinical evidence of potential benefit.

      Monthly assessments included safety laboratory tests, amino acid panel, vital signs,
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, venous ammonia, and blood and urine metabolites. Adverse
      events (AEs) and concomitant medications were recorded on an ongoing basis.
