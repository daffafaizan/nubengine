      To compare the percentage of patients whose wound remained closed on postoperative day #30
      after tertiary closure compared to historical controls who underwent secondary would closure.
      We are primarily looking at time to wound closure. We will be able to abstract this
      information from the postoperative clinic visit notes from patients in the "historical
      control" cohort. We will identify 20 patients with characteristics described in the inclusion
      criteria of this study who underwent laparotomy with secondary would closure during the
      calendar year 2018.

      Secondary Objectives

      To compare the proportion of acute and chronic wound infection in wounds closed with a
      tertiary closure technique to historical controls receiving a secondary wound closure.

      To compare the length of stay of patients receiving a tertiary wound closure to historical
      controls receiving a secondary wound closure.

      To describe the number of patients receiving a tertiary wound closure that return within 30
      days of surgery as compared to historical controls receiving a secondary wound closure.

      To describe the quality of life in patients receiving a tertiary wound closure.
