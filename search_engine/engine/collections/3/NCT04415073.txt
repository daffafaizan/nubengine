    
      Axatilimab (SNDX-6352) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high affinity against
      CSF-1R under investigation for the prevention or treatment of respiratory signs and symptoms
      secondary to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of axatilimab as an add-on to standard of care
      (SOC) therapy in hospitalized subjects with respiratory signs and symptoms secondary to
      COVID-19 compared to SOC treatment.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment groups, active or
      control. All subjects will receive axatilimab or matching placebo intravenously (IV) as an
      add-on to SOC on Day 1, within 8 hours of randomization and on Day 15. Subjects will be
      followed for at least 28 days (+3 days) after the first dose of study intervention (Day 29).

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the proportion of subjects alive and free of
      respiratory failure at Day 29.
