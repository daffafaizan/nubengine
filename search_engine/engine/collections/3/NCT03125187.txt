      and widely used in the world for over half a century, thus, no unknown adverse events or any
      risk of administration are expected in humans, however, this is the first human Biological
      product developed by União Química. The proposed development of this biological drug follows
      the individual route, the control heparin used in the present study has the objective of
      evaluating the results found with the test product, without the obligation to demonstrate
      bioequivalence among the evaluated products.
