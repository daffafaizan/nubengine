    
      A dual-site, randomized, dose-ranging trial to determine the role and practice parameters for
      massage in the standard clinical management of OA based on investigation of efficacy and
      mechanism of action. The study hypothesis is that an 8 week course of Swedish massage therapy
      will be effective in reducing pain and improving function in patients with confirmed OA of
      the knee. A future phase III trial is planned to test the optimal massage intervention
      identified in this study against a validated sham/control intervention, incorporating all
      pertinent outcome measures from the antecedent studies. In addition, this study will further
      the development of robust methodologies to test the efficacy of massage interventions in
      general. The research agenda advanced by the current study will culminate with the
      establishment of the proper place for massage therapy among standard treatment options for
      the millions of Americans suffering with osteoarthritis.
