    
      This is a multi-center study of XMT-1536 (upifitamab rilsodotin) in patients with tumors
      likely to express NaPi2b, focusing on patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and
      non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma subtype. XMT-1536 (upifitamab rilsodotin) will be
      administered as an intravenous infusion once every four weeks. The study consists of three
      segments: dose escalation (DES), dose expansion (EXP), and the pivotal cohort (UPLIFT). The
      DES segment studied small groups of patients who received increased doses. A Safety Review
      Committee was established to review the data from each dose level before moving to the next
      higher dose. The dose escalation cohort has ended and is no longer enrolling patients.
      Enrollment into the EXP segment consists of 2 parallel cohorts of patients to confirm the
      dose that has been identified in DES and estimate the objective response rate in each patient
      population. Enrollment into the pivotal cohort (UPLIFT) includes patients with
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. All adverse events will be graded according to the
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria version (CTCAE v5.0). Throughout
      the study, pharmacokinetics will be measured using proprietary assays developed by Mersana.
      Anti-cancer activity will be measured via RECIST.
