      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) but not ameliorating right ventricular (RV) failure, the
      major cause of death. There are no RV-specific therapies currently available for PAH, in part
      because the pathophysiology of RV failure is poorly understood.

      The investigators hypothesize that the RV in PAH develops a distinct metabolic pattern
      characterized by increased glycolysis, impaired oxidative metabolism and lipid deposition,
      which are associated with RV failure.

      Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that the RV in human PAH exhibits lipid deposition,
      increased glycolysis and impaired fatty acid oxidation. The investigators will measure RV
      oxidative metabolism and glycolysis in PAH patients and controls using positron emission
      tomography 11C acetate and [18F]fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose imaging and measure myocardial lipid
      accumulation using magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging.

      Specific Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that an abnormal RV metabolic profile is associated
      with RV dysfunction and reduced exercise capacity in PAH. PET and MRS findings will be
      correlated with RV function, patient exercise capacity and a blood metabolic profile.
