      economically depressed areas Jordan. The project seeks to more broadly link health education
      opportunities in the form of lectures and seminars with practical experience through
      workshops and hands-on learning, ultimately resulting in the creation of microclinics.
      Microclinics are intimate support groups of diabetic patients (2-8 per clinic) who meet in
      their homes and businesses in order to share the costs of maintaining medical monitoring
      equipment and supplies, come together to support one another in the management of diabetes,
      collectively utilize vital treatment options, and receive personalized screening, education
      and management tools from medical professionals.

      The microclinics concept is ideal for the management of chronic disorders such as diabetes, a
      disease which requires ongoing education about diet and exercise and regular monitoring of
      health indices such as blood glucose levels and weight change. Indeed, the microclinics model
      has been established successfully in the West Bank specifically to combat diabetes. The goal
      here is to extend the model to Jordan and to establish microclinics in a collaborative effort
      with the Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) and the Jordanian Ministry of Health (MoH).
