      have been frequently investigated in the past in both healthy participants and patients. In
      these studies, LSD produced acute transient alterations in waking consciousness including
      visual perceptual alterations, audio-visual synesthesia, derealization and depersonalization.
      Moreover, several of these studies described robust and sustained effects of LSD in patients
      suffering from addiction, anxiety and depression.

      Its psychedelic effects are mainly attributed to its potent partial 5-HT2A receptor agonism.
      Consistently, administration the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg) prior to the
      administration of LSD (100 μg) almost completely prevented the acute effects of LSD in
      another study of our research group (NCT03321136). The present study hypothesis is that
      ketanserin (40 mg) administered 1h after LSD shortens and reduces the acute subjective
      effects of LSD (100 μg) compared to LSD alone (100 μg) followed by placebo in healthy humans.
      Such a finding would confirm a primarily competitive antagonism of ketanserin and LSD at the
      5-HT2A receptor in vivo and indicate that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when
      present at the receptor.
