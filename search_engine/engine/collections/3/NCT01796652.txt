      after a short (≤24 hours) hospital stay. AP was defined as ≥2 or more of the following:
      characteristic abdominal pain, amylase and/or lipase ≥3X the upper limit of normal, and/or
      imaging findings. Patients with an Imrie's score ≤5 and a harmless acute pancreatitis score
      (HAPS) ≤2 were included. Patients in both groups received intravenous lactated Ringer for 3
      days and pain was treated with intramuscular diclofenac. A nurse visited all patients in the
      home group on the 2nd, 3rd and 5th day. All patients recalled for follow-up on the 7th, 14th,
      and 30th days.
