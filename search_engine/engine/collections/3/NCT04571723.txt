      behaviors, has reduced diabetes risk across several American Indian Communities. However,
      there were significant attrition rates, and non-completers were at the highest risk at
      baseline. One's mindset about health (i.e. whether it is fixed or malleable) may affect their
      likelihood of completing the intervention and its efficacy in reducing risk. With an existing
      CAB, I will develop a culturally congruent adaptation of the DPP, the Mindset-DPP (M-DPP).
      The M-DPP will include a discussion of mindset in each session and will present material
      focused on the plasticity of health, including evidence that one's mindset can affect
      outcomes that relate to risk for diabetes. The investigators will implement the DPP and the
      MDPP in a sample of 40 Blackfeet community members at risk for diabetes and test whether the
      M-DPP associates with greater shifts towards a growth health mindsets (i.e. health can be
      changed by effort) compared to the DPP, and whether the M-DPP associates with greater
      increases in physical activity levels and greater reductions in waist circumference, and
      greater retention compared to the standard DPP.
