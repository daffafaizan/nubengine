      people's quality of life worldwide. LUTS may be caused by structural or functional
      abnormalities in 1 or more parts of the lower urinary tract, including bladder, prostate,
      internal and external urethral sphincter and distal urethra. Furthermore, evidence exists to
      demonstrate that LUTS is associate with lifestyle factors, systemic comorbidities and
      geriatric diseases, such as smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney diseases and
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc. So far, there is lack of evidence to illustrate
      the symptom features and comorbidities among Chinese male LUTS patients. Therefore, this
      multicenter clinical study aims to investigate the present status and symptom progression
      among male LUTS patients in China.
