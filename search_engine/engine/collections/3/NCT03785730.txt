    
      This non-inferiority randomized controlled clinical trial, with two parallel groups with 1:1
      allocation ratio, was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Ibirapuera
      (UNIB). The other centers involved are considered co-participants (Centro Universitário do
      Norte - Uninorte , Centro Universitário Uninovafapi - UNINOVAFAPI, and School of Dentistry
      from the University of Sao Paulo - FOUSP). Children aged 3 to 6 years with at least one
      proximal cavitated lesion on anterior primary teeth will be selected from the Clinical
      Pediatric Research Center. Teeth will be randomly allocated to selective removal of carious
      tissue and resin composite restoration (RCR) or NRCC. Tooth survival after two years of
      follow-up will be the primary outcome and cost-effectiveness, satisfaction, and discomfort
      reported by participants and parents/guardians' perception will be the secondary outcomes.
      Only patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be included in the study after the
      legal guardians sign the informed consent form and the child consents to participate in the
      study.
