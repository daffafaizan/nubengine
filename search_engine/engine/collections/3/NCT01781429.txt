      In Part 1 of the study, an accelerated dose escalation plan will be used to establish dose
      limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended Phase 2 dose.

      In Part 2 of the study, additional patients with particular tumor types and/or cancers
      harboring specific genetic mutations will be recruited for treatment at the Recommended Phase
      2 Dose. Patients may also be assessed pharmacodynamic measures in healthy or malignant
      tissues, using biomarker assays for phosphorylation, cytotoxic or cytostatic measures.
