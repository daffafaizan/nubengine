      fetal complications of COVID-19: miscarriage (2%), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR;
      10%), pre-eclampsia, and pre-term birth (39%). In Wuhan, China, nine women who were COVID-19
      positive were surveilled for vertical transmission and overall obstetric and early neonatal
      outcomes. Amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and neonatal throat swabs were collected at
      the time of delivery, and breastmilk samples were collected after lactation commenced. There
      was no viral detection of COVID-19 demonstrated.2 However, two neonates in the United Kingdom
      have tested positively for COVID-19 after delivery from an infected mother. Most recently,
      antibodies were detected (IgM and IgG) in the serum of a neonate born via cesarean delivery
      to a known positive mother. Therefore, vertical transmission has not been completely ruled
      out.

      Additionally, infection at varying times of pregnancy has not been well delineated or
      correlated to neonatal or maternal outcomes at time of delivery. Therefore, there is a need
      to continue surveying and documenting clinical findings in obstetric COVID-19 cases.

      This study will follow pregnant women who are diagnosed during any point of their pregnancy
      with COVID-19 and those who were vaccinated. during pregnancy. The aim will be to evaluate
      maternal and neonatal specimens for the presence of COVID-19 virus, immune and cellular
      response.
