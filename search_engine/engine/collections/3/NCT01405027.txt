      complexity that was previously not seen with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In addition
      to new concepts such as utilization of a lead-in period, compliance with a TID dosing regimen
      of a third agent, development of resistance, and futility rules and decision points have yet
      to be assessed in a real life practice setting. The OPTIMAL trial is designed to evaluate the
      impact of an education program for community sites participating in a CLDF study treating
      chronic HCV genotype 1 patients. Group A will be comprised of approximately 30 CLDF
      designated Hepatology Centers of Educational Expertise (HCEE) and Group B will be comprised
      of approximately 60 community sites. Group A will also deliver the educational program
      regarding the use of HCV protease inhibitors, and the overall treatment of HCV to
      approximately two (2) community sites in it's geographic region. Group B will be comprised of
      community sites that have no previous clinical trial experience with boceprevir or an HCV
      protease inhibitor. For the purpose of this study, each community site in Group B will be
      assigned to an HCEE.
