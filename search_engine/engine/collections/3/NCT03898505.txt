      healthy subjects are planned. After screening and recruitment, subjects will be randomly
      allocated to treatment groups (low dose avocado powder or high dose avocado powder) or
      placebo control group. Once recruitment, randomization, baseline measurements as well as
      treatment allocation is completed (on the first site visit), each subject will orally consume
      one scoop (30-35g of material) of the avocado supplement, blended in 12-16 ounces of a
      smoothie like diluent, once per day for 60 days. The placebo group will also consume one
      scoop (30-35g of material) containing only non-medicinal ingredients used in the test
      product. Primary and secondary endpoint evaluations will be taken at baseline (site visit 2),
      day 30 (site visit 3) and day 60 (site visit 4) at each of the 3 study site visits as well as
      via weekly telephone calls to participants. Total duration of subject participation will be
      60 days. Total duration of the study is expected to be 61 days.
