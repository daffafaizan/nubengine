      and/or behavior) and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are the gross absence of normal
      behavior and emotions, and usually include a general lack of engagement, social withdrawal,
      and loss of goal-directed behavior.

      Negative symptoms may strongly affect daytime activities and quality of life. The effects of
      currently available antipsychotics on negative symptoms are not satisfactory and leave much
      room for improvement. MK-8435 (Org 25935) is an investigational drug that may help to correct
      the above characteristics of schizophrenia by facilitating the messenger function of an amino
      acid in the brain, called glutamate. Preliminary data suggest that lowered glutamate levels
      in schizophrenia are associated with a failure to activate relevant areas in the forebrain
      and with prominent negative symptoms.
