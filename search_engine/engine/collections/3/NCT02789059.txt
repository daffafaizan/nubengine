    
      This study is a prospective physiological study in a pathological condition (neuromuscular
      diseases).

      5 groups of voluntary participants will be investigated:

      1. 20 subjects affected by Dystrophin related muscular dystrophy (Becker Muscular Dystrophy )
      2. Subjects affected by muscular dystrophy not related to dystrophin impairment : 20 subjects
      affected by facioscapulohumeral dystrophy and 20 subjects affected by Limb Girdle Muscular
      dystrophy 3. 20 subjects affected by non-dystrophic myopathies (Congenital myopathies ) 4. 20
      subjects affected by motor diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), Charcot Marie Tooth
      disease, Spinal Muscular Atrophy .

      5. 20 healthy controls Objective: asses the muscular oxygenation modifications during a
      standardized effort and compare the variables between groups. Analyze the mitochondrial
      function and phenotype in the BMD group compared to healthy controls Outcome : Muscle
      Oxygenation by Near Infrared Spectroscopy parameters; oxygen consumption, Muscle Function
      Measure, Vignos and Brooke score, Borg scale, 6 minutes walk test, mitochondrial phenotype,
      mitochondrial oxygenation 3 visits : 1- inclusion 2- standardized effort protocol 3- for
      Becker dystrophy patients and voluntary controls, muscle biopsy of the Vastus Lateralis
