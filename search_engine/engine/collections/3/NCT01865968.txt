      divided into three groups. Group A and B were administrated with one-dose inactivated and
      live attenuated hepatitis A vaccines respectively; Group C was immunized with two doses of an
      inactivated vaccine with 6 months apart. Blood samples were collected at month 1, and 12, 24
      and 36 for anti-HAV titers determination. Safety observation in 30 minutes' duration after
      vaccinations and injection-site reactions and systemic reactions for three consecutive days
      were recorded to assess the safety of investigational vaccines. At Month 36, subjects who
      received one dose of inactivated or live attenuated HAV were administrated a booster dose and
      then were taken blood samples one month later for anti-HAV titers determination.
