        -  Determine the effect of soy protein isolate (isoflavones) and radiotherapy on the
           modulation of biomarkers in patients with localized prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral soy protein isolate (isoflavones) twice daily for 6 months
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo twice daily for 6 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, patients also undergo radiotherapy while receiving isoflavones or placebo.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
