      of the aging process, including immunosenescence, is explained by an imbalance between
      inflammatory and anti-inflammatory networks, wich results in the low grade chronic
      pro-inflammatory status termed inflammaging. It can contribute to a number of age-related
      chronic diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis).
      Prevention or delay in onset of chronic diseases can potentially benefit a large segment of
      the elderly population. Now it is hypothesised that a probiotic drink can reduce low-grade
      inflammation through improvement of the gut barrier function and gut microbiota composition
      in elderly people with low-grade inflammation.
