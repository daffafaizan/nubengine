      completed the PARAGON-HF were eligible to participate. During the study, open-label LCZ696
      was taken in addition to background treatments of comorbidities. All subjects were treated
      with LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan) at maximally tolerated dosed with a target dose of 200 mg
      b.i.d (twice a day).

      The subject were to continue to receive LCZ696 until it became commercially available, or for
      a period up to 24 months from the first patient enrolled in this study whichever came first.
      However, this study was terminated early based on the pre-defined early termination criteria
      of "the primary endpoint of PARAGONHF was not met" in the protocol.
