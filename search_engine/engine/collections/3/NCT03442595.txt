    
      The MedStar Diabetes Pathway (MDP) early pilot program has generated evidence that an
      innovative technology-enabled "Boot Camp" approach to the delivery of diabetes survival
      skills education and medication management has a significant impact on glycemic control and
      healthcare utilization measures. The MDP is a 12 week Diabetes "Boot Camp" technology-enabled
      intervention which will offer learner-centered survival skills self-management education
      (DSSE) and algorithm-driven diabetes medications (DM) titration by Endocrinologist-supervised
      Certified Diabetes Educators (CDE), NPs and PharmDs. The program has been offered at 5
      MedStar Medical Group (MMG) Primary Care Practices from November 2014 to February 2016 to
      high risk adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who have a hemoglobin A1C (A1C) level -a
      marker of average blood glucose (BG) levels in the 2-3 months prior to the time the test is
      done- which is at or above 9% - considered to be poor control, and 1 or more additional risk
      factors for poor health outcomes. The program has been well received by MedStar Primary Care
      Providers and their diabetes patients. Patients that participated in the MDP achieved
      significantly higher A1C reduction and decreased risk risk for acute care utilization then
      matched controls that received standard of care. The pilot evidence demonstrated a
      significant impact on glycemic control and healthcare utilization measures as the result of a
      concise, focused DM education and medication management intervention. Building on the success
      of the MDP Phase 1.0 pilot, the next steps in expanding the program will be as follows:

        -  Transition of the Pathway from early feasibility pilot to the next phase as an expanded
           pilot program integrated within the MedStar Health System care delivery network and
           built upon a sustainable infrastructure across early adopter MMG practice sites.

        -  Expand recruitment to include high risk patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes,
           including those with a new diagnosis and A1C >9%, who have MedStar Emergency Department
           and/or Inpatient encounters

        -  Spread to additional targeted MedStar Primary Care Practices and/or to MedStar Managed
           Care Plan participants.

      Chart reviews and data collection during the expansion phase will be essential to guide the
      process and allow rapid cycle adjustments to maximize the impact of the program and
      utilization of resources for the benefit of our patients.
