      bias) is a common dysfunction in serious mental illness, which may influence their life roles
      and daily functions. The social cognition and interaction training (SCIT) is a manual-guide
      group intervention that can apply to people with serious mental illness. There have been
      evidences showing that the SCIT could improve emotional perception, theory of mind,
      attribution bias, and social relationship. However, there are no SCIT studies in Taiwan yet.
      Thus this study aims to conduct SCIT groups in Taiwan to investigate its feasibility and
      effectiveness.

      This study will include 30 clients from a day care ward and community rehabilitation center,
      excluding clients with acute onset, brain injury, intellectual disability and substance
      abuse. The investigators will randomly allot participants into two group, and conduct a
      crossover design. Before and after the intervention protocol, both group receive evaluations
      of clinical symptoms, emotional perception, theory of mind, and attributional bias. The
      experimental group will receive a 60-minutes manual-guide SCIT session each week for 20
      times, which will be leaded by 2 licensed occupational therapists. There are three main
      themes of the SCIT: 1) introduction and emotion, 2) figuring out situation and 3)
      integration: checking it out. After each theme of the intervention, participants will fill
      out a satisfaction survey. And a senior occupational therapist will observe the group and
      rate the fidelity of the group. The control group will receive treatment as usual.

      After the intervention, the investigators will analyze demographic data and compare the
      difference between experimental group and control group on the social cognition performance.
