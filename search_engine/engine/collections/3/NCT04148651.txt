    
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single-group assignment, interventional clinical
      trial. Female subjects with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) supported by histologic findings on
      biopsy and/or clinical signs on physical examination and recalcitrant to mid- to high-potency
      steroid therapy, will undergo up to 5 monthly treatments to the vulva with a fractional CO2
      laser.

      Investigators will assess clinical signs and architectural changes associated with VLS.
      Baseline measurements will be compared to follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12
      months after the final treatment.

      Subjects will self report sexual function using a validated FSFI Questionnaire at baseline
      and at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups.
