      be fatal if left untreated. The majority of VL cases are found in resource-poor regions,
      including India (Bihar), Bangladesh, Brazil, Nepal, and Sudan. VL pathogenesis has been
      linked to an overproduction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, which can
      promote parasite replication and disease progression. Experimental models have shown that
      IL-10 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of VL.

      The current study has two parts. Part 1 will be an open-label, dose-escalating design to
      determine the safety and tolerability of SCH708980 used in combination with
      AmBisome(Registered Trademark). Part 2 will be a randomized, single-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel design. A total of 50 subjects (n=10 subjects/group) will be
      enrolled in part 1 of the study. A group of 10 subjects will be observed for 7 days prior to
      receiving AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) on the 8th day, as part of the control
      group. Subsequently, 40 subjects (10 subjects/group) will receive a single intravenous (IV)
      infusion of SCH708980 (0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg) followed by a single IV
      infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) 7 days later. The first 2 subjects from
      each dose group to receive SCH708980 will be followed for 3 days after the drug is
      administered before treatment is initiated in the remaining 8 subjects in that group. Also,
      all individuals in each group will be followed for 7 days after AmBisome(Registered
      Trademark) is administered before the next higher dose-level group is enrolled in the study.
      Dose escalation will continue to the next dose level unless dose-limiting toxicities occur in
      > 20% of subjects in any cohort.

      The dose level of SCH708980 to use in part 2 of the study will be decided 30 days after the
      start of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) treatment in the group receiving the highest dose in
      part 1. Randomization and accrual for part 2 of the study will begin at this time. The
      highest safe dose of SCH709890 (< 20% of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity) will be
      administered to subjects, not to exceed 10 mg/kg. Thirty subjects (n=10 subjects/group) will
      be randomized to 1:1:1 to receive:

        1. A single IV infusion of SCH708980 (less than or equal to 10.0 mg/kg) on day 1 followed
           by a single IV infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (3.75 mg/kg) on day 8.

        2. A single IV infusion of SCH708980 (less than or equal to 10.0 mg/kg) on day 1 followed
           by a single IV infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (5 mg/kg) on day 8.

        3. A single dose of placebo on day 1 followed by a single IV infusion of
           AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) on day 8.

      SCH709890 and placebo will be administered over 60 minutes, while AmBisome(Registered
      Trademark) will be administered over 120 minutes.
