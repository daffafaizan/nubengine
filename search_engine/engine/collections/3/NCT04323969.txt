      strategies for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA). Multi-week clinical trials
      demonstrate the biomechanical efficacy and potential clinical efficacy. However, walking
      biomechanics have only been assessed within laboratory environments and performance of the
      modifications during daily at-home walking is currently unknown. Furthermore, the
      modifications have largely been instructed using a specific target, requiring motor learning.
      No study has examined whether a self-directed strategy is feasible and will produce
      significant improvements in biomechanical and clinical outcomes. Moreover, objective
      real-world performance of these modifications is unknown and may explain the previous
      inconsistent clinical results. This study will address these gaps. The investigators
      hypothesize that real-world performance of the modifications will improve over the
      intervention and that both groups will exhibit improvements in biomechanical and clinical
      outcomes at follow up.
