      after onset of symptoms of 5.8 years.PSP is characterized by early falls, vertical
      ophthalmoparesis, akinetic-rigid features, prominent bulbar dysfunction and
      fronto-subcortical dementia. So far there is no treatment for the disease as the negative
      outcomes of the vast majority of studies make it impossible to set standards. As the majority
      of patients experience severe falls and vertigo already in the early phase of the disease,
      the drug of desire would be able to slow disease progression with a special focus on postural
      instability and exert neuroprotective effects. The monoamino oxidase inhibitor Rasagiline
      might be able to influence progression of PSP.
