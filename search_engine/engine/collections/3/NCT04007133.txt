      population. The mortality of people with diabetes due to ischemic heart disease is multiplied
      by 2.2, and when is due to cerebrovascular disease by 1.8 compared to those patients without
      diabetes. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitors, or "statins",
      are considered as the standard treatment for hypercholesterolemia.

      Statins have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, each 1
      mmol decrease in LDL cholesterol reduces the risk of cardiovascular events by 21% at 5 years.

      Many patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes are prescribed with statins, both for
      primary prevention, before the first cardiovascular event, and for secondary prevention, to
      avoid recurrence.

      However, compliance with these drugs may be difficult due to polypharmacy, side effects
      (myalgia) or tiredness. Indeed, the persistence of statin use, one year after its
      prescription, is estimated at 70% in the general population. However, there are no data in
      the French population, and in particular on French diabetic patients for whom the
      cardiovascular risk is increased compared to the general population.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the compliance of diabetic patients with statins
      searching for important factors which could favor adherence.
