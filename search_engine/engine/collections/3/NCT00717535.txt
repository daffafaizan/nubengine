        -  To correlate the total nucleated cell yield of cord blood units from African-American
           cord blood donors with gestational history, maternal history, and delivery information.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Donors complete questionnaires about their demographics, maternal history, gestational
      history, and delivery. Cord blood units (CBU) are collected in utero and transported to the
      Stem Cell Processing Laboratory where they are evaluated for CBU volume and cell count (i.e.,
      total nucleated cell yield) and cryopreserved. The study results will then be used to devise
      future interventional strategies to improve the yield of nucleated cells of CBU.
