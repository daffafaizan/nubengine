      sepsis is controversial, and there is no consensus for the timing and dose of CRRT may
      improve the outcomes. The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to assess the
      effect of different CRRT intensity (25ml/kg/h or 50ml/kg/h) on the outcomes of burn patients
      with early phase of sepsis
