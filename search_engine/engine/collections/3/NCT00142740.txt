      highly individualized immune responses to hepatitis B vaccine in individuals and confirm the
      correlation of specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and haplotypes with Hepatitis B
      Virus (HVB) antibody concentrations and antibody decay kinetics in vaccinated adolescents.
      Approximately 5 ml of whole blood will be collected from study participants at the time of
      the week 28 visit or at any subsequent study visit or clinic visit following successful
      completion of the week 28 visit. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be obtained and QIA
      amp Blood kit will be used to extract high-quality genomic DNA for polymerase chain
      reaction-based genotyping by the PEII laboratory.

      The study is expected to be available for the duration of the parent studies which is
      approximately 2 years. This study requires one visit that may be arranged to coincide with a
      study or routine clinic visit. There are no follow up visits.
