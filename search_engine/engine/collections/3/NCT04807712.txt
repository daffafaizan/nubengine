        -  to follow the duration of protection of the Ca vaccines in the context of modifications
           of the vaccine recommendations

        -  to describe the clinical characteristics of a population vaccinated with several
           boosters

        -  to adapt complementary examinations for diagnostic purposes (culture, PCR, serology)
           according to the evolution of scientific knowledge

        -  to monitor B. parapertussis infections

        -  to train laboratories with nasopharyngeal aspiration

        -  to monitor the evolution of the bacterial species All children aged 0-18 years, in whom
           the diagnosis of pertussis is mentioned and for which a biological check-up is
           requested, are included, except asymptomatic children with confirmed family case.

      In case of suspected pertussis, real-time PCR and / or culture and / or (rarely) serology is
      / are still prescribed to the patient and / or his entourage.

      Selected Pediatricians from the ACTIV group and the AFPA working in an outpatient clinic,
      located in different places in France, are participating in this network since 2001. The
      clinical evolution and the results of the examinations are transcribed on a case report form.
      The data are collected, firstly, during the visit where the diagnosis of whooping cough is
      suspected and a biological assessment requested (patient's medical history, clinical data,
      vaccination status and dates, as well as the search for a contaminated/contaminator) and
      secondly during the follow-up visit (results of the biological check-up and diagnosis,
      antibiotics potentially prescribed, and supplement data of the entourage, except in case of
      diagnosis of pertussis not retained).

      All evaluations made by the pediatricians are regularly reviewed during meetings, and final
      diagnoses used are:

        -  biological pertussis

        -  epidemiological pertussis

        -  not evaluable

        -  lost of follow up

        -  no whooping cough
