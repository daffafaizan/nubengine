      and quality of life of patients with progressing regional or metastatic transitional cell
      carcinoma (or mixed histologies with a component of transitional cell carcinoma) of the
      urothelium treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin vs carboplatin
      and paclitaxel. II. Compare the relative toxic effects of these treatment regimens in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 15, and 22; vinblastine IV on days
      2, 15, and 22; and cisplatin IV over 2 hours and doxorubicin IV on day 2. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours immediately followed by
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 6 courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed
      before treatment, before courses 2 and 4, at 4 weeks after last course, and at 10 months.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.3 years.
