      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells when given following
      high-dose, hypo-fractionated palliative radiation to patients with advanced NY-ESO-1
      expressing sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To look for preliminary evidence of systemic efficacy of NY-ESO-1-specific T-cell therapy
      following radiation on non-radiated tumors.

      II. To determine whether radiation increases trafficking of adoptively transferred
      NY-ESO-1-specific T cells by comparing tumor biopsy specimens from radiated and non-radiated
      tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating radiation
      oncologist. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1-specific T cells intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes 2-3 days after completion of radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 2 weeks, at 4-6, 8,
      10, and 12 weeks, and then for up to 6 months.
