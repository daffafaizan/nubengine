      by symmetrical, irregular macules occurring in photo-exposed areas such as face. Treatment
      with depigmenting compounds such as hydroquinone, are still the gold standard in this
      condition. Miconazol has depigmented properties that could be used as part of the treatment
      in melasma patients. This effect is exerted by inhibiting the tyrosinase enzyme. So, the
      primary objective of this study is to compare the depigmenting activity of miconazole against
      hydroquinone.

      Patients who are included in the study will be randomly assigned to receive one of the
      treatments, which should use for 12 weeks. The medications should be applied in the affected
      regions twice a day.

      The evaluation of clinical improvement will be done in a blinded modality by means of the
      MASI score, the Global Physician Assessment, as well as colorimetry and histological melanin
      content. Evaluations will be held on visits at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Skin biopsy will be taken
      at onset and at 12 weeks.

      At the end of the study, data will be compared concerning the former parameters. All side
      effects will be recorded and analysed.
