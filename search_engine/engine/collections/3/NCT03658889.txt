    
      This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional, national (France), multicentre study,
      conducted on a population of 300 patients with GCA, to describe GCA management and patient
      characteristics.

      The study will be conducted in accordance with the professional code of ethics and the good
      epidemiological practice guidelines developed by the Association of French-Speaking
      Epidemiologists.

      The information will be collected during a single visit to the internist or rheumatologist as
      part of the usual management of the patient with GCA. The physician will not perform any
      additional examinations specific to the study. The physician will inform the patient about
      the study before inclusion and seek her/his non-opposition. A patient information form will
      be given to each patient by the physician. Patients who are eligible to participate in the
      study and who verbally accept automatic processing of their personal data, will be included
      in the study.

      Data will be collected from the medical file and from patient questionnaires on health status
      (SF-36 [36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument], EQ5D [EuroQol-5 Dimensions]) and fatigue
      (FACIT-fatigue). In addition, GCA activity will be evaluated using a global arteritis
      activity Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to be completed by the patient and the physician.
