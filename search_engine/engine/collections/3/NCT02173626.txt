      pilot program on the stress, well-being, and mindfulness skills of physicians in a community
      hospital setting. We administered an eight-week mindfulness training in October/November of
      2013, offered as part of a wellness initiative for medical staff in a suburban community
      hospital in Puyallup, Washington. Participants enrolled on a first-come, first-serve basis,
      engaging in three 90-minute in person trainings, weekly online video-module trainings, and
      weekly teleconference coaching calls. Video-module trainings were available at all times, to
      be accessed at the participants' convenience. Journals and a guided meditation audio library
      were also provided. Physician stress, well-being (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization of
      patients, sense of personal accomplishment), and mindfulness skills (observing, describing,
      acting with awareness, accepting without judgment) were evaluated at baseline,
      end-of-program, and eight weeks post-intervention using well-validated instruments. Risks to
      participants were minimal, including only the possibility of a strong emotional response to
      personal work undertaken by participants during the course of the study. The project was
      funded by MultiCare Health System.
