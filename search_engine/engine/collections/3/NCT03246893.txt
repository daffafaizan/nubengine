      required reintubation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) had been reported as
      an effective tool to prevent post extubation respiratory failure. Recently, high flow oxygen
      nasal cannula (HFNC) had been successfully used to prevent post extubation respiratory
      failure and prevent reintubation. The results from recent randomized controlled trials,
      comparing HFNC with NIV for prevent post extubation respiratory failure among post cardiac
      surgery and high risk patients, showed no significant different in the treatment
      outcome.comparable with NIV among post cardiothoracic surgery and high risk for reintubated
      patients.

      About 40-85% of severe sepsis/septic shock patients developed acute respiratory failure,
      required endotracheal intubation. According to the nature of patients population, usually
      eldery, multiple co-morbid condition and high APACHE II score, sepsis patients were
      considerred as high risk for reintubation, after extubated. There was no information about
      HFNC versus NIV in prevention of reintubation among severe sepsis or septic shock patients.
