    
      Methodology: This is a prospective study, to be made by whole blood collection from 40
      patients with different types of sarcomas (leiomyosarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, synovial
      sarcoma and liposarcoma). The collections will be made in three different moments: before the
      beginning of the treatment, during and at the end of this (8 mL). Blood samples will be
      processed and filtered on ISET system for the isolation and quantification of CTCs. Later, it
      will be performed immunocytochemistry (ICQ) single and/or double staining for protein
      assessment. The following proteins will be assessed: CD45, MRP1, MRP2 and MRP7.

      Expected Results: The investigators hope that this study can show if the CTCs can be used as
      "liquid biopsy" in patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovium and pleomorphic sarcoma and
      liposarcoma.
