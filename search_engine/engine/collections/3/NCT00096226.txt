    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the mediastinal node clearance rate in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with neoadjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy
           comprising paclitaxel, carboplatin, and high-dose radiotherapy followed by surgical
           resection for patients found to be resectable and consolidative chemotherapy comprising
           paclitaxel and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the rate of complete pathological response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility of surgical resection after neoadjuvant induction
           chemoradiotherapy in these patients.

        -  Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
