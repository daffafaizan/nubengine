      A. evaluate clinical efficacy: delay to conversion; number of relapses/episodes per year B.
      evaluate efficacy in terms of resonance imaging parameters (cerebral/spinal MRI) C. evaluate
      efficacy in terms of slowing the progression of disability as measured by EDSS score and
      subscores D. measure and assess cognitive abilities (PASAT) E. evaluate changes in quality of
      life (EQ5D questionnaires, SF36, and TLS-TLS-QoL10 COPING10), fatigue questionnaire (FSMC)
      and anxiety / depression questionnaire (HADS) F. evaluate treatment tolerance G. to correlate
      changes in clinical and imaging parameters with the evolution of serum levels of 25(OH)D2 and
      25(OH)D3 H. establish a biobank of DNA and RNA from all patients in the study and conduct
      analyses of gene polymorphisms involved in the metabolism of vitamin D and the HLA system
      based on the increased levels of vitamin D after supplementation I. establish a biobank of
      CSF, plasma, blood cells, serum and RNA samples for patients in selected centers for research
      on prognostic biomarkers of conversion J. establish a biobank consisting of plasma tubes
      collected for the determination of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D K. Estimate the rate of discordance
      between the conversion decision made by the study neurologist and the result of the MRI
      re-interpretation performed at the end of the study as well as the proportion of patients
      identified a posteriori as as erroneously included according to the centralized reading.
