      focus on movement of both hands at the same time or treatments that electrically stimulate
      the paretic (weak) hand muscles may help the recovery of hand function after stroke. In this
      study, two electrical stimulation treatments will be compared in their effectiveness in
      restoring hand movement and hand function. One of the treatments is stimulation only, and the
      other is stimulation linked to movement of the contralateral hand.

      Study participants will be stroke survivors who are enrolled while they are still within
      their first 6 months after their stroke. After enrolling, their hand movement and function
      will be tested. Then they will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. Each
      treatment will last 6 weeks. The treatment will require the participant to perform specific
      exercises at home for a total of 2 hours every day and to come to the laboratory twice a week
      for study-related occupational therapy. At the end of the 6-week treatment, tests of hand
      movement and hand function will be repeated. The same tests will be repeated again at 1 and 3
      months after the end of treatment to see if the effects of the treatment persist as time goes
      on. Changes in upper extremity impairment and activity limitation will be compared across
      treatment groups.
