      respiratory failure.Bi-Phasic Cuirass Ventilation (BPCV) is a form of non-invasive
      respiratory support, which can provide negative pressure ventilation as well as high
      frequency chest wall oscillations and cough mode.The standard therapy for CF patients to
      release mucous is treatment by a physiotherapist. In this study we will compare the effect of
      BPCV with regular physiotherapy by full pulmonary function testing prior and post treatment.
