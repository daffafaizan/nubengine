      vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) following aggressive transurethral resection
      of bladder tumors in patients with stage II transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
      without nuclear overexpression of mutant p53. II. Determine the proportion of patients
      treated with this regimen in whom bladder preservation rather than radical cystectomy is
      possible.

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo complete or near complete transurethral resection of the
      bladder tumor at entry or within 6 weeks prior to entry. Upon confirmation of staging and
      histology, patients receive combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine,
      doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) every 21 days for 4 courses. Subcutaneous G-CSF is given
      with each course. Patients with a complete response after chemotherapy proceed to
      intravesical therapy or observation; those with a partial response, stable disease, or
      progression proceed to definitive surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 patients will be entered over approximately 18 months.
