      options and care plan. However, the opportunity to monitor vital signs is largely limited to
      the time a patient spends at a healthcare providers premises. This study is being conducted
      to see if the use of small wearable monitoring devices could help deliver a better service
      and improve patient care by continuing to monitor patients remotely.

      The study is observational and has been designed to address two key questions:

        1. Is it possible in principle to use the information captured from the devices to improve
           the treatment of the patient?

        2. How practical is it to implement remote patient monitoring (RPM)?

      To address these questions, consenting patients will be asked to wear a small adhesive
      biosensor for a short period of time following discharge from hospital (either as an
      outpatient or inpatient).

      The data gathered by the device will be examined retrospectively and patients will not be
      monitored in real-time. Following the monitoring period, the vital signs data captured by the
      device will be analysed to see if it correlates with any unscheduled healthcare needs (such
      as unplanned GP appointments or emergency hospital visits). Specifically, the study team will
      be investigating whether the monitoring could have picked up a nascent problem before it
      became more serious, or whether monitoring could have saved the patient from having to make a
      trip to see their GP.

      Information regarding the practicalities of implementing RPM will be captured by monitoring
      compliance and through an exit interview with participating patients.
