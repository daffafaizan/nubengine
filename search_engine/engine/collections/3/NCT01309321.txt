      because of infectious syndromes such as sepsis, acute respiratory infection, neonatal
      tetanus, and diarrhea. Promoting handwashing to mothers in the post-neonatal period has been
      shown to reduce the risk of pneumonia and diarrhea among infants > 28 days old but there is
      little information on the protective effect of handwashing for neonatal health outcomes. The
      proposed study will assess motivators and barriers to handwashing with soap among new
      mothers, and develop and test a hand cleansing promotion intervention in rural Bangladesh.
      The handwashing behavior change intervention will include approaches to enhance maternal
      expectations of being a good nurturer, as well as enhancing maternal self-efficacy to carry
      out handwashing behavior.
