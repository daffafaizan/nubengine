      catecholamines to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. The development of a selective and
      sensitive assay of NPY1-36 (vasoconstrictor) and NPY3-36 (vasodilator) by LC-MS/MS will
      confirm this modulating role of NPY in sympatho vagal balance in healthy young subjects. This
      project should lead to a better understanding of the contribution of NPY to exercise
      physiology through a double-blind randomized study using a DPP4 inhibitor (Saxagliptin) used
      for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, blocking the formation of NPY3-36 and thus enhancing
      the effect of NPY1-36. The interest of this study will be to find targets other than
      adrenergic receptors in the regulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems during
      exercise.
