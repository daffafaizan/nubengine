    
      SCHEMA:

        -  Posterior Fossa Irradiation as defined by diagnostic MRI and CT simulation.

        -  37.5 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions administered via conformal beams.

        -  Radiosurgical boost (with dose titrated to parameters of RTOG 9005).

        -  Contrast enhanced MRI will be obtained at baseline and then at 3, 6, and 12 months
           following completion of posterior fossa irradiation.

        -  The Mini Mental Status Examination will be used to evaluate global cognitive function at
           baseline and then at 3, 6, and 12 months following completion of posterior fossa
           irradiation.
