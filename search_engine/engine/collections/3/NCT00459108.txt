      I. Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate and response rate (complete and partial
      response) at 4 months in patients with unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated
      with dasatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the median PFS and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      II. Assess the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3-6
      months thereafter.
