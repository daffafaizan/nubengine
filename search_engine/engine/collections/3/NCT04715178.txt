      patients who have been identified to receive molecular testing to better understand the
      relationship between genomic and molecular information and clinical outcomes, enabling timely
      and informed treatment decisions by physicians for cancer patients. We hypothesize that large
      gene panels, sequencing (DNA/RNA), and epigenetics of tumors can identify molecular
      aberrations in tumors that can be leveraged to offer more effective treatment. Findings may
      suggest additional research will be required to better understand the molecular underpinnings
      of the relationship between molecular abnormalities and disease. Banked specimens and the
      creation of tumor cell lines and xenograft models will enable this research to be performed.
