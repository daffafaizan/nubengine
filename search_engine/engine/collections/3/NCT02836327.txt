    
      Patients:

      Patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders were included.
      clinical characteristics such as disease duration, expanded disability status scale(EDSS)
      score, age, associated laboratory examination(autoantibodies directed to aquaporin-4 and
      oligoclonal bands in serum as well as cerebrospinal fluid)were recorded.

      Imaging scan were conducted at admission, six months and one year after admission

      Imaging protocols:

      MRI scan protocols: T2 weighted image, T1 weighted image, Diffusion weighted image(DWI),
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery(FLAIR), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging(DCE-MRI) , diffusion tension imaging(DTI) ,quantitative susceptibility mapping(QSM) ,
      arterial spin labeling(ASL) with post labeling delay(PLD) of seconds, sagittal CUBE Fluid
      Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images, sagittal 3-dimensional Fast Spoiled Gradient
      Echo(3D-FSPGR).

      Contrast agent:

      Omniscan 0.1mmol/kg, Inject rateï¼š2ml/s

      Imaging evaluation:

      Transfer constant volume value measured by DCE-MRI indicates the extent of blood-brain
      barrier destruction.

      Magnetic susceptibility manifests iron deposition in lesions and normal appearing white
      matter.

      Diffusion tension imaging demonstrates the extent of white matter fiber tracts destruction.

      Arterial spin labeling(ASL) with post labeling delay(PLD)of seconds shows cerebral blood flow
      in associated regions.
