      optical properties of tissues. The diagnostic tools utilize anomalies in the transmission of
      diffusing near infra-red light for the rapid detection of oxygenated and deoxygenated
      hemoglobin, near infra-red absorbing drug levels, blood volume changes, and scattering
      properties in tissues.

      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging measurements of breast tissue optical properties probe
      is similar in shape to an ultrasound probe. The imaging can measurements on different areas
      of the breast including diseased location and normal area. Optical measurements can guided by
      co-registered ultrasound measurements for the purpose of determining lesion size and
      location. Each measurement will require about 5-60 seconds to record the data and calculate
      optical properties. The process will be repeated until an adequate number of measurements are
      performed and measurements take 30 to 90 minutes.

      The researcher can determine that breast optical properties on demographic information, such
      as age and menopausal status as well as medical history.
