      month physical activity intervention trial, including female breast cancer patients diagnosed
      with histologically verified invasive cancer stage I-II or carcinoma in situ (DCIS/LCIS)
      grade 3.

        -  Participants are randomized to either control or intervention group 10 days +/- 2 days
           after surgery. The intervention start 3 weeks after surgery and continue throughout
           adjuvant treatments given (chemotherapy, radiation, endocrine therapy etc). The
           intervention group receive a detailed training program based on their own ventilatory
           maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) at baseline. They meet for supervised training
           sessions in groups for 60 minutes x 2/ week during 12 months. In addition, they are
           informed to exercise at home for at least of total 120 minutes weekly aiming to perform
           a total of 240 minutes exercise, weekly. The patients in the control group receive
           standard of care without any restrictions regarding exercise.

        -  All participants will undergo a series of measurements before surgery, after surgery, 6
           months and after the 12 months exercise intervention trial. Clinical measurements will
           include anthropometric measurements, fasting blood, fecal and urine samples and
           cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Complete questionnaires (food diary (PFD)/food
           frequency questionnaires (FFQ), quality of life (QoL)).

        -  All participants will come to clinical examination and fasting blood sampling after 2,
           3, 5 and 10 years follow up.
