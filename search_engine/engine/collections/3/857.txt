effect of heparin and parathyroid extract an acid phosphatase in bone.to test the theory that heparinmight stimulate acidphosphatase in the bone ofyoung rats, heparin, pte,or a combination of both wereinjected.  after an appropriatetime interval acid phosphataseactivity of bone oftreated animals was comparedwith controls.  it wasfound that heparin enhancedthe pte-stimulated acidphosphatase activity of bothcalvaria and metaphysis butnot diaphysis.  the possiblerelation of these facts tothe presence of lysosomes inosteoclasts was discussed.
