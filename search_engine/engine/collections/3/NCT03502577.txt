    
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of BCMA-specific CAR T-cells.

      Participants receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days -4 to -2. Participants then
      receive BCMA-specific CAR T-cells intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and
      gamma-secretase inhibitor LY3039478 orally (PO) on days 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18.
      Patients will also receive JSMD194 orally before the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to
      evaluate the effect of this drug alone on multiple myeloma cell BCMA levels.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for years
      1-5 and annually for years 6-15.
