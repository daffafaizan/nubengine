      the study, both atrial-ventricular node(AVN) ablation and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy
      (CRT) implantation are performed with HBP lead implanted and connected with the A port of CRT
      device. Followed with successful AVN ablation, HBP lead and CRT implantation, patients are
      1:1 randomized into BiVP and HBP group for 9 months and then crossover for another 9 months.
      The primary end points of the study is the change of left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF) in both HBP and BiV pacing group.
