      instability, surfactant deficiency and immature lungs that frequently result in respiratory
      failure. Management of these infants is difficult and most will require endotracheal
      intubation and mechanical ventilation (ETT-MV) within the first days of life to survive.
      ETT-MV is an invasive therapy that is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including
      ventilator-associated pneumonia, impaired neurodevelopment, and increased mortality.
      Consequently, clinicians try to remove ETT-MV as quickly as possible. However, 25 to 35% of
      these extubation attempts will fail and infants will require reintubation, an intervention
      that is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore physicians must
      determine the optimal time for extubation which minimizes the duration of ETT-MV and
      maximizes the chances of success. A variety of objective measures have been proposed to
      assist with this decision but none has proven to be useful clinically. Investigators from
      this group have recently explored the predictive power of indices of autonomic nervous system
      function based on measurements of heart rate (HRV) and respiratory variability (RV). The use
      of sophisticated, automated algorithms to analyze those cardiorespiratory signals have shown
      some promising preliminary results in predicting which infants can be extubated successfully.
