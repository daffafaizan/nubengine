      sequencing instrument, Illumina MiSeq, along with the associated computer infrastructure and
      bioinformatics software required for sequence analysis. This system is ultimately intended
      for use by the NIH Clinical Center Department of Laboratory Medicine to identify infectious
      agents in primary patient specimens. Next generation sequencing techniques based on
      sequencing of total DNA from primary specimens are expected to have many advantages over
      classical microbiological approaches. These include the detection of pathogens directly from
      primary specimens that may be difficult or impossible to culture.

      In this study, discarded patient samples and autopsy material will be tested with the MiSeq
      system to identify and classify bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. For the purpose of
      this study, the term samples will refer to any sample such as swabs, tissue biopsies, blood,
      feces, saliva, urine, wound, etc. The investigators analyzing the sequencing results will be
      blinded to the microbiology culture results for a validation subset of specimens to be tested
      with the MiSeq system. The results of the MiSeq analysis will be converted into a form that
      can be compared with the Microbiology Services official culture results that are stored in
      the laboratory information system (software from SCC SOFT Computer [Clearwater, FL, USA]).
