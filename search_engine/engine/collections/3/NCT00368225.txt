      an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) develop hepatitis C reinfection of the graft after
      transplantation. Most of these patients will progress to chronic hepatitis and 20-30% will
      experience a rapid progression to cirrhosis. It is unclear why it generally takes 20 or more
      years for progression to cirrhosis after the initial HCV infection, but as little as five
      years after OLT. Additionally, it is paradoxical that hepatitis C, which is thought to be
      immune-mediated, should advance more rapidly in patients who are immune suppressed. Rapid
      fibrosis progression post-transplantation is likely related to complex interactions between
      viral factors, host immune responses and induction and maintenance of immunosuppression for
      the prevention of graft rejection.

      This study has been designed as an observational, hypothesis-generating pilot study of
      patients with chronic hepatitis C requiring organ transplantation and concomitant
      immunosuppression. Patients who require a liver-transplant for chronic hepatitis C-related
      end-stage liver disease and patients with hepatitis C who require a kidney transplant for
      renal failure will be enrolled and followed for up to five years. Virologic, immunologic and
      intrahepatic parameters will be correlated with the level of immunosuppression, degree of
      fibrosis, progression to cirrhosis and liver-related deaths in study subjects. The objectives
      of this study are to: 1) determine the proportion of patients with hepatitis C that progress
      to bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis at three and five years after liver or kidney
      transplantation (rapid-progressors); 2) compare virologic, host-immune and intrahepatic
      factors in rapid-progressors to non-progressors and slow progressors; 3) characterize the
      relationship between general and HCV-specific immune responses and the extent of liver
      fibrosis; and 4) develop a predictive model that discriminates between rapid-progressors and
      non- or slow-progressors.
