      pain is a subjective phenomenon, it has frequently defied objective, quantitative
      measurements. Today, in order to measure pain, subjective uni-dimensional scales are used to
      quantify pain. One of the most common scale used to rate a patient's pain intensity is the
      Numeric Pain Scale (NPS), usually scored from 0 to 100. Hitherto, those scales are based on
      the subjective evaluation of pain by the patient.

      During anesthesia the patient cannot communicate and therefore the verbal or other report is
      impossible. As a consequence, due to misrepresentation of the existence or extent of pain,
      care providers may fail to estimate the correct measure of pain and give too much or too
      little medication, leading to possible complications and adverse reactions. A validated
      scoring system of subject's pain level, or as in the case of an anaesthetised patient,
      subject's nociception level, is therefore needed.

      In this study the investigators intend to test and analyze the performances of Medasense pain
      response index, PRI, by comparing it with other standard pain related indicators (Heart Rate
      (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Conductance, etc) before and after painful stimuli
      at different levels of analgesia. In addition, in order to reduce the variability between
      stimuli, a standardized stimulus (Tetanic ,30 sec, 100Hz, 60mA) will be given to all patients
      after sleep induction and before intubation, with and without administration of Fentanyl and
      the values of the PRI during these stimuli will be investigated.
