      (LA) NSCLC. Its superiority over radiotherapy alone or sequential chemoradiation has been
      proved in multiple phase III randomized trials. In a meta-analysis of six randomized studies,
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy decreased locoregional progression by 6.1% at 5 years when
      compared with sequential chemoradiation. This resulted in an improvement in overall survival
      of 4.5% at 5 years that was possibly directly related to locoregional control. Many patients
      however succumb to locoregional failure or distant metastases. Thanks to modern radiotherapy
      techniques, some strategies manage the geometrical uncertainties of imaging, treatment
      planning, and treatment delivery and thereby improve target coverage with a much steeper dose
      gradient and less irradiated normal tissue. The introduction of image-guided radiotherapy
      reveals the occurrence of target changes during treatment, and although the percentage of
      patients who experienced regression is not high (range 25%-40%), the degree of regression is
      in the range of 29% to 40%, corresponding to a rate of tumor shrinkage per fraction of 0.79%
      to 1.65%. Anatomical changes during radiotherapy might introduce discrepancies between the
      planned and delivered dose. Currently, the literature reports only dosimetric experiences and
      lacks clinical data on outcome when patients are treated with the adaptive approach. This
      study aims to investigate the failure pattern in patients with LA NSCLC treated with
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy with an adaptive approach, in particular, to evaluate the risk
      for local recurrence in the area excluded during replanning.
