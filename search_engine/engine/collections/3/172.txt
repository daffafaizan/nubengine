an electron microscopic study of wolffian lens regeneration in the adultnewt .changes in the morphology of cells during the regenerative tissuetransformation of the pigmented epithelium of the iris into lens in theadult newt triturus viridescens were studied in ultrathin sections usingthe electron microscope . in addition, quantitative analyses withelectron micrographs were performed . the cells of the normal iris arecharacterized by an abundance of melanin granules, an extensive smooth--surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, and irregular indentations of thenuclear membrane . after lens removal, the first visible changes aredetected in nuclei of the mediodorsal iris cells and involve an increasein the number of primary nucleoli . later, the nuclei enlarge and becomespherical, and prominent nucleoli appear . these nucleoli can bedistinguished from the normal nucleoli by the presence of the granularcortex surrounding the fibrous core . the pigment granules seem to becompletely extruded into the intercellular spaces and subsequently takenup by leucocytes . the endoplasmic reticulum disintegrates gradually andfinally almost disappears . there is a significant increase of ribosomesin the cytoplasm . later, the cytoplasmic matrix also acquires fibrouselements (about 50 a wide) of low density, probably corresponding innature to the main components of a normal lens cell . these and otherchanges in the transforming cells are discussed .
