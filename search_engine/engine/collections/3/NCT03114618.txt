      thromboembolic event is conditioned by individual genomic factors. The genes to be analyzed
      have clearly demonstrated their relationship with thromboembolic disease in other clinical
      contexts. This study is considered the initiation of a field of research in genomic risk
      markers indicating a risk of thrombosis in cancer patients. The ultimate goal of the study is
      to establish a clinic-genomic score for selecting patients with a high risk of suffering
      thrombotic events who can benefit from guided thromboprophylaxis. Its secondary goal is to
      prevent the adverse effects of ineffective therapies in other patients (low-risk patients not
      requiring an anti-thrombotic prophylaxis).

      The aim is to demonstrate the link between the clinic-genetic profile and the risk of
      suffering thromboembolic events in the group of cancer patients. The working hypothesis
      establishes that cancer patients who develop thrombotic events will have a higher score for
      the thrombosis risk clinic-genetic profile than cancer patients not developing thromboembolic
      events. The second aim is to analyse whether the thrombosis clinic-genetic risk score
      improves the detection of patients at risk of suffering a thromboembolic event compared to
      the Khorana predictive model routinely used (Khorana score).
