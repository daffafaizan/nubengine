      There is consensus that displaced fractures should be treated with open or arthroscopically
      assisted reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). However, the optimal method to diagnose
      displacement is debated. Radiographic, computed tomography (CT), and arthroscopic diagnostic
      criteria for the diagnosis of displacement exist. There is no consensus regarding the imaging
      modality and measurements to use to diagnose scaphoid displacement. The definition of
      displacement in recent randomized trials is incompletely described and inconsistent.
      Fluoroscopy is more convenient, less expensive, and uses less radiation than CT scanning. If
      displaced fractures are unstable, then this should be apparent on fluoroscopy. The aim of
      this study is to analyze if fluoroscopy is as accurate as computed tomography in diagnosing
      displacement of acute scaphoid waist fractures.
