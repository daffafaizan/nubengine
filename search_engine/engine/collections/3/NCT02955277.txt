      group allocation. Participants will be referred to the study from 'Maccabi Healthcare
      Services' by family physicians and geriatric physician of 'Maccabi Healthcare Services
      Central District'. The majority of TECH protocol training will take place in the
      participants' home as self-practice. The assessment and weekly group meetings will take place
      at clinics of Maccabi Healthcare Services in the Central District. A Helsinki approval
      (#2016009) has already been obtained. Participants will receive information regarding the
      study and if eligible will sign a consent form, undergo the screening and then the
      pre-intervention assessments. Then they will be randomly allocated into experimental or
      control group by a computer program (stratification of the severity of the cognitive decline
      according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores of above or below 23 points).
      The experimental group participants will receive the TECH protocol, while participants in the
      control group will continue to receive standard care. Following the intervention a second
      assessment will be performed, as well as six-months follow-up assessment.
