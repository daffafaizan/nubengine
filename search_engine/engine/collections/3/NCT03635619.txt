    
      To explore the value of 3 T MRI using multiple sequences, including T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps and
      StarVIBE, in evaluating the preoperative TN staging and prediction of response to neoadjuvant
      therapy and OS in patients with esophageal cancer.

      Patients with endoscopically biopsy-proven EC were prospectively enrolled for imaging on a 3
      T scanner. The MRI protocol included T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps and StarVIBE sequences, and so on.
      Patients received treatment according to NCCN guideline. Readers assigned a TN stage on MRI,
      and post-operative pathologic confirmation was considered the gold standard. Inter-reader
      agreement, the diagnostic accuracy of TN staging on MRI were analyzed and compared to
      post-operative pathologic TN staging. MRI features were analyzed to find the correlation
      between pretreatment MRI features and response or OS. The study will includ 400 patients.
      Inter-reader agreements of TN staging were analyzed excellent for MRI. Diagnostic accuracy of
      MRI will be calculated.
