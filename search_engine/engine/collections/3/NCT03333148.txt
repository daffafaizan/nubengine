      and costly disease of unknown etiology that now affects over 3.1 million people in the United
      States. Patients with IBD suffer from lifelong malnutrition, pain and bleeding with added
      risks of cancers, obstructions and fistulas. There is no known cure and the incidence
      continues to grow. While treatments are usually medical IBD patients will undergo at least
      one major surgery during their lifetime. Patients also have particularly poor surgical
      outcomes with high rates of post-operative complications. In an attempt to improve the risk
      profile of patients and decrease complications, preoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
      has been used to optimize IBD patients for surgery. While this approach has been successful
      the cost and morbidities of TPN prohibit its generalized application. Practical strategies
      that improve surgical outcomes for IBD patients are urgently needed. Improving nutritional
      deficiencies before an operation may be a practical way to improve post-operative outcomes.
      The oral administration of preoperative immunonutrition, is an alternative method to improve
      nutritional states and may have utility in IBD patients who have particularly severe
      nutritional deficiencies because of disease-specific issues in malabsorption, maldigestion
      and loss of appetite.
