      ASP1707 on Day 1. They remain in the clinic for 6 days and are discharged on Day 7 if
      sufficient recovery of administered radioactivity is achieved, or the total excretion (urine
      + feces) per 24 hours is less than 1% of the administered dose during 2 consecutive 24-hour
      intervals. If these conditions are not met, the residential period may be prolonged for a
      maximum of 3 days. If after this time one of the conditions is still not met, subjects are
      requested to continue collecting their urine and/or feces at home for another 2 days. If
      after these additional 2 days one of the conditions is still not met, the condition of
      recovery of radioactivity is disregarded. Therefore only the total excretion condition is to
      be met by collecting 24-hour intervals for urine and feces once a week for up to 2 weeks. If
      the excretion condition is still not met after this time, no further samples are collected
      and the subject is discharged from the study.
