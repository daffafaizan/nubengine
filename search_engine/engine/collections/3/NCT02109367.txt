      cancer markers, cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), are
      measurable from cul-de-sac washings collected via culdocentesis. Immediately prior to the
      scheduled surgery, while the patient is under general anesthesia, a long, thin needle will be
      inserted through the wall of the vagina (just below the uterus) to access the cul-de-sac. A
      saline wash will then be performed and this fluid will be collected for analysis of tumor
      markers. CA-125 and HE4 levels will be compared to serum levels for correlation with a
      diagnosis of ovarian cancer. A urine sample will also be collected from this same cohort to
      measure estrogen metabolites. Estrogen metabolism is associated with cancer progression in
      estrogen sensitive tissues. Estrogen metabolites, 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) the "good"
      byproduct and 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1) known as the "bad" byproduct, have been
      implicated in the development of breast cancer. Study investigators are proposing to expand
      the utility of this predictive ratio to ovarian cancer by measuring the potential imbalance
      of these metabolites.

      If results indicate an association between cancer diagnosis and levels of CA-125 and HE4 or
      the ratio of estrogen metabolites from the urine, this could allow for a new minimally
      invasive, low-risk diagnostic modality for all suspected ovarian cancer cases. This would be
      particularly invaluable for patients at higher risk for poor surgical outcomes. Data from
      this pilot study will confirm the potential effect size needed to identify an optimal
      cut-point useful for the prediction of EOC within this study population.
