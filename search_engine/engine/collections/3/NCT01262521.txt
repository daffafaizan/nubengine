    
      Administration of a single dose of nitrate intervention or water alone to healthy volunteers.
      Before and up to 4 hours (short-term)/6 days (long-term) after ingestion, marker of vascular
      function are measured in plasma and by using high-resolution ultrasound.

      Measurements are taken before and up to 4 h after double blind cross-over per os
      administration of a single dose of nitrate intervention (150 ml tab water with 150 umol/kg
      sodium-nitrate) or water control (100 ml Chapelle mineral water) to healthy volunteers.
      Circulating angiogenic cells are measured as CD34+/KDR+ and CD133+/KDR+ mononuclear cells in
      blood by flow cytometry and plasma is analyzed for nitrate and nitrite, as well as
      mobilization markers and cytokines including stromal cell derived factor, vascular
      endothelial growth factor and stem cell factor. All measurements are performed after >12h
      overnight fasting.
