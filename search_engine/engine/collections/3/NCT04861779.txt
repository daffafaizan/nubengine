    
      This study is divided into 2 parts. Phase 1a is a dose escalation to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of HSK29116 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell
      malignancies, who have required and received at least 1 prior systemic therapy and for whom
      no other therapies are known to provide clinical benefit. Phase 1b will investigate the
      efficacy of HSK29116 at the dose selected in Phase 1a in up to 3 cohorts of patients with R/R
      B-cell malignancy indications who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, and at
      least half of the subjects must have received covalent BTK inhibitors who must have received
      genetic testing to get the mutation status of BTK C481 positive before enrollment：

      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)； Mantle Cell Lymphoma
      (MCL)； Other B-cell malignancies (they will be selected according to the preliminary results
      of Phase Ia)
