      original study (conducted 2009-2010) are asked with a questionnaire. Information on influenza
      vaccinations is collected with vaccination cards and monthly short message service (SMS), and
      verified in registers, if needed. If an epidemic caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus starts in
      Finland, the participants are asked to actively report symptoms of influenza like illnesses
      (ILI). The symptoms are also monitored by weekly SMS. In case of ILI, nasal and oral swabs
      are collected to verify the 2009 H1N1 influenza cases. Paired serum samples are collected at
      the acute on convalescence phase of the disease. The occurrence of laboratory-confirmed 2009
      H1N1 influenza cases is compared between vaccinated and not (yet) vaccinated persons.
