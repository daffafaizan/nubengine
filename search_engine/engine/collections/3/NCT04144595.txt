      outcome. OGTT is performed routinely in pregnancy and hypoglycemia following this screening
      test is often encountered and the implication of this finding for the fetal growth is
      unclear.

      The aim of study will be determinate the association of low maternal plasma glucose in OGTT
      in women with impaired birth weight and determinate if this result is predictive of low birth
      weight (<10th percentile according to the INTERGROWTH-21st newborn weight standards for
      gestational age/sex).

      The study population will consist of patients with singleton pregnancies who will undergo
      OGTT at 24-34 weeks, have regular medical checkups throughout their entire pregnancy, deliver
      on or after 25 week gestation and fulfill inclusion criteria.

      The birth weight will be compared between women with low fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (<10th
      percentile, <65 mg/dL*) and normal FPG (≥10th percentile, ≥ 65 mg/dL) also for 1 and 2-hour
      plasma glucose (1-h PG/2-h PG). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis will be used
      to determine the optimal lower OGTT threshold for the prediction of low birth weight.

      This study will be performed according to the standards of the Helsinki Declaration and
      approval was obtained from the ethics and educational issues coordinating committee of our
      University Hospital.
