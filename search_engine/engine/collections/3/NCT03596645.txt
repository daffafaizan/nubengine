    
      This is a multicenter study in pediatric participants aged 2 to 17 years with moderately to
      severely active UC, defined as a baseline Mayo score of 6 through 12, inclusive, with an
      endoscopy subscore of greater than or equal to (>=)2. This 54-week study will consist of a
      6-week short-term phase and a 48-week long-term phase followed by a study extension (Week 54
      to end of study). At Week 58, participants who are eligible will continue receiving golimumab
      in the study extension. The primary hypothesis is that golimumab is an effective therapy in
      pediatric UC relative to historical placebo control as assessed by clinical remission based
      on Mayo score. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
