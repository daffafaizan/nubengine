      of the implant should be developed & this physiological phenomenon is known by the term of
      osseointegration.

      Initially, it was supposed that to achieve osseointegration, implants had to be submerged
      under the mucosa & left without any loading for a period of 3-4 months in mandible and 6-8
      months in maxilla.

      Recently immediate implant placement at the time of extraction has become a viable treatment
      alternative, this approach provides the advantages of decreasing the patient's discomfort,
      the treatment's duration and costs.

      Aiming to reduce healing process to limit such changes in the soft & hard tissues and
      reducing treatment time, several alterations in both surgical and restorative procedures has
      been introduced. From an implant design perspective, two approaches including the fields of
      biomaterials and/or biomechanics have been most utilized; implant body design which aim to
      increase the primary stability and surface modifications to allow faster osseointegration
      process.

      Rough implant surface is modified by different techniques. Among these different techniques,
      interest in of using laser to achieve roughened surfaces.

      Commercially available implant surfaces are moderately roughened surfaces and they are
      obtained by acid-etching following alumina or titanium oxide grit-blasting.

      Although the micro-rough implants can be successful in compromised clinical scenarios, the
      bioinert nature of titanium surfaces cannot stimulate a more rapid bone regeneration and
      mechanical fixation of dental implants.
