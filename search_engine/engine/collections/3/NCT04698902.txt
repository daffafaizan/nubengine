      Cardiologists. Moderate calcification is found in over 25% of coronary artery lesions planned
      for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Outcomes for patients undergoing PCI to
      calcified lesions have been shown to be consistently poorer than in non-calcified lesions.
      Recently, intravascular lithotripsy has become available for the treatment of calcified
      coronary artery disease. The effect of intravascular lithotripsy on varying calcium patterns
      has not been adequately explored.

      This is an investigator initiated, open label, non-blinded, observational study involving a
      number of centers in Spain. Patients with an indication of PCI and with a significant calcium
      burden requiring modification will be invited to participate. PCI procedures will be
      performed via either radial or femoral access as deemed appropriate by the operator and in
      accordance with local protocols. Intravascular imaging using OCT will be performed prior to
      calcium modification to define the pattern of calcium, after calcium modification to assess
      the effectiveness of IVL therapy and after stent implantation to assess stent expansion.
