      of the two admissions will be randomized. During the Control Admission at home, the subject
      will use the study insulin pump along with a continuous glucose monitor receiver. During the
      Experimental Admission, the subject will be the research house/hotel where the subject will
      be in control of the DiAs. Participation in this study will require 5 study visits over 11-14
      weeks.
