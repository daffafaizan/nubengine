      number of implanted prostheses is increasing, however, at the same time, orthopaedic surgeons
      also find complications inherent to this surgery, where peri-prosthetic infection results to
      be the most devastating. In order to find a solution to this terrible complication,
      prophylactic and therapeutic measures have been implemented, emerging techniques where the
      application of local antibiotics in the surgical site has turned out to be a promising
      concept. It has been shown that the non-modifiable risk factors of patients undergoing joint
      replacement surgery increase the risk of infection rate. Therefore, the identification of
      risk factors, decolonization and the prophylactic administration of antibiotics allow an
      effective reduction of periprosthetic infection. In order to reduce and, as far as posible,
      avoid periprosthetic infections in participants undergo knee or hip joint replacement with
      non-modifiable risk factors, the prophylactic use of calcium sulphate loaded with antibiotic
      for local application is proposed.
