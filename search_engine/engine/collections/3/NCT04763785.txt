      and irregularity. Corneal imaging is crucial in keratoconus detection and progression
      analysis. Detection of keratoconus in early stages is important and has therapeutic
      consequence, whether to plan a surgical intervention or calculating an intraocular lens,
      before cataract surgery, as standard lens calculation techniques may lead to wrong results in
      patients with a keratoconus.

      The Eyestar 900 is a swept-source OCT biometer and has the potential to be used for early
      keratoconus identification and progression analysis.
