      million as of 2018. Most troubling, in 2013 (the most recent year for which census data is
      available) one in every 30 children in the U.S., or 2.5 million, experienced homelessness. In
      addition to having disproportionally higher rates of unmet health needs (e.g., acute health
      problems, trauma-related injuries), children experiencing homelessness have staggering mental
      health needs such that 78% suffer from at least one mental health issue (e.g., depression,
      behavior problems) along with academic/developmental delays. Given that over half of all
      homeless children in the US are under the age of 6, it is particularly important to
      investigate the effectiveness of evidence-based parenting programs within a homeless
      population. This study aims to compare the efficacy in delivering two evidence-based
      parenting programs to families and young children experiencing homelessness.
