    
      Objective: To study whether a culture medium that allows undisturbed culture supports human
      embryo development to the blastocyst stage equivalently to a well-established sequential
      media.

      Design: Randomized, double-blinded sibling trial. Setting: Independent in vitro fertilization
      (IVF) clinics. Patient(s): One hundred twenty-eight patients, with 1,356 zygotes randomized
      into two study arms.

      Intervention(s): Embryos from each patient were randomly allocated into two study arms to
      compare embryo development on a time-lapse system using a single-step medium or sequential
      media.
