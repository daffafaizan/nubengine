      and treatment of airway and pleural malignancy. In the events of burn injury and smoke
      inhalation injury, the Optical coherence tomography can determine the change of the airway
      tissues and severity of airway injury.

      During endoscopic procedure the lesions will be biopsied and prepared by standard histologic
      methods. The Optical coherence tomography endoscopic imaging can measured histologic of the
      tissue samples and compared to standard histologic examination. The Optical coherence
      tomography endoscopic imaging can measured the epithelial thickness and compared to visual
      inspection of the mucosa on bronchoscopy.
