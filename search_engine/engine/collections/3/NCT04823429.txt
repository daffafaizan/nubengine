      endothelial cell. For coronary artery patients, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase
      activity in red blood cell (RBC-eNOS activity) is lower than age-matched health people, and
      it is related with dysfunction of endothelial cell. In cardiovascular diseases. the
      erythrocyte arginase-1 is active and seize L-arginine with eNOS. When the Arg-1 stimulated by
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), the nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity decrease and produce more
      ROS, meanwhile, ROS can go around to stimulate Arg-1. When the RBC-NO production is lowering,
      it will increase the adhesion activity to endothelial cell due to erythrocyte can be quite
      close to blood vessel well then release Nitric Oxide, induce the dysfunction and oxidative
      pressure of endothelial cell. The NO can also regulate the deformability of erythrocytes, and
      extremely affect oxygen supply to tissue once the deformability and aggregation of
      erythrocyte become abnormal. Besides NO, the deformability will be affected if erythrocyte is
      continuously exposed to the endogenous or exogenous ROS, which also increase adhesion to
      endothelial cell with the exposure of phosphatidylserine. Exercise can regulate the mechanism
      of NO release from erythrocyte, affecting the rheology of erythrocyte, and improve the
      anti-oxidation ability. Therefore, as mentioned above which make erythrocyte, as many
      aspects, become an important role on atherosclerosis disease treatment.
