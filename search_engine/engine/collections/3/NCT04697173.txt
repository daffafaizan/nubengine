      and stressful experience for parents and caregivers. Despite the high survival when compared
      to adult ICUs, a PICU admission can have meaningful long-term, negative health consequences
      for adult caregivers including symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. There is little
      known in regards to what specific factors impact the mental health of parents/caregivers of
      PICU patients. However, research into stress and anxiety has suggested that uncertainty is a
      significant contributor to stress when faced with a new environment.

      Usual informed consent for procedures performed in the PICU is obtained immediately prior to
      the procedure. Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to either
      usual informed consent prior to each procedure or to a single consent form obtained upon
      admission to PICU for possible procedures their child may undergo. In this study participants
      will be asked to complete a survey at two separate times during the child's PICU
      hospitalization- 48-72 hours after admission and again upon transfer or discharge from the
      PICU. Data will be collected about the child from the medical record including age,
      diagnosis/reason for PICU admission, length of stay, and any procedures performed in PICU
      requiring consent.
