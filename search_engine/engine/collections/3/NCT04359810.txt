      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Exposure to viruses
      results in an adaptive immune response that commonly include antibodies with neutralization
      activity. Plasma from subjects who have recovered from viral infections has been used to both
      prevent or treat disease. Notable examples of the successful use of convalescent plasma (CP)
      include influenza, measles, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome
      (MERS), Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). Small clinical trials and
      observational studies of CP therapy in patients with COVID-19 have suggested a possible
      clinical benefit.
