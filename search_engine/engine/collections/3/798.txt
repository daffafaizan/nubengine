incidence of symptoms of early infantile autism insubsequently hospitalized psychiatric patientsthis study was concerned with therelationship between the occurrence dur-ing the first two years of life of symptomsof early infantile autism, as retrospective-ly reported by the mothers of s's andsubsequent adjustment.  the mothers of69 unmarried young hospitalized psychia-tric patients were interviewed to deter-mine the presence or absence of each of28 different signs contained in a checklist.  the signs represent characteristicfeatures that are reportedly often foundin conjunction with early infantile autism.as a control, 50 mothers of high schoolstudents residing in the community andpresenting no significant adjustment prob-lems were questioned in regard to thevery same items.the results indicated that there weresignificantly more symptoms reported forpatients than for normals, and that thisfinding applied to the overall number ofsymptoms as well as to several subcate-gories of symptoms.  the items classifiedunder the heading of "social withdrawal"appeared to be the most sensitive in dif-ferentiating the groups.  it was also foundthat 11 of the 28 signs distinguished be-tween the patients and normals, with allexcept one occurring more frequently inthe former group.  it was concluded thata significant relationship existed betweenthe reported presence of symptoms thatare often associated with severe and earlyego impairment and subsequent status asa mental hospital patient.  this study doesnot provide any direct answer to the ques-tion of what proportion of children withinfantile autism are later able to make anadequate adjustment outside of a mentalhospital.
