      countries. Approximately 50% of Zambian children are thought to be affected. This randomized
      control trial will test the efficacy of provitamin A carotenoid biofortified maize meal
      consumption as a strategy to improve vitamin A status among lactating Zambian mothers and
      their infants. The investigators will enroll up to 255 mother/infant pairs to a three-month
      study, during which they will receive one of the following three interventions: 1)
      conventional white maize, 2) provitamin A carotenoid biofortified orange maize, or 3)
      preformed vitamin A fortified white maize.
