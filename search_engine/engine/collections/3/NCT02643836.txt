      procedure as outlined above. After consent and screening are complete each subject will
      receive a hat that delivers three 15 minute stimulations per day for the duration of 6 weeks.
      Each study subject will receive two hats, which contain the integrated PEMF device, this will
      be done to ensure continuity of treatment in case that one of the hats stops working due to
      the battery running out.

      The PEMF device to be used will be an investigational, battery powered custom-made stimulator
      able to deliver an electromagnetic field. This device operates at very low amplitude (0.05
      gauss magnetic field strength) and requires only watch batteries for power, which allows the
      technology to be portable (e.g., used at home), versatile, inexpensive, and safe, (vi) we
      have integrated the PEMF device into a wearable baseball hat to improve tolerance and
      compliance and can also monitor patient use in this configuration.

      The study device consists of a printed circuit board PEMF signal generator and an AAA
      battery-driven power supply encased in high density plastic, a solid wire-loop antenna
      covered in medical grade silicone, all of which are built into a standard baseball-style cap,
      with the antenna fitted around its largest internal circumference. The device was designed to
      be easily used and is activated by donning the cap. Once donned, a 15-minute treatment cycle
      starts and stops automatically. The device requires at least 2 hours between treatments, and
      cannot be activated again until that period has elapsed. A light on the power supply blinks
      while the unit is active. EEG and NIR will be obtained at visits 1, 2 and at three month
      follow up to better evaluate brain oxygenation and metabolism.
