      disease and its treatment safety and efficacy by collecting the appropriate data and using
      data collected under the long term provisions of the DEBuT-HT study to describe and analyze
      the changes in ongoing drug treatment, the programming parameters of the implanted active
      device and any occurring adverse events over a period of up to 13 months after implant
      surgery in the DEBuT-HT trial. Annual follow-ups of up to five years are planned subsequently
      to the 13-month follow-up period.
