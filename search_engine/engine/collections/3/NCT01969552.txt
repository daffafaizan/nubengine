    
      Study Design: Prospective observational cross-sectional monocentre study

      Eligible Patients: Adult subjects presenting for thyroid testing or treatment to the
      Department of Nuclear Medicine, Klinikum Luedenscheid, Luedenscheid, Germany.

      Inclusion criteria: All consecutively seen subjects who consent to precipitate and to fill
      out a questionnaire, which represent the full functional spectrum, as seen in a praxis
      setting.

      Exclusion criteria from analysis: Missing consent, severe illness that may be associated with
      euthyroid sick syndrome (non-thyroidal illness syndrome), pregnancy, pituitary and
      hypothalamic disorders as well as medication that may impair pituitary thyroid hormone
      feedback

      Methods: Except for a detailed questionnaire the study includes routine work-up, established
      standard procedures for diagnosis and standard care for treatment of thyroid disease Patient
      history and physical examination Detailed questionnaire on disease history and medication
      Measurement of thyroid function parameters and autoantibodies Ultrasound of thyroid gland and
      scintigraphy where required

      Statistical analysis includes group comparisons, correlations, generalised linear models with
      multiple covariates and more advanced modelling techniques of feedback control and FT3-
      FT4-TSH interrelations, as previously described (4, 5, 6).

      Outcome Measures: Group comparisons among treated patients and untreated subjects and various
      disease entities, modelling of lnTSH interactions with FT4 and FT3,influence of clinically
      relevant covariates on FT3-FT4-TSH interrelations and equilibria.

      Estimated Duration: approx. 12 months
