      toward those pathogens. These antibodies can be found in the plasma portion of the blood.
      This plasma is referred to as "Convalescent plasma" and contains these infection fighting
      antibodies. Through a blood donation, this convalescent plasma is collected from a recovered
      person and transfused to a sick patient who is still fighting the same virus. This protocol
      will make convalescent COVID-19 plasma available to individuals who meet the eligibility
      criteria described.
