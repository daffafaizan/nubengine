           water at 6:00 AM to make sure they are not dehydrated when the experiments begin.

        2. On two occasions the volunteer receives, at 9:00 AM, an intravenous infusion of acetated
           Ringer´s solution being either 5 ml/kg or 10 ml/kg, over 15 min. The blood hemoglobin
           concentration is measured during 16 occasions during 120 min by invasive blood sampling
           and also non-invasively by a pulse oximeter (Masimo´s Radical 7).

        3. On two other occasions, the infusions are preceded for 2 hours of deliberate
           dehydration. Doses of furosemide 5 mg are repeated 3-4 times with the goal of creating
           dehydration amounting to approximately 2 liters of fluid. Excreted urine is collected
           and the volume measured.

        4. The kinetics of each infusion is calculated by volume kinetics, and the data compared
           pairwise from the experiments with and those without dehydration.

        5. The accuracy and precision of the non-invasive monitoring of Hgb can be determined.

        6. The study is ended with that the Hgb response between the lying and sitting position is
           compared and with that the fluid balance is restored by ingestion of water.

        7. Experiments are performed in the Department of Intensive Care at Linköping University
           Hospital, Sweden.
