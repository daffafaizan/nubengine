      rates for esophageal cancer have remained less than 15% over decades, probably because of
      ineffective therapies and the detection of late-stage cancers. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy
      was established as one of the viable options for therapy of patients with localized EC
      following the results from the landmark trial of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
      85-01 trial, showing a significant survival advantage of concurrent chemoradiation over
      radiation alone.

      The use of radiochemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a well-accepted
      standard for the definitive treatment of esophageal cancer in China which has also been
      demonstrated efficacy and good tolerability internationally. The AJCC recommended dose range
      of radiotherapy for concurrent therapy is 45-50.4Gy. Moreover, (RTOG) 85-01 trial also
      established 50.4 Gy as the standard dose of radiation to be administered concurrently with
      chemotherapy. However, the appropriate dose of radiation fit for Chinese remains
      controversial. Due to insufficient evidence of EBM, radiation therapist in China always
      prescribe a radiation dosage by their own experience. Dosages (e.g. 60-64Gy) significantly
      higher than the international standard is commonly used in Chinese EC patients which lead to
      a greater likelihood of toxicity. Thus Chinese oncologists are urgent to reach a consensus
      about radiation dosage in the standard treatment of local advanced EC.
