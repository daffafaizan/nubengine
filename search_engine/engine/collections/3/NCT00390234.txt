      I. To assess the objective response of recurrent or metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue
      sarcomas to VEGF-Trap (ziv-aflibercept).

      II. To assess the incidence of disease stabilization, as measured by 6-month progression-free
      survival, in patients with recurrent or metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcomas treated
      with VEGF-Trap.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time-to-progression and overall survival in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma treated with VEGF-Trap.

      * As of 24 October 2012, overall survival follow-up is to be discontinued for the one
      remaining patient on long term follow-up, who has been off protocol therapy for at least 3
      years. Time to progression and median survival times have been based on the currently
      available data.

      II. To assess the toxicity associated with VEGF-Trap in patients with recurrent or metastatic
      gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma.

      III. To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of VEGF-Trap and to explore for
      demographic and clinical covariates

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to histology (uterine leiomyosarcoma vs malignant mixed
      mullerian tumor/carcinosarcoma). Patients receive ziv-aflibercept over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients undergo blood collection at baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and
      60 days after completion of study treatment for population pharmacokinetic analysis using
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
