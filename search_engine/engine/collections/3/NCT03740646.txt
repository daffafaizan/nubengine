      fungus, occurs early in childhood. Early investigations of primary infection considering the
      detection of P. jirovecii in respiratory specimens suggests that primary infection in infants
      without immunodeficiency could be either asymptomatic or symptomatic. The infection may be
      identified as an apparently benign respiratory infection evolving on its own, but may also be
      contemporaneous with another viral or bacterial respiratory infection. In addition, there are
      little data available on the genotypic characteristics of P. jirovecii in infants developing
      primary infection.

      In this context, the project will focus on the detection of P. jirovecii in hospitalized
      infants, presented with symptoms, and without overt immunodeficiency. The prospective
      collection of biological, clinical and epidemiological data in these infants will make it
      possible to identify risk factors for the acquisition of the fungus and to address its role
      in symptoms and clinical presentation. A second focus will be on the identification and
      comparison of genotypes in infants developing primary infection and in immunocompromised
      adults developing PPC or colonized by the fungus. These two approaches are the necessary
      steps to address the putative role of these patient populations (infants and adults) in the
      human reservoir of the fungus. A third focus will be the detection and genotypic
      identification of P. jirovecii in infants and the exhaled air of infants in their
      environment. The potential role of infants as potential infectious sources may be determined.
