      the highest risk of adverse events, including death from anaphylaxis. Visits to one pediatric
      emergency department for anaphylaxis doubled between 2001 and 2006, suggesting a rapidly
      escalating public health burden. Despite this critical concern, there are few evidence-based
      strategies to improve food allergy management in adolescents, who must sustain three core
      prevention strategies: diligent avoidance of allergenic foods, consistent carrying of
      potentially life-saving epinephrine auto-injectors, and prompt administration of epinephrine
      in the event of anaphylaxis.

      The objective of this study is to develop and test interventions to encourage safer food
      allergy management among adolescents. The primary outcome is consistency of
      epinephrine-carrying, measured using cell phone photographs at randomly-timed check-ins. This
      study will be among the first to longitudinally track normative food allergy management
      practices and one of the first to test behavior change strategies.

      In a cohort multiple randomized controlled trial (n=130), the study will include two
      experiments to test the effectiveness of text message reminders and incentives, using various
      incentive designs that have proven effective in prior behavioral economics interventions to
      encourage weight loss and smoking cessation. Aim 1. Test the impact of a text-message
      reminder system on consistency of epinephrine carrying. Aim 2. Test the impact of modest
      incentives on consistency of epinephrine carrying. Based on promising preliminary data, the
      central hypothesis is that, compared to controls, adolescents who receive text message
      reminders plus modest financial incentives will more consistently carry their epinephrine.
