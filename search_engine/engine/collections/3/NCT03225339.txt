      randomising young adult patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes to an intervention
      incorporating a low calorie diet and physical activity or usual care. The investigators
      hypothesise that patients in the low calorie intervention arm will have greater weight
      reduction leading to significant improvement in glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk.
      The primary outcome will be weight loss. The low calorie diet intervention arm is designed to
      achieve and maintain significant weight loss through decreased calorie intake, increased
      physical activity, and behaviour change. Usual care will include routine advice about diet
      and physical activity. Secondary outcomes include diabetes control, body composition, and
      quality of life.
