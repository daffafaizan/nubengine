    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm the safety and efficacy of cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) specific T cells
      (autologous NY-ESO-1-specific cluster of differentiation [CD]8-positive T lymphocytes) in
      patients with advanced synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma following
      conditioning with high dose cyclophosphamide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm the persistence of NY-ESO-1 tetramer positive cells in the peripheral blood at
      10 weeks after T cell infusion for synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma
      patients receiving NY-ESO-1 specific T cells following cyclophosphamide conditioning but not
      post-infusion interleukin (IL)-2.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2 and NY-ESO-1 specific
      T cells IV over 60 minutes on day 0. Patients may receive additional infusions at the
      discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 weeks.
