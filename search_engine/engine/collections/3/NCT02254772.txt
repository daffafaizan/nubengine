      targeting certain cells. Biological therapies, such as TLR9 agonist SD-101, use substances
      made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways
      and stop cancer cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer
      cells and shrink tumors. Giving ipilimumab in combination with TLR9 agonist SD-101 and
      radiation therapy may be a better treatment for B-cell lymphoma.

      Study objectives are dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the treatment assessments tumor
      response and time-to-progression. Cohort 1 dose level is 10 mg ipilimumab, subsequent cohort
      is 5 or 25 mg ipilimumab.

        -  If 2 out of 6 patients experience a DLT in the first cohort (10 mg ipilimumab), the dose
           will be de-escalated to 5 mg ("Cohort -1").

        -  If 2 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at the 5 mg dose level, then the study will be
           stopped.
