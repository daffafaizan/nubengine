      primarily associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA. The disease is a common cause of
      blindness in both eyes of affected teenagers and young adults. There is currently no approved
      effective treatment for LHON.

      In 2011, the first LHON gene therapy investigator-initiated study was conducted (registered
      in December 2010 with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01267422) to explore the safety and
      efficacy of gene therapy for LHON. The gene therapy was a recombinant adeno-associated virus
      serotype 2 containing human mitochondrial ND4 (MT-ND4) gene (rAAV2-ND4). By 36 months of
      follow-up, six out of nine patients who received the rAAV2-ND4 intravitreal injection
      experienced clinically significant vision improvement and no adverse events were observed.

      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center study to further evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of rAAV-ND4 in the treatment of LHON patients with G11778A mutation. All patients
      will be treated with a single intravitreal injection rAAV-ND4, with dose 1 Ã— 10^10 vg/0.05 mL
      in one of the eyes.
