    
      Aim: Several questionnaires have been developed for clinical research in Traditional Chinese
      Medicine. The objective of this study is to evaluate the consistency and relevance of two
      questionnaires, the Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) and the Body
      Constitutions Questionnaire (BCQ).

      Method: Between December 2015 and December 2016, a sample of 150 participants aged above 20
      years from the Chinese Medical University "elder college" curriculum and outpatients at the
      Hospital in Taichung, Taiwan, will be interviewed to complete both questionnaires based on
      subjective symptoms in a 3-d interval. There are three common patterns of body constitutions
      in CCMQ and BCQ: gentleness/plain, Ying-deficiency, and Yang-deficiency. As for other body
      constitutions, Qi-deficiency, phlegm-dampness, dampness-heat, blood-stasis, Qi-depression,
      and special diathesis are described only in CCMQ, while stasis is a feature only defined in
      BCQ. Average and standard deviation will be used to describe the measurement scores of the
      questionnaires and the percentages of constitution distribution. Statistical analysis of the
      Kappa value, Pearson Chi-Square, odds ratio, and Pearson's correlation coefficient would be
      employed to examine the consistency and association between the two questionnaires.

      Expected result: The investigators hope to 1) describe the constitution profile of the study
      population; 2) assess the consistency between two questionnaires; and 3) examine the
      associations between CCMQ and demographic life style factors.
