    
      Pain and recovery after surgery are extremely concerned by patients undergoing surgery.
      Though it is important to understand the recovery course of postsurgical pain and recovery,
      most previous studies just focused on one specific time point, and the results were
      inconsistent.

      To investigate the impact of PSP on HRQoL within the first six months following surgery using
      PRO measures, patients undergoing several specific surgeries will be interviewed. The
      investigator will approach to the screened patients one day before surgery (Day-1), using a
      letter of invitation to explain the survey, and obtain an informed consent. Questionnaires
      for pre-surgical assessment will be administrated by a face-to-face interview. Follow-ups
      will be performed at several time-points within six month after surgery to evaluate pain and
      recovery by face-to-face interview or by telephone interview if the patient is discharged.
      Patients' medical charts will be reviewed by investigators to record sociodemographic and
      clinical data.
