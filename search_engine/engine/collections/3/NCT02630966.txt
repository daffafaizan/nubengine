      to treat people who have fistulizing CD. This study will look at fistula healing in people
      who take vedolizumab IV.

      The study is planned to enroll approximately 100 patients. Participants will be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Group 1: Vedolizumab IV 300 mg dose at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22, and a placebo infusion
           at Week 10 (dummy inactive infusion - this is a solution that looks like the study drug
           but has no active ingredient).

        -  Group 2: Vedolizumab IV 300 mg dose at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, 14 and 22.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study from screening to 18 weeks after the last dose is 44 weeks. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of
      study drug for a follow-up assessment.
