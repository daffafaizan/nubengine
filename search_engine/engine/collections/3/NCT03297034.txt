      children and adolescents now survive cancer. This means that the population of long-term
      childhood cancer survivors is growing. Since cancer and its treatments may later have adverse
      effects, it is important to track and improve survivor health and quality of life.
      Comprehensive data on the burden of late effects of childhood cancer or risk factors for late
      effects was not available, and so Switzerland set up the SCCSS to increase knowledge and
      improve the quality of care and follow-up.

      Objectives: The SCCSS investigates long-term outcomes of survivors of childhood and
      adolescent cancer, and the incidence and spectrum of various somatic and psychosocial
      outcomes including late mortality, second primary malignancies, somatic health and
      medication, mental health, educational achievements, health-related quality of life, and the
      association of these outcomes with risk factors like tumor, treatment modalities, and
      demographic characteristics. The SCCSS also investigates how health-care is provided, and how
      long-term childhood cancer survivors take care of their health.

      Methods: All Swiss residents who were diagnosed with cancer at age <21 years, have survived
      at least 5 years since cancer diagnosis, received a detailed questionnaire. The investigators
      added data from general practitioners and hospital records. To compare survivors with the
      general population, they also send the questionnaire to the siblings of childhood cancer
      survivors.

      Rationale and significance: The data collected by the SCCSS allows the investigators to study
      long-term outcomes of Swiss childhood cancer survivors. The SCCSS helps to learn more about
      the incidence of late effects and their risk factors. It also allows to summarize the current
      state of care in Switzerland. Since early diagnosis can prevent or mitigate many late
      effects, tracking them will help to improve the health of current and future childhood cancer
      survivors.

      Current status of the project: From 2008-2017, the investigators have contacted 4140
      childhood cancer survivors diagnosed between 1976-2010 and 1508 of their siblings. To date,
      2876 childhood cancer survivors and 868 siblings returned the questionnaire. The
      investigators contact new 5-year childhood cancer survivors at regular intervals, and
      continuously analyse and publish data and findings. In 2017 the investigators have contacted
      1579 childhood cancer survivors for a follow-up questionnaire and will continue with this at
      regular intervals.
