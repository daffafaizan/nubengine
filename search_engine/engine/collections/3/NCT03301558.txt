      (3000mg/d) sodium bicarbonate (Nephrotrans®) substitution.

      The 0-hypothesis (H0) is that substitution of 3000 mg/d sodium bicarbonate (Nephrotrans®) has
      no effect on T50-values as compared to wash-out-phase.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive low-dose (1500 mg/d) sodium
      bicarbonate followed by high-dose (3000mg/d) sodium bicarbonate (sequence A-B) or to receive
      high-dose sodium bicarbonate followed by low-dose sodium bicarbonate (sequence B-A) with
      washout-phases in between.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive low-dose (1500 mg/d) sodium
      bicarbonate followed by high-dose (3000mg/d) sodium bicarbonate (sequence A-B) or to receive
      high-dose sodium bicarbonate followed by low-dose sodium bicarbonate (sequence B-A) with
      washout-phases in between. The study will start with an initial run-in wash-out phase, where
      all sodium bicarbonate or other alkalizing treatment taken by the patient as standard of care
      will be discontinued. Consequently, there will be a sodium bicarbonate treatment (high
      dose/low dose) phase, followed by a wash-out phase, followed by another sodium bicarbonate
      treatment (high dose/low dose) phase, followed by a final wash-out phase. Each study phase,
      including wash-out phases as well as low-dose and high-dose treatment phases will be 14 ±3
      days of duration. Patients will be followed up to 12weeks after randomization until the last
      study visit of the final wash-out phase.
