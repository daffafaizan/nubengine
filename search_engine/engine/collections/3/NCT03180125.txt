      hydro-dissection using 1% lidocain followed by group I injection of Sodium hyaluronate and
      group II injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, under ultrasound guidance. Baseline
      VAS pain and nerve conduction study, patient satisfaction, and therapeutic duration, will be
      determined in 2nd week, 3rd and 6th month after the procedure. US measurements of the median
      nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) in the CT inlet will be compared pre and post procedure in
      6th month and use NCS results as the gold standard diagnostic test.
