      Primary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival rate of older patients with stage IIIB or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride vs erlotinib
           hydrochloride vs gemcitabine hydrochloride and erlotinib hydrochloride as first-line
           therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients receiving these regimens.

        -  Determine the overall survival rate in patients receiving these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients receiving these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel group, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified by gender, smoking status (never or light vs current or former), and
      ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8. Patients with
           progressive disease may cross over to arm II.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in arm I and erlotinib
           hydrochloride as in arm II.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for 3 years.
