      Tumour hypoxia may impact the ability to control NSCLC. Using 18F-FAZA PET, this study will
      assess patients for hypoxic treatment. With this information, we can start individualizing
      patient treatment to target hypoxia. The relationship between areas of hypoxia (18F-FAZA) and
      high glucose utilization (18F-FDG) will also be assessed.
