    
      In this 24-month pilot study, we will conduct the preparation phase of a multiphase
      optimization strategy (MOST) to develop a culturally appropriate (for Deep South contexts, to
      be adolescent friendly, and to be acceptable to parents or guardians) modular HIV prevention
      mHealth intervention, targeting behavior change related to HIV testing, HIV prevention
      knowledge, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake for sexual and gender minority (SGM)
      adolescents, that can be seamlessly integrated into the existing school and community
      environments across the Deep South. To do so, in Aim 1, we will assess stakeholders'
      knowledge, sentiments, and beliefs related to HIV risk, HIV stigma, and HIV prevention
      including preferences related to modality of PrEP and PrEP acceptability. Then, in Aim 2, we
      will use Aim 1 data, applying the 4-step intervention mapping framework, to inform the
      development of intervention modules targeting 14-18 year old SGM adolescents (rationale for
      this age range presented later in this proposal). We will also, develop corollary modules for
      parents or guardians. After intervention modules have been finalized, in Aim 3, we will
      conduct a 4-arm randomization to assess each module's acceptability, feasibility, and
      clinical signal of effectiveness as compared to a time-attention control.
