    
      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded study. Volunteers who are scheduled for
      laser treatment of Port Wine Stains will be screened and eligible subjects will be asked to
      participate. The patients will be randomized and placed in the experimental or the control
      group. They will be given unlabeled sachets and instructed to apply the product each night to
      the right half of their treated lesion beginning the night after surgery for 4 weeks. Digital
      photographs of the Port Wine Stain will be taken prior to surgery and repeated at follow up
      appointments at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after surgery. The photographs will
      be analyzed by blinded board certified plastic surgeons as well as a computer program.
