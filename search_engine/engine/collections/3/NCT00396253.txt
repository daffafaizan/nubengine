      patient, as well as one follow-up visit. Patients could receive up to three treatments with
      open-label tenecteplase during the study: one or two treatments during an initial treatment
      course, and eligible patients whose catheter became dysfunctional again within 21 days of the
      first visit received an additional treatment as part of a retreatment (RT) course.

      At Visit 1, patients eligible at the beginning of HD had 2 mL (2 mg) of tenecteplase
      instilled into each of the two lumens of the HD catheter. After a dwell time of 1 hour, study
      drug was withdrawn and all subjects underwent HD. The duration of the HD session was not
      fixed by the study protocol, but rather by the site's HD practice, physician orders, and
      individual patient response during the session. Patients who did not experience treatment
      success at the end of Visit 1 had 2 mL (2 mg) of tenecteplase instilled into each lumen of
      their catheter as part of the initial treatment course. The treatment was left to dwell for
      an extended time, until the second HD session at Visit 2 (up to 72 hours later). Patients who
      received extended-dwell tenecteplase had the treatment withdrawn from their catheter at the
      beginning of Visit 2. Patients underwent HD as prescribed or to the extent possible.

      Patients who had treatment success at Visit 1 or Visit 2 and had a recurrence of catheter
      dysfunction within 21 days of Visit 1 and met the re-treatment eligibility criteria had 2 mL
      (2 mg) of tenecteplase instilled into each lumen, followed by a 1-hour dwell time at
      re-treatment Visit 1.
