      worsening throughout most of the world. HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan
      Africa and the leading infectious cause of death in the world. An effective and inexpensive
      vaccine to prevent HIV disease remains as the best option to try to deal with this expanding
      epidemic. A number of vaccine products have been tested; however, only 2 have progressed to a
      Phase III trial, underscoring the need for new vaccine strategies.

      Prior to study entry, participants have their risk status for HIV infection determined by a
      series of questions. Further eligibility is determined by results of physical exam,
      laboratory tests, and further questions. Blood is drawn on each study visit. Participants are
      assigned randomly to 1 of 4 study groups:

      Group I: NefTat or placebo. Groups II, III, and IV: NefTat and gp120 or placebo. Each group
      receives a different concentration of gp120.

      All immunizations are admixed with AS02A adjuvant. Vaccinations are administered
      intramuscularly at 3 time points (entry, 1 month, and 3 months). Product safety and
      immunogenicity are performed at designated time points; participants have about 11 clinic
      visits.
