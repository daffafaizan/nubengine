      technic is the endovaginal ultrasound. This is a technic with good reproducibility and good
      precision. Some authors have found the transperineal technic to present the same
      characteristics, without being as invasive. The aim of the study was to compare the results
      of the less invasive technic to the current invasive gold standard in pregnant women who
      consult for contraction, or for whom cervical modification is suspected in order to determine
      whether the former could replace the latter.
