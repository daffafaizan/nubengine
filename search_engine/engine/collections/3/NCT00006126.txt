      transplantation in patients with metastatic or unresectable small cell lung cancer, breast
      cancer, testicular germ cell cancer, melanoma, or renal cell cancer. II. Determine the
      efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Donors receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously for 4 or 5 days prior to peripheral
      blood stem cell harvest. Patients are assigned to one of three conditioning regimens,
      depending on disease. Group A (small cell lung cancer): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV
      over 1-2 hours on days -7 and -6, etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -5, and total body
      irradiation twice daily on days -4 to -1. Group B (breast cancer and testicular germ cell
      cancer): Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 for a total of 14
      doses. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -3 and -2. Group C
      (renal cell cancer and melanoma): Patients receive fludarabine IV daily on days -8 to -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. All groups: Patients receive allogeneic peripheral
      blood stem cells IV over 10-20 minutes on day 0. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months,
      at 6 and 12 months, and then yearly for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
