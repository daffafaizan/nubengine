      pemetrexed, cisplatin and radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. We will perform the dose escalation of pemetrexed to determine if full dose
      (500mg/m2) of pemetrexed could be administrated concurrently with cisplatin and conventional
      dose radiotherapy (66Gy) firstly. Secondly, radiation dose will be escalated to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy when administered concurrently with full dose
      pemetrexed and cisplatin.
