      rehabilitation units make it difficult to assess muscle mass other than the availability of
      imaging techniques. Often it is impossible to assess muscle mass due to accessibility and
      cost of actual techniques. Deuterium labeled creatine (contained in capsules to be swallowed)
      is an easy procedure to assess muscle mass that could avoid the existing difficulties when
      using imaging techniques. Capsules containing the deuterium labeled creatine will be
      administered to participants who will autonomously take them. The subsequent assessment of
      urinary deuterium dilution will provide the estimate of skeletal muscle mass of the
      individual.

      Primary outcome: Assess muscle mass quantity in older adults using the method of deuterium
      labeled creatine versus the DXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) total lean mass
      assessment.
