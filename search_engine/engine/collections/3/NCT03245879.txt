      antibiotic stewardship strategies designed for small hospitals. Each hospital was randomized
      to one of three ASP interventions with increasing levels of intensity and intervention
      (Programs 1, 2, 3). The investigators felt that clinical equipoise about the effect of ASPs
      did not exist and randomizing to a no-intervention group was unacceptable. Antibiotic use was
      compared within each group before and after the intervention. In keeping with other
      real-world implementation studies, secondary analyses were planned to include an interrupted
      time series design to evaluate the impact of each strategy. Randomization of hospitals was
      stratified based on patient volume. Hospital administration and clinical leadership were not
      blinded to which ASP program they were randomly assigned to, but there were no public
      announcements. The intervention started March 2014 and ended June 2015.
