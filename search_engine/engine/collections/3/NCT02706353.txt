      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 4 groups of 3 participants will be enrolled in
      Part 1, and up to 20 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of APX005M you receive will depend on when you join
      this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of APX005M.
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of APX005M than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of
      APX005M is found.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive APX005M at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in Phase 1

      All participants will receive the same dose level of pembrolizumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      APX005M will be injected directly into 1 tumor every 3 weeks (Weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9) for up to
      4 doses.

      The injections may be done with or without the help of a ultrasound, CT, and MRI.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight or be
      monitored by a caregiver for 24 hours after you receive APX005M.

      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein 1 time every 3 weeks (Weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12). The
      first dose of pembrolizumab will be given 1-2 days before or after your first dose of
      APX005M.

      You will be given a diary to write down any injection site reactions you may have.

      Study Visits:

      Within 1 week before your first APX005M injection:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a punch biopsy or image-guided biopsy of a tumor to check the status of
           the disease. To collect a biopsy, the area of skin is numbed with anesthetic and a small
           cut is made to remove all or part of the affected tissue. To collect a punch biopsy, the
           area of skin is numbed with anesthetic and a small cut is made to remove all or part of
           the affected tissue. To perform an image-guided biopsy, a needle is inserted into the
           affected area using imaging such as CT or ultrasound to collect cells or tissue from an
           organ, lymph node, or suspected tumor mass. The doctor will use the imaging to guide the
           needle into the area.
