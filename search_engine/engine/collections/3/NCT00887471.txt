    
      Objectives: To demonstrate similar improvement in sleep-disordered breathing as determined by
      polysomnography (PSG) with microdebrider-assisted partial intracapsular tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy (PITA) versus Bovie electrocautery complete tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy
      (T&A).

      Methods: In a retrospective cohort study children found to have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
      by PSG who have undergone either PITA or T&A as treatment will be evaluated with repeat PSG.
      The groups will be matched by age, sex, and severity of pre-operative Apnea-Hypopnea Indices
      (AHI). The investigators performing and evaluating the PSG will be blinded to type of
      procedure and preoperative AHI. Change scores will be computed for each participant and the
      change scores of the groups compared.
