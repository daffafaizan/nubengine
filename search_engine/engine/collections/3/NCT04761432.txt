      that is vastly underutilized in the intensive care units of most low-and-middle income
      countries. Despite the positive outcomes associated with vital signs monitoring (i.e.
      increased survival-to-discharge, lower complication rates and shorter length of
      hospitalization), the prohibitive costs of conventional patient monitors and the difficulty
      in maintaining complex medical equipment limit its accessibility in the developing world.

      This feasibility study will demonstrate the safety and accuracy of the Neopenda's wireless
      vital signs monitor, neoGuard, on adult patients in a Ugandan clinical setting. The
      technology will be tested against a conventional patient monitor. Root mean square deviation
      (RMSD) and Bland-Altman plots will be used to assess concordance between paired measurements
      from the two equipment collected over a 1-hour period for each patient.

      This technology innovation has large potential to impact health outcomes in low-resource
      settings, as it is a portable, reusable, long-lasting, cost-efficient monitoring tool
      designed for settings where patient loads are high and such solutions are direly needed.
