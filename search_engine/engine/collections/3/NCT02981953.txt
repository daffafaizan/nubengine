      treatment of secondary (functional) mitral regurgitation (FMR) (CE granted on September
      2015). The Cardioband is an annuloplasty band that is similar to a surgical annuloplasty,
      however deployed on the beating heart through a transvenous approach. The CE mark study with
      30 subjects has been completed and documented significant reduction of severity of MR and
      improvement in quality of life by Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ),
      Ney York Heart Association (NYHA) and 6- minute walk test (6MWT), in subjects with moderate
      to severe MR. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the Cardioband annuloplasty system
      for repair the Tricuspid Regurgitation.
