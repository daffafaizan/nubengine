      inhaled solution of sodium bicarbonate in an attempt to decrease the thickness and stickiness
      of the mucus in the lungs of a person with cystic fibrosis. Also, this study is also looking
      at whether or not it is possible to decrease the acidity of the airways by inhaling sodium
      bicarbonate through nebulizer treatments.
