      thorough history was taken from each patient and written informed consent was taken after
      explaining the procedure, risks and benefits. Mature maxillary first permanent molar with
      diagnosis of periapical periodontitis (as confirmed clinically & by periapical radiograph)
      was chosen for the study. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to either the dental
      operating microscope group or to control group (without using dental operating microscope)
      for the treatment.

      After administration of local anesthesia and rubber dam isolation of the involved tooth ;
      access cavity was prepared using carbide bur and refined using ultrasonic tip in both groups.
      In both the groups similar protocol for irrigation, obturation and post operative
      restorations was followed. Immediate post-operative radiograph was taken using preset
      exposure parameters and follow up clinical and radiographic examination was carried at 12th
      month.
