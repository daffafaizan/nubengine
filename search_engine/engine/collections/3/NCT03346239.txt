      maintenance of anxiety disorders. The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving
      gaze-contingent feedback is an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, compared to
      treatment with SSRI (Escitelopram) and a waitlist control. A secondary purpose is to explore
      the unique neuro-cognitive mechanisms of this treatment, using eye-tracking, MRI and fMRI
      measurements. Participants will be assessed using clinical interviews and self-rated
      questionnaires before, during and after 12 weeks of treatment or wait. Outcome measures will
      be social anxiety symptoms, as well as dwell time on threat in eye-tracking paradigms tested
      in previous studies, and BOLD signals in MRI measurements. Neuro-cognitive mechanisms will be
      explored as potential mediators of clinical efficacy.
