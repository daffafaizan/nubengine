      SARS-CoV-2 may impact on cardiovascular system through a direct myocardial infection or a
      secondary cardiac involvement due to hypoxia or metabolic supply-demand imbalance or
      prothrombotic inflammatory state. As a consequence of and besides acute myocardial damages,
      COVID-19 could also determine chronic cardiovascular consequences, with a significant impact
      on long-term prognosis, quality of life and functional capacity of COVID-19 survivors.

      On this basis, we aim to define the clinical and prognostic effects of myocardial involvement
      in COVID-19 patients, with a 1-month and 6-month follow-up composed of clinical evaluation,
      electrocardiogram, trans-thoracic echocardiogram, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, chest
      computerized tomography scan and cardiopulmonary exercise test.
