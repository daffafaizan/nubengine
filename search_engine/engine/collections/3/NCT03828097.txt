      psychological and physiological measures in pre-menopausal women (21-40 years old) over a
      12-week period.

      This study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention. Briefly, subjects will
      be screened for inclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will then undergo a pre-testing battery
      (i.e., T1) and will then be randomly assigned to one of two groups including:

        1. Experimental group (anticipated n=50)

        2. Control group (anticipated n=50) Subjects will then consume 2 capsules per day for 12
           weeks and perform a post-testing battery (i.e., T2) that includes tests performed during
           the pre-testing battery.

      Main outcome (dependent) variables between treatments will include:

        1. blood levels of various micronutrients (assessed from blood draws using mass
           spectrometry-based assays)

        2. blood cell gene expression patterns (assessed from blood draws and real-time PCR assays)

        3. mood (assessed via questionnaires) Blood and questionnaires will be collected prior to
           supplementation, and 12 weeks into supplementation.

      Statistics used to assess differences between conditions over time will include two-way
      repeated measures ANOVAs. When significant group*time interactions are observed, the
      statistical model will be decomposed using LSD post hoc tests.
