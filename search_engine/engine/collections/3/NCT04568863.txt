      disfunction. Prevention of these critical conditions is mandatory to reduce mortality and to
      improve patient's outcome.

      Melatonin is an endogenous hormone involved not only in circadian rhythm control, but also in
      the cell protection due to its outstanding anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. High
      doses of melatonin have shown high efficacy against bacterial (sepsis) and viral infections.
      Melatonin is a safe product that consistently has shown lack of side-effects when it is
      administered to humans.

      SARS-CoV 2 infection may yield severe forms of the disease that require the patients
      admission to the ICU. These patients may develop an excessive inflammatory response and a
      burst of free radicals, constituting the major cause of death in these subjects.

      Our hypothesis is that high doses of melatonin intravenously administered to COVID-19 ICU
      patients might reach enough blood levels able to prevent/counteract the developing of sepsis
      and the production of free radicals, reducing mortality and hospital stay.
