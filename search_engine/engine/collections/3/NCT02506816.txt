      PARP inhibition in type I primary EC, in patients who receive therapy with AZD2281 during the
      period of time between diagnosis and surgery.

      This is a phase 0 trial or "Exploratory Investigational New Drug" study, a type of trial that
      involves limited number of patient under drug therapy and has no therapeutic or diagnostic
      intent because the drug exposure has a limited duration and the dosage is lower than 100% of
      the dose required to yield a pharmacologic effect.

      The purpose of the phase 0 studies is to assist in the go versus no-go decision-making
      process of a drug's fate earlier in the development process, using relevant human models
      instead of relying on sometimes inconsistent animal data, thus helping to confirm endpoints
      such as mechanism of action, pharmacology, bioavailability and pharmacodynamics.
