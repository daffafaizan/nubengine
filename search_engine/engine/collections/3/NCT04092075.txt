      Silk'n toothbrush in reduction of gingivitis, dental plaque and calculus.

      The study includes a total of 168 treatment sessions, twice a day, and 5 clinic visits over a
      period of 12 weeks.

      One treatment group (Silk'n toothbrush - ToothWave) and 1 control group (an ADA approved
      power toothbrush (PTB)) will participate in the study.

      For each patient, assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 6 weeks.
      Calculus condition will be measured after 12 weeks in addition to the other timepoints. The
      average data sets will be calculated for each group.

      (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken using the Silk'n toothbrush and standard
      fluoride toothpaste. The control group will use a regular PTB and standard fluoride
      toothpaste.
