    
      This study utilizes on open phase of 4-sessions of cognitive-behavior therapy for smoking
      cessation that is combined with open pharmacotherapy (selected by participants in
      collaboration with the study medical team: nicotine patch, varenicline, or bupropion).
      Session topics include educational (e.g., health risks of smoking, effectiveness of different
      treatment approaches), motivational enhancement (e.g., identifying personally relevant
      benefits of quitting, and costs of continuing to smoke), and cognitive-behavioral elements
      (e.g., identifying smoking triggers, developing coping strategies for these triggers,
      planning for high risk situations, relapse prevention). The study therapists will also make a
      supportive phone call on the day of the quit attempt, with repeated check-in calls over the
      quit window (i.e., weeks 4-6) as needed for individuals having difficulties reaching
      abstinence. Participants who fail to achieve smoking cessation during the quit period window
      will be referred for clinical treatment as desired in the center the study is conducted in or
      an alternative site.

      Following successful smoking abstinence at Week 0 (Week 0 is defined by 24 hr abstinence
      within a two-week grace period of the target date), participants will be randomized to the
      study drug condition (50 mg DCS or matching placebo) combined with cue-exposure therapy
      (CET). CET is manualized and will have four modalities: (1) exposure to slides of smoking
      (pictorial), (2) exposure to emotions and imagined situations that most reliably trigger an
      urge to smoke (emotional/imaginal), (3) exposure to a participant's own cigarettes and pack
      (in vivo),70 and (4) personalized and immersive 360Â° VR exposure (participants select the VR
      scene-e.g., break time outside work, evening party, car ride that best corresponds to their
      highest craving situation). CET sessions are scheduled for the quit week, one week later, and
      again 8 weeks later. Smoking cessation assessments continue across 24 weeks of follow-up.
