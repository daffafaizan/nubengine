      patients for cardiac output measurement. However, using pulmonary artery catheter remains a
      major clinical problem in children due to technical and size constraints.

      COstatus measures changes in blood ultrasound velocity in an extracorporeal AV loop caused by
      body-temperature isotonic saline injected into the central vein and calculates cardiac output
      derived from a dilution curve.
