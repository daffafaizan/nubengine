    
      This is a Phase IV, prospective, open-label, multi-center, observational study to assess the
      effectiveness of the Athena PMT to relieve or eliminate the symptoms of female urinary
      incontinence.

      The study will enlist approximately 100 or more Nurse-Practitioners in Women's Health as the
      principle investigators from community-based primary care centers (OB-GYN, Internal Medicine,
      Family Practices or Women's Health Centers) who will enroll approximately 500 or more
      subjects who suffer from urge and/or stress urinary incontinence and who may benefit from
      strengthening of Kegel muscles of the pelvic floor.
