      and/or progression-free survival at 6 months, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme. II. Determine the duration of objective response in patients treated with this
      regimen. III. Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive glufosfamide IV over 60 minutes on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable disease receive treatment for a minimum of 6 months or until
      progression. Patients with an objective complete response receive a maximum of 2 additional
      courses of treatment after confirmation of response. Patients are followed every 6 weeks
      until progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
