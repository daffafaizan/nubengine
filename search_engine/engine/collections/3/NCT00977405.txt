      -gentamicin implant (CollatampG) for patients who undergo major abdominal surgery with
      contaminated surgical wounds.

      Hypotheses: Patients undergoing abdominal surgery with wounds classified as contaminated or
      dirty are at a high risk of SSI. Wounds are classified as contaminated when an operation is
      performed through an infected area (e.g abscess, perforated viscus or traumatic wound) that
      has been exposed for over 4 hours. Risk of infection in these wounds has been shown to be as
      high as 45 %.

      Our hypothesis is that placement of CollatampG in the subcutaneous layer of contaminated
      abdominal wounds is effective prophylaxis for superficial SSI. CollatampG is composed of
      highly purified type 1 collagen obtained from bovine tendon, which acts as a vehicle for the
      aminoglycoside antibiotic, gentamicin. This implant provides a high concentration of local
      gentamicin at the surgical wound to decrease the local microorganism load. It has been shown
      that if a surgical site is contaminated with >10 to the power of 5 microorganisms per gram of
      tissue, the risk of infection is markedly increased. When a gastrointestinal organ is the
      source of pathogens, gram-negative bacilli (e.g., E. coli) are typical isolates, which are
      susceptible to gentamicin. Therefore, a high local concentration of gentamicin at the
      contaminated surgical wound provided by the CollatampG implant may prevent the local
      bacterial load from reaching levels high enough to cause a clinical infection.
