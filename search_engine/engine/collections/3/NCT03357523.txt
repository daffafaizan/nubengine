      be monitored in response to a number of non-invasive interventions/device that are approved
      for clinical use and known to elicit microvascular responses. These interventions are applied
      consecutively, include breathing at different rates, low power visible light in the
      red-to-near-infrared range, increase in local temperature, and changes in the arm position.
