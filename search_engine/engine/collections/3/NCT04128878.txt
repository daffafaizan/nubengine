      based on strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. Goal population includes adult patients with a
      diagnosis of paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation seen in the electrophysiology
      clinic and admitted to the UPMC Presbyterian electrophysiology service for initiation of
      anti-arrhythmic medications.

      The primary goal of the study will be to evaluate the degree of endothelial function recovery
      seen after initiating anti-arrhythmic medical therapy. We will assess genetic markers,
      arterial stiffness and vasodilation in response to acetylcholine iontophoresis, nitroprusside
      iontophoresis, local thermal hyperemia and reactive hyperemia. Laser speckle contrast imaging
      will be employed to evaluate the microvasculature. SphygmoCor (arterial tonometry) will be
      used to assess macrovasculature. Testing will be performed at baseline prior to the 1st dose
      of anti- arrhythmic therapy and repeated again 1-3 months later at outpatient follow-up
      visit. Additionally, follow-up phone calls or office visits will take place at 6 and 12
      months after the initial data collection visit to document recurrence rate of atrial
      fibrillation.
