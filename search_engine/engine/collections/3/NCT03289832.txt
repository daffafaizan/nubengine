      systems which The investigators hypothesize will also include the skin, based on animal
      studies and preliminary evidence in human volunteers. Since The investigators have only
      previously evaluated the ability of topical sulforaphane application to protect skin from
      UV-induced erythema, the next logical step is to evaluate the ability of oral delivery to
      affect the skin of healthy human volunteers. Curcumin is also a potent anti-inflammatory that
      acts upon different biochemical pathways from SF, and it is an antioxidant. It was discovered
      over a century ago, it has been the subject of well over a hundred clinical studies, and it
      has been an ingredient in common foods eaten by millions of people, for centuries. Before and
      after consumption of each of these common food ingredients, The investigators will: (a)
      measure the Phase 2 cytoprotective response in human skin, (b) determine whether it leads to
      reduced UV-induced erythema (reduced inflammation), (c) evaluate changes in age-related
      markers such as dermal elasticity, keratin and collagen levels, (d) measure advanced
      glycation end-products (AGEs) in the serum, as biomarkers of systemic (including the skin)
      reduction in AGE levels, and (e) measure the levels of these biomarkers in skin punch
      biopsies. The investigators will also evaluate the effects of combined oral SF and curcumin.
      The investigators anticipate that there may be a true synergistic response between SF and
      curcumin, and the experiments designed herein are designed to show that synergy, if it
      exists.
