    
      This is a Monocentric, Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Comparative, Phase IV Study, to
      compare the effects of Vildagliptin and Gliclazide MR on Markers of Bone Remodeling, Bone
      Mineral Density and Glycemic Variability in Postmenopausal Women with Type 2 Diabetes.

      Target population of clinical trial subjects A total of 38 women with documented Type 2
      Diabetes and menopause will be enrolled. To be as close to a real life scenario as possible,
      clinical trial subjects which are treated with glucose-lowering medication (except incretin
      or sulfonylurea based therapies) and treatment-naive subjects will be included.

      Investigational Product, posology and method of administration The active treatment will
      include a 50 mg dose of vildagliptin OD twice a day.

      Comparator, posology and method of administration As comparator, gliclazide MR will be
      administered at a dose of 60 to 120 mg OD once a day.

      Treatment duration The study will have an expected total duration of 18 months, 12 months of
      active treatment.
