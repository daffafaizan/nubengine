      adults over age 60 with obesity to determine the efficacy of a novel sitting-reduction
      intervention and its impact on cardiometabolic risk markers. Participants will be randomized
      to a 6-month sitting reduction intervention (termed I-STAND) or healthy-living attention
      control (Stage 1). All participants will be mailed a scale and a blood pressure monitor (to
      keep) which will be used during the phone-based measurement visits at Baseline, 3, 6 and 12
      months. All participants will have phone-based Coaching sessions.

      After 6 months, I-STAND participants will be re-randomized to receive either booster sessions
      or no further intervention (Stage 2). Attention control participants will receive no further
      intervention. All participants will be followed for 12 months total with phone-based
      assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary outcomes are reduction in sitting time
      at 6 months, objectively measured using the activPAL device, and blood pressure. The design
      will answer novel questions about the impact of sitting reduction on cardiometabolic risk
      markers as well as maintenance of sitting reduction.
