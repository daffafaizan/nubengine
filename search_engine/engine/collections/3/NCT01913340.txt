        1. The feasibility of recruiting, enrolling and following 50 patients with moderate to
           severe HIE at 5 sites, while meeting specified recruitment and follow-up target goals.

        2. The safety of high-dose Epo therapy in neonates with HIE with respect to systemic organ
           function and general growth parameters.

        3. The value of brain MRI/MRS performed at 4-7 days of age as a biomarker of motor function
           at 12 months of age.
