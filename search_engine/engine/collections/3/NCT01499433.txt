      (COPD) as an important risk factor of invasive pulmoanry aspergillosis (IPA). However,
      clinical data on the morbidity and mortality of IPA underlying COPD as well as the efficacy
      and safety of antifungal treatment in such subset of patient population is very limited. In
      clinical pratice, capofungin is often used as primary antifungal therapy for IPA, especially
      in patients with impaired renal function. Based on this data, the investigators propose to
      study the efficacy and safety of three-week antifungal therapy with caspofungin in
      hospitalized patients with proven or probable IPA underlying COPD.
