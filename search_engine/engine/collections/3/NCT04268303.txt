      120µg BXCL501, or placebo. Male and female adults with acute agitation associated with
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder will be enrolled.
      Eligible subjects may be identified in outpatient clinics, mental health, psychiatric or
      medical emergency services including medical/psychiatric observation units, or as newly
      admitted to a hospital setting for acute agitation or already in hospital for chronic
      underlying conditions. Subjects will be domiciled in a clinical research setting or
      hospitalized to remain under medical supervision while undergoing screening procedures to
      assess eligibility. Efficacy and safety assessments will be conducted periodically before and
      after dosing.
