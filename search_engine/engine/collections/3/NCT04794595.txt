      the damage of inflammatory factors to organs; at the same time, it can also promote the
      body's immune response, significantly improve immune dysfunction, and restore the body's
      immune balance. However, the timing of early application of CBP in childhood sepsis is still
      unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the treatment and prognosis of this
      technology in the early treatment of sepsis.
