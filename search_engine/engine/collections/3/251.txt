drugs and neonatal jaundice .this paper is not intended as an exhaustive review of bilirubinmetabolism nor of the many factors which may result in exaggeratedphysiologic jaundice.. for such a review the interested reader isreferred to the excellent articles by zuelzer and brown . brief mentionhas been made of the mechanism by which certain drugs may contribute tothe development of hyperbilirubinemia . a few drugs, the water-solublevitamin k derivatives, sulfasoxazole (gantrisin), the salicylates, andnovobiocin have been unequivocally shown to affect adversely the newborninfant's ability to handle bilirubin . in time other compounds willdefinitely be incriminated .it is important to remember that the administration of a drug to amother just prior to delivery may result in appreciable concentrationsof the compound in the infant's serum, and that drugs administered tothe nursing mother may be excreted in breast milk and thereby absorbedby the infant . careful consideration of the drugs given not only to thenewborn but also to the mother is therefore essential if we are to avoidwhat may be termed iatrogenic hyperbilirubinemia .
