      anesthesia protocol to maintain the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) during surgeries done in the
      Beach Chair Position (BCP). Investigators hypothesized that, if the MAP was maintained, Near
      Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring would not change intra-operative anesthesia
      management and would not affect the post-operative cognitive outcomes of participants
      undergoing surgery in the beach chair position. Investigators secondarily wanted to document
      the actual incidence of cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) recorded by NIRS occurring in
      participants placed in the BCP if the MAP was strictly maintained.
