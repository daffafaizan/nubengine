      99mTc-ABH2 SPECT/CT in the detection of HER2-positive breast cancer, and to compare its
      diagnostic value with routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) pathological staining. HER2 imaging,
      specifically to HER2 receptor expressed on malignant breast cancer cell surface, might help
      for targeted therapy with monoclonal antibody such as trastuzumab in breast cancer, and may
      improve the treatment strategy of breast cancer. The investigator will determine the use of
      99mTc-ABH2 SPECT/CT in stratifying breast cancer.
