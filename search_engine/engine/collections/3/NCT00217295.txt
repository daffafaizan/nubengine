      will be blindly assigned to either a group who receive Topamax or a placebo control. Repeated
      neurological and clinical examinations are performed with laboratory tests to determine any
      possible adverse drug effects. The scaled neurologic examinations (EDSS and MSFC) and brain
      MRI's are done at regular intervals to evaluate possible treatment effects.
