    
      Patients will be randomized into 1 of 2 groups: those who received 1 drop of 5%
      povidone-iodine instilled directly over the sliding noose at surgery completion (group 1) and
      those who did not receive povidone-iodine at the end of the surgery (group 2).

      Institutional standard surgical preparation will be performed in all patients with 5%
      povidone-iodine solution on the periocular skin and eyelid margins, followed by instillation
      of 1 drop of 5% povidone-iodine into the conjunctival cul-de-sac.

      All operations will be performed using a sliding noose technique with a polyglactin 6-0
      suture (Vicryl, Ethicon Inc). If a patient undergoes surgery on more than 1 muscle in the
      same eye, a 1-cm section of suture proximal to the knot will be collected from the
      nonadjustable suture as a control. The control suture will be placed in a tube with 2 mL of
      trypticase soy broth and agitated for 1 minute. At the end of surgery, patients in group 1
      will receive a drop of povidone-iodine. A strip of neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and
      dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment will be then applied into the lower conjunctival fornix to
      patients in both groups.
