      of the posterior urethral valves and to compare with the results of vesicoamniotic shunting.

      Outcomes: Accuracy of the prenatal cystoscopic diagnosis of posterior urethral valves,
      neonatal and infant survival (6 and 12 months), as well as normal renal function during the
      same ages.

      Study design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: Pregnant women whose fetuses have
      isolated and severe lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) with (oligohydramnios and severe
      hydronephrosis) will be invited to participate in the present study. Patients will be
      randomized into the fetal cystoscopic group (CYSTO) vs vesico-amniotic shunting (VAS). The
      investigators intend to enroll 30 patients in each group (a total of 60). All patients will
      be followed by fetal ultrasound each 15 days. Besides, these infants will be followed up to
      one year of age. Maternal and obstetrical complications are going to be evaluated as well as
      neonatal and infant survival and the renal function.
