      cancer. Over 70% of breast cancer expressed androgen receptor. And in some estrogen receptor
      positive breast cancer cells which are resistant to Aromatase inhibitors can change androgen
      receptor dependent. So AR may be a new target in the treatment of breast cancer. Bicalutamide
      is a selective androgen receptor inhibitor with a clinical benefit rate of 19% and median
      progression free survival of 12 weeks in the ER-/AR+ metastatic breast cancer. This study is
      aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bicalutamide and aromatase inhibitor in
      ER+/AR+/HER- metastatic breast cancer patients who have disease progression after treatment
      of an AI.
