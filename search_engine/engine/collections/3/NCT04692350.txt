      significantly from what is expected in the culture of the individual is invasive and rigid,
      appears in early adolescence or adulthood, is stable over time and is a source of distress or
      impaired functioning.

      Most of the tools for assessing high-risk personality disorders and traits have been
      developed in adults.Yet it is important to have effective tools to distinguish personality
      disorders from other mental disorders as early as possible. The identification of young
      people at high risk of personality disorders allows their rapid referral to appropriate
      psychotherapies.

      The AIDA and LoPF-Q, screening questionnaires, were recently developed to include an
      assessment of personality functioning in the process of diagnosing emotional and behavioral
      disorders in adolescence. They have been tested in several countries such as Germany, USA,
      Mexico, Croatiaâ€¦ The results of the studies show that AIDA and LoPF questionnaires are
      reliable and valid instruments for assessing normal and disturbed identity in adolescents and
      distinguishes well between patients with psychiatric illnesses and healthy controls.
