      considered the "signature injury" of the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom
      (OIF/OEF) campaigns. The chronic changes that often occur in the wake of TBI along with
      possible physical injuries may run a chronic, unremitting course, imposing great strain and
      distress upon family members who often assume a caregiver role with little preparation and no
      formal training for these wounded service members as they reintegrate back into civilian life
      post-deployment. Unfortunately, research has not adequately addressed the unique long-term
      needs of informal military caregivers of deployed service members with TBI (i.e., family
      members/close friends).
