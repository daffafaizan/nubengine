      operative assessment of tumor margins in partial mastectomy or mastectomy specimens. We are
      seeking to establish the accuracy of first and second-generation prototypes of technologies
      utilizing optical spectroscopy for intra operative margin assessment in partial mastectomy or
      mastectomy specimens. The aims associated with this research are as follows, (1) to evaluate
      the device-tissue interface on reduction mammoplasty specimens from a total of 20 patients,
      (2) to assess random and systematic errors of the new miniature system on mastectomy
      specimens from a total of 40 patients (3) to test the sensitivity, and specificity of the
      miniature spectral imaging system for margin assessment on excised partial mastectomy or
      mastectomy specimens from a total of 150 patients undergoing breast conserving surgery.

      Last patient's surgery took place in 2017 and recruitment remained open. Later the team
      encountered staffing issues; therefore the study status was updated to suspended. We recently
      made the decision to no longer attempt to enroll the remaining 2 subjects and focus on the
      data analysis only.
