      planus). VLS and LP are chronic skin diseases that usually affect the anogenital region. Both
      can cause vulvar itching, burning and pain and can lead to urinary and sexual dysfunction.
      Current treatment options are unsatisfactory. Vulvovaginal laser therapy might be an
      effective treatment option.

      Study aim: To study the effectiveness of non-ablative vulvovaginal laser therapy for women
      with lichenoid disorders.

      Design: Randomized double-blinded placebo- controlled clinical study

      Study Population: Women diagnosed with LD will be recruited from a specialized University
      outpatient clinic.

      Study groups: Participants will be randomized (1:1). Intervention group: Laser therapy (2
      treatments), plus ongoing therapy Control group: Sham laser therapy (2 treatments) plus
      ongoing therapy

      Sample size Total 40 patients Primary study outcome: Visual analogue scale (VAS) composite
      score in regard to LD Secondary study outcomes: quality of life (QoL) (Skindex
      questionnaire); Treatment discomfort/ pain (VAS); Patient treatment satisfaction
      (Questionnaire to ask for treatment satifsaction: ZUF-8); Subjective improvement (Patient
      global impression of improvement- PGI-I), clinical LS score, histological appearance
