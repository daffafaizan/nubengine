      our study. Patients will have a baseline clinical examination (Body weight, Body mass index,
      Waist circumference, Hirsutism score), hormonal profile (FSH, LH, fasting Insulin/glucose
      ratio, DHEAS, testosterone levels), metabolic profile (fasting and 2 hour post prandial
      plasma glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides level),
      ultrasound examination (ovarian volume and subcapsular follicle count, stromal echogenicity)
      and doppler blood flow study (ovarian stromal velocity, Pulsatility index, Resistivity index,
      Systolic/Diastolic ratio and stromal vascularization index).

      Patients will be then randomized using a computer generated randomization program into two
      groups according to BMI (<25 and >25). The randomization will be stratified in order to
      achieve a homogenous distribution of PCOS patients in both arms of the study with respect to
      age and body mass index. Each group will be further subdivided into three treatment arms. 1st
      treatment arm will receive OCP containing 35 microgram ethinyl estradiol and 2 mg cyproterone
      acetate cyclically (21 days regimen) daily; 2nd treatment arm will receive OCP containing 35
      microgram ethinyl estradiol and 2 mg cyproterone acetate cyclically (21 days regimen) while
      the 3rd treatment arm will receive OCP plus metformin 500 mg twice daily for a period of six
      months. Each patient will be asked to keep a diary of her menstrual periods over the study
      period. The patients will be followed up at 3 and 6 months of treatment to evaluate the
      changes in the above mentioned parameters. Analysis of the data will be done through
      descriptive and perceptive statistical methods by using Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences (SPSS) software.
