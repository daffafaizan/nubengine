      surgery. It is thought that with hyperoxemia, ischemia reperfusion damage increases,
      microcirculation is impaired and tissue oxygenation is impaired.Oxidative damage occurs in
      cases of increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant balance.It was aimed to
      investigate oxidative damage by recording modified albumin and thiol disulfide in blood
      simultaneously by recording arterial oxygen levels at determined times during cardiac
      surgery.
