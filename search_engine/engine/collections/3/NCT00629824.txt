    
      A prospective, hospital-based, case-control study enrolling 70 chronic hepatitis C patients
      who are 65 to 80 years of age and other sex- and HCV genotype-matched 140 chronic hepatitis C
      patients who are 50 to 64 years of age will be conducted for comparison. The 210 patients
      chronic hepatitis C patients will receive pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin
      combination therapy. Genotype 1 infected patients will received 48 weeks of treatment and
      genotype non-1 patients will received 24 weeks of treatment. Another 40 HCV-1 infected
      patients who are 65-80 years of age and have a rapid virological response ( defined as
      seronegative of HCV RNA at week 4 of treatment) will receive 24 weeks of treatment and are
      enrolled for comparison since Jan 2008. The primary outcome measurement is sustained
      virological response and safety.
