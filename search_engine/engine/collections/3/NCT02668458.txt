      endotracheal intubation.

      Randomized study, inclusion in two groups: NIV or HFNC.

      Experimental group:

      NHFC group, preoxygenation by NHFC: oxygen flow rate of 60 L / min and 100% FiO2.

      Control group:

      NIV group, preoxygenation by NIV: pressure support set for an exhaled tidal volume of 6-8 ml
      / kg of ideal body weight, PEEP of 5 cm H2O and FiO2 at 100%.

      Duration of participation of each patient: 28 days
