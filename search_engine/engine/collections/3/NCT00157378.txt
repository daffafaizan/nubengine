      respond to lower dosages of neuroleptics, the study aims to reach neuroleptic response under
      the lowest possible dosage of the study medication (haloperidol or risperidone). Therefore
      the initial dosage of the study medication is 2 mg/d. Depending on the patients'
      symptomatology, the daily dosage of the study medication can be increased by 2 mg in weekly
      intervals up to a maximum dosage of 8 mg/d. Patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia
      (F20, according to ICD-10-criteria) are consecutively enrolled in the study. The patients are
      assessed at weekly intervals during the acute inpatient treatment phase of 8 weeks. Apart
      from the weekly psychopathological characterisation additionally neuropsychobiological data
      are assessed at the time of admission and at the end of the study. Major questions of the
      study are, whether patients, who have been treated with risperidone compared with those, who
      have been treated with haloperidol show a better treatment outcome regarding negative
      symptoms and exhibit fewer extra-pyramidal motor side effects. Furthermore it is
      hypothesised, that the treatment with Risperidone has better effects on cognitive
      disorders/dysfunctions and depressive symptoms and that the patients, who receive Risperidone
      are more compliant and have a higher quality of life.
