      only 15-30% of those older Americans who could benefit, actually seek HAs out and use them.
      HA adoption rates are even lower for people with lower income and for racial and ethnic
      minorities. Although the answer to why so few older adults seek or use amplification is
      multidimensional, one common thread is that many people believe that HAs fitted using the
      audiologist-based model cost too much. Therefore, it is not surprising that there has been
      increased advocacy for a variety of over-the-counter (OTC) service-delivery models, which
      have increasingly been identified as important options for managing mild-to-moderate
      age-related hearing loss.

      Is the amplification intervention delivered using the OTC model an appropriate solution for
      age-related hearing loss? Although there is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of OTC
      HAs, all previous studies measured short-term outcomes (e.g., 6 weeks). It is unknown what
      the long-term outcomes of OTC HAs would look like. The purpose of this project is to examine
      the longitudinal changes in OTC HA outcomes over 3 months. Older adults with age-related
      hearing loss will be recruited. Pre-configured hearing aids (that simulate OTC hearing aids)
      will be provided to subjects. Subjects will take the full initiative and responsibility for
      learning and using hearing aids. HA outcomes will be measured at 6-week and 12-week post
      intervention.
