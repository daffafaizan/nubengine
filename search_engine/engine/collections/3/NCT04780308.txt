      for Gartland Type 3 (SCHF). The patients divided into five groups according to the top in
      configurations (crossed 1 lateral 1 medial, crossed 2 lateral 1 medial, crossed 1 lateral 2
      medial, 2 lateral divergent, and 3 lateral divergent). The average age at the time of injury
      was 7.34 (between 2 and 14 years). Bauman angle (BA), Humerocapital angle (HCA), Anterior
      humeral line (AHL), flexion range, extension range, and Carrying angle (CA) were compared at
      preoperative, postoperative 1st-day, postoperative last control, and non-operated side. The
