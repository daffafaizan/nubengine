    
      The present study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, randomized, open label,
      controlled, 2-arm parallel group, superiority trial.

      Participating centres are selected based on previous experience with the use of the EVADO
      system.

      Patients elected to open heart surgery for a variety of cardiac conditions related to
      coronary, valvular or aortic disease or their combination in the participating centers will
      be screened.

      This study as secondary aim wants to confirm the results of earlier investigation by a
      multicentre trial conducted on a larger population of patients undergoing a wide spectrum of
      open heart cardiac operations and either assess a number of cost-efficacy-efficiency
      indicators.
