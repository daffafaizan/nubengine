      group, aimed to perform a more complete analysis of the current situation regarding
      performing minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer. Significant limitations were found
      in the analyzed studies, including:

        -  Small samples of patients, mostly low-quality comparative studies

        -  Selection bias in the comparison groups (e.g. stage, extent of lymphadenectomy)

        -  Absence of subgroup analysis in significant research fields

        -  Lack of information on the surgical techniques adopted

      A large prospective multicenter registry could thus be the optimal way to clarify the role of
      minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer and permit the evaluation of its short and
      long-term effects. A working basis for analyzing outcomes of interest and obtaining
      directions for guidelines and future study developments can also be created. The following
      would be the main advantages of a large prospective multicenter registry:

        -  Achieving a large sample of patients

        -  Collecting multiple variables, allowing for the making of a comprehensive statistical
           report

        -  Standardizing the methodology to be adopted, thus increasing accuracy

        -  Bringing together the experiences of both East and West to discover shared points A
           prospective registry can become a powerful tool that can guide research in this field to
           new developments and pave the way for other investigational opportunities.
