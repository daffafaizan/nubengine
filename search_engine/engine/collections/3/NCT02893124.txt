      globally. HBeAg-negative CHB patients with low Level HBsAg and with a history of drug
      resistance or suboptimal/partial virological response were enrolled in the out-patient
      department of 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. All of them were HBsAg
      positive and anti-HBs negative for more than 6 months with HBV DNA<100 IU/mL and HBsAg levels
      <1000 IU/mL. All patients did not have other liver diseases and contraindications for
      interferon therapy.

      After giving informed consent, patients were treated with NAs once a day and weekly
      subcutaneous injections of alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or peginterferon alfa-2b 80
      micrograms/week for 12 weeks. 12 weeks later, NAs was stopped, patients were treated with
      weekly subcutaneous injections of alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or peginterferon alfa-2b 80
      micrograms/week. The use of other immune suppressive or regulatory drugs and other antiviral
      drugs was prohibited during the course of the study.

      In this study, treatment endpoint was HBsAg loss(<0.05 IU/mL).Anti-HBs positive(>10
      milli-International unit)(mIU/mL) defined as seroconversion. Depending on the decline of
      HBsAg level, treatment was either continued for a prolonged period (no more than 96 weeks)
      until the endpoint was achieved, or terminated in case of nonresponse.
