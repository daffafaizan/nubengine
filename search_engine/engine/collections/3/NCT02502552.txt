      cross-sectional. There are conflicting results among scarce longitudinal data. One study
      reported a negativation of anti-glycan antibodies in some cases but not of ASCA or ANCA.

      On the cohort of 195 patients included in the first study, the investigator would like to
      assess at 3 years the immunological profiles of these patients and thus to compare them. In
      case of modification of the serological status for some antibodies, the search for associated
      factors (clinical, biological or therapeutic) will be performed. In case of sero-negativation
      of anti-glycan antibodies, this could be linked with a decrease or a normalization of the
      increased intestinal permeability in IBD. Indeed, in this subgroup of patients, we will test
      this hypothesis by analyzing intestinal permeability in anti-glycan positive group on the 2
      samples and in the group with a sero-negativation on the second sample.
