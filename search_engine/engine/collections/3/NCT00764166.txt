      phase III trials (1-2). It is likely to demonstrate a substantial role in the management of
      early-stage PC patients in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, where clinical trials are
      underway.â€¢53% of all men who undergo radical prostatectomy will develop prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) elevations in the 10 years following surgery, with approximately 77% of these
      recurrences occurring within the first 2 years.A prospective, multicenter, national,
      randomized, two-arm, phase III study comparing hormonal treatment (LH-RH agonist alone) with
      or without docetaxel was designed to evaluate the interest of chemotherapy in non-metastatic
      prostate cancer patients at high risk of systemic recurrence after initial treatment (radical
      prostatectomy or radiotherapy).
