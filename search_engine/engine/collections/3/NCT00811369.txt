      cancers. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most potent and specific angiogenic
      factor, regulates normal and pathologic angiogenesis. The increased expression of VEGF has
      been correlated with metastases, recurrence and poor prognosis in many cancers. It has been
      shown the VEGF is involved in osteolysis in women with bone metastases. ZACTIMA is an agent
      which targets VEGF. ZACTIMA is a new agent with novel method of action - it is a VEGF
      inhibitor, epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitor, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as well as a
      potential RET kinase activity inhibitor.

      In summary, women with bone only, or bone predominant, metastatic breast cancer is an ideal
      group to study anti-angiogenic therapies where angiogenesis could be a major factor in tumor
      progression and where anti-angiogenic treatment with agents like ZACTIMA could be more
      effective.
