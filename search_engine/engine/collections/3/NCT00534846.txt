      women reported having mastalgia sufficient to interfere with their daily routines.
      Approximately 8-10% of premenopausal women suffer monthly from moderate to severe breast
      pain.Tamoxifen has previously been found to be effective in reducing premenstrual mastalgia.
      We showed that another triphenylethylene derivative, toremifene, significantly alleviated
      cyclical breast pain as compared to placebo. In this study women suffering from cyclical
      breast pain are randomly allocated to receive toremifene (20mg) or placebo during the luteal
      phase for three consecutive cycles. The patients are then crossed over after a wash-out
      period to placebo or toremifene, respectively. The MRI investigations are made at two
      occasions during the premenstrual period after three cycles of toremifene and after three
      cycles of placebo.
