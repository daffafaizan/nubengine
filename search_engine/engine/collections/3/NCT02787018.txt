      fewer side effects. It is more cardio stable than bupivacaine, but the onset of action is
      delayed and the duration of action is shorter than bupivacaine making its use during regional
      anesthesia less preferable to many anesthesiologists. Steroids like dexamethasone, or alpha-2
      agonists like dexmedetomidine are being studied as adjuvants to ropivacaine for brachial
      plexus block to improve its anesthetic properties and have shown favorable outcome in terms
      of shortening the onset of block and prolonging the duration of action. But no study has been
      done to compare their effects. So in this study the investigators want to compare the
      effectiveness of dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to 0.5% ropivacaine for
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block on the onset of block and duration of analgesia, so
      that the investigators can choose the better adjuvant for the investigators routine practice
      of regional anesthesia.
