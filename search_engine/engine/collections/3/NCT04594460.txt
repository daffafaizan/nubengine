      inhalation (Hydrogen-Oxygen Generator with Nebulizer, AMS-H-03, output: 3 L/min (hydrogen
      concentration: 66.7%, oxygen concentration: 33.3%)) and oxygen inhalation (OLO-1 Medical
      Molecular Sieve Oxygen Generator, output: 3 L/min (oxygen concentration: 33.3%), Shanghai
      Ouliang Medical Devices Co., Ltd.), respectively; the treatment duration will not be less
      than 8 hours per day, for 12 weeks.
