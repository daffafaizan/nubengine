      balloon (DCB group), and those undergoing PCI of drug eluting stent implantation (DES group).
      The primary outcome assessed will be the late lumen loss evaluation at a 12-month of
      follow-up appointment. Secondary outcomes include occurrence of major cardiac events (MACEs),
      myocardial viability, operate success, quality of life changes which will be compared to a
      baseline measurement.
