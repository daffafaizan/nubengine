      will be given the opportunity to enroll into the extension study for continued dosing if
      available data support current and/or future benefits for the subject.

      Subjects will be given the opportunity to enroll into this extension study for continued
      dosing if available data support current and/or future benefits for the subject. The
      Investigator, in consultation and agreement with the Medical Monitor, will decide on
      enrollment of each individual subject, as well as on dosing of the first treated eye and
      treatment initiation of the contralateral eye. Continued subject treatment in this study is
      desirable, but cannot be guaranteed, since it will depend on the risks and benefit of further
      treatment on a case-by-case basis, as discussed and agreed upon with the Medical Monitor.

      The contralateral eye and the first treated eye will be injected 3 months apart. The
      injection interval of 3 months between both eyes will limit burden for the subjects, with a 3
      month-visit frequency during the course of the study. This between-eye interval could be
      adapted if safety data are supportive, and for logistic reasons, and in agreement with the
      Medical Monitor.

      The same safety monitoring protocol and efficacy assessments will apply to both eyes.

      QR-110 will be administered via intravitreal (IVT) injection.
