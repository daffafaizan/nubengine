      molecular remission with a history of at least 18 months of consecutive negative standard
      Q-RT-PCR as performed in their own centers. After signing the informed consent form (ICF),
      the patients will be tested for dPCR and will discontinue imatinib therapy. Then they will be
      monitored by standard Q-RT-PCR to assess the maintenance of the molecular remission;
      collection of data will be prospective as each center will collect the data for 36 months. At
      the end of this period, a peripheral blood sample for dPCR analysis will be obtained from
      those patients who will still have undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts by Q-RT-PCR to verify CML
      eradication. The maintenance of molecular remission by Q-RT-PCR and the survival will be
      monitored every six months during an additional follow-up of 24 months. Patients found to be
      positive to BCR-ABL transcripts by standard Q-RTPCR will repeat the test every 2 to 4 weeks
      until the loss of molecular remission, defined as two consecutive BCR-ABL positive tests with
      at least one with BCR-ABL/BCR value above 0.1%, or until the end of the study, whichever come
      first.
