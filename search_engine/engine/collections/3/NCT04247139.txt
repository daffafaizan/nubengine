      yogurt, may improve health by lowering cholesterol levels. Much of this research however,
      focuses on traditional types of kefir, which differ significantly from commercially prepared
      kefir with regards to the types of microbes in each kefir. Additionally, there is a lack of
      research looking at how commercial kefir compares to traditional kefir in its ability to
      improve health. This has led to the consumer being confused about the health benefits they
      believe they are receiving, such as reduced weight gain, and improved cholesterol levels,
      when they purchase and consume commercial kefir. The researchers have produced a commercially
      usable kefir that has the health benefits of traditional grain fermented kefir. This was
      accomplished with only a small subset of microbes present in the traditional kefir, leading
      to a much easier product to commercialize and produce. Thus, this study aims to look at
      whether kefir, produced in the researchers laboratory and commercially available kefir, given
      to males for in two separate months, results in any cholesterol lowering effects. Successful
      completion of this project could potentially result in the development of a new commercial
      kefir with health benefits that are supported by scientific research and testing. In
      addition, if positive results are seen, a larger study will be carried out to ensure that
      results of the current study are consistent for the Canadian population.
