      regimens for the treatment of solid cancers including lung, head and neck, and cervix. Its
      main mechanism of action is through binding of DNA to form cross-links, leading to arrest of
      DNA synthesis and replication. A major adverse consequence of cisplatin therapy is acute
      kidney injury (AKI). It is reported that between 30 and 38 percent of patients develop signs
      of nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys) after a single cisplatin dose, despite strategies
      such as hydration to limit renal exposure. This is problematic for patients as kidney injury
      can delay further treatment and limit the total number of chemotherapy cycles received,
      thereby reducing the overall efficacy of cisplatin-containing regimens. Furthermore, it is
      apparent that cisplatin will remain a central component to the treatment of solid tumors in
      the foreseeable future. New approaches to identify patients at risk of acute kidney injury
      (AKI) and prevent its development and progression are urgently needed. Cisplatin causes
      nausea and vomiting, which requires treatment with 5-HT3 antagonists (5-HT3A) to control.
      Associations between the clinical use of the 5-HT3A antiemetic drugs and the risk of
      cisplatin AKI have recently been discovered. This study will interrogate relationships
      between 5-HT3A drugs (granisetron, ondansetron, and palonosetron) and cisplatin AKI.
