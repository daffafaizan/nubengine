      I. To determine the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of combining paclitaxel with weekly
      bavituximab therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe changes in pharmacodynamic markers and coagulation markers in response to
      single agent and combined therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 and bavituximab IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 15 and 22 only of course 1). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
