      effectiveness for complementary and traditional therapies. Gua Sha is a traditional East
      Asian therapy traditionally used in the treatment of spinal pain. This study aimed to test
      the efficacy of Gua Sha therapy in patients with chronic low back pain A total of 50 patients
      with chronic low back pain were randomized to either two Gua Sha treatments (n=25) or a
      waitlist control group (n=25). Primary outcome measure was current pain intensity on a 100-mm
      visual analog scale; secondary outcome measures included back-related function (Oswestry
      Disability Index), movement-related pain (modified Pain on Movement Questionnaire), as well
      as pressure pain threshold, mechanical detection threshold, and vibration detection
      threshold.
