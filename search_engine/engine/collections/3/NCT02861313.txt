      modality for edentulous subjects. Resin matrix (CM LOC) is one of the low profile attachments
      which represent a promising retention values with subsequent improvement in chewing ability
      and in turns enhance patient quality of life.Oral health impact profile for edentulous
      patient (OHIP-EDENT) is more specific to edentulous subjects.

      Peri-implant soft tissue health (bleeding, inflammation, etc...) is a valuable marker to
      implant success. The study will record different attachment influenced-tissue response and
      its relation to implant success and oral health related quality of life (OHRQOL)
