      patients with high intracranial pressure. For the skull defect after DC, cranioplasty could
      pro-vide protection, aesthetic and even functional improvements. The autologous bone flap
      (ABF) was once thought to be an optimal autograft for repairing [8]. While accumulated
      studies reported ABF related disadvantages. Recently, various customized artificial materials
      are increasingly employed, e.g., titanium and polyetheretherketone (PEEK).

      Titanium is a widely applied metal material for cranioplasty, attribute to its high strength,
      bio-compatibility and comparatively low material cost. Currently, pre-operative three
      dimensional (3D) reconstruction of titanium brings a customized implant for optimal shaping
      effect. However, titanium implant is still confronted with complications of infection,
      implant exposure, etc.

      PEEK is a novel polymer used to rebuild the personalized construction. Through the precise
      computational reconstruction of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning, the
      customized PEEK could more accurately rebuild the complex cranial and maxillofacial
      structure. The application of this material in cranioplasty is increasing, while its
      comprehensive evaluation in clinical practice is still insufficient, especially when
      comparing with the effects of titanium implant.

      We thus designed the study to evaluate the comprehensive effects of the cranioplasty with
      PEEK vs titanium. The data of the patients implanted PEEK or titanium in four years in our
      institute were retrospectively collected and evaluated, in respects of the general
      information of patients, postoperative complications, shaping effects, and psychosocial
      improvements, to display a comprehensive evaluation for these two implants.
