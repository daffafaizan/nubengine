      biased-coin design up-down sequential method). If a patient had a negative response, the
      lidocaine concentration was increased by 0.1% w/v in the next patient. If a patient had a
      positive response, the next patient was randomized to receive the same lidocaine
      concentration (with probability of 0.89), or to receive a concentration 0.1% w/v less (with
      probability of 0.11).
