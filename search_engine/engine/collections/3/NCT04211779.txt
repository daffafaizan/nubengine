      that has become increasingly popular in recent years. tDCS shows promising improvements for
      the motor performance of healthy individuals as well as pathological conditions. Moreover, it
      is frequently preferred because of its safety advantage, high tolerability as well as being
      cheap, portable and easily applicable.

      Studies have shown that tDCS can modulate the excitability of both cortical and subcortical
      brain regions. In recent years, there have been scientific studies investigating the effects
      of tDCS on improving physical performance in healthy individuals, but these studies are
      limited in number, their results are conflicted and as far as the investigators know there is
      no study that combines tDCS with exercise.

      Moreover, although the mechanisms of tDCS on physical performance are largely unknown, some
      tDCS devices are open to public usage and a large number of professional athletes have
      reported using tDCS during their training programs. Therefore, studies are needed to
      demonstrate the effects of tDCS which combined with exercise on performance.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation combined with aerobic exercise on physical performance in healthy individuals.
