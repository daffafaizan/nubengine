      recurrence and progression to CRC. Eligible patients should have undergone a polypectomy
      since 2003, affected by multiple polyps < 10 mm or one-two adenomas < 10 mm and/or with a
      grade of dysplasia to make them classified at intermediate risk for CRC, and scheduled to
      screening colonoscopy each 3-5 years. Patients were sequentially 1:1 randomly allocated to
      placebo or Eviendep at baseline (T0). The dietary supplements were administered twice a day
      for 60 days in advance of the screening colonoscopy, thus covering approximately eight
      complete colon epithelial turnover to occur. Five days in advance of T60 colonoscopy,
      patients refrained from fresh and cooked fruit and vegetable intake. Bowel cleansing was
      achieved by PEG 4000 oral administration (1120 g/4 L water solution). N=8 biopsy
      samples/patient were collected from the non adenomatous mucosa in the sigmoidal colon. Small
      polyps (diameter less or equal 0.5 cm) were topically electrocoagulated, whereas villous and
      tubulovillous polyps (diameter equal or higher than 0.5 cm) were submitted to the
      histological assessment.
