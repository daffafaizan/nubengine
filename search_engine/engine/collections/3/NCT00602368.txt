        -  To identify potential improvements for a noninvasive method of diagnosing cervical
           dysplasia and neoplasia using digital colposcopy and fluorescence spectroscopic imaging.

        -  To measure fluorescence and reflectance images of the human cervix in vivo using digital
           colposcopy.

        -  To evaluate the effect of acetic acid on the image contrast obtained.

        -  To compare the device performance with colposcopic impression and histopathologic
           interpretation of tissue removed by standard loop electrosurgical excision procedure
           (LEEP).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants undergo routine colposcopy as part of their regular colposcopic evaluation. The
      digital colposcope is used to take fluorescence and reflectance images of the vagina and
      cervix. Participants also undergo loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). The digital
      colposcopic images are compared with tissue removed during LEEP. Additional surrogate
      biomarkers under development are also measured using tissue samples removed during LEEP, such
      as quantitative histopathology measurements, DNA tests for the copy number changes, and tests
      for the incorporation of viral HPV DNA.
