      I. To define the biodistribution of gallium Ga 68 fibroblast activation protein inhibitor
      (FAPi)-46 (68Ga-FAPi-46) in normal and cancer tissues of patients with sarcoma with
      histopathology validation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether 68Ga-FAPi-46 accumulation observed by positron emission tomography
      (PET) reflects geography, extent and degree of FAP expression determined by
      immuno-histochemistry (IHC).

      II. To assess the 68Ga-FAPI-46 biodistribution correlation with fludeoxyglucose F-18
      (18F-FDG) biodistribution and to define the frequency of the following phenotypes (FAP
      positive [+]/ FDG+, FAP negative [-]/ FDG+, FAP+/ FDG-, FAP-/ FDG-).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-FAPi-46 intravenously (IV), and then undergo PET/computed tomography
      (CT) over 20-90 minutes.
