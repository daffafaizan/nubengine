    
      In this open-label, compassionate extended use study, patients who have completed their
      participation in an Amylyx sponsored protocol for ALS may be offered compassionate use
      extension of treatment with AMX0035 under this protocol. Patient currently treated with
      AMX0035 will continue to receive treatment at their current dose/regimen. Patients who have
      interrupted AMX0035 for more than 28 days will resume AMX0035 treatment with 1 sachet (oral
      [or feeding tube]) once a day in the morning to be escalated to twice a day (morning and
      evening) after approximately 2 weeks on the basis of GI tolerance. Enrolled patients will
      complete regular outpatient visit approximately every 16 weeks (Â± 2 weeks). Completion of the
      ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) will be optional.
