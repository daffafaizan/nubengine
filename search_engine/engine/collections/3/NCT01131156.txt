    
      Mothers of newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), who had quit smoking
      during or just prior to pregnancy where randomized to either the Standard of Care or Smoking
      Relapse Prevention group. Mothers in both groups were encouraged to remain smoke free
      following the birth of their babies and were given routine lactation support for
      breastfeeding during their babies' hospitalization in the NICU. Mothers in the Smoking
      Relapse Prevention group were also given the study intervention, which was enhanced support
      for maternal-infant bonding by providing information about their newborn's behaviors using
      books, DVDs, and handouts that were appropriate for their baby's gestational age and by
      encouraging frequent skin-to-skin holding.

      Primary outcomes included duration of smoke-free status and duration of breastfeeding.
