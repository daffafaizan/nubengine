      and CYP2C9 genes and the clinical efficacy of ibuprofen after lower third molar extractions
      regarding pain, swelling and trismus, adverse reactions, the amount of pain medication used,
      the patient satisfaction with the drug and the influence of the ability on preoperative
      modulation of conditioned pain. We will evaluate also the relationship between the different
      haplotypes of OPRM1 gene (SNP A118G), the salivary concentrations of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-±), and preoperative conditioned pain modulation.
      Therefore, 200 patients will be genotyped and phenotyped for these genes and their
      postoperative records with all data collected will be compared with the haplotypes found in
      the Brazilian population.

      For analysis of the proposed genes, saliva will be collected, which will serve as a source of
      genomic DNA. For molecular analysis it will be performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All
      tests will be conducted and validated by Applied Biosystems®. Also it will be held in the
      research, genetic sequencing of the genes CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and OPRM1, to verify possible
      correlations of these genes with postoperative pain and pain modulation.
