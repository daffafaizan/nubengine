      there is a significant unmet medical need for safe and effective therapies to treat moderate
      to severe COPD. This patient population has a high mortality rate and requires frequent
      hospitalizations due to disease-related exacerbations. Based on severity distribution
      estimates, approximately 70% of all current COPD patients have either moderate or severe
      COPD. COPD has no known cure, thus current therapeutic intervention is aimed at providing
      relief of symptoms. Oxygen therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve
      survival. Smoking cessation has been shown to slow the rate of FEV1 decline and COPD
      progression. In general patients are treated with bronchodilators and inhaled
      corticosteroids, but again, these measures do not provide any significant benefit regarding
      disease progression or prognosis. The characteristics and biologic activity of PROCHYMAL™,
      along with a good safety profile in human trials to date, suggest that PROCHYMAL™ may be a
      good candidate for addressing this unmet medical need.
