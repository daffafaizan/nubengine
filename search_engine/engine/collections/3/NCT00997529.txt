      non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients whose
      immunosuppressive therapy has been tapered off, are without GVHD, and have evidence of
      residual or progressive disease will undergo DLI.

      In recent years there have been attempts to harness the graft-versus-tumor effect of
      allogeneic bone marrow transplant to treat patients with metastatic solid tumors. Researchers
      at the NIH recently reported on 19 patients with refractory metastatic renal-cell carcinoma
      who had suitable donors and received a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine followed by an infusion of a peripheral-blood stem-cell allograft from an
      HLA-identical sibling or a sibling with a mismatch of a single HLA antigen.49 They note that
      at the time of the last follow-up, 9 of the 19 patients were alive 287 to 831 days after
      transplantation (median follow-up: 402 days). Two had died of transplantation-related causes
      and 8 of progressive disease. In 10 patients (53%) metastatic disease regressed: 3 had a
      complete response, and 7 had a partial response. The patients who had a complete response
      remained in remission 27, 25, and 16 months after transplantation. Regression of metastases
      was delayed, occurring a median of 129 days after transplantation, and often followed the
      withdrawal of cyclosporine and the establishment of complete donor T-cell chimerism. They
      concluded that these results were consistent with a graft-versus-tumor effect and that
      non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation can induce sustained regression of
      metastatic RCCA in patients who have had no response to conventional immunotherapy.
