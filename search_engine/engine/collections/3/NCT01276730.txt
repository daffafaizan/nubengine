      recruited into the study. The patients will be recruited from the Gynecologic Oncology
      Department of the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute that registers more than 600 cases
      of cancer of the cervix per year. Computer-generated numbers will randomize patients into the
      two treatment arms.

      This trial is designed to treat stage III cervical cancer patients with concomitant
      immunotherapy (with cis-retinoic acid and interferon-Î±) and radiotherapy in the study arm.

      Cancer of the uterine cervix is the second most common cancer among women worldwide and is
      the cause of the largest number of cancer-related deaths among women in the developing
      countries. In India, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer among women (126,000 new cases,
      71,000 deaths in 2000), accounting for more than a quarter of the global burden of cervical
      cancer (471,000 new cases and 233,000 deaths).1,2 In contrast, in the U.S., although, there
      were only 12,200 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,100 deaths in 2003, the United States
      spends $5 billion per year screening and treating cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.

      Advanced cervical cancer is relatively rare in the developed world because of routine PAP
      testing. However, in a developing country like India, because of the absence of any
      population based cervical cancer screening programs (HPV testing, PAP smears), nearly 80% of
      the patients are initially detected at stage III or higher. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy
      administered along with surgery and radiation is the recommended treatment for advanced
      cervical cancer in the US and other developed countries.
