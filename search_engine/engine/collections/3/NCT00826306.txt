      education with written instruction on subjects' adherence to sunscreen application.

      Subjects randomized to the video-based education arm will be instructed to watch a video on
      the importance of sunscreen application and the proper technique of applying sunscreen.
      Subjects randomized to the written education arm will receive written information on the
      importance of sunscreen application and the proper technique of applying sunscreen. The
      contents of the video and the written educational materials will be comparable.

      At the end of the study period, 3 months later, subjects will be interviewed via telephone
      regarding their sunscreen application behavior during the last month of the study period.
      Subjects will also be interviewed regarding their comprehension and attitude towards
      video-based and written education materials.
