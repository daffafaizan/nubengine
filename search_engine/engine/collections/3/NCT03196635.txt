      of compression force during mammography and is a personalized approach that has demonstrated
      successful reduction in discomfort experienced during mammography. GE Healthcare's Senographe
      Pristina, an innovative mammography platform that provides both two-dimensional (2D) and
      three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities, offers both standard and PA compression modes.
      This study is being conducted to compare the image quality of breast images obtained using TC
      compression and PA compression, and to evaluate the impact of PA compression on clinical
      workflow. The study population will consist of adult asymptomatic women presenting for
      screening 2D mammography.
