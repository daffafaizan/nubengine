    
      This is a stepped wedge, open-label study of PKU Sphere for the dietary management of
      participants with Phenylketonuria. It will be carried out with 33 participants who will be
      randomised into one of three clusters. The total study length per patient is 16 weeks. Each
      cluster transitions from taking their standard amino acid product alone to incorporating PKU
      Sphere (at least 50% of their protein substitue requirement) at different timepoints: week 5,
      9 or 13.

      Participants will have a face-to-face clinical review at the time of recruitment (week 0) and
      at 16 weeks (completion of the study). They will also have an additional telephone review
      when they switch onto PKU Sphere.

      Blood samples will be taken at baseline, and then every two weeks for the duration of the
      study.

      In addition to these study visits and procedures, routine clinical care will continue in line
      with local guidelines.
