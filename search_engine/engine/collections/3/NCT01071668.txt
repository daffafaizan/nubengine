      to investigate a set of small molecules that characterize biochemical pathways of interest.
      The change in concentration levels of these molecules in various biological samples such as
      urine and blood in the presence of a disease or a patient can detect metabolic fingerprints
      that can be particularly useful for identifying new biomarkers. These will thereafter be
      quantified and validated by metabolic profiling. To our knowledge, there are few studies on
      metabolomics and pregnancy.

      Methods:

      The studied population will be pregnant women between 20-30 weeks of gestation without any
      obstetrical complications.

      Vaginal secretions, blood and urine samples will be taken:

        -  After inclusion in the project

        -  At hospital admission for delivery

        -  During labor

      Blood and urine sample will also be taken:

        -  48 hours after delivery

        -  6-8 weeks after delivery
