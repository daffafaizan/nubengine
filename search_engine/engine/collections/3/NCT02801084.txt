      thermal input to the brain. The float rooms used in this study are both lightproof, and thus
      completely dark when the entry door is sealed and the lights are turned off, reducing all
      visual input to the brain. Each float room was constructed with thick soundproof walls,
      restricting most outside noises from entering the room, thereby reducing auditory input to
      the brain. A high concentration Epsom salt water solution allows individuals to effortlessly
      float on their back while remaining completely still, reducing both proprioceptive and
      tactile input to the brain. The temperature of the water is calibrated to the temperature of
      the skin (~94Â° F) and the temperature of the air is calibrated to the temperature of the
      water, making it difficult to discern the boundary between air and water, thus reducing
      thermal input to the brain while minimizing the need for thermoregulation of the skin.

      While both float pools dramatically reduce external sensory information, it is important to
      note that participants are in full control over the experience. For example, participants can
      enter and exit the float pool whenever they choose. Each float pool also contains a blue LED
      light that can be turned on and off via an air-coupled light switch in the pool. Both float
      rooms contain a shower for cleaning before and after floating.

      In a prior study the investigators have found that healthy participants found the pool
      condition to be relaxing and stress relieving. The current study aims to determine the safety
      of floating with a clinical population, specifically individuals with a history of eating
      disorder who are of normal weight.
