      and reading abilities. However, there is controversy regarding whether or not to prescribe
      for low to moderate amounts of hyperopia. The Correction of Hyperopia In Children Study
      (CHICS) is a placebo-controlled, randomized, masked investigation of the effect of spectacle
      correction for moderate amounts of hyperopia on visual function, attention, and reading
      skills in children.
