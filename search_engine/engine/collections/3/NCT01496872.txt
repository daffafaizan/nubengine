      sacral areas. These findings will be compared to the findings of a standard newborn physical
      exam and the newborn and maternal history. These records will be reviewed for maternal age,
      parity, gravity, anesthesia during labor, and estimated gestational age. Birth history and
      initial newborn assessments will be reviewed for labor augmentation, duration of labor,
      length of second stage of labor, presence of instrumental delivery(vacuum extraction, forceps
      delivery, etc.), multiple birth, and presentation at delivery (breech, transverse, or
      compound presentation). The purpose of the study is to quantify the presence of somatic
      dysfunction in the newborn. We will assess any relationships between the identified somatic
      dysfunctions and factors present in the mother's and newborn's medical history.
