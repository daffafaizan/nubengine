      than single diagnosis patients.

      Cannabis misuse is a known risk factor for recurrence of psychosis.

      A specified intervention on the basis of a manual for schizophrenic substance abusers is
      administered to inpatients in a specialized unit for young schizophrenic patients in a
      psychiatric hospital.

      The control group, same indication (psychotic disorder and cannabis misuse) receives social
      competence training (specified for schizophrenic patients as well).

      Admission to groups is randomly.
