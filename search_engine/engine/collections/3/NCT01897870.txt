      confusion about medication regimens and medication mismanagement before- during - and after
      hospital admission. This phenomenon accounts for many readmissions, longer duration of
      admission and preventable and serious Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) as a result of Drug Related
      Problems (DRPs). Several studies show that discharge medication reconciliation (MR) and
      counseling by a pharmacy employee reduces the amount of discrepancies in the discharge
      prescription lists. Still, no unequivocal effect of MR on the occurrence of DRPs after
      discharge has been shown. This is due to a shift in underlying potential harmful
      discrepancies from mainly patient based (unintended nonadherence) to mainly system based (eg
      dispensing errors) and might be explained by (1) suboptimal transfer of information (2) an
      overload of information during a stressful situation and (3) difficulty to implement changes
      in medication at home. Therefore the reduction of DRPs, improvement of patients' medication
      knowledge and initial adherence can probably most effectively be addressed in a multifaceted
      integrated transmural intervention. Repetition of important information is the key to
      success. Moreover, the first weeks following hospital discharge are most crucial in
      preventing drug-related problems as patients could slip back in old medication schemes, or
      new problems may arise, such as emerging ADEs due to medication changes made during
      hospitalization.
