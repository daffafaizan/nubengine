      including post-date pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, maternal diabetes, premature rupture of the
      membranes and intra-uterine fetal growth retardation. There are two fundamental changes that
      characterise pre-labour preparation for delivery: sensitisation of the myometrium to produce
      contractions, and ripening (softening and dilation) of the cervix. Prostaglandins (PG) are
      fundamental to both of these changes, and several forms have been used to successfully induce
      labour. Dinoprostone (PGE2) is an example of a cervical ripening agent that is available in
      gel and tablet form and has a proven record of successful cervical ripening in this
      population. Dinoprostone is also available in a controlled release vaginal delivery system,
      which is manufactured by Controlled Therapeutics (Scotland) a subsidiary of Cytokine
      PharmaSciences, Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA.

      Another synthetic prostaglandin that has been shown to be an effective cervical ripener and
      labour inducer is misoprostol. Oral tablets are broken into fragments and used intravaginally
      to ripen the cervix and induce labour Due to the disadvantages of existing cervical ripeners
      (delivery of bolus doses, freezer or refrigerated storage, lack of efficacy in labour
      induction), and due to safety concerns with the off-label use of oral misoprostol tablet
      fragments, Controlled Therapeutics has developed a controlled release vaginal delivery system
      similar to its marketed dinoprostone product but containing misoprostol.

      This study examines four dose strengths of the misoprostol vaginal insert in women who need
      to have their labours induced.
