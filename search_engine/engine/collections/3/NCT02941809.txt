      of two different groups: either methadone plus daily open-label placebo (OLP; treatment
      group), or methadone/Treatment as Usual (TAU; control). Participants will meet with study
      team members five times over the course of three months of treatment with methadone
      (baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months post-baseline). Throughout this study time period,
      methadone dosages will be adjusted by an addiction clinician blind to patient assignment, per
      standard clinical methods. The primary outcome is methadone dose at three months. Secondary
      outcomes include self-report of drug use; 3-month urine toxicology screen results; and
      treatment retention. Exploratory outcomes include several environmental as well as
      personality factors associated with OUD and with propensity to demonstrate a placebo effect.
