    
      This is an observational study with focus on existing pregnancy reporting forms
      (retrospective part) and a patient's questionnaire which is completed at a single point of
      time (prospective part). Main data source for the retrospective data (from 2014 until
      December 2019) will be captured from multiple sclerosis service-center (MSSC) database, i.e.
      the entered pregnancy report (to be completed as soon as pregnancy becomes known) and
      pregnancy outcomes report (to be completed after completion of pregnancy).

      Prospective data (December 2020 to 31 March 2021) will be captured as standardized ePDF
      questionnaire completed during telephone interview. If the pregnancy report or the pregnancy
      outcome report is incomplete, i.e. the data above was not collected, the open questions will
      be addressed during a telephone interview performed by the MSSC and the new information will
      be entered into the MSCC database. The patient questionnaire will be completed at a single
      point of time during the telephone interview performed by the MSSC.
