      with suicide, mood, and anxiety symptoms. Eligible individuals will be randomized to one of
      several conditions. In all conditions, participants will complete various self-report
      questionnaires and a neurophysiology assessment that involves an EEG. Some participants will
      also be asked to complete four additional EEG assessments. In addition, all participants will
      be asked to complete a 1, 3, and 6-month follow-up appointment.
