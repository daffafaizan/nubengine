      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford. There will be 3 study groups and it is anticipated that a
      total of 12 volunteers will be enrolled. Staggered enrolment will apply between study groups
      and for the first three volunteers within each group.

      The study includes an optional extended follow-up period, lasting one month and starting one
      year after vaccination. Volunteers will receive a complete pre-exposure prophylactic course
      of an existing rabies vaccine, allowing study of the immunological memory (recall response)
      induced by ChAdOx2 RabG. A second optional element of the study is the collection of saliva
      samples at each visit for the study of shedding of EBV and CMV.
