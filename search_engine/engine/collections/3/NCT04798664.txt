      biochemically confirmed smoking abstinence for 6 months among smokers in underserved
      demographic groups. The 3,200 participants to be enrolled will be current smokers who are
      Black, Hispanic, and/or have low socioeconomic status (defined as household income <200% of
      the federal poverty line or a high school education or less) or rural residence who are
      referred for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening at 4 large health systems. All
      adult patients with LDCT orders will be further screened for eligibility. Eligible patients
      will enroll and complete the study using the NIH-funded Way to Health online research portal.
      The primary outcome will be biochemically confirmed, sustained abstinence from smoking
      tobacco for 6 months following participants' selected quit dates. Relapse rates will be
      tracked at 12 months.
