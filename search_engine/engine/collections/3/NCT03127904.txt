      trial. Patients diagnosed with varicose ulcers through Doppler ultrasonography will be
      recruited at the Pro Circulation Clinic of Angiology and Vascular Surgery, Brazil. The active
      group will be the Vein Fitness system, a multimodal intervention comprising exercise,
      lymphatic drainage, and compressive therapy, while the control group will be standard
      compressive therapy and regular wound care. The researchers will measure closure of the
      wounds and the closure rate as the primary outcomes. The study was designed in accordance
      with the CONSORT statement.
