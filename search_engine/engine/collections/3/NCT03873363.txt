      cruciate-substituting (posterior stabilized - PS) Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).

      For this purpose, flexion and extension of the knee joint are measured using a goniometer
      preoperatively and up to ten years after surgery In addition, the clinical outcome will be
      assessed and evaluated using internationally recognised and evaluated scores (Knee Society
      Score, Oxford Knee Score, EQ5D, UCLA Activity Score).

      Patients are randomized to receive a PS or CR TKA. Patients are assessed before surgery,
      after 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7 years and 10 years postoperatively.
