      pruritus. Methotrexate (MTX) can be used to treat refractory disease to conventional therapy,
      but there are few studies showing its effect on the profile of cytokines involved in the
      inflammatory response.

      Objectives: To assess the effect of MTX on the cytokines involved in the inflammatory
      response of adult AD patients treated with methotrexate for 24 weeks. As specific objectives,
      investigators intend to assess the evolution of serum IgE levels, the EASI (Eczema Area and
      Severity Index) and SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) severity scores and pruritus in them.

      Methods: It will be conducted an open, prospective study with twelve adult patients with
      moderate to severe AD on MTX for 24 weeks. Each participant is expected to attend 7 visits
      during 6 months of follow-up. In clinical healthy and injured skin, two assessments will be
      performed: 1) mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-31, oncostatin M receptor
      (OSMR), alpha subunit IL-31 (IL-31RA) receptor, TNF-α, IFN-γ, TSLP, TARC and MDC by Real
      Time-PCR at the initial week and week 24; 2) expression of IL-31, IL-31RA, OSMR, TSLP and
      Ki67 by immunohistochemistry at the initial week and week 24.

      Skin samples from non-atopic subjects will be utilized as controls for the assays, paired by
      gender and age.

      Additional analysis of serum levels of IgE (nephelometric method) at the initial week and
      week 24 of the study will be performed.

      AD severity scores (EASI and SCORAD) will be tested and pruritus will be analyzed by a visual
      analog scale at the initial, week 12 and week 24.
