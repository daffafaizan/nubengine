      weight suppression (WS; difference between one's highest and lowest weight) and non-suicidal
      self-injury (NSSI). Previous research has found an association between current WS and
      lifetime NSSI and that this association was mediated by depressive symptoms and drive for
      thinness. The current study therefore modified an existing online cognitive dissonance-based
      program (the e-Body Project) using mixed gender content (from the Body Project 4 All scripts)
      to target posited mediators, i.e., depressive symptoms and weight and shape concerns, in a
      sample of individuals with WS and engagement in current NSSI.
