      during probe microphone verification measurements, called real-ear to coupler difference
      (RECD). Because the patient's ear is not used during the RECD measurement, but rather
      simulated, the patient would not need to be present during the RECD verification. This RECD
      hearing aid verification can occur in the clinic after which the hearing aids will be mailed
      to the patient. This study will compare the fitting accuracy and outcomes between the two
      approaches.
