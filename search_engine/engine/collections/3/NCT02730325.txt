      and compared to matching placebo in two distinct patient populations:

      I. Hospitalized ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who tested positive for Clostridium
      difficile (C. difficile) at time of admission and are receiving vancomycin.

      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the effect of SBI on time (# of days) to resolution of diarrhea, defined as a
      consecutive 24 hour period with only formed bowel movements (Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) ≤ 4)
      in this patient population

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the ability of SBI to decrease the incidence of recurrent C. difficile
           infection (CDI) following successful treatment with vancomycin.

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on UC status

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on nutritional status

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SBI

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on subjects' quality of life (QOL)

        -  To investigate the effect of SBI in fecal microbiome

        -  To evaluate the length of hospitalization (time of hospitalization to time of discharge)

      II. Hospitalized UC patients who tested negative for C. difficile at time of admission.

      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the effect of SBI on time (# of days) to resolution of diarrhea, defined as a
      consecutive 24 hour period with only formed bowel movements (Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) ≤ 4)
      in this patient population

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI in decreasing the incidence of CDI

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on UC status

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on nutritional status

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SBI

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on subjects' QOL

        -  To investigate the effect of SBI in fecal microbiome

        -  To evaluate the length of hospitalization (time of hospitalization to time of discharge)
