      stromal and glandular cells, it was demonstrated, in several research efforts, that in the
      presence of E2 they act as antiestrogens.

      Considered that endometrial hyperplasia is due to strong and extended estrogenic stimulation,
      not offset by a proportionate amount of progesterone, we suppose that genistein could be
      therapeutic in these cases inducing a decrease of the hyperplasia and a change from the
      proliferative to a secretory phase of the endometrium.
