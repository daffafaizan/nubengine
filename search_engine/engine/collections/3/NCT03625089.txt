    
      Objectives This study investigates the impact of a nurse-led programme on cardiovascular (CV)
      risk screening with and without carotid ultrasound for carotid plaque on CV risk factor
      control in asymptomatic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.

      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that CV risk stratification and management in RA and
      PsA may be improved by incorporation of carotid ultrasound to assess for carotid plaque.
