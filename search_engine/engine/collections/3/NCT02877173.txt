      alprostadil liposomes for injection in the treatment of atherosclerotic occlusive disease of
      the lower extremities at different dose strengths.The total duration of subject participation
      will be approximately 5 weeks,consisting of a 2-week run-in period,3-week treatment and
      safety follow-up period.

      Subjects will sign the informed consent form(ICF) at a screening visit and will be assigned a
      subject identifier.Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and who have
      successfully completed all protocol procedures at screening will enter the 2-week
      run-in.Following the 2-week run-in period,eligible subjects will be randomized(1:1:1:1) to
      one of the following double-blind treatment groups:

      Group A : Alprostadil Liposomes for Injection at low dose:20ug,once a day(QD); Group B :
      Alprostadil Liposomes for Injection at medium dose:40ug,QD Group C : Alprostadil Liposomes
      for Injection at high dose:60ug,QD Group D(Positive Control Group) : Alprostadil
      Injection:10ug,QD All treatments will be delivered by intravenously guttae.A subject will be
      consider to have completed the study when they have completed all phase of the study
      including run-in,randomization,the randomized treatment and efficacy and safety follow-up
      phase.
