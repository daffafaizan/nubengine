      for detailed evaluation of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and the vascular response to
      coronary interventional devices to guide stent placement during percutaneous coronary
      intervention. Current conventional IVUS catheters emit ultrasound waves ranging from 20-40
      megahertz (mHz), and more recently released high-definition IVUS catheters emit sound waves
      at 60 mHz, allowing for better image quality, quantitative accuracy, and precision in
      measurements.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an alternative imaging modality used for similar
      purposes as IVUS, using a single optical fiber that emits infrared light to image the
      coronary artery. OCT uses light in the infrared spectrum with a central wavelength between
      1,250 and 1,350 nm. Axial resolution with OCT is 10-20 microns, whereas it is typically
      100-200 microns with IVUS. Thus, OCT allows for better image resolution, but this comes at
      the expense of tissue penetration.
