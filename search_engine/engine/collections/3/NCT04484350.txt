      ASA) propose thresholds of systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 180 mm Hg and diastolic BP
      less than 105 mm Hg during and for the first 24 hours following endovascular treatment (EVT),
      which have been arbitrarily inherited from previous intravenous thrombolysis guidelines.
      Although there is plethora of evidence from observational cohort studies suggesting that
      increased BP following EVT is associated with higher likelihood of both intracranial
      hemorrhage and unfavorable clinical outcomes, the potential for residual confounding in these
      observational datasets limits their interpretation. The blooD prEssure management in sTroke
      following EndovasCular Treatment (DETECT) trial is a single-center, pragmatic, pilot,
      prospective open label, blinded end point, randomized controlled trial testing the hypothesis
      that intensive BP management following successful EVT is feasible. The primary objective of
      DETECT is to determine the feasibility of a RCT assessing the efficacy and safety of
      intensive BP lowering compared to standard of care in rates of hemorrhagic transformation and
      functional outcome following successful EVT in acute ischemic stroke patients with large
      vessel occlusion. We will include adult patients with acute ischemic stroke achieving
      successful reperfusion (TICI more or equal to 2b) of a proximal large vessel occlusion in the
      anterior circulation after EVT. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 within 60 minutes
      from the end of the EVT procedure to either intensive (systolic BP target <140 mmHg) or
      standard BP management (systolic BP target <180 mmHg) for the first 48 hours after
      randomization. Patients with presence of concomitant ipsilateral or contralateral
      extracranial vessel occlusion or remaining stenosis â‰¥80% after the end of the EVT, and/or
      patients having any medical condition where randomization to either standard or intensive BP
      lowering would not be acceptable at the discretion of the treating physician will be excluded
      from participating. The trial will be embedded within an established national EVT registry
      that focuses on improving quality of management of patients receiving EVT for ischemic
      stroke.
