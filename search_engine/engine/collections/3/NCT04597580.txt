      receptor negative (HER2-) metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, eligible for 1st line
      endocrine therapy with AI + CDK4/6i will be included. Patients will receive standard therapy
      (AI + CDK4/6i) and follow-up will proceed according to local guidelines, namely cross
      sectional imaging with CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis +/- MRI as required and analysis of CA 15-3,
      every 3 cycles for the first year and every 3-4 cycles thereafter. Participation in the study
      will include serial blood sampling for the bespoke study biomarkers. Decisions on progression
      will be made according to the routine imaging tests and the biomarkers will be subsequently
      analysed.

      The investigators hypothesise that the biomarkers ctDNA, TK1 and CA15-3, alone or in
      combination, will accurately correlate with disease status in patients receiving AI + CDK4/6i
      for metastatic breast cancer such that routine imaging can be delayed until predefined levels
      of biomarker progression.

      Primary aim: To develop a biomarker-based prediction model to be used in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer, receiving first line therapy with AI and CDK4/6i, that provides the
      physician with a recommendation whether or not a radiological examination is required, based
      on the likelihood that the scan will actually show progressive disease.

      Secondary aims

        -  To define the lead time between rising biomarker and subsequent progression on imaging

        -  To define the clinical utility of the bespoke biomarkers for disease monitoring

        -  The relative value of analysing TK1 "on CDK4/6i treatment" versus "off CDK4/6i
           treatment" for disease monitoring

        -  To define the economic impact of implementation of the chosen prediction model
