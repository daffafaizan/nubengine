      procedures. This study uses the tissue that would normally be discarded during the surgical
      process. The tissue is cultured and frozen for purposes of the following testing:

      odor detection and signal transduction, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and odor detection,
      the role of cAMP in olfactory dysfunction, and pheromone detection.

      Only tissue that would normally be discarded during the course of the surgery will be used.
      The study does not interfere with or change any clinical care.
