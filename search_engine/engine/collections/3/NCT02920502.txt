    
      3.4.1 Study Medication (Vitamin D/Placebo): Patients will be blocked randomized into one of
      four groups using a balanced assignment. The target number of patients is 20, with five
      patients who have successfully completed all assessments in each group. Groups will be closed
      to enrollment once their target is reached. The recruitment will continue until every group
      has reached its target. The investigative pharmacy will prepare each dosage according to the
      randomization and will hold the key to the dosing.

      Participants and investigators will be blinded to those receiving cholecalciferol which comes
      in 50,000 I.U. dose capsules and those receiving a placebo. Participants will be randomized
      to 1 of 4 doses as outlined below. All participants will receive the same number of capsules.
      Five participants will be in each group and will be dosed according to the following dosing
      schema:

      Table 1: Dosing Schema

      Cholecalciferol Dosage Group

      Control: 0 Cholecalciferol Capsules 4 Placebo Capsules

      50,000 I.U.: 1 Cholecalciferol Capsules 3 Placebo Capsules

      100,000 I.U.: 2 Cholecalciferol Capsules 2 Placebo Capsules

      200,000 I.U.: 4 Cholecalciferol Capsules 0 Placebo Capsules

      3.4.2. Skin Thickness Measurement:All testing sites will be evaluated for redness. Skin
      thickness will also be measured using a micrometer before and after UV exposure.

      3.4.3. MED/Sunburn Test: This procedure involves exposing eight 6mm areas of skin over
      increasing doses of simulated solar radiation (SSR), while the rest of the body is draped.
      SSR is delivered by a 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp, which emits ultraviolet wavelengths from
      290-400 nm, closely resembling natural sunlight. The minimal erythema dose (MED) will be
      determined approximately 24 hours after initial exposure by using a chromameter that records
      the values of redness associated with each exposed 1cm area. The overall differences in MED
      between the subjects will be assessed.

      3.4.4. UVR Exposure: This procedure involves exposing four 6mm areas of skin over increasing
      doses of simulated solar radiation (SSR), while the rest of the body is draped. SSR is
      delivered by a 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp, which emits ultraviolet wavelengths from 290-400
      nm, closely resembling natural sunlight. The sites to be exposed will be dosed as follows: 1
      MED, 2 MED, 3 MED, 3 MED. Two sites will be exposed for this study, one before study
      medication dosing and one after study medication dosing.

      3.4.5. Blood Draw: samples will be taken by venipuncture to provide samples for analysis of
      serum 25OHD and macrophages.

        -  Serum 25OHD and 1,25(OH): Up to 6ml blood will be drawn to measure 25OHD and sent to
           Heartland Assays, LLC.

        -  Banked Serum:Up to 30ml of blood serum will be collected and stored in the Dermatology
           research lab and will then be analyzed with the Macrophage Harvest.

        -  Macrophage Harvest: One-time collection up to 180ml whole blood will be processed and
           purified to isolate peripheral blood macrophages in the Dermatology research lab.

      3.4.6. Punch Biopsy (Tissue Sample): A punch biopsy is the removal of a small (pencil
      eraser-sized) circle of skin using a cookie cutter-like instrument. This procedure involves
      numbing the designated area of skin with lidocaine and the removal of a circle of skin. Prior
      to obtaining the punch biopsy, the skin will be injected with lidocaine, a painkiller similar
      to that used by dentists. Although the lidocaine can tingle or hurt briefly during the
      numbing process, volunteers should not feel any pain while the punch biopsy is being
      obtained. The circle is then closed using one to five fine stitches per site, which prevents
      bleeding, speeds healing, and improves the appearance. The stitches are removed 10-14 days
      later.

      3.4.7. Photographs: Photographs of the testing sites will be taken through-out this protocol.
      In the event that a photograph is taken of the subject's face or any other identifiable
      feature, the subject's identity may become known.

           4. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS - MINIMIZED

      4.1. Study Medication (Vitamin D/Placebo): Vitamin D is well tolerated and often used in
      clinical practice. It is freely available as an over the counter supplement. There are few
      side effects to oral vitamin D, with the most severe being hypercalcemia with prolonged use
      of a high dose. Vitamin D toxicity can occur when the active form is given (1,25
      dihydroxyvitamin D) or with prolonged exposure to high dose vitamin D3. Both young and old
      adults have taken one time high dose vitamin D3 safely. It is possible that an allergic
      reaction could occur to the medication and participants will be asked to report and symptoms.

      4.2. Skin Thickness Measurement: there are no known risks to evaluating or measuring the
      skin's thickness with a micrometer.

      4.3. Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) and Ultraviolet Light Exposure (UVR): The risks associated
      with this procedure are minimal, as only the testing sites will be exposed. The consequences
      of being exposed to UV light are short-term, and primarily involve mild redness at the
      exposure site followed by minor itching and dryness of the skin several days later. The
      degree of the sunburn is typically mild to moderate and the UV dose used is not enough to
      cause blistering of the skin.

      4.4. Blood Draw: Risks from a blood draw may include the occurrence of discomfort and/or
      bruise at the site of puncture and, less likely, the formation of a small clot, swelling of
      the vein, or bleeding from the puncture site.

      4.5. Punch Biopsy (Tissue Sample): Punch biopsies pose minimal risk, and volunteers are
      instructed as to the proper care of the biopsy site. Lidocaine may cause a tingling or
      burning sensation when injected into the skin. Potential problems localized to the biopsy
      site include bleeding or oozing, discomfort, or infection. The biopsy site will heal with a
      small, flat scar, which may be red for several months. The scar may also turn lighter or
      darker than the surrounding skin after some time.

      4.6. Photographs: There are no known risks to taking photographs. In the event a photograph
      is taken of the subject's face or any other identifying feature, the patient's identity may
      be known.
