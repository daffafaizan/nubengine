      Primary

      Determine the ability of alpha-lipoic acid supplementation to prevent or reduce the incidence
      and severity of hearing loss in cancer patients undergoing treatment with cisplatin.

      Secondary

      Determine if this drug improves the oxidative state, as measured by a malondialdehyde
      measurement of oxidative stress, thereby protecting the patient against ototoxic-induced
      hearing loss.

      OUTLINE: This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified by cancer stage and institution. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral alpha-lipoic acid supplement once a day beginning 1 week before
      the start of cisplatin treatment and continuing for up to 1 month after the completion of
      cisplatin. During cisplatin treatment, patients discontinue supplement 1 day prior to the
      cisplatin treatment and resume daily supplements 2 days post treatment.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo supplement once a day beginning 1 week before the start
      of cisplatin and continuing for up to 1 month after the completion of cisplatin. During
      cisplatin treatment, patients discontinue supplement 1 day prior to the cisplatin treatment
      and resume daily supplements 2 days post treatment.

      Hearing and ototoxicity are assessed at baseline, on each day of chemotherapy, and at 1 and 3
      months post chemotherapy.

      Blood samples are collected periodically to measure malondialdehyde and alpha-lipoic acid
      levels.

      After completion of treatment with cisplatin, patients are followed for 3 months.
