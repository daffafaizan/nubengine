    
      A prospective, single masked comparative trial using either combination therapy (group 1):
      same day combination therapy with 0.05cc intravitreal dexamethasone injection (10mg/ml vial)
      and a single 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab injection for four consecutive months will be
      compared to monotherapy (group 2): one intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab also
      given for four consecutive months. These treatments will then be followed by PRN treatment
      based on clinical exam, angiographic studies, and OCT evidence of residual subretinal fluid,
      CME, subretinal hemorrhage, or pigment epithelial detachment. Fluorescein angiography and
      fundus photography will be performed at baseline and at the 1, 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up
      visits. Only OCT testing will be performed at all follow-up visits. Both groups will be
      re-evaluated for safety at 12 and 24 months.
