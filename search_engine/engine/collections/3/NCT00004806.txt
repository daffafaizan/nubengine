    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene complexed
      with lipid is administered intranasally to the right inferior turbinate. Lipid without CFTR
      is administered to the left nostril as a control.

      Cohorts of 3 patients are given successively lower doses of CFTR, each dose complexed with
      500 micrograms of lipid.

      Patients are followed at days 2-12, 15, and 21, then every 3-4 days for 3 weeks, every 2-3
      weeks for 10 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter.
