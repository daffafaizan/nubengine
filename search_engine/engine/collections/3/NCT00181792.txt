      adolescents, and as theoretical considerations suggest that ADHD and tobacco use may share
      common underlying mechanisms, the proposed study looks to examine the association between
      smoking and ADHD. Since both ADHD and smoking are known to be familial disorders, one
      approach to examine the nature of the association between the two disorders is to conduct a
      familial risk analysis comparing ADHD youth who smoke and ADHD youth who don't smoke. Another
      approach is to conduct a genetic study, to identify candidate genes associated with nicotine
      abuse and dependence in ADHD youth and relatives.

      This study includes:

        1. assessment of psychopathology and substance use/dependence,

        2. assessment of the family environment, and

        3. assessment of molecular genetics in 100 families with at least one child (proband)
           between the ages of 12-17 with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD.
