measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorptionspectrometry .an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitatesquantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, includingurine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorptionspectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit directmeasurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary toemploy a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate thenickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine andhuman b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . therecovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a rangefrom 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulinaveraged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 .the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a rangefrom 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 .the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleicacids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the meanconcentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugalsupernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. ofrna, with a range from 21 to 39 .measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serumproteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and bycold-ethanol precipitation . the highest concentrations of nickel werefound in preparations of serum b-globulins .
