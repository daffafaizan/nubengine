    
      Proximal deep venous thrombosis of a lower limb was defined as any venous thrombosis
      involving the ilio-femoral and/or femoro-popliteal axes, with or without cava thrombosis or
      distal DVT.

      A DVT was assumed provoked, as recommended by AFSSAPS (2009) and ACCP (2012), when there was
      a major transient risk factor (surgery, prolonged immobilization â‰¥3 days, lower limb
      fracture) in the last three months, or a persistent risk factor (Antiphospholipid syndrome,
      active cancer). In case of absence of at least one of these factors, DVT was considered
      unprovoked.

      A DVT was supposed recent when there was no known DVT in the patient medical history.

      The association with a Pulmonary Embolism was assessed by the presence of PE diagnosis in the
      medical report. It had to be diagnosed following the ESC guidelines, with a thoracic CT scan
      and/or a V/Q lung scan.

      In this study, we analysed the shear wave's velocity (expressed in m/s).

      Acquisitions were obtained during the venous ultrasound realised for the diagnosis of DVT.
      All measures were made on the same ultrasonic device, with the ShearWave module.
