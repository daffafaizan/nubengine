      load seen in the first several months after acute infection. These beneficial CTL responses
      diminish with disease progression and cannot be recovered with antiretroviral therapy alone.
      Recent studies suggest a vaccine may help restore CTL responses. This study tests the
      effectiveness of the C4-V3 vaccine, a synthetic peptide vaccine representing 4 epitopes from
      HIV gp120, including an HLA B7-restricted CTL epitope. Administering IL-12, an
      immunostimulatory cytokine, in conjunction with C4-V3 may enhance HIV-1 specific immune
      responses and global immune function.

      All patients continue their antiretroviral regimen during the study. Twelve patients are
      assigned equally to 1 of 3 cohorts; all patients receive 4 doses of C4-V3. Cohort 1 receives
      C4-V3 alone; once all 4 patients have received 2 doses and completed 8 weeks of treatment,
      toxicity data are reviewed. Barring serious adverse events, 4 patients are enrolled in Cohort
      2 to receive C4-V3 plus a low dose of IL-12 near the vaccine injection sites. Once all 4
      patients have received 2 doses of C4-V3/IL-12 and completed 8 weeks of treatment, toxicity
      data are reviewed. Barring serious adverse events, 4 patients are enrolled in Cohort 3 to
      receive C4-V3 plus a higher dose of IL-12 administered as above. [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/1/00:
      Twenty patients are assigned equally to 1 of 5 cohorts; all patients receive 4 doses of
      C4-V3. Cohort 1 receives C4-V3 alone; once all 4 patients have received 2 doses and completed
      6 weeks of treatment, toxicity data are reviewed. Barring serious adverse events, 4
      additional patients are enrolled in Cohort 2 to receive C4-V3 plus a low dose (dose level 1)
      of IL-12. Barring serious adverse events, 4 additional patients are enrolled in Cohort 3 to
      receive C4-V3 plus a higher dose (dose level 2) of IL-12. Barring serious adverse events, 4
      additional patients are enrolled in Cohort 4 to receive C4-V3 plus a higher dose (dose level
      3) of IL-12. Barring serious adverse events, 4 patients are enrolled in Cohort 5 to receive
      C4-V3 plus a higher dose (dose level 4) of IL-12.] Patients are followed for safety
      evaluations and changes in viral load through Week 48. If toxicity related to C4-V3 or IL-12
      persists through Week 48, the affected patients are followed until resolution of the
      toxicity.
