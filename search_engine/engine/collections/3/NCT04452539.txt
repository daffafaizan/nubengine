      influences, but also different genetic regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as nuclear
      facto kapp B. it is also know that cardiac surgery, especially under cardiopulmonary bypass,
      is associated with a major inflammatory response. This response is even more marked in
      pediatric cardiac surgery. The investigators hypothesise that there is a gender influence on
      mortality and major morbidity in paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The
      investigators will do a retrospective cohort study, analysing the local database of all
      paediatric cardiac surgery cases from jan 2006 to dec 2019. Primary outcome will be any
      difference in mortality and /or major morbidity according to gender.

      Statistical analysis:

      The investigators will use a propensity score on 11 pre-operative variables clinically judged
      relevant. Both group will be matched until a absolute standardised difference < 15% is
      obtained. This type of matching, contrary to a P value, is independent of sample size.
      Variables will be presented as mean, standard deviation or percentage for frequency
      distributions. After propensity score matching, logistic regressions will be performed on
      binary variables and linear regressions on continuous variables. A Bonferroni correction will
      be used for multiple comparisons.
