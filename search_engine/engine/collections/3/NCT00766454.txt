    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the association between the genotype for 4 metabolic enzymes (e.g., CYP1A1,
           GSTM, GSTT, and GSTP) in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer that play key roles in
           the metabolism of environmental human carcinogens and the risk of breast cancer
           development.

      OUTLINE: Urine and blood samples are collected for DNA, mutation, and polymorphism analysis.
      The biological samples may be stored and used for future research.

      Patients complete a Baseline Questionnaire to collect basic risk/exposure information,
      including demographic factors (e.g., age, weight, height, and body mass index),
      menstrual/reproductive history, medical history, medication use, smoking history, alcohol
      consumption, exposure to chest x-ray, and family history of breast cancer in first-degree
      relatives. Patients also complete a Second Hand Smoke Questionnaire to collect information on
      cigarette smoking history and second hand smoke exposure and a Food Frequency Questionnaire
      to collect information on the frequency of use of specific fruits and vegetables (e.g.,
      cruciferous vegetables) and to estimate usual dietary intake of 33 nutrients during the past
      year (e.g., total fat, saturated fat, oleic fat, linoleic fat, carbohydrates, protein,
      vitamins [e.g., A, B1, B2, niacin, B6, folate, C, and E], minerals [e.g., calcium, magnesium,
      iron, and zinc], electrolytes [e.g., sodium and potassium], and dietary fiber). Patients'
      medical charts are also reviewed to collect information on age, gender, ethnic background,
      medical history, and medical care.
