      many countries of the world. The investigators hypothesize that since the number of hospital
      applications expected to be decreased due to trauma during the COVID-19 period, the level of
      hospital trauma applications changed. Thus, the aim of this multi-centered study is to guide
      for the approach, organization, diagnosis and treatment of the patients admitted due to
      trauma to emergency department during the pandemic period.
