      aims to investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF
      intervention called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke (AIS) The primary endpoint is the safety and compliance of 4 weeks of
      TRF in AIS patients.

      The secondary endpoints are the efficacy of 4 weeks of TRF compared to normal eating (NE) on
      plasma and imaging biomarkers and functional outcome at 3 months post-stroke.

      This study will determine whether compared to NE control:

        1. TRF (16 hours fasting daily) is safe and well-tolerated in patients with AIS.

        2. TRF improves functional outcome compared to NE in AIS patients. (3) TRF decreases plasma
           pro-inflammatory cytokines including metallopeptidase (MMP)-9, interleukin (IL)-6, and
           tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in plasma compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.

      (4) TRF improves diffusion tensor imaging on MRI at 3 months post stroke compared to baseline
      and NE in AIS patients.

      (5) TRF changes plasma exosome components, metabolomics and lipidomics compared to baseline
      and NE in AIS patients.
