      starting to be incorporated into clinical practice; however, the translational use of these
      biomarkers has not been validated at the 'omics' level. This is strikingly the case in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which represent the most common primary malignant tumor of the
      liver. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been widely used as a diagnostic marker of HCC; however,
      according to international guidelines (AASLD, EASL), AFP is unsufﬁciently sensitive or
      unsufﬁciently speciﬁc for use in a screening assay. Aberrantly methylated DNA sequences
      frequently occur in tumors and are detected in the circulation of cancer patients by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). SEPT9 is a significant epi-driver gene in liver
      carcinogenesis. The SEPT9 gene is a key regulator of cell division and tumor suppressor whose
      hypermethylation is associated with carcinogenesis. SEPT9 is involved in the onset of rat
      hepatocarcinogenesis and SEPT9-promoter hypermethylation was reported in HCC in man. SEPT9
      expression is turned on in cells throughout the body and absent or diminished by aberrant
      promoter methylation in several types of cancer. Through an initial proof-of-concept pilot
      study from France and an independent replication study from Germany, we showed that the
      circulating cell-free DNA methylation-based epigenetic biomarker mSEPT9 is a promising plasma
      biomarker for diagnosing HCC in cirrhotic patients. The aim of the SEPT9-CROSS study is to
      confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the biomarker in a large-scale study of 440 cirrhotic
      patients recruited in the Nancy University Hospital.
