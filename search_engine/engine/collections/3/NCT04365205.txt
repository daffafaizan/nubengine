      non-severe asthma and 20 non-asthmatic controls. Inclusion visit will include written
      informed consent, asthma questionnaire, clinical examination, lung function testing, prick
      tests and assessment of airway remodeling using CT scan and MRI. Bronchial specimens from all
      subjects will be obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Airway remodeling will be evaluated by
      morphological analysis. After BSM cell culture, BSM cells function will be assessed in vitro
      in the absence or presence of benralizumab using proliferation (BrdU) and chemotactism
      experiments, ELISA, RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction ) and electronic microscopy.
