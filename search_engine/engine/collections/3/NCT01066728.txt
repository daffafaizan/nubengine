    
      1. To discover whether, in the nursery setting, continuous administration of a low
           concentration of inhaled CO2 (0.8%) for a prolonged period (3 days) can make breathing
           in preterm infants more regular with less apneic time than that observed with
           theophylline.

        2. To discover whether inhalation of low CO2 decreases apneas, particularly prolonged
           apneas (>20 seconds), more effectively than theophylline.

        3. To discover whether short term (during hospitalization) and long term (2 years) adverse
           side effects are less pronounced with CO2 than with theophylline.
