      learning techniques to online methods in order to prevent transmission of the disease. Misr
      International University (MIU) has an established online learning system that has been used
      together with face-to-face classes. However, shifting all courses in all the faculties to the
      online mode is a new experience that needs to be assessed to allow for future improvement
      plans.

      Aim: To assess and compare the satisfaction and perceptions of full-time teaching staff and
      undergraduate students regarding online learning during COVID-19 crisis.

      Method: An online anonymous questionnaire will be distributed to all Misr International
      University (MIU) students and staff members. The total number of students is 8679 and the
      total number of staff members regardless of their academic title is 530. The questionnaire
      will be validated by three experts and piloting will be performed on a sample of
      participants. The questionnaire consists of five sections: Demographics, satisfaction with
      online teaching and learning methods, knowledge, and perception of COVID-19.
