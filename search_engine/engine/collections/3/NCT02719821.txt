      Patient-reported outcomes:

      Participants will complete self-report measures prior to HSCT and 9 (mid-intervention) and 18
      weeks (post-intervention) post-HSCT. The sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression modules
      of the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) will be the
      primary outcomes. The investigators will compare performance with more established
      instruments the investigation team has previously used: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),
      Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS)
      depression subscale.

      Actigraphy:

      The Actiwatch-2 (Philips Respironics), a wrist-worn actigraphy device, will be used to
      objectively quantify circadian rest-activity patterns over a continuous 7-day period using
      1-minute sampling epochs at three time points: prior to HSCT and 9 (mid-intervention) and 18
      weeks (post-intervention) post-HSCT. The following indices will be calculated: mesor (mean
      activity level), amplitude (rhythm height), acrophase (time of day the rhythm peaks), and
      R-squared (robustness of the rhythm). Participants will complete a concurrent nightly sleep
      log, and traditional sleep parameters will be calculated from both the logs and actigraphy,
      including total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset
      (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). For daytime activity, calibration thresholds will be used
      to aggregate activity data into steps and minutes spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and
      vigorous activity
