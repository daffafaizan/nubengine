      testing a combination of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine in an Environmental Exposure Unit
      setting once inside and once outside the grass pollen season. An equivalent outcome would
      validate the ECC for testing anti-allergic substances during the pollen season in the future.
      Up to now these studies have been restricted to the pollen-free season.
