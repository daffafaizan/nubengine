    
      This study is a pilot feasibility study in 30 healthy, preoperative children and young adults
      undergoing major surgery with high risk for chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) to characterize
      the brain metabolite status of the Anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) and insula in
      pre-surgical adolescents and to understand the relationship between metabolite levels and
      CPSP. We will also examine whether neurochemical tone in these regions is related to resting
      state functional connectivity with other brain regions. Correlations between differentially
      methylated CpG sites in genes enriching gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Dopamine-DARPP-32
      pathways and Glu/GABA levels in insula/ACC will be analyzed.
