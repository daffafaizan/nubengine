        -  Determine complete response rate in post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients
           with severe veno-occlusive disease of the liver treated with defibrotide.

        -  Determine the minimal effective dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess toxicity and adverse side effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. All patients initially receive the same
      dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on day 1. On day 2, patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 doses of defibrotide.

        -  Arm I: On days 2-14, patients receive a lower dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every
           6 hours.

        -  Arm II: On days 2-14, patients receive a higher dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours
           every 6 hours.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
