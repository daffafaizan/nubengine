    
      The eight (8) Capnography CO2 Sampling Filterlines (CCSF) have different designs for
      obtaining a gas sample for CO2 measurement and also for delivering supplemental oxygen (O2).

      In this study awake, healthy volunteers will evaluate the 8 CCSF (Capnography CO2 Sampling
      Filterline) to determine their performance variability in providing a representative exhaled
      CO2 sample for measurement on the Capnostream 35 dual parameter monitor during scripted
      activities of closed mouth/open mouth breathing during both high and low respiration rate
      with supplemental oxygen delivery at 5lpm.
