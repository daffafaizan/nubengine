    
      Prior to the initiation of Nebivolol and after 10 weeks of Nebivolol therapy, subjects
      underwent a resting 2D echocardiogram including routine sampling of mitral valve (MV) inflow
      and LV tissue Doppler imaging as well as a symptom limited exercise treadmill stress test
      with echocardiographic imaging. Primary endpoints were 1) changes in systolic blood pressure
      before and after 10 weeks of treatment and 2) changes in exercise capacity as determined by
      exercise duration and metabolic equivalent (MET) level before and after treatment. Secondary
      endpoints were changes in exercise hemodynamics and Doppler echocardiographic parameters of
      LV systolic and diastolic function and quality of life before and after 10 weeks of nebivolol
      treatment. Subjects completed an EuroQol (EQ-SD) Quality of Life questionnaire which is a
      standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol group as a simple general
      measure of health at baseline and at conclusion of the 10 week trial period.
