      Evaluations") the patient has to make decisions for non-alcoholic and against alcoholic
      drinks. Therefore there are several scenarios, which are supposed to let the patient
      integrate these choices into a realistic, everyday life, setting and help the patient to
      maintain abstinence in upcoming "high risk situations". It has been developed as an add-on
      therapy to increase the overall outcome.

      Participating patients with alcohol-use disorder are to receive an initial screening
      including questionnaires and neuropsychological tests. Then the patients receive three
      training sessions with SALIENCE each week.

      After three weeks there is another examination. After these three weeks, there is a 90 day
      period in which there are online follow-ups every two weeks to assess the craving and relapse
      of the participants. After the 90 day period there is a third examination analog to the first
      and the second one.
