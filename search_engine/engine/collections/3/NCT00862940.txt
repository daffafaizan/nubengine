      brain atrophy compared to placebo in patients with AD (moderate severity) over a 1-year
      period. This was a multinational, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (20 mg memantine). The study also included secondary
      imaging, cognitive and behavioural measures.
