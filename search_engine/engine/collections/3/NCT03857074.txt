      exposure to low intensity green light, and (2) presence or absence of neurologic/systemic
      symptoms referable to exposure of the pre-selected duration, intensity, and band of green
      light.

      Our primary aim is to determine whether prolonged exposure (120 minutes) to a narrow band of
      green light (520-540 nm) at low intensities (1-10 cd/m2) alters the pattern of electrical
      activity in the cortex of epilepsy patients.

      The primary outcome measure for this aim will be the fraction of patients in which the number
      of epileptiform discharges (spikes or sharp waves) decrease, per recording, in response to
      green light exposure, as determined by spike frequency detected via scalp EEG before and
      after green light exposure.

      The investigators anticipate that the primary outcome measures of safety and tolerability
      will not differ from the previously established measures of green light exposure for migraine
      (Noseda et al. 2016). The investigators will use only low intensities (1-10 cd/m2) of green
      light which is well tolerated in adults and children (Main et al. 2000). In addition, given
      limited experience with conventional green light exposure in epilepsy, the investigators
      predict that post-exposure to green light, patients will have an improvement on the
      post-exposure EEG (decreased spike frequency).
