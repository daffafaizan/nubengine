      men who were diagnosed with urethritis were randomized to one of three study arms:

      Standard partner referral (PR) - index patients were instructed to tell their partners that
      they need to go to a clinic for STI evaluation and treatment.

      Booklet-enhanced partner referral (BEPR) - index patients were given a wallet-sized booklet
      containing 4 tear-out cards with information for the partner and treatment guidelines for the
      providers that would see the partners. The partners could then present this card at a clinic
      to help the clinician better treat them. If index patients had more than 4 partners, they
      were given additional booklets.

      Patient delivered partner treatment (PDPT) - index patients were given packages containing 2
      gram metronidazole (for TV patients) or azithromycin 1 gram and cefixime 400 mg (for
      urethritis patients) for up to 4 identified sex partners. When cefixime was no longer
      available, ciprofloxacin 500 mg was used. These packages contained written instructions about
      how to take the medication, warnings about side effects and a nurse's pager number to call if
      there were any questions or if the partner encountered any problems. All medications were
      distributed in containers with childproof caps and the partner's initial and birthdates were
      written on the bottle. This was a requirement of the Louisiana State Pharmacy Board. Names
      were not documented on the index patient's study or medical records.
