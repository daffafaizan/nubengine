      inherent to small samples as patients will become their own controls. After a baseline
      assessment, patients will be randomized to receive either botulinum toxin or an equal amount
      and distribution of normal saline (placebo). Patients will undergo reassessment of function
      at one and four weeks after the initial and second session of injections. The second
      procedure will occur, using the opposite treatment arm (BotoxÂ® or saline placebo), three
      months after the first injection session. Doses of levodopa, dopaminergic agonists, and
      antidyskinetic drugs if applicable, will be kept constant throughout the study. All study
      assessments will be carried out at the time treatment is expected to cause the greatest
      severity of LID.
