      deemed an unfair assessment of its potential to impact public health. This is due to
      systematic review evidence that reports evaluations of exercise referral interventions that
      are not evidence-based or underpinned by behaviour change theory.

      This evaluation is the third phase of a project that aims to co-develop (Phase 1), pilot
      (phase 2) and evaluate (phase 3) an evidence-based exercise referral scheme. This approach is
      underpinned by the Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions.

      Through co-development work with a multidisciplinary group of researchers and local
      stakeholders and subsequent pilot work, it is hypothesised that the co-developed,
      evidence-based intervention will have improved chances of implementation success, and
      therefore, clinical effectiveness.
