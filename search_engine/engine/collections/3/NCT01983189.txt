      criteria for autism and have clinically prominent repetitive behaviors. The investigator will
      apply low frequency rTMS for 20 minutes 5 times a week for 3 weeks targeting the area of
      brain which was involved in repetitive behaviors. The investigator will obtain clinical
      measures of repetitive behaviors as well as social functioning pre and post treatment. As a
      control and a cross-over condition , we will stimulate other area of brain which has nothing
      to do with repetitive behaviors but may improve social functioning in autism spectrum
      disorders. In addition to r TMS we will perform a pre and post treatment perfusion functional
      MRI and obtain TMS measure of excitability of brain.
