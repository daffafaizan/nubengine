      Subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the following groups:

        -  Group I: mix of the four bioactive compounds (bacopa, lycopene, astaxanthin and vitamin
           B12), once a day for 8 weeks per os;

        -  Group II: placebo, once a day for 8 weeks per os.

      The study is double blind. Neither the study staff at clinical sites (Investigators, nurses,
      pharmacist) nor the subject was aware of the treatment assigned.

      Each participant attended 4 visits over a total period of about 9 weeks.
