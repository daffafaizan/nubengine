      without apatinib as induction therapy for the treatment of head and neck adenoid cystic
      carcinoma. It is a randomized phase II clinical trial with single phase and 2 experimental
      arms. Participants will be randomized to arm 1, receiving apatinib (0.5g, daily) for 6 weekly
      followed by particle radiotherapy (proton: 56 GyE/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15 GyE/5 Fx for boost);
      arm 2: particle radiotherapy alone (proton: 56 GyE/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15 GyE/5 Fx for
      boost). The short term response will be evaluated using RECIST criteria. And the acute and
      late toxicities will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE v4.03.
