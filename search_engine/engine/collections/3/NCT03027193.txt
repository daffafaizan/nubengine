    
      This is a phase I, open label, dose escalation trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity
      of the ChAdOx2 and MVA HAV vaccines against Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis
      (MAP) in healthy volunteers

      There will be 5 study groups with a total of 28 volunteers. ChAdOx2 HAV will be administered
      intramuscularly as a single vaccination at 3 different doses: 5x10^9 vp (group 1), 2.5x10^10
      (group 2) and 5x10^10 vp (group 3) and as a prime vaccine in group 6 (prime/boost group). MVA
      HAV will be administered intramuscularly as a single vaccination at 2 different doses: 5x10^7
      pfu (group 4), 2x10^8 pfu (group 5) and as a boost vaccine in group 6 (prime/boost group)

      Vaccination of groups will be sequential from Group 1 to Group 6 with interim safety reviews
      prior to dose escalation

      Volunteers will be recruited and undergo screening visits, vaccination and clinic visits
      post-vaccination at the trial site. Blood samples for safety and immunology purposes will be
      performed on the visit time points indicated in the schedule of attendances.

      Safety will be assessed by the frequency, incidence and nature of adverse events and serious
      adverse events arising during the study.
