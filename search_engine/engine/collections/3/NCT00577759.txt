      of significant morbidity and mortality, including coronary heart disease, hypertension,
      cancer, stroke, diabetes, and respiratory dysfunction. One solution to decreasing unhealthy
      behaviors would be to better integrate primary care providers with community resources,
      including community and public health organizations that already have the capacity and
      expertise to deliver effective interventions. This project is a randomized trial to evaluate
      different practice-level interventions to link practices to community resources to decrease
      unhealthy behaviors.
