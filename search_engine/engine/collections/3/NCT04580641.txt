      attacks, and even between attacks, especially when migraine frequency is high, many subjects
      with migraine present with photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia or allodynia. These symptoms
      are though to correspond to central sensitization and can be found in animal models of
      migraine (Boyer et al., Pain 2017; Dallel et al., Cephalalgia 2018).

      These 4 symptoms have been studied separately in previous studies but to date, there is no
      overall questionnaire evaluating these 4 sub-types of hypersensitivity. The investigators
      have constituted a questionnaire based on previous validated questionnaires that have been
      translated into French (Lipton et al., 2008 for cutaneous allodynia; Choi et al., 2009 for
      photophobia), a previous questionnaire validated in French (Khalfa et al, 2002 for
      phonophobia) and created a few questions for each of the 4 symptoms, including osmophobia.
