    
      The purpose of this study is to create a prospective cohort to study volume, radiomic and
      anthropometric characteristics. For that 60 patients will be included before treatment by
      radiotherapy.

      Patients will benefit from a detailed pre-therapeutic imaging assessment with trimodal
      acquisitions (CT/MRI/PET with 18F-FDG) before radiotherapy and in radiotherapeutic position
      according to the "CRAI" (for "Centre Régional de thérapie Assistée par l'Imagerie")
      acquisition protocol, innovative in trimodality.

      This initial imaging assessment will be supplemented by a whole-body biphoton absorptiometry
      which will be used as a reference examination for certain anthropometric parameters. This
      examination will be carried out at the Rouen University Hospital in the Rheumatology
      Department
