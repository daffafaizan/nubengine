      Patients with Severe Sickle Cell Disease (BMT CTN 1503) (STRIDE)" (NCT02766465) will also
      participate in the biorepository portion of the study. The purpose of the biorepository is to
      examine DNA to learn if certain genes predict who will have serious complications of sickle
      cell disease. The STRIDE Biorepository is an optional substudy available to individuals
      enrolled in the main study, who are at a participating site. Participants in the main study
      who consent to take part in the biorepository will have blood drawn at the Baseline Visit.
      This blood will be shipped to Emory University in Atlanta Georgia and stored for future
      research.
