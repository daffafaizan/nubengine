    
      This study will assess the accuracy of four of the best-selling optical heart rate monitors
      when worn by cardiac rehabilitation patients.

      During testing, each subject will wear:

        1. Two different optical heart rate monitors (one on each wrist)

        2. A Polar chest-strap based monitor

        3. ECG leads

      The types of wrist-worn heart rate monitors assigned to each subject will be randomly
      assigned.

      The location (left or right wrist) will also be randomly assigned.

      Heart rate will be assessed using each of the 4 monitors with the subject on the exercise
      machines under each of the following conditions:

        1. Pre-exercise

        2. Treadmill: at 3, 5 and 7 min.

        3. Stationary Cycle: at 3, 5 and 7 min.
