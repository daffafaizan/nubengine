      program in youth with the aim to identify the most effective programs that can improve
      psychological well-being, especially reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and improving
      self-esteem. This study targets participants aged 9 to 30 years and included in an education
      program (from 4th Grade to undergraduate university or college). The investigators propose to
      perform a prospective, randomized, clinical study involving participants with mood disorders
      (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)
      for medical coding: ICD-10-CM F32.9), anxiety (ICD-10-CM F41.9), specific learning
      disabilities (ADHD hyperactivity (ICD-10-CM F90.2), dyslexia-dyscalculia-dyspraxia (ICD-10-CM
      F81.0, F81.2, F81.81)) and healthy subjects equally distributed for confounding variables
      (age, gender, subclinical or clinical depressive symptoms). The participants (ambulatory or
      inpatients) will be enrolled either in an experimental, intensive and structured aerobic
      exercise regime or in a active control activity of stretching and relaxation conducted in
      parallel. The effects of this program will be assessed for i) psychological symptoms, using
      questionnaires, ii) cognitive function, particularly attention skills and executive
      functions, in neuropsychological tasks, and iii) physical abilities (through physical
      testing). To investigate the therapeutic value of exercise in the prevention of depressive
      and anxiety symptoms and in the treatment of mood disorders in the young student is a
      necessity imposed by the current outbreak of depression among adolescents and young people at
      school. To promote the exercise medicine based on the level of evidence in this specific
      domain, rigorous experimental studies must be performed. Depending on the results, a medical
      imaging will be proposed to participants at the end of the behavioral study. This will be a
      functional magnetic resonance imaging in physiological activation condition (performing a
      behavioral task such as a Stroop task suited to the subject's age), performed before and
      after intensive physical training.
