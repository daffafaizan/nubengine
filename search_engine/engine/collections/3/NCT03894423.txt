      information to develop clinically applicable tools for meaningful per-vessel
      revascularization decisions. The decisions will be based on quantitative lesion-specific
      ischemia and viability and flow simulations. These will be based on CT anatomy enhanced with
      a function for prediction of hemodynamic improvement after CABG.

      Aim 1: Predict restoration of myocardial perfusion from coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
      The investigators will perform cardiac CT before and after CABG and measure absolute changes
      in myocardial perfusion as the functional outcome of CABG. The investigators will investigate
      clinical, surgical and imaging variables in association with post-CABG perfusion improvement
      on a per-vessel and per-patient level.

      Aim 2: Non-invasively quantify vessel-specific ischemia for meaningful CABG decisions.

      The investigators will develop and validate tools for assessment of vessel-specific ischemia
      and viability. The investigators will assess the potential impact of CT guided CABG by
      comparing the per-vessel need for grafting with standard care.

      Aim 3: Predict CABG benefit through multi-parameter flow simulations Hypothesis: Integration
      of myocardial perfusion and viability can improve flow simulation models to predict CABG
      outcome. The investigators will develop new computational fluid dynamics models enriched with
      functional parameters and explore the potential of virtual grafting to improve hemodynamic
      outcomes.
