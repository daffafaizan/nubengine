      I. Determine the radiographic response rate (complete response and partial response) in
      patients with refractory adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated
      with FR901228 (depsipeptide).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the median time to progression and progression-free survival of patients treated
      with this drug.

      II. Determine the grade 3 and 4 toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 6.5-10
      months.
