    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To comprehensively define the safety profile of ch14.18 when administered with cytokines
      and isotretinoin in high-risk neuroblastoma patients after autologous stem cell transplant
      (ASCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further describe and refine the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)
      estimates and baseline characteristics for subjects receiving chl4.18 + cytokines +
      isotretinoin.

      II. To further describe the safety and toxicity of chl4.18 + cytokines + isotretinoin with
      focus on: a) number of courses delivered per patient; b) number of dose reductions or
      stoppage (ch14.18 and/or interleukin [IL]-2 [aldesleukin]); and c) number of toxic deaths.

      III. To further describe the immune reconstitution of patients following ASCT, based on
      laboratory data obtained just prior to, during, and after treatment with this regimen.

      IV. To obtain correlative laboratory data to evaluate and describe mechanisms related to
      response, toxicity of immune activation, and allergic phenomena.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days
      0-13 of courses 1, 3, and 5; monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 IV over 10 hours on days 3-6 of
      courses 1, 3, and 5 and on days 7-10 of courses 2 and 4; and isotretinoin orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 11-24 of course 1, on days 14-27 of courses 2, 4, and 6, and on days
      10-23 of courses 3 and 5. Patients also receive aldesleukin IV continuously on days 0-3 and
      on days 7-10 of courses 2 and 4. Treatment repeats every 24-32 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.
