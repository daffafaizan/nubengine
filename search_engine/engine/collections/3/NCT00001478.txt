      tomographic (PET) scans with H(2)(15)O to measure global and local differences in cerebral
      blood flow during a passive introspection task. Patients receive repeated scans while in
      different mood states and while participating in placebo controlled therapeutic trials as
      described by separate protocols. Global and regional cerebral blood flow is correlated with
      data obtained from participation in other protocols, which include clinical (life charting
      course of illness parameters, mood and anxiety ratings, medication response data, and
      psychological test performance) and biochemical (levels of medications, monoamines and
      peptides in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid) measures.
