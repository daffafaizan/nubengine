      Subjects will be randomized to Group A or Group B (1:1).

        -  Group A: 0,63ml NaCl will be used to reconstitute toxin in the vial. 0,05mL will be
           injected (equal to a dose of 10s.U.)

        -  Group B: 1,25ml NaCl will be used to reconstitute toxin in the vial. 0,1 mL will be
           injected (equal to a dose of 10s.U.).

      The two different reconstitution volumes (each containing a dose of 10s.U. botulinum toxin A)
      will be compared as described under objectives.
