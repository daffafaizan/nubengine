    
      Zintevir belongs to a new class of anti-HIV drugs, the integrase inhibitors. The HIV-1 virus
      uses the protein integrase to incorporate its genetic material into the infected host cell.
      Integrase inhibitors block integrase and may stop replication of the HIV-1 virus.

      In this open-label, Phase I/II study, 3 groups of HIV-positive patients (12 patients total)
      receive escalating doses of intravenous zintevir for 14 consecutive days.
