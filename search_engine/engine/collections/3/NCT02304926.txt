      months. A total of 42 hyperlipidemic patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: one
      received simvastatin (40 mg/day) and the other received ezetimibe (10 mg/day) for 4 weeks,
      after which both groups were administered combined therapy for an additional 4-week period.
      Lipid profile, lipoprotein subfractions of LDL and HDL, inflammatory, oxidative stress and
      endothelial function parameters were evaluated.
