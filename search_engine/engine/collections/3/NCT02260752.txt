      the US. We anticipate recruitment to last approximately 24 months. Sites will consent
      interested patients and have them complete a patient contact information form to be used to
      contact the patient for telephone interviews. Following informed consent, the site will
      collect clinical information and several patient-reported outcomes scales, including the
      Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL), the Menopausal Rating Scale,
      and the EQ-5D, a standardized measure of general health outcomes.

      In year 01 of this study, among patients receiving a procedure to treat their UF, 1000 will
      be asked to provide two blood samples: the first at time of enrollment (before the procedure)
      and the second at 12 months after the procedure. Samples will be evaluated for ovarian
      reserve via a blood assay measurement of anti-mullerian hormone.

      Additionally, for patients who have a procedure to treat their UF, they will have a routine
      clinic follow-up visit, sometime between 6 - 12 weeks post procedure. Additional clinical
      data will be collected at this time.

      For patients who are treated medically, there will be no further study-related clinic visits.
      Follow-up will occur exclusively by telephone.

      All consented patients will complete telephone interviews at approximately 12, 24, and 36
      months following the initial procedure. It is anticipated that patients enrolled during the
      first study year will complete a maximum of three years of follow-up. However, if additional
      funds become available, the investigators plan to extend the follow-up of enrolled patients
      to five years.
