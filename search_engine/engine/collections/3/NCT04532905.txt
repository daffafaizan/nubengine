      exercises like: dumbbell bent row over, dumbbell deadlift, and dumbbell lunge using oxygen
      consumption as a dependent variable while blood pressure, heart rate, blood lactate, body
      mass index, body weight, body height, body fat composition, muscle strength, and surface
      electromyography of selected muscles as independent variables. The previous literature
      measures energy expenditure for various lower and upper body resistance training exercises
      but it devoid for dumbbell bent row over, dumbbell deadlift, and dumbbell lunge energy
      expenditure models. The subject will come for 5 times clinical trial for total 10 days. After
      the completion of this study, the participant will know about their energy expenditure during
      included strength training exercises.

      The study will include total 30 participants; 15 normal healthy young individuals and 15
      athletes with regular resistance exercise training experience. The experiments will be
      divided into 2 stages. The first stage experiment will be conducted in 10 young individuals
      into two groups. The group one will include 5 normal healthy individuals without resistance
      exercise training experience and group two will include 5 individuals with regular resistance
      training experience. The second stage will proceed more 20 young participants (10
      participants in each group) to determine the resistance exercise energy expenditure.
