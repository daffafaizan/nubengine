    
      -  In this randomized controlled trial, the investigator will compare the incidence of
           postoperative delirium after total knee arthroplasty between 3 intraoperative sedation
           regimens including (1) propofol-fentanyl (2) dexmedetomidine -fentanyl (3) fentanyl
           alone

        -  Anesthesia techniques include spinal anesthesia and adductor canal block for
           postoperative analgesia. Sedation will be provide per group assignment.

        -  After performance of regional anesthesia, sedation protocols will be used as followed:
           (1) target-controlled infusion of Propofol to achieve MOAA/S of 3-4 (2) incremental
           titration of Dexmedetomidine to achieve MOAA/S of 3-4 (3) supplemental fentanyl for
           anxiolysis.

        -  Delirium will be screened by trained physicians, registered nurses every 8 hours
           postoperatively with validated Thai-version CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment
           Method-Intensive Care Unit) until patient discharge.

        -  Serum Interleukins (IL-1, IL-6) Tumor necrosis factor-Alpha and S100B protein from
           preoperative period will be compared with serum from postoperative period between
           delirium and non-delirium group. The level of serum biomarkers will be acquired in a
           6-hour interval for 5 measurement points during the first postoperative day in the first
           12 participants. The subsequent participants will have 1 measurement of serum biomarker
           during the first postoperative day.

        -  Genetic profile for ApolipoproteinE genotype will be acquired and compared between
           delirium and non-delirium group.
