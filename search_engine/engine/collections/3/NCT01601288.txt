      conditions is important in the understanding of the disease process, clinical response to
      treatment, and prognosis. Pulmonary function testing is a very important aspect of clinical
      phenotyping in many respiratory conditions. Creating a database will enable us to study the
      various phenotypes within each respiratory condition. This will allow us to better understand
      each disease, with a view to provide personalized patient care targeted at their specific
      phenotype and hence better clinical outcomes.
