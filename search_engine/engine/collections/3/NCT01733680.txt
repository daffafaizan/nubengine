      Primary Aim: Assess the efficacy and adverse effects of amiloride in medication naive ADHD
      adults in a placebo controlled study. Hypothesis 1: Amiloride will reduce scores on our
      primary outcome measure, the Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Investigator
      Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) and on our secondary outcome, the ADHD specific Clinical Global
      Impressions (CGI) improvement scale. Hypothesis 2: Amiloride will be well tolerated and will
      have few side effects in adults with ADHD.

      Exploratory Aim 2: Assess effects of amiloride on ADHD-associated clinical features. We will
      also assess, in an exploratory manner, the effect of amiloride on two clinical features that
      are not well treated by current ADHD medications: deficits in emotional self-regulation
      (DESR) and executive function deficit (EFD). Hypothesis 3 predicts that amiloride treatment
      will reduce symptoms of DESR and of EFD.

      We will recruit 40 adults who are diagnosed with ADHD in a double blind placebo controlled
      study. 20 subjects will receive amiloride hydrochloride and 20 subjects will receive placebo
      for 8 weeks. Participation in the study requires subjects to meet with the physician for a
      screening visit, baseline visit and 8 additional weekly visits.
