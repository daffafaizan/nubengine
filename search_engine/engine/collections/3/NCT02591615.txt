      for patients with advanced NSCLC, only a minority of patients at this time will have a
      readily identifiable actionable molecular target. Furthermore, genotype-directed therapy has
      not been validated for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Therefore, the
      majority of patients with advanced NSCLC will continue to rely on standard platinum-based
      doublet chemotherapy. Given the plateau in effectiveness of this approach, novel treatment
      strategies are clearly warranted.
