      also for anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive
      disorder, premature ejaculation, post-traumatic stress disorder, and neuropathic pain.
      Despite being widely prescribed in the United States in men of reproductive age, the impact
      of antidepressants on fertility has not been extensively studied.

      After noticing worsened semen parameters in men on anti-depressants, the investigators
      performed the first prospective study to demonstrate a deleterious impact of selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) on sperm DNA integrity, which has been linked to
      reproductive outcomes. Further small studies have corroborated the negative impact of SSRIs
      on male fertility, as assessed by semen parameters and/or sperm DNA integrity.

      No studies have examined the impact of a newer, but similar, class of antidepressant - the
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Like SSRIs, SNRIs inhibit the reuptake of
      serotonin, but also act on norepinephrine. The use of SNRIs has increased recently due to
      their slightly improved efficacy profile when compared to SSRIs. Duloxetine is an SNRI and is
      one of the most commonly prescribed anti-depressants in the United States.

      The investigators are conducting this trial to determine whether or not the administration of
      duloxetine will result in a deterioration in sperm DNA fragmentation in healthy, fertile men.
