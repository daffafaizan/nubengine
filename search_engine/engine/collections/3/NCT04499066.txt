      of mothers, is one of the most common complications around childbirth and gradually have
      become global public health issues. However, little is known about the course of peripartum
      mental health problems and possible fluctuations, as well as related risk factors among
      Chinese women. In addition, there are no effective prediction and preventive strategies for
      postpartum depression. The Peripartum Mental Health Cohort Study in Guangzhou will collect
      the epidemiological, clinical information and biological specimens across pregnancy and
      childbirth to establish trajectory of peripartum mental health and identify the factors
      influencing the fluctuations and build a comprehensive prediction model of postpartum
      depression, as well as explore its adverse outcomes. This study would help to determine the
      timing of screening and target interventions to improve women's and their offspring's health.
