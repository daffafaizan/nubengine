      during microscopic ear and sinus surgeries with controversial results given the possible
      cardiovascular complication in case of systemic absorption,especially in vulnerable cardiac
      patients.Tranexamic acid (TXA) as an antifibrinolytic medication is used to treat or prevent
      excessive bleeding in significant trauma, surgery, tooth removal, or nasal bleeding,
      discovered by Japanese researchers. TXA, given either oral or intravenous, is a derivative of
      lysine amino acid; it acts reversibly on the lysine binding sites to block it on the
      plasminogen molecules. TXA consequently hinders the stimulation of plasminogen competitively,
      thus reduces its conversion into plasmin. Plasminogen is the enzyme that leads to the
      degradation of a fibrin clot, fibrinogen, and other plasma proteins, such as factors V and
      VIII. More than 95% of TXA intravenous administered dose eliminated unchanged through the
      urinary system. Twenty-four hours after intravenous administration of TXA has demonstrated
      accumulative excretion of approximately 90%, whereas only 3% is bound to plasminogen. TXA is
      minimally excreted in breast milk while it can freely cross the blood brain barrier and the
      placenta .
