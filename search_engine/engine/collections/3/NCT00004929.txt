      hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody, helper T
      cell, and/or cytotoxic T cell response against glycosylated MUC-2 in patients with
      progressive prostate cancer. II. Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in this
      patient population. III. Determine the effect of glycosylated MUC-2 antigen with KLH
      conjugate on the T cell response against MUC-2 and by skin testing in these patients. IV.
      Assess the post immunization changes in prostate specific antigen levels and other objective
      parameters of disease including radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccination with glycosylated MUC-2 antigen with keyhole limpet
      hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ on weeks 1-3, 7,
      15, and 27 for a total of 6 vaccinations. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or
      until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
