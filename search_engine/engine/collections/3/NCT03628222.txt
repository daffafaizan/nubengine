      chosen. Subject which has peripheral lung lesions (PLLs) detected by chest CT scan, requires
      biopsy diagnosis, and meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be included in this
      trial. Firstly physician determines the lesion biopsied, then the subject will be randomized
      to experimental or control group. The experimental group is treated with ENB guided
      transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB)(ENB-TBLB): Under ENB guidance, the location sensor reaches
      the edge of the lesion, and X-ray is used for actual distance confirmation, if physician
      determines the distance is enough for biopsy, TBLB will be conducted. The control group will
      be treated with TBLB using X-ray guidance.
