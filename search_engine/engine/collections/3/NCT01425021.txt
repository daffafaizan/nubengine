      identify any design features that put the implant at risk for early failure. Normally all
      implants are discarded. The investigators will collect the implants indicated for removal and
      if there are impressive findings the investigators will perform research on the implants,
      otherwise the implants will be discarded. All patients will be followed prospectively after
      informed consent is signed. The implants that are chosen for research will be assessed for
      implant wear and failure at a lab appropriate for evaluating the particular concern.
