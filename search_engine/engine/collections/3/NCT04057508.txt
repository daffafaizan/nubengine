    
      First part: Assessment of the muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) at baseline using
      microneurography performed on the superficial peroneal nerve.

      Second part: Acquisition of the MSNA signal during non-invasive VNS and apnea. Non-invasive
      VNS is performed using several frequencies of stimulation. Maximal and voluntaries apnea are
      performed at the end of the expiration.

      Continuous recording of the following parameters:

        -  non-invasive arterial blood pressure

        -  R-R interval

        -  electrocardiogram

        -  MSNA activity

        -  respiratory curve signal

        -  respiratory rate, oxygen saturation
