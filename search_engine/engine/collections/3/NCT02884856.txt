    
      -  Female and male observers will be analyzed.

        -  Human upper central incisors (UCI) will be shade matched to shade tabs from Vita
           Classical (VC) shade guide.

        -  The spectral reflectances from the four UCI and from the 16 VC shade tabs will be
           measured using a spectroradiometer (SP).

        -  Measurements will be performed over a gray background, inside a viewing booth and under
           D65 illuminant (diffuse/0ยบ geometry).

        -  CIELAB coordinates (L*, a* and b*) will be calculated according to CIE D65 illuminant
           and CIE 2ยบ Standard Observer.

        -  Two color difference metrics (CIELAB and CIEDE2000(2:1:1)) will be used to find the best
           option for each UCI, using VC shade guide.

        -  Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and McNemar test (ฮฑ=0.05).
