      specific, the anterior corneal surface is responsible for the anterior component of
      astigmatism fault (anterior astigmatism), while the posterior corneal surface and the lens
      are responsible for the posterior one (posterior astigmatism).

      Regarding our study, 74 refractive surgery candidates were recruited. Only one eye from each
      candidate was randomly enrolled in the study. Of them, 40 eyes underwent LASIK treatment (LG
      group), while 34 eyes underwent PRK treatment (PG group). The Allegretto Wave excimer laser
      (software version: 2.020 / WaveLight AG, Erlangen, Germany) was used for the ablation in all
      groups. Preoperatively, the ocular residual astigmatism (ORA) was calculated for each eye,
      according to which each astigmatism fault was characterized as primarily anterior or
      non-anterior.ORA is the vectorial value of astigmatism arising from non-anterior sources. Its
      amount on total astigmatism (R) is determined by the magnitude ratio ORA/R. Ratios below 1
      indicate primarily anterior astigmatism, while ratios above 1 indicate primarily non-anterior
      astigmatism. 20 LG eyes and 16 PG eyes presented primarily anterior astigmatism (LG-A and
      PG-A subgroups, respectively), while 20 LG eyes and 18 PG eyes demonstrated primarily
      non-anterior astigmatism (LG-NA and PG-NA subgroups, respectively). Postoperatively, vector
      analysis of astigmatism correction was conducted; The following indexes were calculated: a)
      Correction index (CI), b) Difference vector (DV) and c) Index of Success (IOS).
