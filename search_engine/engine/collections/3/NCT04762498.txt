      of pegloticase 16 mg dose with a possibility of potential additional dose (e.g., 24 or 32 mg)
      administered via IV Q4 Wks, co-administered with weekly doses of oral MTX, as measured by the
      sustained normalization of serum uric acid (sUA) to <6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time
      during Month 6 and the duration of sUA to <6 mg/dL over 24 week treatment period in adult
      participants with chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy.
