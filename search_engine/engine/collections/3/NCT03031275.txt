      screened for eligibility in January 2014. Patients living abroad (including non-Swedish
      citizens), patients treated for non-respiratory conditions, diseased patients and patients
      with a known pre-ECMO mental handicap were excluded.

      Eligible patients were contacted, and patients who agreed to participate gave their written
      informed consent. All studied patients underwent the same study protocol during a day at the
      hospital, including a clinical interview, MRI scan of the brain, HRCT scan of the thorax,
      pulmonary function testing, neuropsychological examination, walking test, self assessment
      questionnaires for quality of life, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.

      Patient charts were reviewed for relevant clinical information, including age, gender, ECMO
      mode (venovenous or venoarterial), time in hospital, on ECMO, non-ECMO ICU and on mechanical
      ventilation; preexisting diseases, blood gas values and ventilator settings before initiation
      of ECMO treatment. Hand written clinical data from the patients´ charts from every hour with
      ECMO treatment was reviewed for ventilator settings, lung volumes, mean arterial pressure,
      hemoglobin, lactate and oxygenation parameters during an observation period, which was
      defined as the first 10 days on ECMO (or the entire treatment period if shorter than 10
      days). This information was added to a digital database for the purpose of this study.

      At the time of ECMO treatment, arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation was measured by
      peripheral pulse oximetry from the right ear, finger or nose. Venous preoxygenator lactate
      and venous saturation values were used as indicators of sufficient (lactate < 2 mmol l-1 ,
      SvO2 ≥ 70%) or insufficient tissue perfusion.
