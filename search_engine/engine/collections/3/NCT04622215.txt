      to fill in a 24h voiding diary the day prior to the control visit or dialysis session, or
      this can be registered the day of planned 24h urine collection.

      All patients will be asked to fill a ICIQ-LUTS questionnaire. The ICIQ-LUTS questionnaire is
      a validated questionnaire to investigate the presence of LUTS in a non-invasive way:
      ICIQ-FLUTS(female lower urinary tract symptoms) for female patients and ICIQ-MLUTS(male lower
      urinary tract symptoms) for male patients.

        -  Gender

        -  eGFR(estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) (CKD-EPD)
