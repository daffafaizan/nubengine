    
      PERSERIS is an extended-release subcutaneous (SC) injectable suspension administered monthly
      for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. PERSERIS was approved by the FDA at doses
      equivalent to 3 mg and 4 mg oral risperidone. Many patients require doses of 5-6 mg oral
      risperidone and above, and this study will test a higher dose of PERSERIS in order to meet
      this need.

      Eligible subjects will initially be stabilized in the clinical unit on 6 mg oral risperidone
      for 5 days and transition to an approximate dose of PERSERIS by SC injection. PERSERIS will
      be administered every 28 days and subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit the day
      before, and remain in the unit for 3 days after each injection for pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      safety evaluations (a total of 8 days for the first injection including the stabilization
      period). Subjects will return to the clinic between injections for additional PK, safety and
      efficacy assessments at scheduled intervals until the next injection.

      A total of 4 doses of PERSERIS will be administered. The 4th dose will evaluate an alternate
      site for injection, and will be administered in the back of the upper arm.

      Subjects will return to the clinical unit for an end of study visit and will receive a follow
      up phone call to assess for adverse events one week after the end of study visit.
