      I. To assess survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma with a Zubrod
      Performance Status of 2 treated with OSI-774.

      II. To evaluate the objective tumor response rates (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete and
      partial), in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma with a Zubrod Performance
      Status of 2 treated with OSI-774.

      III. To investigate in a preliminary manner possible correlations of EGFR expression,
      mutations, and/or EGFR polymorphisms with response and/or survival.

      IV. To investigate in a preliminary manner possible correlations of activated signal pathway
      molecules, including basal p27 expression levels with response and/or survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.
