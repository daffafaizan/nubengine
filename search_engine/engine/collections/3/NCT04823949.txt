      with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum. These
      patients will be recruited prior to discharge home. This will be a randomized control trial,
      non-blinded. The study group will receive a mobile app for postpartum education and an
      integrated Wi-Fi connected blood pressure cuff for at-home monitoring for 16 days postpartum.
      The home BP monitoring will occur twice a day and study team will check the BPs twice a day
      and intervene by phone or text if necessary. The control group will be scheduled for blood
      pressure checks at the clinic between days 7-10. These groups will be compared with regard to
      identification of severe blood pressures (>/= 160/100), adherence to ACOG guidelines for
      blood pressure monitoring, timing of the identification and treatment of severe blood
      pressures, readmissions, and patient satisfaction.
