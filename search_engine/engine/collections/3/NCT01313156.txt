      Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf, Germany. This study is assessing a multitude of serum biomarkers,
      anthropometrics, dietary habits, physical activity, perceived stress along with genetic
      information from "healthy workers" (25-60years) to better understand phenotype-genotype
      associations leading to MetS and type 2 diabetes.
