    
      In the recruitment period, 60 patients will be approached when they are invited to attend for
      scheduled surveillance colonoscopy. Eligible patients (18-75 yrs) who agree to participate
      will be randomised to undergo CE or VCE as the first procedure. Data will be captured by an
      Observer using a bespoke Access-based program.

      The site and number of any biopsy samples taken will be recorded alongside the Endoscopist's
      prediction, based on visual appearance, of whether they think the area biopsied is actually
      dysplasia.

      After an agreed interval (no more than 8 weeks, usually 3-6), participants will undergo a
      second colonoscopy with the second technique, performed by an Endoscopist blinded to the
      results of the first test, and data captured as before. For each procedure, a questionnaire
      assessing immediate patient experience will be administered in the Endoscopy department,
      after the participant has recovered from the procedure. Participants will also be given a
      second questionnaire assessing their overall experience to take home and complete 48 hours
      after the procedure, which will be returned by post.
