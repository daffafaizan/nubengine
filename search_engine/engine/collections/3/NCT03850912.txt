    
      A multi-disciplinary team of investigators from 6 health systems have formed the Symptom
      Management IMplementation of Patient Reported Outcomes in Oncology (SIMPRO) Research Center.
      SIMPRO will use functioning ePRO prototypes to create and refine the electronic symptom
      management system eSyM. eSyM is the name of the platform the team will refine, integrate,
      implement and evaluate. eSyM addresses each of the 4 evidence gaps by:

        -  Implementing eSyM in cancer centers in small, rural or community-based systems.

        -  Integrating eSyM into the EHR of the predominant vendor used nationwide.

        -  Leveraging evidence-based tools, patient engagement, and population management.

        -  Executing this work using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research across
           all phases to maximize the chances that eSyM and similar systems achieve their intended
           goals and decrease the morbidity of cancer treatment at a population level.

      This project contains 4 activities:

        1. Obtain stakeholder feedback

        2. Build and deploy eSyM

        3. Pilot test eSyM

        4. Pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial
