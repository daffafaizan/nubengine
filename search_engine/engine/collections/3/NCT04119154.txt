    
      Prospective feasibility and validation study of a novel contrast microhalography (CEM) device
      for diagnosis of malignancy in Botswana. Consenting patients identified by their providers as
      requiring a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or percutaneous biopsy for assessment for possible
      lymphoma or breast cancer will undergo standard diagnostic procedure. Concurrently these
      patients will have additional FNA fluid tested using the portable novel nanosensor-based
      device (CEM). Diagnosis made from standard anatomic pathology, flow cytometry, and/or
      cytology will be compared with the diagnosis made using the CEM platform. Assessment of the
      feasibility and acceptability of the CEM platform will be performed. Assessment of training
      requirements for CEM platform will be completed.
