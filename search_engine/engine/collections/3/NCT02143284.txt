      330 degree field of view. FSOT powers EndoChoice's FDA, CE and AMAR (Israeli medical device
      authority) approved Endoscopic systems (Gastroscope and Colonoscope). The intent of this
      study is to evaluate the safety, performance and usability of additional versions of FSOT-
      powered gastroscopes and colonoscopes.
