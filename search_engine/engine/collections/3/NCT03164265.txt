    
      Phase I/II, single center, prospective, open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized,
      interventional, cohort study in which low risk living donor liver transplant (LDLT)
      recipients will receive a single infusion of donor-derived DCreg with concurrent mycophenolic
      acid (MPA) therapy (1/2 dose) 1 week prior to transplantation. All patients will be
      maintained on MPA and Tacrolimus (Tac) for the 1st 6 months after transplantation. At that
      time point, recipients meeting specific criteria (no rejection and permissive liver function
      tests (LFTs)) will be slowly weaned off MPA per standard of care over a period of 6 months.
      Participants will then be evaluated for TAC weaning at 1 yr after transplantation. Those who
      meet the criteria of no rejection and permissive LFTs will undergo a protocol liver biopsy
      and proceed to Tac weaning over 6 months if liver biopsy is permissive. Successfully weaned
      participants who remain rejection-free will undergo 3 years of follow-up after the last dose
      of immunosuppression. They will undergo a liver biopsy at 1 yr and 3 yrs after
      immunosuppression withdrawal. Participants who are removed from the study protocol at any
      time will return to standard of care, but will be continue to be followed by the study team
      and will undergo a liver biopsy at the end of the study (4.5 yrs after transplantation).
