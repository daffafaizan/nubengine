    
      Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia (WM) is defined by a bone marrow infiltration by
      lymphoplasmacytic cells and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) M gammopathy in
      the peripheral blood. The clinical understanding of the disease has been greatly improved by
      the identification of internationally recognized criteria for initiating therapy, the
      description of an international prognostic index for patients requiring a first-line therapy
      and the definition of response criteria. These criteria are mainly based on the evolution of
      serum IgM concentration. However, delayed IgM monoclonal protein responses may cause
      important difficulties in response assessment. In addition, discrepancies between the
      kinetics of serum M protein reduction and the clearance of monoclonal B-cells from the bone
      marrow have been reported. Despite continuing advances in the therapy of WM, the disease
      remains incurable with a median survival of 5 to 8 years from the time of diagnosis thereby
      necessitating the development and evaluation of novel treatment approaches.
