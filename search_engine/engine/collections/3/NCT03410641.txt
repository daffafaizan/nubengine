      long-term risk of coronary events and mortality. The lifestyle risk factors for cancer are
      partly similar to those for coronary heart disease, e.g. smoking, high body weight,
      unfavourable diet. The investigators therefore expect that the intervention has an effect on
      cancer risk in the long term.

      In this follow-up study, the investigators analyse the association between the intervention,
      and cancer incidence and mortality drawn from the Cancer Registry of Norway and the Norwegian
      Cause of Death Registry from the time of randomisation in 1972/3 until the end of 2015.
