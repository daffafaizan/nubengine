      clinically localized prostate cancer. The dose and frequency of IT injections will be
      increased in successive cohorts to define a safe dose and schedule for further testing.

      Intratumoral + intramuscular poly-ICLC in patients with clinical localized prostate cancer.
      In the current pilot clinical trial, poly-ICLC will be administered intratumorally (Artemis
      guided) and intramuscularly (e.g., deltoid muscle) prior to prostatectomy in patients with
      clinically localized prostate cancer. Based on the available preclinical data exploring
      intratumoral administration of PAMPs described above, we expect this approach will result in
      three immunomodulatory steps26:

      Immunomodulatory Step 1: Innate immune local tumor killing induced by intratumoral poly-ICLC
      - the initial intratumoral injections are expected to induce activation/recruitment of IL-12,
      TNF-Î±, and other cytokines and NK cells, resulting in early tumor killing and antigen
      release.9-11 Poly-ICLC may also have a direct antiproliferative effect on tumor cells
      mediated by interferon-inducible nuclear enzyme systems.

      Immunomodulatory Step 2: Th1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte priming as a result of the repeated
      in-situ poly-ICLC 'danger signal' combined with the tumor antigens released in step 1 and
      further processed and cross-presented by poly-ICLC-activated myeloid dendritic cells.7,8
      Poly-ICLC is expected to recruit myeloid dendritic cells and macrophages to the tumor site
      where they can load with antigens being released through the innate mechanisms, present them
      Th1 cells, and cross-present them to CD8 T cells in the tumor or in the regional lymph nodes,
      thus generating antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

      Immunomodulatory Step 3 (or "Boost" phase): Maintenance of the systemic anti-tumor immune
      response and migration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to remote metastases, through repeated
      intramuscular poly-ICLC induction of chemokines, other costimulatory factors, and
      inflammasome activation.23-25 The rationale for followup with intramuscular maintenance is
      that as part of the comprehensive response, dsRNAs such as poly-ICLC induce various
      chemokines and costimulatory factors that help target the response to tumor. For example, one
      of these costimulatory factors is OX40, which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family of
      cytokines, and helps maintain cytotoxic lymphocyte longevity and action at the tumor and
      metastatic sites.
