      I. To assess the complete remission (CR) rate of this regimen as compared with 7 + 3 standard
      induction with the 90 mg/m^2/dose of daunorubicin (historical control) in previously
      untreated patients with AML or advanced MDS or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm less than
      age 65.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment related
      mortality of this regimen.

      II. To assess the toxicity of this regimen in previously untreated patients. III. To
      determine whether 3 consolidation chemotherapy cycles consisting of G-CSF (filgrastim),
      clofarabine, and cytarabine (GCLAC) can be administered with prompt recovery of blood counts.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning the day
      prior to chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive clofarabine
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour followed by cytarabine IV over 2 hours daily for 5 days.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive filgrastim SC daily for 5 days beginning the day
      prior to chemotherapy. Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour followed by cytarabine IV
      over 2 hours daily for 4 days.

      Treatment with induction therapy may continue for up to 2 courses and treatment with
      consolidation therapy may continue for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 5 years.
