      over 20%. Pulmonary vein isolation is now established as therapy of choice for patients with
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation. It is well known that this interventional therapy inevitably
      modulates the intracardiac autonomic nervous system. While this ablation might alter atrial
      electrophysiology beneficially, the impact on ventricular electrophysiology remains unclear.
