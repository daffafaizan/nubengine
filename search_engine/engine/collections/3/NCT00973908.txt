      and Clostridium Difficile associated diarrhoea when VSL#3 is giving during a course of
      systemic antibiotics. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 proportion to receive either one
      sachet of VSL#3 or a similar looking placebo twice a day. This will be given for the length
      of the antibiotic course and another week thereafter. Follow-up will last until 28 days after
      the last antibiotic dose. Patient restarted on antibiotics during follow-up will be restarted
      on the trial medication and the 28 day follow-up will be recommenced.

      This trial has 2 co-primary outcome measures.
