      tension, intraoperative or postoperative recipient site infection, postoperative edema, which
      in turns compromises stability of onlay bone blocks thus osseintegration of bone block. Any
      attempt of bone recontouring and resuturing fails since there is no vascular bed. Ideal
      requirements of barrier membranes are, they should be biological compatible, they must act as
      a barrier membrane, unwanted fibroblasts should be hindered from entrance while allowing
      diffusion of nutrients, tissue integration (biological adhesion), tissues should be able to
      grow into the membrane but not through it. Space maintainer, it should be sufficiently stiff,
      so as not to collapse into the underlying particulate bone under the pressure of soft tissue
      and it should be ease in its manipulation, adaptation and handling, as for example, collagen
      membrane. Some types of collagen membrane, contain some degrees of stretchability.
