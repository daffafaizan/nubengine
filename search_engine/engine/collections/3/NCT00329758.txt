      is the main cause of death and disability between 18 and 40 years. In addition it originates
      expensive expenses in health care systems.

      Head injury produces damage by primary mechanisms related to impact, then by biochemical ways
      which are activated and they carry to secondary damage. Many studies have been conducted for
      explaining secondary injury, the majority conclude there is a kind of ischemic lesion related
      maybe with changes in cerebral flow and metabolism. The management today is trying to avoid
      progression in secondary damage without good outcome. Many drugs and measures has been
      ineffective.

      In the last years has been demonstrated in head injury microvascular damage like stroke.
      Statins o inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase are drugs used in dyslipidemia, frequently for
      reduction in LDL. Experimental and clinical studies in stroke have shown improvement in
      outcome. The toxicity related to statin is myopathy and hepatopathy, both with low incidence
      without fatal cases. Rosuvastatin has been postulated be the most powerful with longest life
      and toxicity similar to another statins.

      We have designed this study for demonstrate if the administration of rosuvastatin in the
      first 24 hours and by 10 days has improvement in amnesia and orientation, furthermore
      outcome.
