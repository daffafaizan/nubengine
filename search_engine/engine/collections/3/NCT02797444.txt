      knowledge about the aggressive life support measures used routinely in contemporary Critical
      Care to make informed decisions for themselves and their loved ones. Considering that most
      Canadians have not even heard of the term Advance Care Planning, it is likely that there is a
      gap in their knowledge and expectations of Critical Care. Such a gap can be bridged through
      education - the only caveat being that the individual should be in full possession of their
      faculties and can make informed decisions. This point is critical.

      Thus this study uses a mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) research design to
      address the following questions: 1) What is the state of knowledge about Critical Care
      interventions among healthy elderly laypersons in London, Ontario? 2) What are the barriers
      to formulating ACPs? 3) What opportunities exist for increasing ACP in the healthy elderly
      population? The primary objective of this proposal is to assess public knowledge of Critical
      Care interventions (and their outcomes) from the perspective of making Advance Care Plans.
      Secondary Objectives are 1) To evaluate local barriers to Advance Care Planning 2) To
      determine effective modes of education for Advance Care Planning that could be used for the
      community and in our hospital setting.
