      B radiation. Vitamin D can also be obtained through fortified foods and oral supplements.
      Lipid abnormalities are common in the general population, and are regarded as a modifiable
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recently low vitamin D status has been shown to be
      associated with increased risk of developing hyperlipidemia. Statins are normally the
      first-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia. It is also reported that vitamin D can improve
      serum lipid levels. However, its effects on hypercholesterolemia patients remain unclear. The
      investigators planned to determine the efficacy of combination therapy with statins and
      vitamin D in a cohort of hypercholesterolemia patients. This study may shed light as to
      whether oral vitamin D supplementation can be an adjunct therapy in hypercholesterolemia
      patients.
