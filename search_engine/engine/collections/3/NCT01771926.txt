      consumed carbohydrate sources on glucose tolerance and other cardiometabolic risk factors in
      overweight and obese, glucose intolerant men and women participating in a lifestyle
      intervention program. We hypothesize that consumption of potatoes is a healthy adjunct to
      lifestyle intervention in overweight and obese glucose intolerant adults. Our specific aims
      include: (1) to evaluate of the effects of the consumption of potatoes (high or low resistant
      starch) vs. commonly consumed carbohydrate sources on glucose tolerance; and (2) to determine
      the extent to which potato consumption alters markers of lipid metabolism and inflammation in
      the context of a lifestyle intervention program.
