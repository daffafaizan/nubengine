      control group. A total of 60 caregivers; caregivers of patients with HSCT, caregivers of
      patients enrolled in phase I oncology trials, and caregivers of patients with advanced cancer
      (Stage IV, solid tumor) will be enrolled in this study. The investigators do not expect
      different outcomes from these three groups, rather these populations are selected to optimize
      recruitment within a short time frame. The caregivers will be randomized to either treatment
      as usual or Pep-Pal intervention. The proposed study population is based on prior research
      indicating that caregivers of patients receiving HSCT, caregivers of patients enrolled in
      phase I oncology trials, and caregivers of patients with advanced cancer experience
      significant distress. In addition, an initial study of caregivers of patients receiving
      allogeneic-HSCT were able to benefit from a brief, cognitive behavioral stress management
      treatment approach. A study examining distress in phase I oncology clinical trial patient
      caregivers highlighted the need for more support for this significantly distressed
      population. Furthermore, initial results of the qualitative development study for Pep-Pal
      yielded support for a mobilized platform delivery of resources for caregivers to manage
      distress because they acknowledged many barriers to engaging in in-person treatment to manage
      distress.
