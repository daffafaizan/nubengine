      as adults. Few drugs are specifically indicated for use in children with severe hypertension.
      Cardene I.V. has been widely used in children with severe hypertension without specific
      dosing recommendations for children in the labeling. This study is designed to examine the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of using Cardene I.V. to reduce
      blood pressure (BP) in children with hypertension and will provide important information to
      guide use in pediatric patients.
