    
      STUDY POPULATION: Children aged 3 to 12 years consecutively referred to the Sleep Units due
      to clinical suspicion of OSA.

      SAMPLE SIZE: To evaluate the relationship between cognitive measures and polysomnographic
      variables and differences before-after treatment, a sample size of 1200 children is
      calculated.

      METHODOLOGY: The followiong will be obtained in all children included in the study: personal
      medical history, Spanish version of Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), physical and
      otorhinolaryngological examination, neurocognitive assessment by customary neurocognitive and
      behavioral tests routinely used in Spain (CUMANIN neuropsychological tests, ENFEN
      neuropsychological tests, and Spanish version of the ECBI (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory)),
      sleep study by polysomnography (PSG) or Respiratory Polygraphy (PR) and blood test.

      The diagnosis and treatment of OSAS will be established according to the criteria of the
      Spanish Consensus Document of OSAS in children.

      Depending on the treatment, three groups will be obtained: Group 1: Children with OSAS and
      adenotonsillar hypertrophy we will perform surgical treatment. Group 2: Children with OSAS
      and without adenotonsillar hypertrophy will be evaluated other treatments (sleep hygiene-diet
      and physical activity guidance, medical, orthodontic, continuous positive pressure on the
      airway (CPAP) treatment, Group 3: regular follow up but no treatment for children referred
      for suspicion of OSAS and that in PSG or RP the diagnosis of OSAS is not established. In all
      three groups, at 12 months, we will repeat all assessments as delineated for the initial
      visit
