        -  Determine the efficacy of irinotecan and docetaxel with or without cetuximab, in terms
           of objective response rate, in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients with tumors that overexpress epidermal growth
           factor receptor.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm A: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and irinotecan IV over 30 minutes
           weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

        -  Arm B: Patients receive docetaxel and irinotecan as in arm A. Patients also receive
           cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

      Courses repeat in both arms every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then
      periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients (46 per treatment arm)
