      Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide), paralleling clinical standard of care with unmanipulated
      donor lymphocytes. Intra-patient dose escalation will proceed at intervals of not less than 8
      weeks, dependent on development of toxicity or evidence of efficacy and confirmation by the
      Trial Management Group.

      Three dose cohorts levels are planned, and dosing will be according to total CD3+ T- cell
      dose as this correlates with toxicity in the unmanipualated donor lymphocyte setting:

        -  Dose Level 1: 1x10^6 CD3+ T-cells/kg (starting dose for all patients)

        -  Dose Level 2: 3x10^6 CD3+ T-cells/kg

        -  Dose Level 3: 1x10^7 CD3+ T-cells/kg

      The inter-patient dosing for the first 3 patients was at least 28 days, following TMG
      confirmation.

      Patients will be followed up regularly during the interventional phase of the study until 12
      months post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion. During the long term follow up phase of the study
      (years 2-3 post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion) patients will be followed-up annually for
      overall survival, disease status and safety.

      All patients will enter long term follow up until 3 years post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell
      infusion.
