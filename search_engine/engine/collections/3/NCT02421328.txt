      Hospital. They will be randomized in two groups; one group will start on nasal CPAP (Fisher &
      Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Z ealand) (Pressure 5 cmH2O) for 60 minutes and then will be
      switched to HHHFNC (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Z ealand) (flow of 4 l/m) for
      another 60 minutes. The other group will start on HHHFNC and then switched to nasal CPAP.

      After the 2 h study period (2Ã—60 minutes epochs) further respiratory support will be at the
      discretion of the clinical team.

      Ultrasonographic assessment of diaphragmatic dimensions and excursion will be analyzed in
      different respiratory cycles and the average of 3 cycles will be calculated at the end of the
      60 minutes periods on nasal CPAP and HHHFNC.
