      reduction in the Emergency Department. Our institution's current standard of care consists of
      IN Fentanyl for baseline control of pain, and for those fractures requiring reduction;
      typically IV Ketamine is utilized. Ketamine is typically well tolerated but is not without
      concerns including hypertension, vomiting, and the rare but serious complication of
      laryngospasm. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) offers a possible alternative to IV Ketamine. DEX has
      been used safely in the critical care setting for both pediatrics and adults. It has been
      well documented as being quite effective in sedation, amnesia and analgesia. Using IN DEX for
      PED procedural sedation has the potential to obviate the need for IV placement and may offer
      a better conscious sedation profile than Ketamine with respect to sedation, analgesia, and
      adverse outcomes.

      Our overall project would be to assess the efficiency of IN DEX in comparison to IV Ketamine,
      for proper sedation and analgesic coverage for children undergoing closed reduction of distal
      forearm fractures.
