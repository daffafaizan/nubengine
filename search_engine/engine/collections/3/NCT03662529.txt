    
      This study was funded and launched as an internal program evaluation regarding the effects of
      a four-session weekly individualized cognitive therapy program called the "Mind Freedom Plan"
      (MFP) on substance use outcomes, impulsivity, and substance abuse treatment retention in
      veterans admitted to the intensive outpatient (treatment) program (IOP) for substance abuse
      at the Richmond Virginia Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center
      (RICVAMC). Substance use and treatment retention outcomes were compared between veterans
      randomly assigned to the MFP versus treatment as usual (TAU), which consisted of typical
      case-management-oriented weekly individual sessions. Veteran participants were approached and
      consented within a week of admission to the RICVAMC IOP and randomly assigned to either an
      MFP or TAU practitioner. Assignment was constrained by practitioner new-patient availability
      in order to place veterans into individualized care sessions as soon as possible.

      Participants completed self-reported and interview-based mood, personality and addiction
      severity assessments at study entry. After one month, participants were reassessed with
      psychometric symptomatology questionnaires, and also completed a 60-minute neurobehavioral
      testing session in a follow-up appointment. Subjects completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive
      Function System (DKEFS) Tower Test of planning ability, along with a delay-discounting
      decision-making task, a stop-signal task, and a go-nogo behavior inhibition task that used
      emotional and expressionless faces as stimuli.
