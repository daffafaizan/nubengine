      inversely with the risk of development of CMV replication and correlates with the response to
      initial therapy and risk of relapse after onset of replication. The primary aim of this study
      is to determine an association between CMV CMI response and both the risk of CMV infection
      and the degree of initial CMV viremia and rate of viremia clearance with standard CMV
      therapy. The first secondary aim is to determine an association between CMV QnPCR, CMV
      microRNA expression, TLR2 expression, and CMV-specific CMI and the risk of relapse of CMV
      disease after initial treatment. The second secondary aim is to determine an association
      between CMV QnPCR, CMV microRNA expression, TLR2 expression, and CMV-specific CMI collected
      at CMV infection and the following prospective data: Development of CMV end organ disease,
      resolution of symptoms of CMV infection, other non-CMV infections after initial CMV
      infection, graft rejection, recurrent or resistant CMV infection, and other markers of immune
      function. The third secondary aim is to determine an association between CMV QnPCR, CMV
      microRNA expression, TLR2 expression, and CMV-specific CMI response collected at CMV
      infection in solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients and the following retrospective data:
      Type of SOT, CMV donor/recipient status, type and degree of immunosuppression, type and
      length of CMV prophylaxis, prior graft rejection and infections (non-CMV).
