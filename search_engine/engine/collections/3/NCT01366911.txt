      Correlation with Aging/Health" study which used excess bone marrow and blood samples to
      complete stem cell assay labs will be invited back at least 2 years post THA to complete
      bilateral hip x-rays, if not already completed as part of routine medical follow up plus a
      QCT bone density testing and to complete a questionnaire regarding smoking, alcohol and
      exercise history along with recording BMIs.

      This ability to identify older individuals with compromised stem cell function could offer
      opportunities to develop and test new preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve
      outcomes.
