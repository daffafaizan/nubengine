      by assessing the reduction of the seizure/interictal discharges in polysomnography and
      assessing the sleep structure.

      After initial recruitment, the baseline visit includes a polysomnography. The patients will
      then be randomised in two groups: melatonin (1 cp containing melatonin 2 mg 1x/d 1h before
      sleep) vs placebo (1 cp 1x/d 1h before sleep). The treatment (melatonin or placebo) will be
      given for 1 month.

      After 1 month, the treatment will be stopped and another polysomnography will be recorded.

      The patients will take no treatment (wash-out period) for 15 days. The second treatment phase
      is cross-over: the group that had melatonin in the first phase will take placebo for one
      month, and the group that had placebo in the first treatment phase will take melatonin for
      one month. A last polysomnography will be recorded after the second treatment phase.

      The other medications (antiepileptic drugs) taken by the patients before the trial will not
      be modified.
