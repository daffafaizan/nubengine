      chemotherapy. Patients will be treated in sequence with HGS1036 at planned dose levels of 10
      mg/kg and 20 mg/kg. Patients who demonstrate stable disease or better may continue to receive
      HGS1036 until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient requests discontinuation of
      study treatment, or the Investigator feels further treatment is not in the patient's best
      interest. After discontinuation of HGS1036, subjects will be followed for 30 days after the
      last dose of HGS1036 for safety. The end of study will be defined as 1 year after the last
      subject begins treatment of HGS1036. Any subject still receiving HGS1036 at this pre-defined
      end of study, may continue to receive HGS1036, but the only study assessments required will
      be for safety.
