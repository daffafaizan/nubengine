      Dysfunctional breathing (DB), resulting in dyspnoe, can mimic or exaggerate asthma. Around
      20-29% of asthmatic patients have DB. Breathing exercises (BrEX) can improve asthma-related
      quality of life (QOL) and control of asthma symptoms in less severe asthma. No study has
      investigated the effect of BrEX on QOL neither on level of physical activity in severe
      asthma.

      A randomised controlled multicentre trial will include 190 adults with poor asthma control
      (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ6)-scoreâ‰¥0.8) from seven outpatient departments and one
      specialized private clinic. After optimizing of inhalation technique, patients will be
      allocated to either usual care (no intervention) or BrEX-treatment consisting of 12-week
      intervention including three physiotherapist-sessions focusing on breathing pattern
      modification (Papworth Method; Buteyko technique) in rest and activity and 10 minutes
      home-exercise twice daily. Primary outcome is change in Mini Asthma Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) at six-months follow-up. Secondary outcomes are changes in ACQ6,
      Nijmegen Hyperventilation Questionnaire (NQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD),
      accelerometry (physical activity level, number of steps), 6 minutes walk distance, and forced
      expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), besides response of Global perceived effect rate
      (GPE) in asthma-related QOL and asthma control.
