      gastric volume now is not easy, and scintigraphy has remained the gold standard technique for
      many years. Ultrasound has progressively emerged as a useful substitute due to its reduced
      cost and ease of performance.

      Using gastric ultrasound measure gastric antrum cross-sectional area to determine whether
      patients are empty stomach, help anesthesiologists in preoperative evaluation of diabetic
      patients with the risk of aspiration, so as to guide the anesthesiologist take effective
      interventions, this prospective observational study aim to explore the gastric emptying of
      type 2 diabetic patients.
