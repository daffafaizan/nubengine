      leading cause of cancer death world wide. Several metabolic changes are present in the whole
      body in case of cancer so the investigators conducted a placebo controlled, double blinded,
      randomized, prospective and multicentre study to investigate, whether L-Carnitine
      supplementation may have an impact on malnutrition, cancer cachexia and cancer related
      fatigue in advanced pancreatic cancer.
