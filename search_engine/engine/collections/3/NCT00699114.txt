      pain control of minor to moderate postoperative pain. Gradually traditional non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have become more popular as analgesics due to assumed
      superior therapeutic effects and aggressive marketing campaigns orchestrated by the
      pharmaceutical industry.

      Ibuprofen is a widely used analgesic both in non-prescription and prescription doses.

      A dose-response relationship for low ibuprofen doses is shown. Evidence of a progressing dose
      response relationship for moderate (i.e. 400 mg) to higher doses is scarce. A possible
      analgesic ceiling effect has been suggested for doses above 400 mg, although a correlation
      between given ibuprofen doses above 400 mg and patient serum levels is shown. However, it may
      be questioned if the plasma concentration of ibuprofen is an important determinator of
      analgesic drug efficacy. A higher dose is more likely to influence the duration of analgesic
      effect rather than the peak analgesic effect.

      There are few clinical trials investigating the dose-response relationship of increasing
      ibuprofen doses and paracetamol doses. To our knowledge no published study has investigated
      the dose-response relationship of ibuprofen and paracetamol in the same trial with a negative
      (i.e. placebo) and a positive (i.e. best standard analgesic treatment) control group.
