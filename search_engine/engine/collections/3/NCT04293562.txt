    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare event-free survival (EFS) in children with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      without FLT3 mutations who are randomly assigned to standard induction therapy on Arm A with
      daunorubicin, cytarabine (DA) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) (DA-GO) versus Arm B with
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) and GO.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS) and rates of end of Induction 1 (EOI1) minimal residual
      disease (MRD) in children with de novo AML without FLT3 mutations who are randomly assigned
      to standard induction therapy (Arm A) with DA-GO versus CPX-351 and GO (Arm B).

      II. To estimate the EFS and rate of EOI1 MRD in FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation
      positive patients (FLT3/ITD+; as defined by allelic ratio > 0.1) without favorable
      cytomolecular characteristics (NPM1 and/or CEBPA) receiving gilteritinib fumarate
      (gilteritinib) in combination with DA-GO (Arm AC).

      III. To estimate the EFS and rate of EOI1 MRD in patients with non-ITD FLT3 activating
      mutations who receive backbone therapy (DA-GO or CPX-351 and GO) with gilteritinib (Arms AD
      and BD).

      IV. To determine the feasibility of combining gilteritinib and DA-GO or CPX-351 and GO in
      patients with FLT3/ITD mutations (Arm AC/Arm BC/Arm AD/Arm BD).

      V. To compare EOI1 MRD and EFS in patients with FLT3/ITD AML+ (allelic ratio [AR] > 0.1)
      without favorable cytogenetic/molecular characteristics treated with DA-GO-gilteritinib
      versus (vs) CPX-GO-gilteritinib (Arm AC vs Arm BC).

      VI. To compare the incidence of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in
      children with de novo AML without FLT3 mutations who are randomly assigned to standard
      induction therapy (Arm A) with DA-GO versus CPX-351 and GO (Arm B).

      VII. To compare the changes in echocardiography-derived measures of cardiac function,
      including left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS),
      throughout AML therapy in patients with low and high risk AML without FLT3 mutations
      receiving Arm A vs Arm B.

      VIII. Determine if early changes in sensitive echocardiographic measures of cardiac function
      (i.e., post-Induction 1 decline in GLS) and elevations in circulating cardiac biomarkers
      (i.e., cardiac troponin T and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide) are associated with
      subsequent declines in left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with non-FLT3 mutant
      AML receiving therapy on Arms A or B.

      IX. To compare longitudinal acute changes in neuropsychological functioning and
      neurocognitive late effects between those with central nervous system (CNS) disease and those
      without CNS disease and between those treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
      and those treated with chemotherapy only for patients on Arms A and B.

      X. To compare cardiotoxicity measures (EF, GLS, and cardiac biomarkers) in patients receiving
      standard induction with dexrazoxane hydrochloride (dexrazoxane) vs. CPX-351 in the context of
      gilteritinib therapy and explore whether the differential cardiotoxicity across arms varies
      from that observed in non-FLT3 mutant AML without gilteritinib exposure.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the EFS and rate of EOI1 MRD in patients with high allelic ratio (HAR)
      FLT3/ITD+ patients, as historically defined by an AR > 0.4, receiving gilteritinib in
      combination with DA-GO (Arm AC with AR > 0.4).

      II. To estimate the EFS and rate of EOI1 MRD in FLT3/ITD+ patients (as defined by allelic
      ratio > 0.1) with NPM1 and/or bZIP CEBPA mutations receiving gilteritinib in combination with
      DA-GO (Arm AC).

      III. Compare the changes in high sensitivity troponin and natriuretic peptide elevations
      throughout AML therapy, as measured at the end of each chemotherapy course, in patients with
      low and high risk AML without FLT3 mutations receiving Arm A vs Arm B.

      IV. Quantify the association of host factors (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], race),
      treatment exposures (cumulative anthracycline dose, anthracycline arm, hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant vs. chemotherapy alone), early declines in GLS, and elevations in cardiac
      biomarkers (cTnT and NT-proBNP) with subsequent LVSD.

      V. Develop a multi-marker risk prediction model incorporating significant host factors,
      treatment exposures, and echocardiographic predictors for the development of LVSD within 1
      year of completing therapy.

      VI. To describe the rates of CNS disease utilizing an updated strategy for diagnosing and
      defining CNS disease in pediatric AML.

      VII. To describe the rates of CNS relapse (both isolated CNS and combined bone marrow/CNS)
      when utilizing this updated strategy as well as changing CNS prophylaxis and treatment to
      include triple intrathecal chemotherapy.

      VIII. To describe disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in high risk patients
      based on multi-dimensional flow cytometry detection of measurable residual disease prior to
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      IX. To describe plasma metabolomics that may impact efficacy, toxicity, and/or
      pharmacokinetics of allogeneic HSCT.

      X. To estimate the prevalence of non-risk stratifying cytogenetic/molecular variants and
      assess their impact on outcome in childhood AML.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to either Arm A or B and assigned to Arm C or D based on
