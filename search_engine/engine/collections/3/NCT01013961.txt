      Primary

        -  To compare the rate of complete and overall response in elderly patients with
           progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with one of two doses of
           rituximab combined with alemtuzumab to determine if the use of modified-dose rituximab
           significantly affects outcome.

      Secondary

        -  To monitor and assess toxicity of these regimens.

        -  To determine the overall and progression-free survival, time to clinical response, time
           to next treatment, and duration of response in patients treated with these regimens

        -  To assess the correlation between risk stratification prognostic markers (i.e., CD38,
           ZAP-70, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and IgVH mutation) and clinical
           outcome.

        -  To assess response to these regimens using both the 1996 National Cancer Institute
           Working Group (NCI-WG 96) criteria and an expanded definition of response for patients
           in complete remission, including immunohistochemical examination of the bone marrow and
           sensitive flow cytometry (4-6 color) of blood for minimal residual disease and computed
           tomography (CT) scans for residual adenopathy.

        -  To determine the mechanism of action of rituximab and alemtuzumab and to determine
           mechanisms of resistance of a subpopulation of CLL cells to these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to FISH risk (low
      [13q14-] vs intermediate [12+, no abnormality, all other abnormalities] vs high
      [17p13-,11q22-]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm A: Patients receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15,
           17, 20, 22, 24, 27, 29, and 31 and standard-dose rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 8,
           15, 22, and 29 in cycle 1 (33-day cycle). In cycle 2 and subsequent cycles (28-day
           cycle), patients receive alemtuzumab SC on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24,
           and 26 and standard-dose rituximab IV on days 3, 10, 17, and 24. Treatment repeats every
           28 days for up to 3 cycles.

        -  Arm B: Patients receive alemtuzumab as in arm A. Patients also receive low-dose
           rituximab IV on days 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 24, 27, 29, and 31 in cycle 1 and on
           days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 in cycless 2 and 3. Treatment
           repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for cytogenetic and biomarker
      analysis.

      Alemtuzumab dose for Cycle 1 Week 1 of both Arms A and B requires a 'dose ramp' (3 mg day 1,
      10 mg day2, and 30 mg day 3 of cycle 1).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
