      twice daily to substitute the daily carbohydrate for 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout period
      between alternative diets. All 33 subjects received two servings of either GMNs or PNs (400
      g) per day, which replaced the main carbohydrate in two daily meals for 4 weeks. After a
      2-week washout period, the subjects received the other type of noodle for 4 weeks. The body
      weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile, as well as serum
      vitamin A, E, Î²-carotene and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CPR) were measured by
      HPCL.
