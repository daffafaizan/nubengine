      before sun exposure.

      The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study conducted on healthy
      volunteers. The volunteers will have 5 squares of 8 cm*8 cm on their backs, which each will
      be randomized to receive one of following: melatonin cream 0,5%; melatonin cream 2,5%;
      melatonin cream 12,5%; placebo cream (vehicle) and no treatment.

      After randomization and received treatment the volunteers will be exposed to strong midday
      sun (UV-index of approximately 9) for 40 minutes.

      The outcomes parameters (degree of erythema and pain sensation) are measured at baseline and
      1,4,8 and 24 hours post exposure.
