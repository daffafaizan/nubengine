    
      Parts A and B will include a screening period (up to 28 days) and a 12-week treatment period.
      A subject with no serious adverse drug reactions and who is expected to benefit from
      continued treatment in the opinion of the investigator will have the opportunity to
      participate in the long-term extension (Part C). If the subject is not a candidate for or
      chooses not to participate in the long-term extension (Part C), a post-treatment period of 4
      weeks will commence that concludes with an end-of-study visit.

      Subjects participating in only Part A or Part B will have approximately 9 study site visits
      over 18 weeks. Part C will include monthly visits to the study site for 9 months. Thereafter,
      visits will occur every 3 months. A subject with stable disease or response may continue
      ASN001 treatment with the approval of the investigator; treatment can continue until a
      subject experiences an intolerable adverse event (AE) or disease progression, withdraws
      consent or until termination of the study by the sponsor. At the end of treatment, a
      post-treatment period of 4 weeks will commence that concludes with an end-of-study visit.

      Part B of the study will not be completed as enrollment was halted after Part A (Phase 1)
