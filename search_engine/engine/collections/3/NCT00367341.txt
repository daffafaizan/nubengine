      FDG PET) associated with differential clinical remission to each of two well-established,
      randomly delivered first-line antidepressant treatments-the SSRI escitalopram (s-CIT) or
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with cross-over treatment for non-remitters (sequential
      course of treatment model).

      Aim 2. To define metabolic change patterns, occurring early in the course of both s-CIT and
      CBT, associated with successful and unsuccessful clinical remission to each intervention.
