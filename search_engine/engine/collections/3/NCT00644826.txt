      resulting need for long term care is increasing in the near future. It is not only an
      individual's interest but also of public concern to avoid a nursing home admission. Current
      evidence indicates that preventive home visits can be an effective way to reduce the
      admission rate in this way making it possible for elderly people to stay longer at home than
      without home visits. As the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preventive home visits
      strongly depends on existing services in the social and health system existing international
      results cannot be merely transferred to Germany. Therefore it is necessary to investigate the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such an intervention by a randomized controlled trial
      in Germany.
