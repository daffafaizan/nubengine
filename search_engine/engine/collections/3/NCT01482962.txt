      have relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

      This study evaluated alisertib for the improvement in overall response rate (ORR) compared
      with single-agent treatment, as selected by the investigator from the offered options of
      pralatrexate, romidepsin (US only), or gemcitabine, in participants with relapsed or
      refractory PTCL.

      The study enrolled 271 patients. Participants were randomized (1:1) to one of 2 treatment
      arms:

        -  Alisertib

        -  Investigator's choice (Pralatrexate, Romidepsin, or Gemcitabine)

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was approximately 5 years. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and then
      were contacted by telephone up to 42-months after the last participant was randomized, or
      until death, for follow-up assessment.
