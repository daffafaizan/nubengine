      million people worldwide. Incidence of asthma is steadily increasing in Western populations;
      an additional 100 million asthma diagnoses are anticipated by the year 2025. Asthma is a
      multifactorial disease affected by genetic and environmental factors. One major and
      potentially modifiable environmental factor is the Western diet. The Western diet influences
      the microbiome, which in turn, may influence inflammatory airway diseases via a gut
      microbiome-airway connection. The investigators hypothesize that prebiotic dietary fiber
      supplementation leads to increased circulating short chain fatty acid production and
      improvement in asthma disease activity. The investigators will recruit 20 children, ages 6-17
      years old, with asthma from the Severe Asthma Clinic or General Pulmonary Clinic at Phoenix
      Children's Hospital. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) using a random number
      generator to ingest PROMOTIR soluble corn fiber (85% fiber, 12 g/day) in a fruit-flavored
      beverage or placebo (malodextrin in a similar fruit-flavored beverage) as previously
      described. Participants will be asked to consume the prebiotic soluble corn fiber (or
      placebo) for 4 weeks alongside their normal diet and normal asthma treatments. Blood will be
      collected pre- and post-fiber intervention to measure baseline and post-intervention
      circulating SCFAs. Stool samples and nasal wash will be collected for microbiome and immune
      analysis pre- and post- fiber consumption. Nasal washes will be collected pre- and post-fiber
      consumption to measure inflammatory patterns.
