      Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) to patients with similar symptoms and healthy controls.
      The differential diagnosis cohort includes patients diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy
      (MSA), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), Essential
      Tremor (ET) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and Healthy Controls.

      This is a prospective observational study. Blood samples and clinical data will be collected
      at the first and only study visit. The expression levels of 5 to 6 genes will be analyzed by
      blinding technicians concerning the diagnosis, demographic data and clinical data, which will
      be revealed after sending PDx gene expression values to the clinical sites. The gene
      expression levels will be compared between Parkinson's disease patients to the differential
      diagnosis cohort and healthy controls. Additional mRNA and miRNA markers will be explored.
      The primary aim of the study is to design and validate a clinical classifier that will aid
      the physician in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease patients. The analysis will be
      performed in two stages: Stage 1) Exploration analysis and Stage 2) Validation. After one
      year of taking a blood sample, the study physician will contacted to confirm the patient's
      diagnosis.

      Blood samples will be collected at specialized movement disorder clinics.

      Medical history, clinical diagnostic features, family history in regard to Parkinson's
      disease, use of medication and routine imaging assessment (not mandatory) will be collected
      at the first and only patient visit.
