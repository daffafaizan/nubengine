      sirolimus upon cognitive functioning in Sturge-Weber syndrome is the primary outcome measure.
      This outcome will be assessed using a panel of testing selected based upon extensive
      experience in testing cognitive function in adults and children with SWS at the Kennedy
      Krieger Sturge-Weber Center. Changes in a quantitative EEG before and after the trial,
      Sturge-Weber syndrome clinical neuroscore, port-wine birthmark score, and the impact of
      sirolimus upon seizures will be assessed.
