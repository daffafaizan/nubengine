      relevant component positioning, including relevant motion assessments, are still not
      navigated, and only femoral/tibial component positioning is supported by computer-assistance.
      After surgery, anterior knee pain is generally reported and this may due to prosthesis
      component mal-positioning, including the patella, and, ultimately, this may result in
      revision arthroplasty. Within computer-assisted surgery, surgical navigated system have been
      introduced to monitor femur and tibia prosthesis implantation and to assess tibio-femoral
      joint kinematics. In this context, the patella is still disregarded or limitedly considered,
      whereas it is still debated if the patella should be resurfaced in total knee replacement.
      Recently, new navigation-based procedures have been tested to allow the intra-operative
      monitoring of patellar-based data for more proper patellar resurfacing; at follow-up under
      active conditions, video-fluoroscopy, so far used to assess general tibio-femoral kinematics,
      offers the potentials for patellar motion tracking.

      The possibility in vivo to perform intra-operative evaluations of the patello-femoral joint
      data, i.e. including patellar bone morphology and motion, via computer assisted procedures
      during surgery would allow the surgeon to have a more complete comprehension of the knee
      functioning in patients undergoing total knee replacement; these procedures, along with
      derived data, can act as a support in for the most critical surgical actions in terms of
      femoral/tibial prosthesis component implantation and related patellar resurfacing.
      Furthermore, at post-operative follow-ups via fluoroscopic acquisitions and gait analysis, it
      is possible to evaluate how the implant is able to recover, or not, the normative
      physiological motion at both tibio-femoral and patello-femoral joint.

      The goal of this study is to validate a new technique for intra-operative quantification of
      the patello-femoral joint kinematics in patients undergoing total knee replacement, and for
      postoperative quantification of implanted knee and general lower limb activity, along with
      relevant muscle dynamics.
