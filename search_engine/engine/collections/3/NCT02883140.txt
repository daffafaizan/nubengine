      submandibular salivary symptoms. Each patient included is given a MRI sialography and a
      3D-CBCT sialography at a later stage when the acute episode has subsided. Images are archived
      on the Carestream Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS). Interpretation is achieved
      after Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR), Maximal Intensity Projection (MIP) and
      three-dimensional rendering. A primary radiological analysis of the two procedures is
      systematically done by a specialist radiologist for the diagnostic and therapeutic care of
      the patient. A second radiological data analysis is carried out at the end of the study, by a
      specialized radiologist, different from the first one, to asses the two radiological
      examinations.

      The primary outcome measure is the capability of the radiological technique to detect a
      ductal salivary feature. Secondary outcomes include the clinical characteristics of the
      patients, the diagnostic capabilities in identifying the salivary lesions, their number,
      their precise location and measurements. A primary side effect in catheterization and
      dosimetric parameters for the CBCT technique will be systematically recorded.
