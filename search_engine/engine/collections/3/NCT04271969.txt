    
      This study will use a prospective interventional comparative study design using the patient's
      quality of life (QoL) as the primary study endpoint to determine HFCWO affect. The study will
      compare the patient's QoL baseline (established at enrollment prior to HFCWO treatment) to
      the QoL measured at various timepoints (enrollment, 2 months, 6 months and 12 months) over a
      one-year period whilst receiving HFCWO treatment. In addition, a baseline for the secondary
      endpoints will established at enrollment for comparison to measurements taken at various
      timepoints over a one-year period whilst receiving HFCWO treatment. The patient's medical
      records will be used to establish prior histories of exacerbation rates for comparison to
      exacerbation rates experienced after one year of HFCWO treatment. Patients will serve as
      their own control.
