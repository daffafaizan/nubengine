      approximately a third experiencing a remission of symptoms over a year follow-up. Although
      the etiology of prostatitis is still not clear, it is mainly thought to be due to infection
      of bacteria or other microorganisms. Traditional techniques to identify bacteria (e.g. on
      agar petri plates) are limited in what they can identify. Although HMP (Human Microbiome
      Project) has turned many mysteries into common sense, little is done on the relationship of
      bacteria in the prostate for prostatitis. Up to now, there is still no research being done on
      the microbiome (bacterial species) of the prostate. The objective of this study is to look at
      the etiology of chronic prostatitis (bacteria or non-bacteria prostatitis), mainly focusing
      on the effect of bacteria in the prostate. Modern sequencing methods, such as 16s rRNA
      amplification, cloning and sequencing will be used to evaluate the role of bacteria in
      prostatitis. The basic idea is to survey the microbes present in expressed prostatic fluid
      using 16s sequencing to compare healthy men and prostatitis patients in a small cohort to see
      if there are correlations between microbes found and symptoms.
