      Time taken for insertion. Insertion attempts or failed attempt. Oropharyngeal leak pressure
      Air leak Time taken to pass an orogastric tube Attempts to pass an orogastric tube or failed
      attempt. Haemodynamic variation Incidence of adverse events like failed insertion,
      aspiration-regurgitation, hypoxia (SpO2< 90%), bronchospasm, airway obstruction, gastric
      insufflation, coughing, gagging, retching, hiccup, coughing during removal, blood staining of
      the airway device and trauma to tongue, lip, teeth, or gums.
