    
      Non-clinical data on Givinostat, support a potent anti-inflammatory mechanism of action which
      can potentially slow the arthritic destructive process. This rationale seems to be confirmed
      by the preliminary evidences collected in a previous Phase II clinical trial conducted in
      children and young adults with systemic JIA.

      The present protocol is aimed at collecting new information on safety and efficacy of two
      doses of Givinostat for the treatment of JIA.
