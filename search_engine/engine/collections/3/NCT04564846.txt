    
      This study is designed to explore the efficacy of ORMD-0801 compared to placebo on endogenous
      glucose production in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Subjects will undergo an initial
      Screening Visit (Visit 0) to establish their eligibility to participate in the study. At
      Visit 1 (2 weeks after the Screening Visit), qualifying subjects will be randomized to either
      ORMD-0801 (8 mg) or matching placebo, study medication will be dispensed and subjects will
      dose, twice a day, once in the morning prior to breakfast and once at night prior to bedtime.
      Doses will occur at 45 minutes (± 15 minutes) before breakfast and no later than 10 AM each
      morning, and at 8 PM (± 120 minutes) each night, and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner.
      Subjects will return to the clinic, 2 weeks later, for Visit 2. At this visit, subject
      compliance will be assessed, medication will be dispensed, a blood sample will be collected
      to measure HbA1c and subjects will be questioned for any adverse events. Subjects will be
      scheduled to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for morning admission (8 AM ± 120 minutes) to
      the PK unit (Visit 3). Subjects will be provided with standardized meals and the morning dose
      in-clinic. A light standardized dinner meal will be provided at 6 PM ± 30 minutes. At
      approximately 8 PM (± 60 minutes, and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner), subjects will be
      dosed with their study medication and will be started on a 16-hour infusion of
      [6,6-2H2]-glucose tracer.
