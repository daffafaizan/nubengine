      fractures. Nevertheless, the majority of fractures in adults occur in those with "osteopenia"
      (bone mineral density (BMD) only moderately lower than young normal individuals) Since life
      long drug therapy is an expensive option with uncertain consequences and side effect, natural
      herbal therapy offers an attractive alternative. The classic Yin and Yang Tonic Formula
      (eg.Zuogui Pill, Yougui Pill) have been used for osteoporosis or osteopenia in traditional
      Chinese medicine(TCM) for a long time. For this reason, Chinese guidelines for the treatment
      of osteopenia include natural herbal therapy, however, there is currently no randomize
      placebo controlled trial to verify the efficacy for treating low BMD. This trial is
      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled design. Results of this study will provide
      evidence regarding the value of the classic Yin and Yang tonic formula as an intervention for
      increase BMD and decreasing fracture risk in osteopenia. Furthermore, the mechanisms of
      action can be identified by this study.
