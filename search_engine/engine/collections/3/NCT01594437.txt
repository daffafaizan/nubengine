      prevalence of congenital HCMV infection is ~1% and is one of the leading causes of permanent
      hearing loss and neurological deficits in children. In immunocompromised individuals such as
      transplant recipients it can cause serious life-threatening disease and may significantly
      increase the risk of graft rejection. As existing therapies for HCMV can have serious side
      effects, there remains a medical need for safe and effective treatment of HCMV disease.
