      cardiac morbidity and mortality. Treating depressive symptoms appears to improve depressive
      symptoms and quality of life. Despite expert recommendations to screen and treat depressive
      symptoms fewer coronary heart disease patients engage in depression treatment than the
      general population, perhaps due to 1) sub-optimal provider awareness and referral rates and
      2) low self-efficacy, stigma and misattribution of depressive symptoms among coronary heart
      disease patients. In addition, few real world theory-informed implementation trials exist for
      improving screening and treatment in outpatient settings.

      The specific aim is to determine whether an electronic shared decision making (eSDM) and
      behavioral activation tool improves depressive symptoms and treatment initiation in coronary
      heart disease patients with elevated depressive symptoms. To accomplish these aims, a hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation trial will be conducted using a stepped wedge design across
      socioeconomically diverse cardiology and primary care clinics.
