           years and had recurrence/persistence of symptoms after primary HM with an Eckardt
           symptom score ≥ 4. The diagnosis of achalasia was made on the basis of the absence of
           peristalsis and on impaired relaxation of the LES on established methods (barium
           swallow, manometry, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)). Exclusion criteria were severe
           cardiopulmonary disease or other serious disease leading to unacceptable surgical risk,
           pseudoachalasia, and megaesophagus (diameter of > 7 cm).

        2. All patients were scheduled for a follow-up visit at 1 month after POEM for EGD and
           manometry. Symptoms were assessed 1 month after treatment in the clinic and every 3
           months thereafter via telephone questionnaires.

        3. The primary outcome of the study was therapeutic success (a reduction in the Eckardt
           score to ≤3) at the follow-up assessment. The secondary outcomes included
           procedure-related adverse events, LES pressure on manometry pre- and post POEM, reflux
           symptoms and medication use before and after POEM, and procedure-related parameters such
           as procedure time, hospital stay, and myotomy length.
