      pressure measurements will enroll 200 patients with moderate to severe ARDS by the Berlin
      conference definition in several academic medical centers in North America. The control group
      will be ventilated using an alternative high-PEEP strategy with PEEP and FiO2 set using to an
      empiric table.

      Plasma samples will be obtained at enrollment and days 3 and 7 and assessed for a variety of
      lung injury biomarkers to better assess the association between our intervention and the
      inflammation associated with mechanical ventilation and the development of ARDS. Hospital
      survivors will undergo a brief follow up phone survey to assess survival, functional status
      (Barthel Index), health-related QOL (Short Form 12), and frailty (VES) twelve months after
      enrollment.

      The study length will be six years with a six month start-up period followed by a planned 50
      month enrollment and twelve month follow-up.
