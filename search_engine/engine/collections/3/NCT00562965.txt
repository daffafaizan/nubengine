      because it was unlikely that the study would meet the estimated enrollment of approximately
      978 subjects. The decision was not prompted by the identification of any safety signals in
      this or other studies. Active treatment and follow-up of the already enrolled subjects was
      continued. On July, 22th 2010 , the study was amended to shorten the long-term follow-up to
      one year after active treatment.
