      pandemic threat. Elderly persons, young children, and individuals with chronic medical
      conditions have the greatest risk for complications or death from influenza infection.
      Neuraminidase inhibitors are currently licensed for the treatment and prevention of influenza
      if started early in the course of illness, but little is known regarding the effects of
      oseltamivir (one neuraminidase inhibitor) on illness severity when initiated later in the
      course of illness. Greater knowledge of the treatment effects is urgently needed for optimal
      management of seasonal influenza, and to maximize use of a limited stockpile of antiviral
      drugs in the event of an influenza pandemic.
