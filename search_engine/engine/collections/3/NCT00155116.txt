      were progresses in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, the incidence and mortality
      rate of lung cancer increased in recent years. In many cases, lung cancer is not diagnosed
      and treated until cancer cells have already invaded surrounding tissues and metastasized
      throughout the body. Only 15% of lung cancer patients were operable at presentation and about
      half of them had long term survival. The remaining almost died of metastatic disease.
      Detecting lung cancers when they are at their earliest stages, and identify cancers with
      metastatic potential will have a higher probability of truly curing the disease. Molecules
      that are expressed uniquely or at high level by tumor cells in comparison to normal tissues
      and that may be secreted into accessible fluids such as blood, urine, or sputum may be useful
      as lung cancer biomarkers. By using tools in SAGE Genie of Cancer Genome Anatomy Project
      (CGAP), we identified a secreted protein, SERPIN D1, as an overexpressed gene in non-small
      cell lung cancer as compared with normal lung and any other normal tissue. In an established
      panel of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with different invasive activities (CL1-0 cells
      and its sublines CL1-1, and CL1-5, in ascending order of activity), we detected that the
      expression of SERPIN D1 was higher in CL1-5 than in CL1-0 and CL1-1. According to our
      preliminary results, we hypothesize that SERPIN D1 may play a role in lung cancer invasion
      and metastasis and may serve as a serum biomarker for prognosis stratification. For this
      study, we are going to evaluate the potential correlation between SERPIN D1 expression in
      clinical specimen (including surgical specimen and blood sample) and lung cancer metastasis.
