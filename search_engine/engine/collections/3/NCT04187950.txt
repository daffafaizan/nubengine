    
      This clinical trial will be a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study with two
      2-week treatment conditions separated by at least a 4-week washout period between conditions.
      Participant flow through the study conditions will be counterbalanced. Participants will be
      randomly allocated to yogurt with honey first or control first. Before beginning the first
      intervention period, participants will undergo a 2-week lead-in period that is devoid of all
      supplemental and dietary probiotics, fermented dairy products, and fermented foods.
      Participants will be asked to refrain from consuming all supplemental and dietary probiotics,
      fermented dairy products, and fermented foods throughout the entire study.
