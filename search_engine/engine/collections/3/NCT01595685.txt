    
      A single-center randomized active-controlled open-label superiority trial

        -  Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive telbivudine (600 mg/day) or ongoing
           entecavir (0.5 mg/day) for 48 weeks.

        -  Eligible patients will be randomized using blocks of permuted treatment assignments
           after stratification by HBsAg level (1,000 IU/mL-5,000 IU/mL and ≥5,000 IU/mL IU/mL) and
           by entecavir treatment duration (1 year-2 year, ≥2 year).

        -  Because over 98% of Korean patients with CHB have HBV genotype C,9 HBV genotype will not
           determined or be regarded as a stratification factor.

        -  There will be no interruption in entecavir therapy before randomization.

        -  Patients' treatment information will be retrospectively collected during entecavir
           treatment phase as well (DNA change, HBeAg status, HBsAg titre, ALT, and treatment
           duration. etc)

        -  Patients will be screened within 4 weeks before randomization to determine study
           eligibility.
