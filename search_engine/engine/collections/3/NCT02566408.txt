      I. To assess physical activity beliefs, attitudes and preferences (KAPs) of breast cancer
      (BCa) survivors to inform the development of a physical activity (PA) intervention that will
      foster initial enrollment and sustained participation, particularly for African American (AA)
      and socioeconomic status (SES)-disadvantaged BCa survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      INTERVIEWS AND GROUP DISCUSSION: Participants undergo a 2-hour one-on-one interview about
      their KAPs towards PA. Ten topics will be used to explore older women's attitudes toward PA:
      (a) terminology used to describe PA; (b) meaning of PA to older women; (c) usual PA during
      daily life; (d) perceived influences and benefits of PA on body and mind; (e) recent changes
      in PA and their influences on women's daily life; (f) facilitators and barriers to older
      women's participation in PA; (g) preferences for PA in general and specific types of PA; (h)
      age-related differences in attitudes toward PA; (i) ethnic differences in attitudes toward
      PA; (i) SES-related differences in attitudes toward PA; and (j) overall feeling about PA. Six
      topics will also be used to explore ethnic-specific and culture-specific contexts that
      surround older women's participation in PA: (a) older women's daily life schedules, and
      hardships and sufferings in daily lives; (b) culturally unique aspects of women's daily
      lives; (c) age-related difficulties and advantages in daily lives influencing older women's
      participation in PA; (d) ethnicity-related, cultural-related and SES-related difficulties and
      advantages in daily lives influencing women's participation in PA; (f) culturally available
      support for PA and women's preferences for support; and (g) older women's preferences for PA
      promotion programs.

      REFINEMENT OF THE PA INTERVENTION: Approximately 1-2 months after the conclusion of
      interviews, participants are invited to a joint session and presented with results of
      analyzed data. Participants are asked to review results and themes identified from
      interviews, and to concur whether conclusions capture their KAPs. Through this process a set
      of preferences that is agreed upon by all as most critical for enhancing PA participation,
      adherence, and retention will be identified.
