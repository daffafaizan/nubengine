    
      This study is designed to evaluate user/physician preference as it relates to use of a 510(k)
      cleared vascular access peripheral IV catheter device compared with peripheral IV
      conventional needle/catheter devices, in terms of first stick success rates, adverse events
      and overall user and patient satisfaction. As noted above, the study is designed to formally
      test the hypothesis that the AccuCathâ„¢ System will exhibit superiority in terms of the rate
      of successful first attempt peripheral IV placement and higher user and patient satisfaction
      compared to Conventional IV Catheters.
