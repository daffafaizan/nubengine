      Investigators propose three specific aims:

        1. Examine the hyperexcitability of the afferent-pelvic floor brain axis in 60 patients
           with IBS by measuring the cortical evoked potentials (CEP) and sensory thresholds after
           electrical stimulation of the rectum and anus before and after administration of
           linaclotide or placebo for a period of 10 weeks.

        2. Study the efferent brain pelvic floor axis by stimulating the cortex with transcranial
           magnetic stimulation and record the anal and rectal motor evoked potentials (MEP) in 60
           IBS-C patients.

        3. Determine the locus for neuronal modulation i.e are the neuroenteric changes due to
           central or peripheral neuronal sensitization or both, by evoking anal and rectal MEPs
           after selectively stimulating the lumbar and sacral nerves bilaterally, and by comparing
           segmental with transcranial-induced MEPs.
