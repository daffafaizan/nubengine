      ears, hearing loss and often a fullness in the ear. Currently there is no definitive test to
      diagnose the problem. It is believed to be caused by inner ear abnormalities, specifically of
      an over-collection of lymphatic fluid.The goal of this trial is to determine if an MRI with
      double dose of IV gadolinium can be diagnostic.
