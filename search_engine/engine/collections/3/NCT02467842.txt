    
      In a randomized controlled phase III trial undertaken in 10 university hospitals of South
      Korea, adults and elderly subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to NBP607-QIV
      versus cell culture-based trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), NBP607-Y and
      NBP607-V. Immunogenicity was assessed 3 weeks after vaccination by hemagglutination
      inhibition (HI) assay. Safety was assessed for 6 months post-vaccination: solicited adverse
      events for 7 days, unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for 21 days and serious adverse events
      (SAE) for 6 months.
