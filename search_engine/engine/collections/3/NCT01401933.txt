    
      This study is designed to explore the drug interaction between rifampin and linifanib to
      determine the potential effect of rifampin on the metabolism of linifanib. Linifanib will be
      taken alone or in combination with rifampin. The safety of a single dose administration of
      linifanib when administered alone and in combination with rifampin will be assessed. Subjects
      may enroll in a separate extension study to continue receiving linifanib after completion of
      this study.
