    
      This is a multicenter, prospective study containing 3 parts:

      Part 1 consists of Part 1A (optimization/training) and Part 1B (evaluation/testing) as
      follows:

      Part 1A will optimize the OctavaPink test for women with dense breast tissue, and will not
      affect the treatment of the participants. Part 1A is an internal part done by EventusDx and
      no statistical evaluation is needed.

      Objectives: To optimize the OctavaPink test, with the target of ≥95% specificity and ≥70%
      sensitivity.

      Part 1B will assess the properties of the OctavaPink test using cases and controls obtained
      via the same criteria as in Part 1A. The sensitivity and specificity of the OctavaPink test
      must be confirmed as sufficiently high in samples in which EventusDx is blind to case/control
      status before using the test to affect clinical management of patients.

      Objectives:

      (i) To obtain a sensitivity estimate ≥60% with 95% CI lower limit ≥50% in the whole group of
      cancer cases (DCIS, IDC and ILC); also to obtain a sensitivity estimate with the same
      properties in the subset of cases with invasive cancer (IDC and ILC).

      (ii) To obtain a specificity estimate ≥90% in controls with 95% CI lower limit ≥85%.

      Part 2 will examine the yield of cancer detection by MRI/biopsy among women who have a
      positive OctavaPink test result in the dense breast negative mammography population.

      Objectives:

      (i) To compare the yield of cancer detection via MRI/biopsy among women with a positive
      OctavaPink test versus a negative OctavaPink test result.

      (ii) To estimate the proportion of patients who are positive for the test in the target
      population

      Part 3 will assess sensitivity of OctavaPink test in an enriched population of women with
      dense breasts and negative mammography.

      Objectives: To obtain an estimate of sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue and
      negative mammography that is broadly consistent with that found in the dense breast
      population (but not necessarily negative mammogram) in Parts 1A and 1B.
