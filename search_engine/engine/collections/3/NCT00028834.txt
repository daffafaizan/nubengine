      I. To determine the objective response rate of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who
      are treated with gemcitabine plus bevacizumab.

      II. To determine the toxicity experienced by patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are
      treated with gemcitabine plus bevacizumab.

      III. To determine median and overall survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who
      are treated with gemcitabine plus bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure plasma VEGF and serum VCAM-1 levels before, during, and after therapy as a
      predictor of outcome.

      II. To collect and store serum samples for possible future assessment of other antiangiogenic
      inhibition markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
