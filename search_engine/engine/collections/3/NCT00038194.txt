        1. To define the maximum tolerated dose of weekly docetaxel in combination with fixed-dose
           oral STI571 in adult men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC).

        2. To determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of the combination of oral STI571
           and docetaxel.

        3. Evaluate PSA modulation with STI571 alone at thirty days in patients with AIPC.

        4. Obtain a preliminary estimate of the response rate in AIPC to the combination of STI571
           and docetaxel.

        5. Obtain tissue for correlative science studies (these are optional studies).
