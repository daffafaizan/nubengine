      Nalbuphine (Group B) in the following items over the first 7 days of initiation:

        1. Pain intensity VAS every 12 hours and during the performing of mouth care for each
           patient over the first 7 days.

        2. Total opioid consumptions for each patient every 24 hours and the total consumption of
           the entire 7 days since initiation.

        3. Number of active and total pushes of PCA buttons every 24 hours and the sum up of the
           active and total pushes of PCA buttons for each patient over the 7 days.

        4. Patient satisfaction at the end of the 7 days. Patient satisfaction score PSS was
           assessed using a linear scale where 0=very satisfied; 10=very dissatisfied (14).

        5. Serious adverse events. (Nausea and vomiting, pruritus, respiratory depression, urinary
           retention, sedation, bradycardia, hypotension).
