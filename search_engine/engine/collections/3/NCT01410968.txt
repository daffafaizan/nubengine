    
      Primary Objectives

        1. Assess the safety of this treatment by evaluating the qualitative and quantitative
           toxicities in this group of patients.

        2. Determine the feasibility of generating dendritic cells and administering these cells as
           a vaccine to patients.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Assess anti-tumor activity after vaccination, measured by change in tumor burden and
           overall survival.

        2. Assess immunological responses after vaccination (antigen-specific T cell cytokine
           production, antigen-specific T cell frequencies by tetramer analysis, and DTH reactions)
