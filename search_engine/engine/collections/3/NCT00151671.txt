      mortality rate can reach 10% and morbidity (ascites, icteria, infections) 70%. These
      complications are mainly due to hepatic insufficiency: surgery leaves a reduced parenchyma,
      with oxidative stress lesions due to reperfusion injury. A good preoperative nutritional
      state has been shown to reduce complications and mortality. This can be amplified by
      preoperative nutrition with supplements containing L-arginin, Ï‰3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      and nucleotides which boost immune responses, resistance to infections and liver function
      recovery. In this context, the study randomly assigns 50 patients who were scheduled to
      undergo hepatic resection, to receive either an oral immune-enhancing nutritional supplement
      or a placebo, for the 7 last preoperative and the first 3 postoperative days. The aim of the
      study is to evaluate the effects of this supplementation on liver function, immunity, and
      incidence of infections after surgery.
