      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome
      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.
      Pulmonary hypertension has now been identified as a major cause of death in adults with
      sickle cell disease. Similarly, pulmonary hypertension has been identified as a chronic
      complication of hemolytic disorders such as thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis and
      paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Sildenafil has been proposed as a possible therapy for
      both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension and recent phase I/II studies from the
      intramural NIH suggest it is well tolerated and efficacious in this population. Furthermore,
      a number of recent studies have suggested that NO based therapies may have a favorable impact
      on sickle red cells at the molecular level and could improve the abnormal microvascular
      perfusion that is characteristic of sickle cell anemia.

      This clinical trial is designed with three major objectives: 1) to assess cardiopulmonary
      function in patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia with and without pulmonary
      hypertension, 2) to determine the relative acute vasodilatory effects of sildenafil, and
      inhaled NO in patients with hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension and 3) to determine
      the chronic effects of the addition of inhaled NO on pulmonary hemodynamics and functional
      capacity in patients with hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension chronically treated
      with sildenafil.
