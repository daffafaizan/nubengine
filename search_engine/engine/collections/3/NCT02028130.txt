      long-term outcomes in treating persistent AF are variable, often requiring more than one
      procedure to maintain long-term freedom from AF. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins
      (PVs) is central to catheter ablation strategies, with the majority of paroxysmal AF
      recurrences being associated with reconnection of previously isolated PVs. Persistent AF is
      different, with recurrences being attributable to foci and or substrate outside the PVs,
      including the left atrial appendage (LAA). Recently, a non-randomised, consecutive study of
      987 patients undergoing repeat catheter ablation for persistent (82%) and paroxysmal (18%) AF
      has demonstrated that almost 30% of recurrences were due to an LAA focus and that the
      addition of LAA electrical isolation to a standard persistent AF ablation strategy improves
      freedom from AF.

      Percutaneous LAA occlusion has been demonstrated to be as effective as warfarin in reducing
      the risk of thromboembolic stroke in patients with AF. The combination of a standard AF
      ablation lesion set with LAA electrical isolation and LAA occlusion may be an elegant method
      of improving success rates of ablation for persistent AF whilst also mitigating stroke risk
      and reducing the bleeding risks from long-term anticoagulation. However, the feasibility and
      safety of concomitant endocardial electrical isolation and mechanical occlusion of the LAA is
      not known.

      In this study we test the hypothesis that concomitant electrical isolation of the LAA and its
      occlusion with a Watchman device, following a standard persistent AF lesion set is feasible
      and safe.
