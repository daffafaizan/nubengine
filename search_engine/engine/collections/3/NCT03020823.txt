      anticancer action with a vascular disrupting activity that has the potential for treatment of
      various malignancies, particularly for patients with drug resistance. The drug has been
      studied in human subjects in a dose escalation phase I study and has shown to be safe for up
      to 2 cycles of 24 mg/m2 (each cycle consisting of one intravenous [i.v.] administration of
      SCB01A via a central line every 3 weeks). In the phase I study, partial response (PR)
      (shrinkage of tumor size to 50%) was observed in cycle 9 (3 mg/m2) of one subject with right
      buccal squamous cell carcinoma and 19/33 (58%) subjects had stable disease (SD) for more than
      2 cycles.

      Pre clinical study of SCB01A showed that the concentrations at which tubulin inhibition
      occurred were around 80 nM for 24-hour exposure or 200 nM for 6-hour exposure. However,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) results of phase I study showed that the average elimination half-life
      (t1/2) of a 3-hours i.v. infusion of SCB01A is approximately 2.5 hours and almost no SCB01A
      can be detected after 10 hours, indicating most subjects were treated in short API exposure
      time and may have been insufficient to achieve efficacy. Therefore, to extend the exposure
      duration above effective concentration in blood may increase the treatment efficacy.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of i.v. infusion for 24-hour of
      SCB01A in subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck who have failed previous
      platinum based therapies.
