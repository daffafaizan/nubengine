      subjects will receive oral immunotherapy for their specific food allergies (peanut, milk,
      egg, soy, wheat, cashew, walnut, almond, hazelnut, cod, salmon, sesame, shrimp). All
      participants will receive three doses of Omalizumab 4 weeks apart over 8 weeks. The subject's
      allergens will be introduced after receiving the third omalizumab dose. Subjects will return
      to clinic to escalate the dose of their allergens until 300 mg (group A) vs. 1200 mg (group
      B) total protein daily dose is reached. There will be equivalent allergen protein portions
      depending on test allergen per each subject's history. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      either group A or group B after meeting eligibility criteria. All subjects and study
      personnel will be blinded to group A vs B.

      Food protein and powder will be obtained and prepared as per Investigational New Drug 14831
      and will be in compliance with all applicable regulations.
