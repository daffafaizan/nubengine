      Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA). Valortim is designed to target PA, which is one
      of three plasmid-encoded proteins that together form the toxins released by B. anthracis.
      Individually, these proteins (protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF) and edema factor
      (EF)) are inactive. Toxic effects require the transport of LF and EF into the host cell,
      mediated by the activity of PA. Valortim binds to PA and interferes with the activity of the
      toxins. Based on both non-clinical and clinical data, Valortim may have utility for the pre-
      and post-exposure prophylaxis of individuals exposed to, or at risk of exposure to, B.
      anthracis and for the treatment of individuals displaying symptoms of inhalational anthrax.
      Because the treatment of inhalational anthrax includes the use of antibiotics such as
      tetracyclines, it is necessary to demonstrate that there are no adverse interactions between
      newer therapeutic interventions and these medications. The purpose of this study is to assess
      the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline (a commonly used tetracycline for both treatment and
      post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax) and Valortim following co-administration, as well as
      the safety and tolerability of these medications when administered concomitantly. These data
      are intended to support the use of Valortim as a treatment for inhalational anthrax.
