    
      IFT is an intensive combinatory family treatment which is child-oriented, and traditionally
      used in an inpatient family treatment unit in child and adolescent psychiatry.

      Measures include ones on bonding (PBI), personality traits (NEO-PI), anxiety and depressive
      symptoms (HADS), attributional tendencies (PAT) and social desirable responding (BIDR). A
      subgroup was also assessed before a waiting period (pre-treatment).
