      PET imaging of uPAR (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor). The tracer has the potential
      of identifying the invasive cancer phenotype, thereby distinguishing between aggressive and
      less aggressive tumors. This is a first in human study to test the radiotracer in cancer
      patients. The biodistribution and tumor uptake will be evaluated by repeated PET scans (10
      minutes, 1 and 2 hours post injection). The primary end points are safety, biodistribution
      and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105. In addition, the quantitative uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105
      will be compared to the expression of uPAR measured directly in tumor tissue obtained by
      surgery or biopsies. The project will be monitored and evaluated in accordance with the
      principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).
