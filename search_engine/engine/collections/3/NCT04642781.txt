      grades 2-5 recruited from 4 different primary schools in German speaking Switzerland. Two
      texts of The New International Reading Speed Test (IReST) of similar difficulty are presented
      on a laptop in randomized order. Children are asked to read the text aloud while eye
      movements are recorded with an eye tracking bar. The following parameters are analysed:
      reading speed (words/minute), number of saccades, number of fixations.
