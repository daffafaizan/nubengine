      shoulder pain with a painful arc of motion, and/or pain on active or passive motions. The
      diagnosis of SAB requires confirmation by an infiltration with local anesthetic. Previous
      study showed that corticosteroid injection is more effective than hyaluronic acid in
      treatment of chronic SAB, however, some (about 20%) patients were not responsive to
      corticosteroid injection, and some responsive patients may have recurrence of symptoms. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate whether combination of corticosteroids SASD
      injections and physiotherapy is more effective than either treatment alone in chronic SAB.
