      DNR (50 mg/m2 d 1, 3, 5), cytarabine (100 mg/m2 d1-10), etoposide (100 mg/m2 d1-5) followed
      by an intensive consolidation with cytarabine (500 mg/m2/q12 hrs d1-d6) and the same
      anthracycline as in induction on d 4-6. Following consolidation, eligible pts (age <45 or 55
      yrs) with a HLA compatible sibling had to be allografted, the others, had to be autografted
      with autologous peripheral stem cell (PSC) collected during recovery from consolidation.

      BM and PB samples at diagnosis were centralized according to a national GIMEMA original study
      planned with the aim to accurately evaluate biological characteristics at diagnosis and to
      identify genetic alterations with prognostic relevance and to follow up cases monitoring
      minimal disease during remission. To allow the adequate collection and sending of samples
      before starting intensive chemotherapy, all patients received a 5-day pretreatment consisting
      of hydroxiurea (HU) at the dosage of 2 g/m2/day, also effective for "debulkying" of disease.
