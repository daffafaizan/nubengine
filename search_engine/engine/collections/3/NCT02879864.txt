      Some studies have shown an inverse relationship between cancer-related fatigue and the time
      of exposure to natural light for cancer patients. This association suggests the existence of
      a vicious circle of side effects of chemotherapy (physical fatigue and moral), itself causing
      a decrease in outdoor activity and therefore a reduction of the light exposure time natural.
      This results in a strengthening of the initial patient's state of fatigue. In an interesting
      way, vitamin D synthesized in large part due to light plays a cancer protective role],
      especially in the prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancer for example. Furthermore and
      paradoxical way, the disruption of circadian rhythms is correlated to the development and
      tumor progression in vitro, in vivo tumor growth and incidence of cancer in humans.

      Notoriously, the direct effect of light therapy on cancer-related fatigue has been little
      discussed in the literature. Data obtained from a small sample of patients indicate that
      light therapy improves quality of life by reducing fatigue in patients with breast cancer
      during chemotherapy. To date, There are no data on the effects of light therapy on
      cancer-related fatigue in general, patients treated with chemotherapy.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the role of light therapy on cancer-related
      fatigue in patients during the 6 months following initiation of first-line chemotherapy.

      Primary objective

      To assess the effects of daily therapy on fatigue of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic cancer treated with chemotherapy.

      secondary objective

      Evaluate the impact of daily light therapy on quality of life, pain, anxiety and depression,
      tolerance of chemotherapy and medico-economic benefits.
