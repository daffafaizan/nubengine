      orally once daily for 5 years) on 5 year overall survival (OS) for stage II and III colon
      cancer patients of 45 years of age and older. Preclinical, epidemiologic and clinical
      evidence suggest that acetylsalicylic acid use may reduce overall cancer risk and mortality
      in colon cancer patients. It is a phase III double blind placebo controlled, randomized trial
      of adjuvant low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in colon cancer patients. Patients will be
      stratified at randomization by centre, age (<70 and â‰¥70 years) chemotherapy use (any versus
      none) and disease stage.
