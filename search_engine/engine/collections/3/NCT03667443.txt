      resistant to Myo-inositol treatment for ovulation induction, probably due to the presence of
      malabsorption caused by gut dysbiosis. The most recent evidence proposes dysbiosis and
      related chronic low-grade inflammation as the new DOGMA behind PCOS pathogenesis. In this
      regard, the recent findings on alpha-lactalbumin reports its effect in improving the
      absorption of different nutrients including myo-inositol as well as a crucial factor for
      reducing inflammation. Furthermore, this whey protein is well known for its effect as trophic
      agent for gastrointestinal flora in infants. For all these reasons, the investigators expect
      that the treatment with Inofolic HP (Myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin) will get an efficacy
      20-25% higher than the treatment with inofolic.
