      from LDCTT scans can be significant and increase the lifetime risk of inducing a second
      cancer. The aim of this project is to determine whether a 75% reduction in radiation dose for
      LDCTT in other words, an ultralow dose chest CT (uLDCTT) at a dose comparable to chest X-ray,
      maintains the diagnostic image quality for detection of fungal chest infection in IC
      patients. If successful, uLDCTT will be adopted as SOC imaging at Princess Margaret Cancer
      Center (PM) for these patients.
