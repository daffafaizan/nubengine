      affects clinical outcome, and the rate of re-stenosis. These studies suggest that angiography
      alone is not sufficient to ensure proper vascular stent deployment, and that re-stenosis
      rates will decline if proper stent apposition has occurred. The importance of proper stent
      sizing and apposition is further emphasised with the increasing use of drug eluting stents,
      the drug effects of which are only realized upon contact with the arterial wall.

      Angiometrx Inc. developed the Metricath Arterial Measurement System in response to the need
      for increased stent sizing and deployment. The Metricath System measures the diameter and
      cross sectional area of arteries using an intravascular balloon catheter attached to a
      computerized console. Considering the ease and rapidity of obtaining Metricath results, this
      technique may form an alternative to evaluate vessel area and stent expansion.

      The Metricath System was 510(k) cleared in the U.S. in June, 2003, and received European and
      Canadian market approvals in 2004.

      Angiometrx Inc. has now developed the next generation of Metricath System, which incorporates
      a second balloon on the catheter, intended for angioplasty purposes. The Metricath Gemini
      System is comprised of a dual balloon catheter which is attached to the same Metricath
      computerized console as the Metricath System. As with the Metricath System, the Metricath
      Console operates the inflation and deflation of the Gemini measurement balloon and provides
      arterial cross-sectional area and diameter. The Metricath Gemini angioplasty balloon is
      controlled separately in the traditional manner using a hand-held inflation device, attached
      to a port in the hub of the catheter.
