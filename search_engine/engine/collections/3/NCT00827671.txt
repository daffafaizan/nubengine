      adenocarcinoma and gastro-oesophageal junctional tumors with curative intent. Surgery in
      combination with peri-operative chemotherapy, using the combination epirubicin, cisplatin and
      5-FU, as defined by the recent MAGIC trial, results in 13% increase in 5-yr survival. To
      improve the outcome of patients with this disease we hypothesize that the addition of
      pre-operative combined cetuximab-radiotherapy (cetux-RT) treatment could improve the outcome
      of this patient category through better local control.
