      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of erlotinib when administered in combination
           with docetaxel and carboplatin as front-line therapy in patients with newly diagnosed
           stage III or IV ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of maintenance therapy with erlotinib when administered after
           front-line therapy in these patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients who are able to receive the full schedule of
           treatment courses.

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with measurable or evaluable disease
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib.

        -  Front-line therapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on day 1, pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2, and oral erlotinib once daily
           on days 3-16. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses.

      Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after the completion of front-line therapy,
           patients with stable or responding disease receive oral erlotinib once daily for up to
           12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then
      periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
