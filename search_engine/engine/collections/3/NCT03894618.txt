      expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity and
      pharmacodynamic effects of SL-279252 in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. The
      study design consists of Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts. In the dose escalation
      phase of the study, subjects will be enrolled into sequential dose levels. During dose
      escalation, two possible schedules for administration of SL-279252 may be explored. The MTD
      or MAD may be determined for either schedule. Based on accumulating data from the dose
      escalation phase, including safety, PK, pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor activity, up to two
      dose expansion cohorts may be opened. The primary objective of the expansion phase is to
      further refine the safety and tolerability of SL-279252. The expansion cohorts will evaluate
      one or two doses of SL-279252 using one selected schedule. At the end of dose escalation and
      dose expansion, safety, PK, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacodynamic data will be reviewed to
      identify the RP2D.
