        1. To investigate the safety of auto-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy among children and young
           adults with refractory/relapsed B-cell ALL on the basis of prospective evaluation of
           adverse affects frequency and severity according to CTCAE v.4

        2. To study the efficacy of auto-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy among children and young adults
           with refractory/relapsed B-cell ALL on the basis of proportion of patients in
           haematological and molecular remission at 28 days after infusion.

        3. To evaluate long-term efficacy of auto-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy among children and young
           adults with refractory/relapsed B-cell ALL on the basis of overall and event-free
           survival at 1 and 3 years after infusion.

      The novelty of this study will be cytokine release syndrome prophylaxis by tocilizumab
      Patients will receive fludarabine 120 mg/m2 (totally) intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days -5 to -2 and cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes on day -2. One hour prior to
      infusion of CAR T-cells patients will receive tocilizumab IV 8 mg/kg (max 800 mg) over 1
      hour. Patients then receive CD19-CAR T cells IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0.

      This is a dose-escalation study of CD19-CAR T cells. Dose escalation consistently:

        -  Level 1 5х105/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes

        -  Level 2 1х106/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes

        -  Level 3 3х106/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes

        -  Level 0 1х105/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes (in case of dose-limiting toxicity at dose Level
           1) In case of severe side affects next dose will be reduced to the previous lower dose.
