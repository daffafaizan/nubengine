      and patients are then randomized to receive treatment either using Reciproc Files or ProTaper
      Next files. Postoperative pain is then assessed using the Numerical Rating scale 6, 12, 24
      and 48 hours post-instrumentation. The tooth is then temporized and after 1 week obturation
      is then and post obturation pain is assessed using the Numerical Rating scale after 12 and 24
      hours following obturation. The time required to complete instrumentation is also measured
      and compared using the two files.
