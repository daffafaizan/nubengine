      development. Arthrosis is one of the most important causes of disability and its treatment
      with prosthetic surgery is associated with a high cost, and is not free of other
      complications. Several studies of cell therapy with autologous chondrocytes have shown
      efficacy in the treatment of this type of lesions, and currently is a common technique for
      the treatment of focal lesions of articular cartilage. Autologous chondrocyte transplant is
      associated with morbidity of the cartilage sample removal, which needs intra-articular
      surgery, and the limited tissue sample for culture. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells (ASC) have demonstrated chondrocytic differentiation and have been used in animal
      models for articular cartilage repair. Adipose tissue yields more ASC than chondrocytes are
      obtained from cartilage, and liposuction is simple and with less adverse events than
      arthroscopy. It is worth mentioned that culture conditions are less stringent for ASC than
      for chondrocytes, in terms of number of passages to obtain the amount of cells needed for
      implantation.

      We propose a randomized clinical trial, in which we compare the surgical implantation of
      either autologous chondrocytes or autologous ASC to treat chondral knee lesions.
