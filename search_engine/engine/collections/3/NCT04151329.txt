    
      main purpose: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT8001 in combination with BAT1306
      in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, and to explore the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) to determine the recommended dose for phase II clinical trials (RP2D). Secondary
      purpose: (1) Evaluation of pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenic characteristics of BAT8001 in
      combination with BAT1306. (2) Preliminary evaluation of the antitumor efficacy of BAT8001 in
      combination with BAT1306. Exploratory purpose: To explore the efficacy-related biomarkers of
      BAT8001 in combination with BAT1306 in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.
