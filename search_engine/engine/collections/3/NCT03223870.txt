    
      1. Start data collection system(s) and allow them to run 15 minutes prior to study start of
           each subject.

        2. Confirm that the subject meets inclusion/exclusion criteria and has signed the current
           IRB- approved Informed Consent Form

        3. Collect Demographic and Anthropometric Data from the subject.

        4. Place Pulse Oximetry Sensors

        5. Place nasal cannula for capnography recordings

        6. A summary of Respiratory rate protocol.

             1. Stage 1: Subject will rest quietly and breathe at a normal comfortable rate for 40
                minutes. The start and stop times will be marked on the data collection system.

             2. Stage 2: Immediately after Stage 1 is complete, the subject will start the 25
                minute paced breathing protocol which will ramp from 5-45 BPM. A computer program
                will be used to guide the subject through the stage 2 paced breathing. The start
                and stop times will be marked on the data collection system.
