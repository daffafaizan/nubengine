    
      This is a single-arm, single institution phase 1a / 1b study to test the safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of MTA-based personalized vaccine in patients with newly
      diagnosed GBM along with the use of continual TTFields. MTA-based personalized vaccine is
      prepared in the laboratory with several peptides based on each patient's own tumor sequence.

      The vaccine is given after the radiation and chemotherapy portion of the treatment, in the
      maintenance phase of temozolomide in conjunction with the TTFields.
