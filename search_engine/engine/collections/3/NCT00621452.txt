    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex-vivo
      expanded autologous T cells genetically modified to express a "second generation' cluster of
      differentiation (CD)20-specific scFvFc:CD28:CD137:zeda chimeric immunoreceptor in patients
      with recurrent or refractory CD20+ mantle cell or indolent lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD20-specific T
      cells transfected with a CD20-specific scFvFc:CD28:CD137:zeda chimeric immunoreceptor.

      II. To assess the trafficking of CD20-specific T cells to lymphoma masses. III. To evaluate
      the development of host anti-CD20 scFvFc:CD28:CD137:zeda chimeric immunoreceptor and
      anti-neomycin-resistance gene (NeoR) immune responses in study subjects.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes.

      IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 2 days after completion of cyclophosphamide, patients receive
      autologous CD20-specific T-cells IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 2-5 days for 3
      courses.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 2 hours after the last T-cell infusion, patients receive
      low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously twice daily for 14 days.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Subjects who have achieved at least a partial remission lasting a minimum of 6 months may, on
      a case-by-case basis, receive additional stored T cells following relapse.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for one month, monthly
      for 1 year, and then annually for up to 2 years.
