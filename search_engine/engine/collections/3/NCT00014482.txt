        -  Compare the effects of music therapy vs no music therapy on depression and anxiety in
           patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing high-dose therapy and autologous stem
           cell transplantation.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on mood, mucositis pain, pain interference, need
           for analgesic medication, and length of hospital stay of these patients.

        -  Compare the immediate effects of these regimens on mood in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to whole body or whole
      lymphatic irradiation (yes vs no) and diagnosis (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs Hodgkin's lymphoma
      vs myeloma/amyloidosis). Patients are randomized to one of two arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive individualized music therapy over 20-30 minutes beginning on day
           0 and continuing over 16 days for a maximum of 12 sessions during high-dose therapy and
           autologous stem cell transplantation.

      Patients complete a Profile of Mood States (POMS) quality of life and pain questionnaire on
      days -2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard psychosocial support during high-dose therapy and
           autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients complete POMS and mucositis pain
           questionnaires as in arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
