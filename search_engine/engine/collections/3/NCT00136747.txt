      on the effects of nicotine on the brain and behavior presents an opportunity to advance
      medication development. Neurotransmission at NMDA receptors in the brain is associated with
      learning and memory and has been linked to many of nicotine's effects on humans. It is
      possible that altering NMDA neurotransmission may be helpful in treating nicotine addiction.

      The goal of this study is to develop a laboratory model for early-stage testing of new and
      existing compounds for the treatment of tobacco and nicotine addiction. Specifically, the
      study will assess the effect of memantine, a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, versus
      bupropion, a medication currently used to facilitate smoking cessation, on various behavioral
      aspects related to smoking behavior, including reinforcement and cue-reactivity.

      This double-blind, randomized assignment study will consist of three distinct phases
      (placebo, bupropion, and memantine). Each phase will include 10 days of outpatient medication
      maintenance, followed by 3 days of inpatient testing. During the outpatient phase, study
      visits will occur every 2 to 3 days. At these visits, compliance and side effects of
      medication will be monitored, smoking diaries will be collected, and medication will be
      dispensed. During the inpatient period participants will be allowed to smoke only at
      designated times. A variety of assessment will be conducted, including abstinence symptoms,
      acute effects of cigarettes, responses to cigarette cues, and cigarette self-administration.
