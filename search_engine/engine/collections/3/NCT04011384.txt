      economic intervention compared to a control group on the following outcomes among food pantry
      clients: 1) Nutritional quality of food chosen at the pantry using food transaction data; 2)
      Fruit and vegetable intake measured by biomarkers and food frequency questionnaires; 3)
      Objectively measured biomarkers of health. The web-based behavioral economic intervention
      will include the following modifications to the online shopping platform: 1) Healthy food
      shopping cart defaults, 2) healthy placement choice architecture, 3) traffic light nutrition
      labels, 4) social norms messaging, and 5) healthy swaps. Food transaction data will be
      collected from the online system at baseline and then continuously for the remaining 3 months
      of the study (participants typically shop monthly). Surveys and objective biomarkers will be
      collected at baseline and three-months.
