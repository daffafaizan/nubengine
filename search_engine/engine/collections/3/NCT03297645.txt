    
      RVA Breathes includes family-based asthma self-management education (delivered by Community
      Health Workers [CHWs] with the Institute for Public Health Innovation), homeenvironmental
      remediation (with Richmond City Health Department's Healthy Homes Initiative), and a
      schoolnurse component (with elementary schools in the Richmond City Public School System).
      These interventions capitalize among existing resources and relationships with stakeholders
      in Richmond, each of which is committed to RVA Breathes. Three-hundred children with asthma
      and their caregivers will participate in a randomized clinical trial of RVA Breathes. After
      completing a baseline assessment, families will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1)
      asthma education + home remediation + school intervention, 2) asthma education + home
      remediation and 3) comparator condition (Enhanced Standard of Care, E-SOC). Families will
      participate in the program for 9 months and complete follow-up assessments (post-treatment
      and 3-, 6-, and 9-month) to measure changes in healthcare utilization and the impact of the
      program on child asthma outcomes. Conditions will be compared on the primary outcomes of
      healthcare utilization, including asthma specific ED visits and hospital admissions, school
      absences, and controller medication use; secondary outcomes include asthma control, symptoms,
      and quality of life. We will also evaluate the sustainability of RVA Breathes after 9 months
      (without active intervention), including a review of qualitative data from participants and
      stakeholders in the program. Findings from this trial will allow for dissemination and
      implementation of RVA Breathes as a sustainable program in the Richmond are.
