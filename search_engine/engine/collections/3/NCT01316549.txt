    
      Fludarabine is a nucleoside analog with potent antitumor and immunosuppressive properties
      used in conditioning regimens of pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (alloHCT) to promote stem cell engraftment.

      This is a single-center, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) study investigating the
      clinical pharmacology of fludarabine in 45 children undergoing alloHCT at UCSF Benioff
      Children's Hospital.

      Patients would receive fludarabine regardless of whether or not they decide to consent to PK
      sampling.

      Fludarabine doses will not be adjusted based on PK data.

      We will apply the combination of a D-optimality-based limited sampling strategy and
      population PK methodologies to determine specific factors influencing fludarabine exposure in
      pediatric alloHCT recipients and identify exposure-response relationships.

      Subjects will undergo PK sampling of plasma (f-ara-a) and intracellular (f-ara-ATP) drug
      concentrations over the duration of fludarabine therapy (3 to 5 days).

      To evaluate sources of variability impacting fludarabine exposure clinical data will be
      obtained from the patient's medical chart on each day of PK sampling.

      A single blood draw for the collection of DNA and genotyping of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms of genes involved in fludarabine activation, transport or elimination will
      occur in all patients.

      To assess exposure-response relationships neutrophil engraftment, treatment-related toxicity,
      and survival data will be collected through day 100 post-transplant.
