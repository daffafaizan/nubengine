        -  Compare the efficacy of oral idarubicin and etoposide vs intravenous mitoxantrone,
           etoposide, and cytarabine as consolidation therapy in patients over 55 years old with
           acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these 2 regimens in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to number of courses
      of induction therapy required to achieve complete remission.

      All patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin IV on days 1-3 and
      cytarabine IV over 12 hours on days 1-7. Patients receive 1-2 courses of induction
      chemotherapy to achieve complete remission.

      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms for consolidation therapy after
      achieving complete remission.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive 2 courses of mitoxantrone IV on days 1 and 2, etoposide IV over
           1 hour on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 12 hours on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 2 courses of oral idarubicin and etoposide on days 1-3.

      Quality of life is assessed before each course of consolidation chemotherapy and 6-8 weeks
      after completion of therapy.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 400 patients will be accrued for this study.
