      tranexamic acid (TXA) to patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction
      with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft to minimize hemarthrosis within the knee joint and
      post operative pain. Patients received the standard arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with a
      BTB autograft and were randomized to either receiving or not receiving two individual doses
      of TXA intra-operatively or receive. The goal of the study is to determine and evaluate the
      effect of intra-operative TXA on post-operative hemarthrosis, pain reduction, and opioid
      consumption.
