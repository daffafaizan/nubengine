    
      The purpose of this study is to compare cemented and cementless versions of the Triathlon
      total knee arthroplasty/replacement (TKA) in terms of clinical outcomes, perioperative
      course, and outcome scores including function and patient satisfaction.

      Patients who present to the clinical practices of Dr. Ryan Nunley, Dr. Robert Barrack, or Dr.
      Denis Nam and are suitable candidates for primary TKA will be screened for eligibility and
      invited to participate. Once enrolled participants will be randomized (1:1) to either receive
      a cemented or cementless Triathlon TKA. Data collected for the study will include standard of
      care clinical and radiographic evaluations collected during office visits and surgery, as
      well as study-specific patient questionnaires. Clinical, radiographic and questionnaire data
      will be collected pre-operatively, at the time of surgery, and at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year
      and beyond, and 2 years and beyond post-operatively. Patients will complete the following
      outcomes questionnaires preoperatively: New Knee Society Score, Oxford Knee Score, UCLA
      Activity Score, SF-12, and EQ-5D. The following questionnaires will be collected at four to
      six weeks, six months, one year and beyond, and two years and beyond postoperatively: New
      Knee Society Score, Forgotten Joint Score, Washington University Knee Satisfaction and
      Function Questionnaire, Oxford Knee Score, UCLA Activity Score, SF-12, and EQ-5D, and a Pain
      Drawing. In addition, a Pain Diary with a pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be assessed
      once daily at home for 6 weeks after surgery.
