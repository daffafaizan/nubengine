      procedures with intravenous (IV) administration of unfractionated heparin. The Activated
      clotting time (ACT) is routinely measured to assess adequacy of anticoagulation to prevent
      clotting/thrombotic complications from placement of foreign materials used during cardiac
      surgery and cardiology procedures. Alternative methods to measure adequacy of anticoagulation
      such as measurement of Anti-Xa level and Reaction (R) time as assessed by
      Thromboelastrography (TEG) have also been suggested. However, their use in clinical practice
      is limited by lack of Point of Care (POC) technology and need for additional expertise to run
      these tests.

      The efficiency and promptness of heparin anticoagulation is necessary during the structural
      heart procedures to minimize time from insertion of cannulae to valve deployment in cardiac
      surgery. The time required to prevent major complications is on the order of seconds to
      minutes. The goal of this study is to determine how rapidly the adequacy of heparin induced
      anticoagulation occurs using two different point of care ACT technologies (iSTAT and
      Hemochron). It is hypothesized that anticoagulation can be determined by the iSTAT ACT device
      30 seconds after administration of heparin. Measuring heparin effectiveness at 30 or 90
      seconds instead of the usual 3-minute time period may allow for earlier cardiac intervention.
