      breast cancer have led to a small decline in overall breast cancer mortality in the last 20
      years. New advances will require understanding of breast cancer biology at the molecular
      level. Inhibition of COX-2 and its analysis of effect in breast cancer tumor microenvironment
      provide one such fruitful therapeutic target. Tumor microenvironment is poorly understood in
      breast cancer research. Despite new drugs being developed to treat breast cancer and tested
      in clinical trials, it is rarely possible to assess how the drug is affecting the breast
      cancer cells at a molecular level. The use of collagen properties such as alignment and
      deposition will allow giving a faster diagnosis of breast cancer status and seeing how
      celecoxib with respect to collagen can change the tumor microenvironment in human tissue.
      This window trial provides a way to look at cancer and stromal cells before and after
      celecoxib intake to see if the drug is actively working. If we can do this before and after a
      patient has surgery, and see how the tumor microenvironment responds, then the physician
      could pick a better suited adjuvant treatment for this patient after surgical intervention
      that would improve their overall survival rate.
