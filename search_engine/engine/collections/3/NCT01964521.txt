    
      Approximately 25-30 subjects from two to three centers will be evaluated provided they
      fulfill the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and gives a signed and
      dated consent.

      Subjects to be included were to suffer from a DFU and being in need of anti-microbial wound
      dressing.

      Dressing changes were to performed according to the local clinical routine (usually 3
      times/week), evaluated during a total treatment period of maximum 4 weeks including weekly
      visits when assessments were being done. A record (dressing log) for Mepilex Transfer Ag and
      outer layers were to be filled in at every dressing change.

      Photos taken directly upon dressing removal and after cleansing /debridement were to be
      collected to visually follow the ulcers status.

      At each visit the investigators/nurse and subjects opinion (using an evaluation form) were to
      be asked for questions considering the use of Mepilex Transfer Ag. Pain before, during and
      after removal will be assessed.
