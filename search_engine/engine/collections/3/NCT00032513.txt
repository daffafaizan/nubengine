      primary infection with EBV or markedly elevated titers of antibodies to EBV, (b) histological
      evidence of organ disease, and (c) elevated EBV DNA levels in the blood or EBV DNA or
      proteins in affected tissues. This is primarily a disease of children and young adults. Many
      of these patients develop hypogammaglobulinemia or pancytopenia and death is frequently due
      to opportunistic infections or B or T cell lymphoproliferative disease. The primary goal of
      this study is to identify genetic mutations responsible for CAEBV. The secondary goal of this
      study is to learn more about the natural history of CAEBV. Blood samples or available tissues
      (e.g. previous biopsy or autopsy material) from patients with CAEBV and their relatives will
      be analyzed to identify disease genes that are mutated in this population. In addition, some
      of the patients will be invited to come for evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center. At that
      time medically indicated studies of disease progression will be performed. Serial virologic
      and immunologic studies will be performed. Eligible relatives of patients will be studied to
      compare the gene(s) associated with CAEBV in patients with the gene(s) in their relatives.
      Knowledge gained from this study has the potential of providing insights into the immunologic
      control of EBV infections. In addition, identification of the molecular mechanisms for CAEBV
      may provide insights leading to improved treatments for this disease.
