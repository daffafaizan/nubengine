      confounding factors, and it rises only after loss of 50% of renal function. This time lost in
      rise of serum creatinine gives rise to the risk of missing time window that may be used to
      prevent progress of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI).

      NGAL and IL 18 are a panel of new biomarkers associated with acute kidney injury, and their
      levels correlate with an improvement of graft function in renal transplant recipients.
      Precise and early detection of a failing graft can prompt multiple investigations and
      interventions which may ultimately aid in maintaining the graft.

      The serum levels were measured to avoid the dilution effect and output variability of urine
      samples.

      The investigators measure the serum NGAL and IL-18 for the first 2 post-operative days after
      renal transplantation, and check if the trends correlate with long term graft survival and
      function.
