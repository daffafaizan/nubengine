      decreasing the risks of general anesthesia.The quality and duration of sensory and motor
      block and decrease post operative pain is important in the major abdominal cancer surgery and
      patient's content satisfaction. Opioids in high doses and other drug such as clonidine and
      neostigmine added to local anesthetics to this purpose, but significant side effects.

      Magnesium sulfate block the N- methyle -D- aspartate (NMDA) channels in a voltage-dependent
      way to be improve the quality and duration of spinal block. However, the use of magnesium
      sulfate safety profile has been documented by histopathological analysis in experimental
      studies. Systemic delivery of magnesium sulfate decrease postoperative opioid requirements.
      In experimental studies, spinal injection of magnesium sulfate reduces the respond to painful
      stimulus in rats.
