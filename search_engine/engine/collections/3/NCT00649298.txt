      associated with an increased duration of dialysis. As well as improved quality of life,
      improved functioning and beneficial changes in a variety of laboratory parameters, it has
      been suggested that extended dialysis sessions might reduce mortality and major morbidity.
      Uncontrolled data from centres that have been providing extended dialysis shows dramatically
      lower mortality rates compared to those observed in centres providing standard duration
      dialysis. Recent analyses of extended dialysis conclude that the savings achieved in drug and
      hospitalization costs may lead to an overall reduction in costs compared with traditional
      forms of dialysis.

      In this trial, we propose to examine the effects of extended dialysis (24 hours weekly or
      more) compared to standard dialysis (18 hours or less weekly) in patients with ESKD. The
      proposed study is a multi-centre, open label, randomised, controlled trial.

      The study began with a pilot phase which was converted to the current main study on the
      receipt of peer-reviewed funding for the full study.
