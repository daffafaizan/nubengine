      will be included as they are kept for 3 days in the hospital as opposed to 2 days for vaginal
      deliveries. If they meet inclusion criteria they will be asked to participate in the study,
      and consented. Each patient will receive routine postpartum care. The ambulatory blood
      pressure cuff will be introduced and validated on the particpant prior to discharge.
      Particpants will then be given specific instructions on when to place the cuff on their am
      and when to remove it. The ambulatory cuff will take blood pressure measurements every hour.
      The Particpant will be asked to keep a log of actives, symptoms, and pain medication use for
      the 72 hour period that her blood pressures are being recorded. The BP device will be
      returned to the department of OB/GYN at St. Mary's after completion of her 72 hours of
      monitoring. This will occur at her first post op visit. Particpants will be asked to complete
      a survey about comfort of device and return with the device. Information pertaining to their
      pregnancy and delivery will be collected while the patient is in the hospital. Particpants
      are not responsible for damage or loss of equipment.

      All of these procedures are part of the study.
