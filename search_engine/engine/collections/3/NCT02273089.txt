      mortality. Arterial stiffness, evaluated by pulse wave velocity, is related to
      atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. It has been reported that arterial stiffness is
      higher in patients with OSA than in healthy control groups, and it is assumed that it
      decreases after treatment with CPAP.

      In patients with OSA without daytime hypersomnolence it is not clear if CPAP has some
      benefits on cardiovascular events and hypertension.

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of CPAP therapy in an interventional cohort of
      patients with moderate to severe OSA, in which each patient will be is own control, for
      ethical reasons; the effect of CPAP therapy on the subcohorts of sleepy and of nonsleepy
      patients will be compared. The effect of a three months trial of CPAP will be assessed.
