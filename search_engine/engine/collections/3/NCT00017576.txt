      treated with calcitriol and carboplatin. II. Determine the palliative response in patients
      with cancer-related pain treated with this regimen. III. Determine the response in patients
      with bidimensionally measurable disease treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the duration
      of prostate-specific antigen, palliative, and measurable disease responses in patients
      treated with this regimen. V. Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.
      VI. Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. VII. Determine the
      qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on day 1 and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day
      2. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks until disease
      progression. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
