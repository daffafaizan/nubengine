      moderating effect of quality of object relations, personality disorder and gender will be
      explored. Methods and study design: The First Experimental Study of Transference Work-In
      Teenagers (FEST-IT) will be a randomized clinical trial with a dismantling design. The study
      is aimed to explore the effects of transference work in psychodynamic psychotherapy for
      adolescents with depression. One hundred patients ages 16 to 18 years old will be randomized
      to one of two treatment groups, in both of which general psychodynamic techniques will be
      used. The quality of adolescents' relationships will be a central focus of the study.The
      patients will be treated over 28 weeks with either a moderate level of transference
      intervention or no transference intervention. Follow-up will be at 1 year after treatment
      termination.

      Gender personality disorder (PD) and quality of object relations (QOR) will be the
      preselected moderators.

      The object of this clinical trial is to explore the effect of transference interventions in
      psychodynamic psychotherapy in adolescents with a major depressive disorder. Using a
      randomized and dismantling design, we hope that the study will add more specific knowledge to
      the evidence base.
