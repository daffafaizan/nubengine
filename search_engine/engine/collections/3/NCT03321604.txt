    
      KINDRED is a prospective observational cohort study that will enroll up to 5,000 dialysis
      patients throughout the United States with and without known diagnosis of Fabry disease but
      at risk for Fabry disease (e.g., unknown cause of renal disease, young male, initiating
      dialysis without a kidney biopsy, etc).This tissue repository will allow for genetic
      screening of a geographically diverse population, assist in identification of rare diseases
      in ESRD, and collect research-quality information on risk factors and outcomes from an
      ethnically heterogeneous population of dialysis patients. In this study, Investigators will
      use a novel method of performing research in this population by leveraging the internet to
      enhance and accelerate recruitment of potential subjects to participate in a genetic
      screening/tissue repository protocol.
