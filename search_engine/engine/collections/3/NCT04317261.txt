      ANXA10, UPK1B, CRH, and IGF2) in urine sample by real time RT-PCR. Previous studies had
      investigated the feasibility and diagnostic performance characteristics of Xpert monitor for
      surveillance of NMIBC patients (12, 13). It demonstrated a high SN and NPV in relation to
      urine cytology.

      On the other hand, metabolic dysfunction has been implicated in a wide variety of human
      diseases including BC (14). Growth and division of tumor cells are associated with an
      increase in the activity of a variety of metabolic pathways. Significant alterations in the
      carnitine-acylcarnitine metabolic pathways were detected in urine speci¬mens from BC patients
      compared to those of healthy controls (15). The expression of six genes involved in the
      carnitine-acylcarni¬tine metabolic pathway (CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2, SLC25A20, and CRAT)
      was assessed by Won and colleagues. CRAT and SLC25A20 were found to be significantly down
      regulated in BC patients (16).

      In this context, we aimed in the current study at prospective assessment of diagnostic
      performance characteristics of Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor (Xpert Monitor) test and urinary
      metabolomics (urinary metabolites of tissue mRNA genes expression CRAT and SLC 25A20) for
      bladder cancer detection in patients with hematuria.
