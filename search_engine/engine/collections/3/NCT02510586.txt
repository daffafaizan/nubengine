      receiving revascularization surgery. Previously its incidence has been reported to be 17~50%,
      but little remains regarding frequency of reperfusion injury after revascularization surgery
      in patients with moyamoya disease. Volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane has been
      introduced clinically to reduce reperfusion injury and preconditioning with sevoflurane
      induced ischemic tolerance like as ischemic preconditioning. However, there was no report on
      the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane postconditioning on ischemic/reperfusion injury in
      human brain. Therefore, We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane
      postconditioning on the incidence of postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome after
      revascularization surgery in moyamoya disease patients.
