      conducted in the US in support of licenses held by sanofi pasteur in various countries.

      Participants will be randomized to receive a dose of either Fluzone® or Fluzone® High-Dose
      vaccine and will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity. The duration of participation
      in the trial will be approximately 1 month.
