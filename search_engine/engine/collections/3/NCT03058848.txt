    
      This is an assessment of ten (10) infants who require a protein restricted diet that is low
      in Phe. Infants who routinely use a Phe free infant formula as part of their dietary therapy
      will be recruited for a 28-day assessment of PKU Start, to evaluate tolerance and
      acceptability.

      The outcome of this assessment will be used in a submission to the regulatory authorities,
      Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS), for PKU Start to become reimbursable on
      prescription in the UK.

      The participant's dietitian will advise on an appropriate amount of PKU Start based on
      individual requirements. Parents/carers will be asked to substitute their usual Phe-free
      infant formula with PKU Start for one (1) month. The sponsor will supply PKU Start free of
      charge.

      Prior to starting PKU Start, parents/carers will be asked to record information about the
      infant's usual GI tolerance and feeding pattern for a period of three (3) days, to allow for
      comparison between their existing formula and PKU Start.

      They will be asked to record information about the following:

      Stools Vomiting and Spit-up Feed / Fluid Intake and Compliance Phenylalanine Levels Final
      Evaluation about the presentation of the product, ease of preparation and how PKU Start
      flowed through the teat of a bottle.
