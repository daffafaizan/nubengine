    
      This is a single-center, blinded, randomized control trial of patients 18-years or older that
      are undergoing CMR as a standard of care at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon,
      NH. After informed consent is obtained, subjects undergo a study-specific external,
      non-invasive echocardiogram utilizing a special RV focused protocol on the same day of their
      CMR as close to their scheduled CMR as possible to minimize wait time for consented patients.
      The echocardiogram takes approximately an additional 30 minutes of the subject's time.

      De-identified echocardiogram images from each subject will be evaluated by experienced
      echocardiographers using three different methodologies (standard method, Phillips Novel
      technology and the newly developed UVRV algorithm). The methodologies will be compared with
      each other to determine sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.
