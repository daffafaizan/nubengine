      populations. Previous work by members of this research team has shown that telemedicine is an
      effective health information technology solution to address similar challenges in multiple
      vulnerable populations, demonstrating both improved access to care and reduced ED visits. The
      existing telemedicine program in Rochester, Health-e-Access (HeA), has been both successful
      and sustained, and well accepted by all key stakeholders including patients, families,
      clinicians, and insurers. This existing program, combined with the experience and
      multidisciplinary expertise of the investigators research team, creates a unique opportunity
      to (1) develop a model of care that leverages this technology to improve geriatric acute
      care, (2) evaluate this model through a prospective cohort study, and (3) identify key
      barriers and drivers of implementation to promote dissemination.
