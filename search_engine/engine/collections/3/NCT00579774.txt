      prevalence of cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, decline
      of renal function, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs can lead
      to activation of transcriptional pathways, excessive proliferative/growth-related phenomena
      and sustained inflammation and through these different mechanisms may contribute
      significantly to the clinical complications of aging. Recently, it has become clear that a
      major source of AGE precursors and OS is the Western diet. The body turnover of AGEs involves
      specific receptors and is also dependent on renal function.

      While experimental work has linked AGE-mediated OS and chronic complications in aging
      animals, human studies are strikingly lacking. We plan to test the following two hypotheses:
      1) older men and women (age > 60 years) who consume standard diets (usually high in AGE
      content) will have higher serum levels of AGEs in conjunction with higher markers of OS,
      vascular dysfunction and inflammation when compared with younger subjects (age < 35 but >18
      years), and 2) dietary AGE restriction will reduce the serum levels of AGE, markers of OS,
      vascular dysfunction and inflammation and attenuate the difference between older and younger
      groups.

      Specific aims:

      To determine the effect of dietary AGE modification for 4 months on circulating levels of
      AGEs, markers of oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, inflammatory mediators and
      AGE-receptor mechanisms in PBMN in old and young subjects. This will be a randomized study
      (Study 2).
