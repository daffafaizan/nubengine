    
      A clinical observation study to determine whether obesity during pregnancy is associated with
      altered immunogenicity of influenza and pertussis vaccines during pregnancy. The study will
      also assess vaccine specific antibody concentrations in cord blood collected from vaccinated
      women at the time of delivery to estimate any effect of obesity on transplacental transfer of
      antibodies and will measure and compare cytokine profiles between obese and non-obese
      participants to determine any correlation with immune responses. This study will enrol 150
      pregnant women (50 obese and 100 non-obese) during 2017-2019 to receive a recommended,
      licensed influenza vaccine (FluQuadri) as well as pertussis vaccination (Adacel) for women
      enrolled in their third trimester, as part of routine antenatal care. Local and systemic
      adverse events will be captured using a 7 day diary card and unexpected or serious adverse
      events will be recorded for the duration of the study. Blood samples will be collected to
      measure antigen specific vaccine antibody responses. The proportion of influenza vaccine
      recipients achieving seroprotective antibody titres at 4 weeks post vaccination and
      persisting at 6 months post vaccination be compared between obese and non-obese recipients.
