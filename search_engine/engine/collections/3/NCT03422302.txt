      I. To compare the two methods of tumor motion management, continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) and deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) and to estimate the decrease in tumor motion
      from free breathing for CPAP and DIBH.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if CPAP is a more time-efficient option for tumor motion management than is
      DIBH.

      Ia. Determine if CPAP is better tolerated by patients than is DIBH. Ib. Determine the
      reproducibility of lung expansion and tumor motion reduction by CPAP.

      Ic. Determine if the dosimetric coverage of the tumor and the sparing of the normal tissues
      with CPAP is comparable to that with DIBH.

      Id. Measure treatment time differences between CPAP and breath hold (DIBH) treatments.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo free-breathing, DIBH, and CPAP CT simulation scans. If patient has
      difficulty exhaling on CPAP, then patient undergo biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP)
      CT simulation. The attending physician then compares all 3 simulation treatment plans
      (free-breathing, DIBH, and CPAP/BiPAP) and determines which method to use during SBRT. If
      CPAP/BiPAP is chosen as preferred method, patients wear CPAP/BiPAP over 1 hour prior to SBRT,
      then again during SBRT over 30-60 minutes. All other patients complete free-breathing or DIBH
      during SBRT over 30-60 minutes.
