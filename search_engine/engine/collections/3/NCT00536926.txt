      worldwide. In case of deteriorating lung function response until therapy depends on patients
      efforts to reach the transplant center and the contactability of the transplant center.

      Therefore transfer of home spirometry recordings to the transplant center via cell phones
      will lead to less complications, cost savings and bigger constancy of therapy compared to the
      home spirometry alone.
