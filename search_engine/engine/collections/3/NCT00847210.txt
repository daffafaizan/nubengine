      reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter. The
      prevalence of Gastroesophageal reflux disease in the pediatric population is becoming
      increasingly recognized and documented. It is a chronic disease that can persist through
      adulthood with symptoms in older children and adolescents being similar to those seen in
      adults. The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease increases with age, from 2.5% of
      children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, to 8.5% of those between the ages of 10 and 17
      years.

      Younger children generally present with extra-esophageal manifestations, regurgitation, and
      epigastric pain, while older children and adolescents typically present with adult-type
      gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. Treatment for
      gastroesophageal reflux disease is aimed at alleviating symptoms and healing the esophageal
      inflammation.

      This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of dexlansoprazole MR in the pediatric
      population (ages 12-17) and determined if the pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that in
      adults given the same dose.
