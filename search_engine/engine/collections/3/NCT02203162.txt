      after an e-cig vaping session, and 24 hours subsequently. One e-cig vaping session will
      consist of 30 puffs of an e-cg (Blu) 30 seconds apart, which will deliver the approximate
      nicotine amount delivered by one tobacco cigarette. Cough reflex sensitivity, defined as C5,
      the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs, is the standard end point of cough
      challenge studies.
