    
      Purpose: A pilot randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is testing the feasibility
      of conducting a full-scale trial of the efficacy of bupropion SR vs. placebo in
      non-breastfeeding postpartum women who smoked >1 cigarette in the last month of pregnancy and
      want to stop smoking. The study will estimate achievable enrollment and retention rates;
      estimate the effect size of the drug on tobacco abstinence; assess the tolerability of
      bupropion in postpartum women; and allow refinement of recruitment, retention, intervention,
      and assessment protocols.

      Research Design: Pilot double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.

      Study Population: 40 postpartum women aged 18 years or older who smoked > 1 cigarette in the
      last month of pregnancy, want to stop smoking, and are not breastfeeding. Subjects will be
      recruited postpartum while hospitalized after delivery.

      Intervention: Bupropion SR (or matching placebo) for 8 weeks, starting immediately
      post-delivery. The dose is 150 mg qd for one week then 150 mg bid for 7 weeks. All subjects
      will receive behavioral counseling delivered face-to-face during the post-delivery
      hospitalization and by telephone 4 times over 8 weeks.

      Outcome Measures: (assessed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postpartum):

        1. Study eligibility, recruitment, and retention rates (primary outcome).

        2. Tobacco abstinence (7-day point prevalence nonsmoking by self-report and confirmed by
           saliva cotinine at 2 weeks, 8 weeks (end of drug treatment), and 12 weeks postpartum.

        3. Postpartum weight loss and symptoms of depression and anxiety.

        4. Tolerability of postpartum bupropion, assessed by medication adherence and adverse
           effects.
