      conditions, an indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) may be required. An estimated 90,000 people
      in the UK require a long-term urinary catheter.

      Urinary catheters are associated with significant harm and can cause substantial distress.
      Furthermore, managing frequent catheter-associated problems is a resource intensive burden to
      the providers of community healthcare services Currently, most patients use the standard
      Foley catheter design and experience problems that can constrain work and social lives, lead
      to UTI and pain and substantially reduce quality of life.

      The Optitip catheter became available on the Drug Tariff in 2017. Unlike the Foley catheter
      design which has a protruding tip, the Optitip has a blunt open end (eyelet) that protrudes
      slightly beyond a single fluid-filled 10ml balloon. It has an additional drainage eyelet
      underneath the balloon.

      The Optitip therefore has the potential to make important differences to patients by reducing
      pain/discomfort; reducing blockage frequency and potentially reducing clinical infection.
