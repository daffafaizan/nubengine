      pancreatitis as well as for coronary heart disease (Ginsberg 2001, 2002). The incidence rates
      for major coronary events in the Munster Heart Study increased from 4.4% among Subjects with
      baseline TG concentrations under 200 mg/dL to 9.3% among Subjects with TG concentrations in
      the 200-399 mg/dL range, and up to 13.2% in Subjects with TG levels ranging from 400-799
      mg/dL (Assmann 1996).
