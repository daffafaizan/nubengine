      For each of the two forms of Alzheimer's Disease (young or late), it compares two groups of
      patients: a group benefiting from a tactile tablet semantic stimulation (tablet group) and a
      control group All patients benefit from a clinical evaluation and a language assessment at
      M0, M3 and M6. The analyzes will be conducted in intention to treat.

      The main criterion is the 3-month variation of the Lexis 3 subtests scores. The two groups
      will be compared by the Student test.

      The number of subjects required is based on the following assumptions: a 10% increase over
      three months of the Lexis subtests scores in the tablet group and a stability of the scores
      in the control group. The standard deviation of the variation is assumed to be identical in
      both groups and equal to 13% at the most. Three scores being compared, tests will be
      conducted at the 1.67% threshold (Bonferroni correction) to ensure a 5% overall risk of first
      species. The inclusion of 36 patients in each of the two treatment groups will give 80% power
      to the study.
