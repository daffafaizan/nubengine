    
      Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease that has reached epidemic proportions. The global
      incidence of this disease is estimated to increase from 120 million individuals to over 200
      million by the year 2010. In type 2 diabetes, multiple metabolic defects contribute to
      hyperglycemia. These include insulin resistance, inadequate insulin secretion, and excessive
      hepatic glucose production. Nine classes of antihyperglycemic agents are currently approved
      for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (insulin, sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glycosidase
      inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glinides, glucagon-like peptide analogues, amylin analogues,
      and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors). Each class acts by a unique mechanism on 1 or more of
      the metabolic defects.

      Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited is developing TAK-379, a non-thiazolidinedione partial
      proliferator-activated receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study
      participation is anticipated to be approximately 4.5 months.
