      be obtained from bone marrow donation and cultured in the laboratory. MSCs have shown the
      ability to find injured tissue, reduce and control inflammation, and assist in tissue repair.

      Prochymalâ„¢ MSCs will be infused into patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.
      Infusions will occur on two separate days, 7-10 days apart. Patients will be monitored for
      reduced Crohn's disease symptoms. Patients will receive high or low dose. Study is open
      label.
