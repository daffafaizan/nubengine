    
      All study participants receive an initial 4 week course of intra-dermal vaccination with
      telomerase vaccine (GV1001) and immune adjuvant, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
      factor (GM-CSF), along with a cycle of gemcitabine chemotherapy. This is followed by
      concurrent radiation therapy and low-dose intravenous (IV) gemcitabine chemotherapy given
      twice weekly followed by one additional dose of vaccine.

      About 4 weeks (as late as 8 weeks) after chemotherapy and radiation treatment, participants
      with disease that can be removed by surgery will proceed to surgery. After recovery,
      immunochemotherapy will resume.

      Participants with stable or responsive disease that is not able to be treated with surgery
      will proceed to immunochemotherapy.

      Immunochemotherapy will consist of 2 cycles of telomerase vaccine with GM-CSF along with
      gemcitabine chemotherapy. Participants with disease that is not able to be treated with
      surgery, or that has worsened following immunochemoradiotherapy phase of treatment may
      continue on study with transition to immunochemotherapy phase of treatment. Tadalafil will be
      administered orally on a daily basis from start of therapy (Day 1) through completion of
      therapy with doses held only when required in the immediate perioperative period in patients
      who proceed to surgery.
