      hypertrophy of FLR with 95-100% completion rate of the second stage. The most common
      indication for ALPPS is locally advanced multiple colorectal liver metastases. Unsatisfactory
      immediate outcomes of ALPPS in surgery of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) including high mortality
      reached 48% in patients with h-CCA suggested that patients with biliary cancer should not be
      treated by ALPPS.

      Recently reported modifications of in situ splitting (partial ALPPS, RALPPS
      (radio-frequency-assisted liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy)
      and ALTPS (associating liver tourniquet and right portal vein ligation for staged
      hepatectomy) etc) have been aimed to minimize the operating injury on the first stage, hereby
      reducing postoperative morbidity.

      The other important idea was to preserve all initial benefits of ALPPS in terms of liver
      hypertrophy and completeness of the second stage. To date, there is no evidence of the
      benefits of any new ALPPS modification over others in reducing the morbidity of procedure,
      particularly in patients with CCA..
