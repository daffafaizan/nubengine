effect of parathyroidectomy and ferric dextrinupon calciphylactic sensitization by uremiaexperiments on the rat indicate that calciphy-lactic sensitization can be achieved by bilateralnephrectomy.  intravenous administration of aferric dextrin preparation (fe-din) inducesselective calcification in the buccal mucosa,esophagus, trachea and mediastinum of thenephrectomized rat although it produces no suchchanges in intact control animals.  conversely,fe-din prevents the cardiovascular calcificationnormally elicited by nephrectomy.  parathy-roidectomy protects the nephrectomized ratagainst the fe-din-induced calciphylaxis.hence, it may be concluded that: 1) autologousparathyroid hormone, in amounts secreted bythe glands, can act as a calciphylactic sensitizerand 2) fe-din is highly effective in protecting thecardiovascular system against uremic damage.
