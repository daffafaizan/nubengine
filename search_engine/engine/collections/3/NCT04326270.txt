      serve as their own controls and are randomized to initial interface of either RAM® infant
      cannula or Miniflow® nCPAP prongs. Infants are instrumented with the following monitoring
      equipment: Edi orogastric tube to measure electrical activity of the diaphragm,
      transcutaneous monitor to measure transcutaneous CO2 and O2, pulse oximeter to measure heart
      rate and oxygen saturation, and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) bands around the
      chest and abdomen to measure breathing movements and relative Vt (arbitrary units, a.u.).
      Data are continuously and simultaneously acquired using a data acquisition system. After 10
      minutes of stabilization, infants receive 5 minutes of NIPPV on each of a sequence of four
      commonly used pressure settings (expressed as peak inspiratory pressure / positive end
      expiratory pressure): 16/5, 16/8, 20/5, 20/8. This sequence is not randomized and is constant
      between interfaces. Subjects are then placed on the alternate interface, and the sequence is
      repeated. Events ("breaths") are separated into 3 types: patient effort synchronized with
      NIPPV breaths (type I), NIPPV breaths without patient effort (type II), and patient effort
      without NIPPV breaths (type III).
