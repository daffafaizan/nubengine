      of these patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease (ED). SCLC is a particularly
      aggressive form of lung cancer with a tendency for rapid tumor growth, early dissemination
      and high frequency of the metastasis In this study, we evaluate the MTD of everolimus
      combined with paclitaxel combination chemotherapy in SCLC.
