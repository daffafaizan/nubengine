      during endotracheal intubation by using large doses of opioids. However, high doses of
      opioids often leads to persistent and recurrent hypotension in patients from the anesthesia
      induction period to the beginning of the surgery. Patients scheduled to accept cardiac
      surgery often have severe concomitant disease. Hemodynamic fluctuation might lead to
      disastrous events. Anesthesia induction for such patients should not only provide adequate
      depth of anesthesia to decrease the stress response of endotracheal intubation, but also make
      hemodynamics stable after tracheal intubation.
