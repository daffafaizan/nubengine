      and vascular health in overweight volunteers at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The
      research objectives are:

      (i) To evaluate dietary inducers of glyoxalase 1 for effects on markers of glucose metabolism
      during an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), (ii) To evaluate dietary inducers of glyoxalase
      1 for effects on vascular function on three levels, using finger fold capillary density by
      capillaroscopy (FFCD), arterial stiffness by aortal pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and flow
      mediated dilatation (FMD); and effects on metabolic and pro-inflammatory markers in
      circulating blood and urine.
