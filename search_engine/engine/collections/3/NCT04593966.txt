    
      Follow-up: In the investigators' neurosurgical center, follow-up was conducted for all
      participants at the first 3-6 months and annually after discharge by clinical visit and
      telephone interview.

      Study overview: DOPA will aim on outcomes of both pediatric and adult AVMs patients who
      underwent intervention in investigators' institution. Intervention strategies contains
      microsurgical resection, embolization, embolization + radiosurgery, and single-stage hybrid
      surgery (embolization + resection). Outcomes will be measured by a neurologist using Modified
      Rankin Scale (mRs). Participants' mRs<2 will be considered as a good outcome and
      investigators will keep follow-up with every patient for at least 3 years.

      Sample size: About 300 patients will be enrolled in this study, and adults and children will
      account for half. All kinds of intervention will be included. The distribution of different
      strategies is excepted as: 30% resection, 20% embolization, 30% embolization + radiosurgery
      and 20% hybrid surgery.

      Study endpoints: The patients' mRs, occlusion rate and complication will be evaluated at 2
      weeks, discharge from hospital, 1 year and 3 years after the first-time intervention.
