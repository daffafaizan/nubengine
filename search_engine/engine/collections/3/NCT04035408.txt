      but tools exist to objectively measure changes thus we have chosen to use those tools to
      measure skin health. Before embarking on an intervention study showing improvement in skin
      health and patients' self-image and QOL, we first need to see if 1) it is feasible to measure
      changes in skin health in this population and 2) if skin health does objectively change over
      the course of therapy.
