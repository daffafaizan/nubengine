    
      Behçet's disease is a severe chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder marked by oral and
      genital ulcers, uveitis and skin lesions, as well as varying multisystem involvement
      including the joints, blood vessels, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. Oral
      ulcers are the initial symptom for most of Behçet's cases and are the single manifestation of
      the disease required for an official diagnosis, along with two other hallmark symptoms.

      Ninety (90) patients will be enrolled in a randomized, parallel, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of low dose natural human IFN α
      administered by the oral mucosal route in reducing the number, size, incidence and pain of
      oral ulcers in patients with Behçet's disease.

      The clinical trial will consist of 3 groups of patients randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to twice
      daily receive 2 lozenges containing 500 IU IFN α(2,000 IU daily, n=30), one active (500 IU)
      and one placebo lozenge (1,000 IU daily, n=30) or 2 placebo lozenges (n=30). Subjects will be
      monitored weekly over an initial 4 weeks of treatment and then bi-weekly over an additional 8
      weeks of treatment. Medication will be self-administered as 2 lozenges taken twice daily
      (morning and evening). Oral lesions will be counted and measured at each study visit, and
      patients will answer a series of questionnaires. Results will be subjected to statistical
      analysis at the completion of the study, with change in total ulcer burden of a patient, a
      measurement of the total oral mucosal surface area involved with ulcerous lesions at each
      visit, serving as the primary endpoint. The total ulcer burden from each treated visit will
      be compared to the baseline total ulcer burden and the amount of change determined. Patients
      with a 75% decrease in total ulcer burden will be considered responders.
