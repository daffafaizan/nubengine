      out-patient department of 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. All of them were
      HBsAg positive and anti-HBs negative for more than 6 months with HBV DNA<2000 IU/mL and HBsAg
      levels â‰¤1000 IU/mL. All patients did not have other liver diseases and contraindications for
      interferon therapy.

      After giving informed consent, patients were treated with weekly subcutaneous injections of
      alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or peginterferon alfa-2b 80 micrograms/week. The use of other
      immune suppressive or regulatory drugs and other antiviral drugs was prohibited during the
      course of the study.

      In this study, treatment endpoint was HBsAg loss(<0.05 IU/mL) and anti-HBs positive(>10
      milli-International unit(mIU)/mL) defined as seroconversion. Depending on the decline of
      HBsAg level, treatment was either continued for a prolonged period (no more than 96 weeks)
      until the endpoint was achieved, or terminated in case of nonresponse. Treatment was
      proceeded if HBsAg level continued to decline until HBsAg seroconversion was achieved and the
      anti-HBs level was above 200 mIU/ml. If the patients were not willing to extend treatment,
      the therapy was ended at the time of HBsAg loss, or stopped without further decline of HBsAg
      levels.
