      block (transverse abdominal plan block) with 3mg/kg Ropivacaine 0.5% (maximum 200 mg) and 150
      microg Clonidine.

      In a second group, before skin closure, a multiholes catheter was inserted beyond the skin.
      20 mg Ropivacaine 0.2% added with 150 microg Clonidine was injected as bolus dose through
      this catheter followed by a continuous infusion of Ropivacaine 0.2% 10ml per hour during the
      following 9 hours (total dose of 200 mgr).
