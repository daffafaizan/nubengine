      chronic bronchitis, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and community-acquired
      pneumonia. This multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the study doctor will know
      the dose of levofloxacin being administered) study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of
      two antibiotic regimens in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adult patients. A
      5-day course of 750 milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily will be compared to a 10-day
      course 500 milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily. Patients receive levofloxacin by
      mouth or through a vein depending on the severity of their pneumonia. Patients are assessed
      after 3 days of treatment; treatment is discontinued if no significant improvement is noted.
      Patients showing signs of improvement continue in the study, with assessments on study days
      12-16, and 17-21 (posttherapy visits), and 31-38 (poststudy visit). Effectiveness is assessed
      by measuring the ability of the study drug to eliminate bacteria causing pneumonia and to
      reduce the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Chest x-rays and laboratory tests for presence of
      bacteria are performed during the study. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events,
      physical examinations, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The study
      hypothesis is that levofloxacin administered at a higher dose for a shorter duration is at
      least as effective as levofloxacin administered at a lower dose for a longer duration in the
      treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and is generally well-tolerated.

      mouth or slowly through a vein daily for 5 days
