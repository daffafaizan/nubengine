      with 66 caregiver-child dyads (33 intervention and 33 comparison) recruited from two
      community based agencies in East Los Angeles. Fidelity and feasibility will be assessed. Pre-
      and post- intervention data (child dietary, physical activity, and media viewing behaviors
      and BMI z-scores) will be collected to estimate preliminary effect sizes and standard
      deviations. The mHealth intervention has been informed by a previous feasibility study and
      focus groups with Latino caregivers of 2- to 5-year old children. This mHealth childhood
      obesity intervention specifically targets Latino mothers, fathers, and grandmothers of 2- to
      5-year olds. The intervention focuses on parenting skills, dietary, physical activity, and
      media-viewing behaviors consistent with American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.
