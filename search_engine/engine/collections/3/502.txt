3105. studies on the subunits of a-crystallin and their recombi-nationearlier investigations have shown that, inthe presence of high concentrations ofurea, a-crystallin from bovine lens is splitinto a number of subunits with apparent-ly different electrophoretic mobilities butsimilar molecular weights.  the recom-bination of these subunits after removal ofthe urea has been studied by ultracentri-fugation and immunoprecipitation techniques.it was found that maximal recombina-tion was obtained when the ionic strengthduring the removal of the urea was high(>0.2), whereas at low ionic strengths amolecule with only half the molecular weightof native a-crystallin and a much lowersedimentation coefficient was obtained.  acomplete recovery of the structure ofnative a-crystallin was never obtained, evenat high ionic strengths, as was evidentfrom electrophoretic and quantitative preci-pitin analyses.  the subunits werefractionated by chromatography on deae-cellu-lose in the presence of 7 m urea.the purification was followed by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis.  after removal ofthe urea at high ionic strength, 2 of thefractions obtained showed reactions ofonly partial identity with native a-crystallinin immunodiffusion tests, but all otherfractions showed complete identity.  thedifferences in the electrophoreticmobilities of the fractions in the presence ofurea persisted after removal of the urea.all fractions had much higher sedimen-tation coefficients in the absence of ureathan in its presence, although the valuesfor urea-treated unfractionated a-crystallinobtained after removal of the ureawere not reached even at high ionic strengths.the amino acid composition of thefractions was found to differ.  theseobservations suggest that a-crystallin is com-posed of a number of chemically different,but related, subunits of approximatelythe same size, which are bound togetherby nonspecific, noncovalent bonds, pos-sibly hydrophobic bonds.  moreover,when isolated, these subunits have the abilityto associate and form molecules ofhigh molecular weight.
