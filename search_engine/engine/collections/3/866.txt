albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.  report of a family with studiesof bone remodeling.two members of a single family, each representingdifferent forms of albright's hereditary osteodystrophy,have been presented.  the kindred pattern issimilar to those of other reported families and is consistentwith a sex-linked or autosomal dominant mode ofinheritance.  the importance of a course of intramuscularparathyroid extract for proof of parathyroid hormoneresistance is emphasized.  biopsy specimens of rib,labeled in vivo with tetracycline, were studied microscopically.these new observations indicated cellulardefects in bone remodeling shared by the propositus andcase 2, which may explain the low rates of bone turnoverfound in each.  immunologic studies established thepresence of a substance antigenically similar to parathyroidhormone in the parathyroid tissue of the propositus.the pathogenesis of albright's hereditary osteodystrophyand atypical forms of parathyroid hormoneresistant hypocalcemia is discussed.
