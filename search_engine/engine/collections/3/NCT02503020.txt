      order to study nutritional supplements for preterm infants <1500 grams and/or <32 weeks
      gestational age (GA) who were born in clinical University Hospital of Santiago de Compostela
      (CHUS). They were enrolled for a period of 14 months (from July 2011 to August 2012) and
      followed up from birth until 2 years of age. Milk formulas were provided either as adjunct to
      insufficient amount of breast milk, or as full formula feeding. Breastfeeding was actively
      encouraged. Patients were randomized into one of the two formula groups, depending on the
      type of formula they were to receive. Group A's formula was supplemented with DHA (0.3% of
      all fatty acids) and AA (0.6%) with an ω-6/ω-3 ratio of 2/1. Group B's formula was
      supplemented with DHA (0.3%) and AA (0.3%) with an ω-6/ω-3 ratio of 1/1.

      Primary outcome:

      Assessment of psychomotor development with the Brunet Lézine scale at 2 years of age (Early
      Care Unit CHUS)

      Secondary outcomes:

      Physical examination and anthropometric measurements (weight, length, and head circumference)
      at birth and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of age (Neonatology Unit CHUS) Blood levels of
      fatty acids in the first week of life and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. (Metabolic
      Unit. Hospital de Cruces, Bilbao) Visual- and auditory-evoked potentials at 6 and 12 months
      of age (Neurophysiology Unit CHUS)
