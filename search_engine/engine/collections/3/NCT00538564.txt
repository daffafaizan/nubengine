      treatment for recurrent ischemic priapism. Enrolled participants will be randomized to
      receive oral 10 mg tadalafil tablets 3 times a week or receive matching placebo. Patients
      will be instructed to use the medication in the morning a few hours after awakening from
      night time sleep, and they will be instructed against engaging in any form of sexual activity
      or excitement within 8 hours of dosing. Treatment duration will be 2 months for each
      participant. After the 2 month period, participants on tadalafil and placebo will be offered
      tadalafil (same dosing regimen) for an additional 2 months.

      The study duration will be 4 months.

      Tests and procedures will include: consent; medical history; physical examination; clinical
      laboratory tests; completion of questionnaires; and medication dispensation.
