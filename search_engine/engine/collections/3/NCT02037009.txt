      surveillance of the 3 operating rooms where surgery of the ocular anterior segment is
      performed: 1) the usual procedure, with the presence of 3 anesthetic nurses (1 in each
      operating room) and 2) a new organization with an anesthetic nurse checking a centralised
      monitoring station and a back-up anesthetic nurse ready to intervene inside the 3 operating
      rooms whenever needed.

      The 2 procedures will be successively implemented during 3 to 4 sequences, until the number
      of surgical procedures statistically required have been studied.

      The investigators aim to demonstrate that the centralised monitored surveillance does not put
      the patients at risk more often than the current surveillance procedure.
