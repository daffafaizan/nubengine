      reduced pharmacodynamic (PD) effects to several oral antiplatelet agents, including
      clopidogrel. In addition to the hyperreactive platelet phenotype, impaired drug metabolism as
      well as increased platelet turnover rates may contributed to impaired clopidogrel-induced
      antiplatelet effects in DM patients. These observations may contribute to the higher ischemic
      event rates, including stent thrombosis, observed in DM patients compared with non-DM
      patients treated with clopidogrel.

      Ticagrelor is characterized by more prompt, potent and predictable antiplatelet effects
      compared with clopidogrel and lower ischemic events in patients with an acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS) on a background of aspirin therapy. In patients who experienced a prior (1-3
      years) myocardial infarction (MI), compared with placebo, ticagrelor 60 mg bid on a
      background of aspirin therapy also reduced long-term ischemic events, with a mortality
      benefit observed in DM patients.

      To date the PD effects of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in DM largely derive from post-hoc
      assessments or in stabilized patients (e.g. >30 days after PCI), and have not been
      prospectively evaluated in the context of elective PCI procedures. Moreover, PD studies with
      the ticagrelor 60 mg bid regimen are limited. Therefore, the aim of this investigation will
      be to compare the PD effects of a ticagrelor 60 mg bid versus clopidogrel 75 mg od MD regimen
      in DM patients without a prior major CV event undergoing elective PCI.
