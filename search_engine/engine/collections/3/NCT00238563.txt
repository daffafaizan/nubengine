      Objectives: Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure designed to reduce internal eye pressure
      by draining fluid from within the eye to the sub-conjunctival (superficial eye lining) space.
      Scar formation from conjunctival and Tenon's capsule fibroblast proliferation represents the
      most common cause of failure of trabeculectomies. A number of drugs have been use to prevent
      failure of trabeculectomies from the scarring process including intraoperative mitomycin C
      (MMC) and preoperative Triamcinalone Acetonide (TA). Over the past several years,
      intraoperative MMC has become a preferred method of preventing scar formation. This study
      looks to determine in a prospective, double-blind, randomized method the long-term efficacy
      and safety of MMC with postoperative TA compared to the standard practice of intraoperative
      MMC with postoperative prednisolone acetate drops in preventing scar related failures of
      trabeculectomies.
