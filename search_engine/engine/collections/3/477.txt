1362. the synthesis of phage and host dna in the establishment of lysogenya method of extraction is described whichprevents excessive fragmentation of bac-terial dna.  the larger bacterial dna canthen be separated from the phage dnaon sucrose gradients.  the relative amountsof phage and host dna made at varioustimes during infection of s. typhimuriumwith phage p22 leading to lysogeny havebeen determined.  phage-specific dnasynthesis begins at about 4 min, continuesto increase for 2-4 min, and then decreasesuntil complete repression is attainedat 16 min.  autonomous phage dna synthesisremains repressed from then on.  bac-teria-specific synthesis proceeds at adecreasing rate until about 16 min, whenalmost complete inhibition is reached.when dna synthesis recovers in the in-fected cells, only host-specific materialis made.  a new species of dna, which ismade only when phage dna is synthesized,has been detected.  the possible implica-tions of these findings in the understandingof the lysogenic interaction is discussed.
