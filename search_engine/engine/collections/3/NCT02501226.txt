      achieve remission of index episode in a multicentric randomized controlled trial using ENVIE
      program and treatment as usual versus treatment as usual only. The investigators will include
      depressed subjects suffering from non a first depressive episode as well as recurrent
      episode.The eligible patients will be randomized into two groups (computer-generated
      randomisation in a 1 :1 ratio, blocked in groups of 4, stratified on the number of episodes :
      1 , 2 , 3 and more). Only outpatients consulting in the investigation centres will be
      recruited. Sociodemographic data, psychiatric diagnoses using Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and Screening Interview for Axis II Disorder (SCID-II)
      for borderline personality disorder, pharmacological treatment will be also recorded.
      Patients will be assessed by clinicians blind to treatment allocation, at inclusion (before
      intervention) and at 3 months (end of the intervention), 6, 9 and 15 months after the
      inclusion.
