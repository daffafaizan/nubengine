      of Episcleral Dexamethasone in patients suffering from refractory diabetic macular edema.
      Numerous studies have documented the anti-inflammatory activity of Dexamethasone in macular
      edema associated with diabetes, branch retinal vein occlusion, and non-infectious posterior
      uveitis. The investigators hypothesize that Episcleral Dexamethasone is safe, tolerable and
      that its anti-inflammatory activity will reduce macular edema and improve vision in patients
      with diabetic macular edema.
