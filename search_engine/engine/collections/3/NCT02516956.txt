      choices later in the day, eating behaviours are a complex interaction of several factors.
      Nutritional requirements are not only affected by the body homeostasis, but also by
      environmental signals, as cultural and social habits, lifestyle, etc. These parameters evoke
      reward-related and motivational signals influencing our daily eating behaviour choices. Most
      of the theories on food regulation propose two parallel systems interacting with food
      consumption homeostatic and reward-related systems. For all these reasons, there is an
      increasing interest on motivational and decisional aspects of food choices, eating behaviours
      and how they are influenced by food characteristics. This project aims to explore the
      association between compositional and perceived characteristics of a breakfast meal with
      nutritional/biochemical/physiological variables. The approach will be the evaluation of
      appetite, food intake as well as metabolic and compensatory responses to foods consumed
      during the day. Volunteers (n=15) will be fed with 4 different breakfast meals (one control
      and three iso-caloric with different glycemic indexes) and several different parameters will
      be evaluated, as biological parameters linked to satiety, food choices during a free lunch
      buffet, psycho-physiological and biological mechanisms underlying the compensatory effect and
      attentional components in the postprandial period. The participants will complete, in
      randomized order, the four breakfast meals, on four different weeks, separated by at least
      one week.
