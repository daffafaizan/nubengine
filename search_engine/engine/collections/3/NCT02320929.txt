      debridement followed by an intravenous antibiotic treatment. Several surgical methods have
      been described to remove the purulent debris from the flexor tendon sheath. Closed-catheter
      irrigation involves irrigation of the tendon sheath from proximal to distal direction
      facilitated by two small incisions; one proximal to A1 pulley and one distal to A4 pulley.
      Lille et al. (J Hand Surg Br. 2000;25(3):304-307) conducted a retrospective study that
      implied that intraoperative closed-catheter irrigation without postoperative irrigation might
      be as effective as the combination of intra- and postoperative irrigation.

      The hypothesis of this prospective randomized trial is that the intraoperative
      closed-catheter irrigation alone is as effective as the combination of intraoperative and
      postoperative intermittent closed-catheter irrigation in the treatment of purulent flexor
      tenosynovitis.
