      Primary

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of hydroxychloroquine and carboplatin in
           combination with paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with advanced recurrent
           non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To assess the antitumor activity, as measured by tumor response rate, of this regimen in
           these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To measure time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival of these
           patients.

        -  To assess the incidence of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carboplatin
      and hydroxychloroquine followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes, and
      bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral hydroxychloroquine on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses. Patients then receive bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes every 21 days and oral hydroxychloroquine daily for up to 1 year in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.
