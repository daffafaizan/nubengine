      osseous metastases from breast cancer. However, there is no data addressing the effects of
      intravenous bisphosphonate therapy on the results of bone scan imaging. Therefore, the first
      step in the collaboration between MSKCC Breast Cancer Medicine Service and Nuclear Medicine
      Service is to define whether or not intravenous bisphosphonate therapy affects the results of
      bone imaging with the standard technetium, Tc-99m MDP. Women receiving intravenous
      bisphosphonate therapy for breast cancer metastases involving bone at MSKCC are eligible for
      this diagnostic clinical is no therapeutic intent in this study.

      Bone Scan performed before intravenous bisphosphonate therapy (baseline as clinically
      indicated). Ideally, the bone scan will be performed immediately before to, bisphosphonate
      therapy.

      Zoledronic acid, intravenous bisphosphonate therapy (as clinically indicated)

      Bone Scan performed within 1 day after intravenous bisphosphonate therapy (study test).

      Number of lesions seen in the baseline and study test will be counted and compared for
      changes in imaging results induced by intravenous bisphosphonate therapy.

      The number of lesions detected by bone scan pre and post therapy will be recorded and the
      difference will be calculated.
