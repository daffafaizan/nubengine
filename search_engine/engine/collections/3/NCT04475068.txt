      principles explain its mechanism of action: 1) the first indicates that atelectasis and
      poorly ventilated areas of the lung can improve their aeration by putting the lung in the
      highest position. Opposite lateral decubitus causes that upper lung to have a higher PL and
      allow a recruiting effect at moderate airway pressures. 2) The second principle is based on
      Laplace's Law and postulates that once the upper lung is recruited, it remains without lung
      collapse if a sufficient level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied. Based
      on these two precepts, PRM consists of sequentially moving the patient from the supine to the
      left lateral decubitus to recover the aeration of the right lung. After that, the patient is
      placed in the right lateral position to recruit the left lung; keeping the right lung without
      collapse by continuous use of PEEP. Finally, the patient returns to the supine position
      looking for an improvement in the distribution of ventilation and global pulmonary aeration,
      with a subsequent improvement in gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics.
