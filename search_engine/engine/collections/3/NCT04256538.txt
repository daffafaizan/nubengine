      diagnosis and differential diagnosis of IBD still lack gold standard. To diagnose IBD,
      physicians need to combine clinical manifestation, lab results, image examination, endoscopy
      examination and pathology. After diagnosis, patients still need to monitor their disease
      progression. The most accurate way is to do endoscopy examination, however, endoscopy
      examination is an invasive, expensive and uncomfortable procedure. At present, C-reactive
      protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fecal calprotectin are used as main
      noninvasive biomarkers to monitor progression routinely. But their specificities are still
      unsatisfactory. So, it's urgent to find high sensitivity and specificity biomarkers to better
      diagnose and monitor progression of IBD. In this study, we try to find miRNAs that can used
      to diagnose or monitor progression of IBD by exploring differential expression of miRNAs in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
      healthy controls. And we further validate these miRNAs in a larger population to assess their
      function as biomarkers.
