    
      Melphalan is an alkylating agent with potent antitumor and immunosuppressive properties used
      in conditioning regimens of pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT)
      to promote stem cell engraftment.

      This is a single-center, prospective, non-interventional pharmacokinetics (PK) study
      investigating the clinical pharmacology of melphalan in 24 children undergoing allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHCT) at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.

      Patients would receive melphalan regardless of whether or not they decide to consent to PK
      sampling.

      Melphalan doses will not be adjusted based on PK data.

      We will apply the combination of a limited sampling strategy and population PK methodologies
      to determine specific factors influencing melphalan exposure in pediatric alloHCT recipients.
      Population PK methodologies support the use of sparse sampling and therefore allow us to
      investigate drug levels in a pediatric population that would otherwise not be feasible using
      traditional intensive PK sampling.

      Subjects will undergo PK sampling of plasma melphalan drug concentrations over the duration
      of melphalan therapy (3 to 5 days).

      To evaluate sources of variability impacting melphalan exposure clinical data will be
      obtained from the patient's medical chart on each day of PK sampling.

      To assess exposure-response relationships neutrophil engraftment, treatment-related toxicity,
      and survival data will be collected through day 100 post-transplant.
