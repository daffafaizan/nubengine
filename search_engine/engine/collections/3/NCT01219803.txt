      divided into different groups in a randomized, doubled blind, dose-paralleled-control
      multi-centre clinical design. The patients were randomly taken with high-dosage(5 times of
      low-dosage),mild-dosage(3 times of low-dosage), low-dosage,placebo(4.5% of low dosage) by 2
      times every day for 12 weeks. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Fasting plasma glucose
      (FPG),postprandial 2 hours plasma glucose(2hPG),insulin(0h,1h,2h),syndrome,symptoms,body mass
      index (BMI),waist circumference (WC) of these groups were measured and analyzed. Some safety
      indexes such blood and urine and stool routine examination, electrocardiogram (ECG)and liver
      and kidney function tests were measured and analyzed during the experiment. The treatment
