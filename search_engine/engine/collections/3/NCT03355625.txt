      sparse. In the present study, the aim is to investigate platelet function in adult patients
      treated with ECMO using flow cytometry. The investigators hypothesize that platelet function
      increases from day 1 to day 3 in patients treated with ECMO. The secondary aim is to
      investigate the association between platelet function and the incidence of bleeding episodes
      and thrombosis during ECMO treatment.

      The present study is a substudy to the study entitled; "Coagulopathy During Extracorporeal
      Membrane Oxygenation" (pending Clinical Trial ID number).
