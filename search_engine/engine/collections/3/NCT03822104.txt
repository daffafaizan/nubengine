        1. To test if fortification of human milk with BC reduces feeding intolerance compared with
           currently used HMF.

        2. To verify the safety and tolerability of BC fortification and to monitor the rates of
           growth, NEC and sepsis, as investigated in a parallel trial in Denmark

        3. To explore new markers of growth, maturation, clinical interventions, and health
           outcomes, using samples of blood, plasma or feces collected during the trial

      Trial design This study is a dual-center, non-blinded, two-armed, randomized, controlled
      trial.

      Participants Parents to eligible very preterm infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care
      Units (NICU) at Nanshan People's Hospital (NAN) and Baoan Maternal and Children's Hospital in
      Shenzhen, China will be asked for participation.

      Sample size 68 infants per group, 136 in total

      Data type Clinical data and biological materials (feces, whole blood, and plasma)

      A parallel trial on BC used as human milk fortifier is conducting in Denmark (NCT03537365)
