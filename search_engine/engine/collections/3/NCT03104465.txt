      web-based mindfulness training with active duty soldiers being treated for chronic pain. We
      will adapt the evidence-based Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training for use with
      this population. The adapted training will be enhanced by mobile applications (apps) for
      skills practice, using an existing apps platform.
