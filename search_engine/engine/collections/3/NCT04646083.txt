    
      The Aim of the study: To compare the depth of maximal ileal insertion between
      through-the-scope balloon enteroscopy (NaviAid) with enteroscopy using the adult colonoscope
      (Olympus CF-190) alone, in the same patient, in a prospective cohort from August 1, 2020 to
      July 31, 2023 at University Medical Center of El Paso, Texas.

      Depth of insertion is correlated with diagnostic yield, meaning that we would like to
      ascertain if the use of the colonoscope with NaviAid will result in greater depth of
      insertion and potentially more findings of small bowel abnormalities than using a colonoscope
      alone.

      It is assumed that this is the case, but we want to show it and quantify it.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      The depth of ileal insertion is greater with the use of through-the-scope balloon enteroscopy
      (NaviAid) when compared with enteroscopy using the standard adult colonoscope (Olympus
      CF-190) alone.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To compare the depth of maximal ileal insertion between through-the-scope balloon enteroscopy
      (NaviAid) with the adult colonoscope (Olympus CF-190) alone, in the same patient, in a
      prospective cohort at University Medical Center of El Paso, Texas.
