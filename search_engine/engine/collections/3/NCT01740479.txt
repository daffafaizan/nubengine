      non-infarct related artery lesions plus optimal medical therapy is superior to a strategy of
      optimal medical therapy alone in reducing (1) the composite outcome of cardiovascular (CV)
      death or new myocardial infarction (MI), or (2) the composite of CV death, new MI or ischemia
      driven revascularization (IDR) in patients with multivessel disease who have undergone early
      successful culprit lesion PCI for STEMI.
