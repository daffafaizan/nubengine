    
      This is a prospective, non-randomised, open label, Phase I, dose escalation study of
      plerixafor (MozobilTM) in patients with histological documentation of advanced pancreatic,
      high grade serous ovarian or colorectal adenocarcinoma. We will investigate the feasibility
      of administering plerixafor in terms of safety, and will try to identify the proof of
      mechanism in patients.

      This study is required to establish whether relevant plasma concentrations of plerixafor can
      be achieved safely in patients with advanced pancreatic, high grade serous ovarian and
      colorectal cancer.

      Plerixafor (Mozobil) will be administered as a continuous 7 day intravenous infusion,
      starting at a dose of 20 ug/kg/hr, and subsequent dose levels of 40, 80 and 120 ug/kg/hr (as
      an inpatient for at least the initial 48 hours). 3 patients will be entered sequentially (at
      least 1 week apart), using a standard 3+3, Phase I trial design. Up to 28 patients will be
      recruited.
