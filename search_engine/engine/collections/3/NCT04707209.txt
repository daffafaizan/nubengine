      in the nerve-fiber layer of the retina. They are often associated with tuberous sclerosis
      complex (TSC) and, more rarely, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). RAH may be caused by
      dysregulated tumor suppressors genes TSC1 or TSC2, which play a role in cell cycle regulation
      in retinal astrocytes via the PDGF-signalling pathway. Downregulation of TSC1 or TSC2 can
      result in hyperactivation of mTOR. Sirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR, therefore inhibiting
      cell growth and proliferation of astrocytes. Systemic mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and
      everolimus) have shown impressive reduction in the size of RAH in animal models and many
      human case series.

      This single patient study is investigating the use of concurrent oral and intravitreal
      Sirolimus to treat a patient with multiple retinal astrocytic hamartomas (RAH) of both eyes
      to improve intraocular response and reduce duration of treatment. The patient has no other
      clinical features suggestive of neurofibromatosis and a presumed diagnosis of tuberous
      sclerosis is being considered, with only two hypopigmented skin lesions noted.
