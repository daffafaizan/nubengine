      training program on bilateral balance and explosive power in athletes with chronic ankle
      instability (CAI). The study included 28 volunteer athletes with a history of CAI who
      registered as a team player at Yeditepe University Culture and Sports Directorate February
      2019 - June 2019. The severity of functional ankle instability of all the athletes was
      assessed by the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT). Functional limitations of the
      athletes with CAI were evaluated by Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activity of Daily Living
      Subscale (FAAM-ADL) and Sports Subscale (FAAM-S). Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) was
      used to determine the static balance performance of athletes. Dynamic balance was evaluated
      by the Y Balance Test (YBT). Sport performance including vertical jumping and hopping was
      assessed with Single-Legged Countermovement Jump (CMJ) Test, Figure-of-Eight Hop Test, and
      Side Hop Test. The athletes were randomly divided into Rehabilitation for the Stable Ankle
      Group (SG) (n=9), Rehabilitation for the Unstable Ankle Group (UG) (n=9) and Control Group
      (CG) (n=10). Athletes in SG and UG were included balance exercise training program. The
      balance exercise training program was administered for only the stable ankle of athletes in
      SG and only the unstable ankle of athletes in UG, twice a week and for a 4-week duration.
