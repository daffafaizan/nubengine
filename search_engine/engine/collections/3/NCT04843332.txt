      delivery of evidence-based precision medicine for cancer care. We plan to randomize newly
      diagnosed patients and those currently under cancer care to either a control arm (usual
      cancer care alone) versus an intervention arm (layered on top of usual cancer care alone)
      where patients are assigned to a community health worker who will assist patients in ensuring
      the following discussions with their care team: 1) precision cancer care 2) cancer diagnosis
      and treatment plan 2) adherence to treatments and 3) goals of care and symptom burden. A
      total of 55 participants per study group (total 110) will be recruited in Monterey County
      from Pacific Cancer Care.
