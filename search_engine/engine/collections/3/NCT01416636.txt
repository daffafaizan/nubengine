      organized thromboembolic obstructing the pulmonary vascular bed. These thrombi are resistant
      to thrombolytic therapy and chronic plasmatic anticoagulation. An increase in pulmonary
      vascular resistance (PVR), right ventricular overload, and eventually right ventricular
      failure ensue.

      The treatment of choice for CTEPH is pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), providing a potential
      cure for the disease. However, about 50 % of patients are not candidates for surgery, mainly
      because of distal location of thromboemboli. Despite recent advances in the treatment of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), medical treatments have not been recommended for
      inoperable CTEPH, because of the concept that a predominantly major vessel obstructive
      arteriopathy would not be suitable for vasodilators. Furthermore, a major drawback of i.v.
      prostacyclin therapy is the need for a permanent central venous access that increases the
      risk of infection (0.22-0.68 per patient per year), thrombosis and new major vessel
      thromboembolism.
