      When substituting a random biopsy procedure with a few targeted biopsies, it is of outmost
      importance to know immediately if the biopsy is positive or not. A recent study has
      demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity of imprint cytology of random biopsies.

      Aim:

      The correlation between cytological imprints and histology of targeted prostate biopsies

      Material&Method:

      All patients in this study are already participating in an ongoing randomized biopsy study
      (NCT01455792) comparing:

        1. Preoperative MRI and targeted biopsies + random biopsies .

        2. Random biopsies (gold standard).

      Only patients with a positive MRI were included in this collateral study.

      The cytological imprints (negative/positive) of each targeted biopsy is compared to the
      histology (negative/positive) and Gleason score.
