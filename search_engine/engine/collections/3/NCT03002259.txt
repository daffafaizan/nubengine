      commonly used in some countries,but uncommonly in the US, Canada and Australia. Steroids can
      reliably attenuate activation of the complement pathways associated with cardiac surgery, but
      clinical trials have had mixed results. The current evidence is dominated by the results of
      two recent large randomized trials: DECS (n=4,494)6 and SIRS (n=7,507).

      Both DECS and SIRS assigned patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB to receive either a
      high intraoperative dose of steroids (dexamethasone 1 mg/kg, or methylprednisolone 500 mg,
      respectively) or placebo. The point estimates of both trials suggested a possible reduction
      in serious complications and mortality. Planned subgroup analyses in the DECS trial steroids
      reduced the incidence of respiratory failure (3.0 % vs. 4.3%, P=0.02), infection (9.5% vs.
      14.8%, P=0.009), and shortened hospital stay (median 8 [7-13] vs. 9 [7-13] days, P=0.009).6
      Severe renal failure (need for RRT) was reduced, 0.4% vs. 1.0%, P=0.04.8 But SIRS found
      methylprednisolone was associated with a higher incidence of myocardial injury (as measured
      by elevation of CK-MB enzyme). Nether trial identified a higher risk of myocardial infarction
      (MI). The methylprednisolone-induced elevation of CK-MB may therefore be a class effect.

      Another compelling finding in pre-planned subgroup analysis of patient age groups is that
      when limiting analysis to those aged less than 75 years in the DECS trial, dexamethasone
      reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint, RR 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58-0.95), P=0.017; as
      well as respiratory failure RR 0.62 (95% CI: 0.42-0.91), P=0.014; and possibly mortality RR
      0.53 (95% CI: 0.26-1.10), P=0.08.6 This age-interaction effect is supported by the
      demonstration of increased C-reactive protein concentrations in younger patients enrolled in
      the DECS trial.

      Therefore, it is highly plausible that prophylactic steroids can suppress deregulated
      inflammation and thus improve outcomes in cardiac surgery, but only when used in a less
      elderly (i.e. <75 years) patient population.

      In retrospect, the primary endpoints of both DECS and SIRS trials can be challenged, in that
      they used composites heavily weighted by thrombotic events (MI, stroke) and not specific to
      inflammation (respiratory failure, kidney injury, sepsis, prolonged ICU and hospital stay,
      mortality). We thus plan to re-evaluate dexamethasone in cardiac surgery, using a
      patient-centred, clinically important endpoint focused on enhanced recovery and earlier
      hospital discharge: "days alive and at home up to 30 days after surgery".
