    
      This is a randomized trial comparing the incidence of WON in patients with acute necrotizing
      pancreatitis, according to the placement or non-placement of an Advanix or a Cook Pancreatic
      Duct (PD) stent during Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 1-2 week
      of symptom onset. Patients will be randomly allocated to either treatment arm i.e. to either
      PD stent placement or no PD placement in a 1:1 ratio. The type of stent to be placed is at
      the discretion of the physician based on the clinical needs and presentation of the patient
      at the time of procedure. This is based on factors such as the size of the WON, the patient's
      anatomy, and other variables. Patients will be assessed at 4-6 weeks post-ERCP for the
      primary outcome measure, which is the incidence of WON on contrast-enhanced CT.
