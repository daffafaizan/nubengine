hypoplasia of the intrahepatic bile ducts.a description of 2 cases: (1) a boy of 13 daysold had atresia of the small intestineand pneumonia, and a slightly enlarged liverwith faint green coloration.  histologicalexamination revealed numerous collapsedbile ducts which had solid ductularcell sprouts reaching the liver cells;the minor and smallest bile ducts wereempty.  (2) a girl of 1 yr and 4 mth had increasingjaundice since birth.  autopsyrevealed a hypoplastic common bile duct,which was, however, open to probing,and marked green coloration of the liver.also in this case, the bile ducts werevery narrow and had solid ductular cell sproutsreaching the liver cells.  thistype of bile duct corresponds to a stage inontogenesis and does not show signsof proliferation.  it may be considered a formof hypoplasia, as the size and numberof the primordial bile ducts is reduced.  whenpresent the anlage shows a regularconnection with the liver cells.  this hypoplasiais to be distinguished from anatresia.  the long survival of the second casecan be explained by the greatcompensatory capacity of the liver.
