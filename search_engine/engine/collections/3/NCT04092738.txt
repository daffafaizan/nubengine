    
      A double-blind randomized controlled trial. Seven Primary Care Centers from Spain (n=5
      Catalonia, n=2 Madrid), 2 hospitals (n=1 Catalonia, n=1 Madrid) and 2 companies (occupational
      health services; n=1 public, n=1 private) will participate in the study. In each center,
      physicians, nurses, endocrinologists and occupational physicians will recruit patients with
      DT2 who spend at least 55% of their working hours doing desk-based tasks (OSPAQ) and have a
      cellphone. Following the CONSORT Statement (2010), volunteers will be randomized into a
      control (CG) or intervention group (IG) by the research team using a computer program to
      generate the random sequence. 184 individuals are needed in each group. Main variables:
      fasting glucose levels, HbA1c, weight, height, BMI, waist circumference. Occupational sitting
      time and sitting time breaks will be measured using ActivPAL devices. Other variables:
      physical activity (IPAQ short), quality of life (EuroQool), presenteeism (WLQ),
      triglycerides, total cholesterol (LDL and HDL), blood pressure and sociodemographic
      variables.

      Intervention: A mHealth program (13 wks) will progressively replace occupational sitting time
      with light physical activities. Participants from the CG will receive usual care.
      Multivariate analysis will assess changes over time (post intervention and at 6 months follow
      up) in the dependent variables; looking at differences between groups. Intention to treat
      will be applied.
