sudden hypocalcemia in normal and hypoparathyroid subjects.serum calcium concentration was suddenly decreasedin 10 normal and 4 hypoparathyroid subjectsby the infusion of 50 mg/kg of disodium edta over a30- to 45-minute interval.  the return rate to pre-infusionvalues of the serum calcium concentration was thesame in both groups.  serum phosphate showed a marked,transient decrease 30 min after the infusion in normalindividuals, but not in those with hypoparathyroidism.the hypophosphatemia was followed by a markedincrease in phosphate clearance in the normal group anda decrease in the hypoparathyroid group.  urine phosphate:urine creatinine x 10 (up:uc x 10) and urinephosphate: urine osmolality x 10 (up:uo x 10) ratiosalso reflected an increased phosphate excretion in the2 groups.  a simple clinical measure of parathyroidfunction is suggested by determining the up:uo x 10or the up:uc x 10, or both, ratios before and 3 to 6hr after intravenous infusion of disodium edta.
