      locoregional adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine combined with radiation
      therapy. II. Estimate the biomarker response to this regimen through evaluation of
      circulating CA19-9 levels and correlate this response with survival of this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive radiation therapy 5 days per week for 5 1/2 weeks and gemcitabine
      IV over 30 minutes not greater than 2 hours prior to radiation therapy twice weekly. This
      combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy is followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients with
      stable or responding disease receive a higher dose of gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly
      for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. This 4 week course is repeated 3 more times for a
      total of 16 weeks of gemcitabine therapy alone. Patients are followed every 2 months for the
      first year and then every 3 months for the next 2 years or until disease progression. Upon
      documentation of disease progression, patients are followed every 3 months for survival and
      secondary malignancy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
