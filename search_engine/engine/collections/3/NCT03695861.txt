    
      Infectious endocarditis remains a serious pathology with an intra-hospital mortality of
      between 15 and 30%. The prognosis of patients depends on the speed of diagnosis and the
      beginning of the appropriate treatment.

      Currently, the diagnosis of endocarditis is based on the ESC 2015 modified criteria.
      Echocardiography techniques play a key role, but can be negative in 20% of endocarditis.
      18F-FDG PET-CT showed promising results in the management of prosthetic valve endocarditis
      and / or stimulation material.

      However, few studies have been carried out on the contribution of PET-CT in the diagnosis of
      endocarditis on native valves, with discordant results. But this is the majority of
      endocarditis (70% of cases).

      A 18F-FDG PET-CT will be performed in all patients included in the study in addition to
      standard care for endocarditis, within 5 days of the beginning of their management in the
      university hospital center of Bordeaux after verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria
      and signature of consent.

      The included patients will be reviewed at Month 3 during a consultation with the completion
      of a clinical examination, an electrocardiogram, a biological assessment and a transthoracic
      ultrasound.

      Adverse events and serious adverse events will be collected throughout the study.
