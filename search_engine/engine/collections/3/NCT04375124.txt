      ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) 2 receptors to enter human cells and also blocks the
      activity of ACE 2. Upon these data the investigators hypothesize that, mortal
      hyper-inflammation state which is shown in COVID-19 cases, can be a result of angiotensin
      peptide (1-7) deficiency. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the possible effect
      of plasma derived angiotensin peptide (1-7) supplementation on treatment of COVID-19 cases.
