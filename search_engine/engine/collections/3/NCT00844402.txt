      Hypercholesterolemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Since many PBC patients have a very slow progression of their underlying liver
      disease cardiovascular risk factors may become more relevant as prognostic facors. Whether
      statins lower serum cholesterol levels and reduce the cardiovascular risk in PBC patients
      remains to be determined. Statins are generally well tolerated and are not associated with an
      increased risk of hepatotoxicity in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
      However only limited data on safety on statins in chronic cholestatic liver diseases are
      available. In a recent pilot study at the Medical University of Graz atorvastatin did not
      statistically increase liver enzymes in PBC patients. However, data on long-term treatment
      with atorvastatin in these patients are not yet available. Moreover, long-term treatment with
      statins may have potential beneficial immunomodulatory effects on the disease course of PBC
      in analogy to other immune-mediated disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple
      sclerosis.
