      virus, which is causing many deaths and burden on intensive care facilities. Data regarding
      epidemiologic characteristics in children and young adults is limited, especially in the
      context of educational settings. Due to mild symptoms or even asymptomatic cases in children,
      the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infected children is underestimated. Therefore, the present study aims
      to determine the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children at 3 timepoints during 12
      months expressed as seroconversion measured in non-invasive saliva sampling in TÃ¼bingen, a
      defined study area. Children and adolescents (N = 1850) in the age of 1 to 17 years will be
      recruited via child-care, kindergarten and primary and secondary schools and followed-up for
      12 months: shortly after release of lock-down measures in summer 2020, before winter and
      after the winter. An adult cohort (adult comparator group) is sampled at the same time points
      for incidence comparisons. To validate the ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements in
      saliva compared to blood, and to understand the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in
      respective body fluids, peripheral blood and in saliva will be sampled every 2 months in an
      additional adult group (adult validation group).
