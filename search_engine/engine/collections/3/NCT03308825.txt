      participants, for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine were recommended per Advisory Committee
      on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance, a second dose of the same volume as the first dose
      was administered during Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1). Solicited adverse reaction (AR)
      information was collected for 7 days following each vaccination. Unsolicited non-serious
      adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) information was collected from Visit 1 to
      Visit 2 or from Visit 1 to Visit 3 for those participants receiving 2 doses of study vaccine.

      Immunogenicity was evaluated in all participants prior to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and
      after the final vaccination (Day 28 post-final vaccination for participants 6 months to < 9
      years of age and Day 21 post-vaccination for participants â‰¥ 18 years of age).
