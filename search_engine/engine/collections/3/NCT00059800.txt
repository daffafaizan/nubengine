        -  Determine the clinical response, by serial objective measurements, in patients with
           melanoma treated with boron neutron capture therapy.

        -  Determine the time course, uniformity, and severity of acute dermal reactions in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the late dermal reactions in patients who are followed for at least 6 months
           after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to tumor size (no greater than 15 cc vs greater
      than 15 cc).

      Patients undergo boron neutron capture therapy.

      Patients are followed for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
