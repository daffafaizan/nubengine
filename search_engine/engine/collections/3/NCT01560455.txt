      yet to be established. Prior to the era of drug-eluting stents, the limited data which
      existed suggested that a strategy of stenting the main vessel, with balloon angioplasty alone
      of the side-branch if required was superior to stenting both vessels.

      Randomised trials of "all-comer" bifurcation lesions have now established that there is no
      advantage to systematic dual drug-eluting stent strategies. However, these trials included
      patients with no disease in the side branch, and small side branch vessels.

      Expert consensus suggests that "large" bifurcations with significant ostial side branch
      disease still merit a systematic total lesion coverage stent technique. This trial therefore
      is designed to assess the hypothesis that large true bifurcations with significant side
      branch ostial disease are more successfully treated with a systematic culotte technique than
      with the provisional T approach.
