      will be invited to participate in a longitudinal study comparing the relative contribution of
      the two major maternal iron sources, i.e. maternal dietary iron intake and maternal red blood
      cell iron recycling, to fetal iron accretion during pregnancy. At about 15 weeks of
      gestation, participants will consume an oral dose of a stable iron isotope (57Fe as ferrous
      sulfate) to enrich their red blood cells (RBCs) with 57Fe. Maternal blood samples will be
      collected at 4 times during pregnancy to monitor changes in blood 57Fe concentrations. In the
      third trimester of pregnancy, women will consume a dose of a different iron isotope (58Fe as
      ferrous sulfate) as dietary nonheme iron. Cord blood samples and placental tissue will be
      obtained at delivery to determine how much of the dietary iron (58Fe) and RBC iron (57Fe) was
      transferred to the fetus and how much of each isotope was retained in the placenta. Placenta
      tissue samples will also be used to assess placental expression of iron transporters in
      relation to the amount of each iron isotopes transferred to the fetus. Circulating iron
      status indicators and regulators will be measured in all maternal and cord blood samples to
      examine the effect of iron status on placental transfer of iron derived from the diet vs. RBC
      during pregnancy.
