    
      A double-blind randomized controlled clinical study of an 8-week intervention with 36
      hypertensive subjects was carried out to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of fermented
      milk with Lactococcus lactis NRRL-B50571. Once obtained the informed consent; volunteers were
      randomized into two groups (n=18) to either receive 150 mL daily: fermented milk with
      Lactococcus lactis NRRL-B50571 (intervention group) or artificially acidified milk as control
      (placebo). Both drinks were consumed daily. Participants were asked not to change their diet
      or lifestyle during the intervention. We applied intention to treat for those participants
      who did not have good adherence and those who withdraw the study. The outcomes between groups
      were analyzed using an independent sample Student t test, with a P value of 0.05 or less (two
      sided) when there was statistical significance; using statistical software.
