      diagnosed in the UK each year. Development of prostate cancer depends upon testosterone (the
      male hormone), and medications that block testosterone (eg Androgen Deprivation Therapy, ADT)
      can help men to survive for many years. Men with metastatic prostate cancer are also treated
      with ADT, but recent evidence has demonstrated that there are survival benefits when
      chemotherapy given as well as ADT. Many patients now receive chemotherapy as first line
      treatment along with ADT in the context of newly diagnosed metastatic disease.

      However, blocking testosterone causes bone loss which may lead to osteoporosis and increases
      the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Such fractures cause pain, loss of mobility and
      independence, and one in three men who have a hip fracture will die within one year. The
      osteoporosis caused by prostate cancer treatments may differ from other forms; the limited
      available data suggest that it may affect the wrist more than other bones (most other forms
      affect the spine and hip the most). We need to better understand the pattern of osteoporosis
      in these men, so that we can offer the most effective treatment to protect their bones and
      ensure that they stay as well as possible as they live with their cancer treatment

      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of prostate cancer treatment on bone health.
      Comprehensive bone assessment at baseline and 12 months will include different bone scans
      (DXA whole body, Xtreme CT of radius and HR CT T12 vertebra), biochemical markers of bone
      turnover, anthropometric measurements, and assessment of grip strength and muscle strength
      and function.
