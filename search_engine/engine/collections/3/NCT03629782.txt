      have severe asthma in primary and secondary care settings that should be referred for
      assessment for biologics. It is anticipated that these data from European countries, will
      help to estimate the unmet need for better treatments in severe asthma patients and will
      provide supporting evidence on the current shortcomings in referrals to asthma specialist or
      secondary care clinics. This information could also support the development of better severe
      asthma care pathways across Europe.

      Approximately 1,500 other patients like you will take part in the RECOGNISE study.
