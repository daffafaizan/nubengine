      patients in the VA system have uncontrolled diabetes with high HbA1c. The inability to carry
      out important self-care behaviors such as measuring blood sugars regularly, following diet,
      exercise and medication programs may be due to apathy. Apathy is the lack of motivation,
      persistence and novelty. We have found this to be very prevalent in the VA diabetes
      population. We now do a randomized placebo controlled trial to see if treatment of apathy
      with methylphenidate will improve glycemic control in patients with A1c >8. Treatment will be
      for 6 months. The primary end point is HbA1c.
