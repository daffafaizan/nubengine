      on emotion, thought and behavior, and leads to significant impairments in functionality.
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective and reliable biological treatment
      method used in psychiatric diseases for a long time. The most common use in psychiatry is
      depression. Studies have shown that ECT causes a broadly distributed increase in brain gray
      matter volume (especially the temporal lobe) in MD patients. Optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) is a non-invasive medical imaging method that displays biological tissue layers by
      taking high resolution tomographic sections. Alterations in the thickness of the retinal
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL), which is a layer of the ganglion cell complex in the retina of the
      eye and consists of ganglion cell axons, occur due to axonal damage in the retinal nerve
      tissue. Since RNFL is in a similar form with the brain gray matter tissue, recently,
      neurological and psychiatric studies have been conducted to provide data regarding the
      neurodegeneration occurring in the brain tissue. In the study, it is aimed to assess the
      possible cortical volume changes of patients by measuring changes in the retinal layers due
      to ECT in patients with depression. In other words, considering that ECT causes an increase
      in brain volume, it is to observe whether this increase is reflected in the retinal nerve
      fiber layer thickness.
