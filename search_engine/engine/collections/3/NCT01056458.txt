      insomnia , especially in the pre-menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause stage.
      Sleep problems are common in menopausal and postmenopausal women, its prevalence can be based
      on research from 15% to 60%. As for anxiety, the prevalence of women in this population can
      reach 53.7%. Several studies overseas have already pointed out that the improvement of
      acupuncture for anxiety disorders have had pretty good results. As auricular acupressure with
      a simple operation and the advantages of non-invasive, our interest is to explore the
      clinical benefit of combined auricular acupressure and medical therapy on anxiety and
      insomnia improvement in menopausal and early post-menopausal women. We design a double-blind,
      randomized controlled study, the subjects are ninety 40 to 60 years old women, during
      perimenopause and early postmenopause who are accompanied by anxiety symptoms. They were
      randomly divided into experimental and control groups, use the tape of ear adhesive beads on
      shenmen and subcortical area of both ears after three meals and before bed for three minutes
      each area with alternating ears, twice a week to replace paste. A total treatment time is
      eight times and a total of four weeks. Primary efficacy assessment (primary outcome measure)
      for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) total score change. Secondary efficacy
      assessments (secondary outcome measure) for: 1) Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) scores; 2) Short
      Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores; 3) Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores; and
      4) Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score changes.
