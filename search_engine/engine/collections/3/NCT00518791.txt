      PD, management of the disease is often 'monodisciplinary' since most patients are only
      treated by a neurologist. Stimulating compensatory strategies by allied health professionals
      might offer additional therapeutic relief, but this assumption is mainly based on theoretical
      arguments and expert opinion. Even less is known about the claim that a multidisciplinary
      team of multiple professionals active in complementary domains (e.g. physiotherapy,
      occupational therapy and speech therapy) is superior to management by each of these
      professionals alone.

      This study anticipates to provide more insight in the clinical effectiveness and health care
      costs of multidisciplinary treatment in PD. Therefore, our multidisciplinary care concept (a
      comprehensive assessment by a dedicated multidisciplinary team and subsequent treatment by
      specifically trained health professionals) that is tailored to the patients' individual needs
      will be compared to usual care in terms of effectiveness and costs.
