      version 15.0.5 for windows (2017) using previous results with the mean opioid consumption in
      the first postoperative day as the primary outcome. Effect size of 0.5 (medium effect size)
      was calculated using the difference between the mean opioid consumption in TAB group (140 mg)
      and that in ESPB group (124.6 mg) with an estimated standard deviation of 30 in both groups.
      This study will add a control group in which only intravenous analgesics will be used; hence
      the aforementioned effect size was used for sample size calculation using a one-way ANOVA
      test. Sample sizes of 18 patients in each group are needed to achieve 90% power (1-β) to
      detect differences among the means using an F test with a 0.05 significance level (α). The
      size of the variation in the means is represented by the effect size f = σm / σ, which is
      0.5. A 20% drop out is expected so the drop-out inflated sample size will be 23 patients in
      each group.
