        -  Compare the efficacy of temozolomide with or without radiotherapy in terms of overall
           survival in patients with stage IV melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases.

        -  Compare the time to appearance of neurological symptoms in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life and quality-adjusted survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to LDH
      levels (less than 225 U/L vs 225 U/L or more), concurrent metastases (visceral vs soft
      tissue), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues
           every 4 weeks for a maximum of 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive temozolomide as in arm I and whole brain radiotherapy on days
           8-12 and 15-19 during the first course of chemotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed before beginning each course and then every 4 weeks after
      completion of study drug.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
