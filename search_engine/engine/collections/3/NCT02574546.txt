      incidence and mortality in AA (African American) compared to EA (European American or
      Caucasian) women is influenced by the biology of the tumor. Gene methylation changes caused
      by environmental factors starting at birth is one mechanism through which genetic and
      non-genetic factors could affect development of breast cancer and which could underlie
      disparities in aggressiveness. The investigators were the first to show that a panel of genes
      was hypermethylated specifically in AA-ER-negative tumors in young women in comparison to
      EA-tumors in women of the same age. Gene promoter methylation is found at low levels in
      healthy breast tissues from women without cancer. Race and family history of cancer increase
      the likelihood of these early events. Thus, epigenetic changes may be early events in
      transformation of breast cells and tumor formation.

      This study will enroll women from different ethnic backgrounds undergoing mastectomy in order
      to collect normal and tumor tissue to study these genetic changes and breast cancer risk.
