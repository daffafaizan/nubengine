      characteristics of neck and postoperative diaphragmatic paralysis in patients undergoing
      interscalene brachial plexus block before shoulder arthroscopic surgery. In addition, we want
      to identify risk factors for diaphragmatic paralysis after brachial plexus block. Through
      this study, we can find the basis for predicting the possibility of diaphragmatic paralysis
      after brachial plexus block according to the patient's anatomical characteristics and
      procedural factors.
