      damage. It is also associated with feelings of depression, anxiety, and despair. Current
      treatments for chronic pain usually involves drug treatments, which often has unwanted side
      effects.

      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of neurofeedback, which refers to teaching
      participants to gain control over their own brainwaves, as an intervention to treat chronic
      pain. It is believed that by teaching participants to gain control over a brain signal
      associated with pain resilience, the participant can reduce some of the negative effects
      associated with chronic pain.

      Participants who take part in this study will have their brain activity recorded using
      electroencephalography (EEG), and have pain elicited using the cold pressor test (CPT), which
      involves the participant submerging their wrist in cold water to elicit a chronic pain-like
      sensation. This is a safe, regularly used method, and the participant is free to remove their
      hand early if the pain becomes too great.

      Some participants who take part will undergo neurofeedback training, which will involve them
      viewing a signal associated with pain resilience, and learning to increase it over multiple
      sessions.
