    
      The DynamX Sirolimus Study is a prospective, consecutive enrollment, single-arm study
      designed to enroll up to 30 patients requiring treatment of up to two de novo lesions ≤ 24 mm
      in length in vessels ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter.

      One or two designated target lesions, located in separate epicardial vessels (RCA, LCX or
      LAD), and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be treated with the DynamX SECBS.
      Alternatively, one target lesion may be treated with the DynamX SECBS after successful,
      uncomplicated treatment of a non-target lesion, located in a separate epicardial vessel, with
      any commercially-available DES. Acceptable example: non-target RCA lesion and LAD target
      lesion. Not acceptable example: LAD non-target lesion and 1st diagonal target lesion.

      The primary safety endpoint is Target Lesion Failure at 6 months. TLF is a composite endpoint
      defined as cardiac death, target vessel MI, and clinically-indicated target lesion
      revascularization The primary efficacy endpoint is late lumen loss at 6 months, assessed by
      angiography Additional secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated at 30
      days, 6 and 12 months Using visual assessment, the target lesion must measure ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤
      3.5 mm in diameter and ≤ 24 mm in length able to be covered by a single DynamX Sirolimus
      Bioadaptor including 2 mm of healthy vessel on either side of the planned treatment area.

      The patient will be eligible for stent (also called bioadaptor) implantation only after
      satisfactory lesion pre-dilatation defined as: ≥ TIMI 2 flow, and no dissection greater than
      Grade B (NHLBI) able to be covered with a single DynamX SECBS
