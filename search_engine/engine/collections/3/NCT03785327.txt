      often struggle to secure and maintain employment, succeed in college, or develop satisfying
      personal and professional relationships. Current psychosocial interventions for this
      population have produced limited effects on real-world functioning. These programs typically
      seek to improve social skill and understanding with the hope that these abilities will
      translate to better functioning and are often effective at increasing knowledge of social
      rules and norms,yet these improvements frequently do not translate to better social and life
      outcomes in the real world. One reason for their limited efficacy may be that the mechanisms
      involved in real-life social interaction continue to be poorly understood for this
      population. The current study is designed to specify the factors that predict more or less
      favorable social outcomes for autistic adolescents and young adults when interacting with an
      unfamiliar, non-autistic peer, and test a multifaceted intervention for improving these
      outcomes. The intervention will target both brain and behavior, not only in the individual
      with ASD but also in their typically-developing (TD) partners. For TD participants, the
      efficacy of a training program will be tested to determine if social experiences for older
      adolescents with ASD can be improved by increasing knowledge, acceptance, and understanding
      of autism among TD individuals. For the participants with ASD, this study will test the
      efficacy of an innovative, non-invasive neurostimulation session using Transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) to target social brain regions involved in perspective-taking and
      social reciprocity. Social outcomes for each intervention will be compared to a "no
      intervention" control condition, and to each other, to provide a comprehensive examination of
      intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to social interaction quality for autistic
      adolescents and young adults.
