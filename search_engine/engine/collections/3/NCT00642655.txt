    
      Patients eligible for the study will be those who have anti-HLA antibody (Panel Reactive
      Antibody {PRA}) of >30%. If patients meet these criteria, patients will be asked to have an
      assessment of the ability of IVIG to reduce the anti-HLA antibodies activity in the test
      tube. Patients will receive IVIG 2gm/kg x1 on hemodialysis. Seven days later, patients will
      receive Rituximab 1gm in the CSMC Infusion Center as per protocol for Rituximab infusion. The
      second Rituximab infusion will be on day #22. Additional IVIG infusion will be given at month
      one.

      Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 12 months after the last IVIG
      infusion and will be asked to return for follow up visits at month 1 through 5, month 7 and
      12.
