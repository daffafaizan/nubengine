      to lower labor force participation, increased sickness absence and reduced productivity. A
      Danish study from 2006 reported a yearly 1, 8 million extra days of work absence and close to
      1.100 cases of disability pension related to obesity. A 2016-report from OECD show that
      persons with obesity between the ages 50-59 have three times as much work absence as those
      who do not struggle with obesity. This indicates that persons with obesity are a group where
      the need for work rehabilitation is important. Despite this connection, work focus has not
      been a part of lifestyle interventions for persons with morbid obesity until the last two
      years.

      By introducing a work intervention into a traditional lifestyle rehabilitation program for
      persons with BMI over 30, the investigators wanted to examine whether this would affect the
      participants' ability to work and their lifestyle change. The study was designed as a
      randomized controlled study with an exploring prospective design. The intervention lasted 12
      months and each patient had three visits (baseline, 6 and 12 months) at Muritunet, each
      lasting 4-2-2 weeks. The participants were randomized into two intervention, one with work
      intervention and one without.

      Data material gathered at each stay consisting of self-reported forms, test, journal and
      individual interviews. These were all collected at baseline, and at six and twelve months.
