        1. Determine the safety and tolerability of gemcitabine hydrochloride and pemetrexed
           disodium in patients with advanced mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome. (Phase I)

        2. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride when administered with
           pemetrexed disodium in these patients. (Phase I)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride. Originally,
      this was designed to be followed by a phase II portion to determine the efficacy in this
      population. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, the phase II portion was never
      conducted.

      During Phase I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which ≥ 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
