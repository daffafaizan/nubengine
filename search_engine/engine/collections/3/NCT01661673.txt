    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, sequential escalating repeat daily dose study conducted
      in two parts. The first part is being conducted in healthy subjects and will evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of escalating EVP-0962 doses (10, 50
      100 and 200 mg) or matching placebo following once-daily administration for 14 days. The
      second part will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of EVP-0962 following once-daily administration for 14 days in patients with mild cognitive
      impairment or early Alzheimer's disease at the dose level selected based on the available
      safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observations in the first part.
