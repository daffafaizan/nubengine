      assessment of information satisfaction, psychological stress, illness perception, and symptom
      burden throughout their head and neck cancer treatment without any intervention. This group
      will represent the current standard of care in the head and neck group and serve as a
      "historical control" for the second group. In "Phase II", which will occur after "Phase I"
      group, 30 new participants will be recruited to receive a handbook and to have it integrated
      into their cancer care. The same participant reported outcome measures of information
      satisfaction, psychological stress, illness perception, and symptom burden will be assessed
      such that comparisons between phases can be made. This will serve as a pilot study of the
      implementation and maintenance of an educational intervention in clinical practice and how it
      affects participant-reported outcomes. Comparison of these two groups of participants will
      provide the baseline data to plan future interventions.
