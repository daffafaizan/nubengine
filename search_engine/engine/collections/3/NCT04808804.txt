      vascular process. However, recent studies suggest that ocular degeneration in DM might be
      caused by 2 different conditions: vasculopathy and neuropathy . For some authors, neuropathy
      observed in the retina of DM patients might be a part of an underlying polyneuropathy ; for
      others, however, neuropathic changes might precede microvascular alterations .

      Axons of retinal ganglion cells compose the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in the retina
      and then form the optic nerve connecting the eyeball and brain. Retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) loss is recognized as an important neurodegenerative sign in glaucoma. Thinning of the
      RNFL has also been found in multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease,
      indicating neurodegeneration of the retina. If RNFL thinning is significant in diabetic
      patients with preclinical diabetic retinopathy, evaluation of peripapillary RNFL thickness
      would be very important, because early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy is
      critical to reduce the risk of blindness Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been
      introduced into clinical practice as the most noninvasive and objective method to visualize
      the retina, showing an amount of detail that resembles histological specimens. Initially, OCT
      was applied to detect complications of DR (edema macular or epiretinal membrane). Later on,
      it allowed quantitative and qualitative measurements of retinal thickness and segmentation of
      all intraretinal layers. OCT might detect early retinal neurodegenerative changes, and thus
      help define which diabetic patients may be at risk to develop DR.
