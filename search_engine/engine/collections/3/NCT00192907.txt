      we do not know how. Equally, biochemical changes measured in the blood after trauma (eg.
      bloodglucose, GC-globulin, coagulation parameters etc.) may predict the prognosis and the
      degree of complcations. Two significant complications are infection and organ failure, which
      may prolong hospitalisation and increase mortality.

      In the study we collected samples from blood and body surfaces to determine changes in
      cytokines, biochemistry, bacterial flora, and subsequent complications. We compare the
      changes in between groups of the cohort.
