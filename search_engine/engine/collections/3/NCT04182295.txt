    
      A total of 89 healthy volunteers will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of the 4
      groups at an identical ratio. Four groups differ in acupuncture and placebo information. It
      is summarized as follows:

        1. to receive real acupuncture and to read fully disclosed sham acupuncture information
           (e.g., fake acupuncture) written in the informed consent

        2. to receive real acupuncture and to read partially disclosed sham acupuncture information
           (e.g., different kind of acupuncture) written in the informed consent

        3. to receive sham acupuncture (Park Sham Needle) and to read fully disclosed sham
           acupuncture information written in the informed consent

        4. to receive sham acupuncture to read partially disclosed sham acupuncture information
           (e.g., different kind of acupuncture) written in the informed consent.

      They will read informed consent with differently described placebo information following
      their allocation. After participants repeatedly lift a dumbbell with their non-dominant arm
      to induce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in their biceps brachii, they are given
      allocated acupuncture treatment once a day for three consecutive days including the very
      first visit to compare outcomes (i.e., relief of DOMS measured with pressure pain threshold
      and visual analogue scale) and blinding property (the participants will be asked 'which type
      of acupuncture do you think you have received?' and choose 1 answer out of real, sham, or
      don't know options).
