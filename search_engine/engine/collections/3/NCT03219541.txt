    
      For two-arm randomized control (RCT) pilot study (AIM 3), 100 current smokers will be
      observed to examine the preliminary effect of bidirectional SMS smoking cessation
      intervention. Subjects will be randomized into two groups (intervention vs. control), and
      compare the carbon monoxide (CO) validated 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rates at
      4-week follow-up between intervention group (SMS smoking cessation treatment) and control
      group (assessment texts only).

      Investigators will administer surveys at baseline, 4- and 12-weeks, and assess daily
      cigarette consumption using text message surveys. After the intervention, they will randomly
      select 10 participants from the intervention group to attend semi-structured interviews to
      obtain more in-depth understanding about the usefulness, usability, and acceptability of the
      intervention. Findings from the pilot RCT will be used to derive an estimate of the effect
      size, power, and sample size for a full-scale efficacy trial.
