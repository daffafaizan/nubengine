      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine priming followed by sequential
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride/etoposide/cytarabine (MEC) chemotherapy in adults with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine, within the limits of a Phase 1/2 study, disease response and duration of
      remission.

      II. Identify biomarkers (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] methylation and/or gene expression
      changes) associated with treatment responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of decitabine followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) on days -9 to -5 (dose level 1), days -11 to
      -5 (dose level 2), or days -14 to -5 (dose level 3).

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on days 1-5, etoposide IV
      on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV on days 1-5. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or CR
      with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) may receive up to 2 courses of induction
      therapy and up to 2 courses of consolidation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.
