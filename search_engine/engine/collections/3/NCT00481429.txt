      the sensitivity of body tissues to insulin.

      This pilot study will examine the possibility that baseline biochemistry might predict the
      response to rosiglitazone. The study will be conducted in males and the biomarkers of
      interest measured by specific assays. In addition, since the biomarkers to be measured come
      from body fat, interpretation of the data would be facilitated by accurate measurements of
      changes in body fat mass during treatment and these data can be obtained from Echo-MRI scans.
