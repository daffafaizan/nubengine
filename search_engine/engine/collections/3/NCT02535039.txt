    
      Choose descending colon cancer radical general anesthesia, 80 cases of patients, ASA Ⅱ ~
      level III, aged 65 ~ 75, were randomly divided into two groups: anesthesia method selects the
      tracheal intubation general anesthesia.All Diprifusor propofol used in patients with TCI
      system, with the initial plasma concentration of 2.0 ug/ml start TCI, and intravenous
      sufentanil injection 0.15 ug/kg, propofol 1 ug/ml every 1 minute.After the BIS value < 75,
      start the fentanyl TCI system, maintaining the plasma concentrations of 4 ng/ml, vein to the
      interaction between rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg, insert the endotracheal intubation after mechanical
      ventilation.Adjust the propofol infusion control electrical double-frequency index between 45
      to 55.The experimental group to give intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/sack.And 1 mg/kg
      * d continuous application to the third day after surgery.

      1 day before the surgery, postoperative 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days the MOCA scale to
      assess cognitive function after surgery for the patient.(T0) prior to the induction and bi
      (T1), 24 h after surgery (T2) and 48 h after surgery (T3) extraction in patients with venous
      blood, adopts the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) determination of serum IL - 1
      beta, IL - 6, Aβ1-42, p- Tau concentration.In rSO2 intraoperative continuous monitoring, and
      calculate the average rSO2, intraoperative rSO2 down the biggest percentage compared with
      basic value rSO2 % of Max.And record the occurrence of adverse reactions to special
      circumstances.
