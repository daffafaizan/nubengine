      and a wide-field observation system to observe the fundus.Location, marking and freezing of
      the retinal tear on the scleral side .

      Subretinal fluid is released from the outside of the sclera as needed. The spherical
      conjunctiva was opened and the radial full-thickness scleral incision (3mm)was made about
      8-13mm away from the retinal tear. A "pocket" is formed by injecting some viscoelastic agent
      into the posterior edge of the sclera and separating the choroid from the sclera using the
      Healon packaged cannula (No.27 Rycroft cannula). The Healon 5 syringe was connected with a
      450-um special tube (a 23 caliber curved tube with olive tip). The cannula is inserted into
      the supragromal space under microscopic and was scaned by iOCT . Monitor the location of
      retinal tear during intubation in real time, and adjust the position of the needle: posterior
      margin of the tear. Once confirmed in accord with the needle position, sodium hyaluronate
      injection, injection needles to in front of shift to injection, until the tear was completely
      surrounded in viscoelastic agent to create the choroid crest, usually need 0.2 mL to 0.5 mL.
      Exit the duct and close the incision with scleral presutures.
