      their lifetimes. Sun exposure in childhood appears to be the most important preventable risk
      factor for this disease. This project will develop a tailored, risk-based, written
      intervention, which will be mailed to parents of children age 6-9 years in the spring of each
      year. The tailored intervention will utilize the Precaution Adoption Process Model, which has
      a primary focus on risk perception and suggests that there are seven stages leading to
      sustained health behavior change. The effectiveness of the intervention will be tested using
      a randomized controlled trail involving 1000 children recruited from health care facilities
      and community locations at age 5-6 years and followed for 3 years using telephone interviews
      to assess sun protection behaviors and skin exams to observe changes in melanocytic nevi,
      freckling, and tanning.
