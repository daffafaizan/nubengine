    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of iclaprim
      compared to vancomycin. Patients will receive either iclaprim or vancomycin for 5 to 14 days.
      Patients will be evaluated daily up to early time point (ETP), then every 48 to 72 hours
      through the end of treatment. Patients will also be evaluated at the test of cure (TOC) visit
      (7 to 14 days post-EOT), and will have a Late Follow-Up (LFU) visit (28 to 32 days post-first
      dose).
