      especially between coronary artery disease and LDL-cholesterol (LDL).

      LDL is the lipoprotein responsible for delivering cholesterol to cells. However, in recent
      years, special attention has been given to modified LDL, especially oxidized LDL, since it
      plays a very important role in the initiation and progression of the atheroma plaque.

      There are environmental and genetic factors that can influence the type and levels of blood
      lipoproteins. Among the modulable factors (environmental) it has been observed that some
      phytochemical compounds found in several plant extracts may reduce cardiovascular risk, due
      to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the possible effect of the intake of a
      combination of plant extracts (BSL_EP025) on the levels of LDL-cholesterol and oxidized
      LDL-cholesterol in healthy individuals with LDL-cholesterol levels between 100 and 190 mg/dL.
