      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), accounting for substantial morbidity
      and an annual expenditure of approximately 150 million annually.(1,2) Non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) have been shown to be effective in multiple prospective
      randomized controlled trial for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.(3-6) NSAIDs are
      postulated to inhibit phospholipase A2 and prostaglandin synthesis, which plays an important
      role in the inflammatory cascade in acute pancreatitis. Rectal suppository indomethacin (a
      potent COX-2 inhibitor) has been effective in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis in clinical
      trials and is now recommended for routine use for ERCP by the European Society of
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.(7) ToradolÂ® (ketorolac), an NSAID available in IV form, is a more
      potent COX-2 inhibitor and analgesic than indomethacin.(8,9) Ketorolac is routinely used
      postoperatively following major surgery to assist in pain control particularly following
      orthopedic procedures. IV ketorolac has never been evaluated for the prevention of post-ERCP
      pancreatitis.
