    
      Phase Ⅰ is a cross-sectional study to record selected information and biospecimen of more
      than 250 sporadic colorectal adenoma cases (200 cases with convetional adenomas, 25 cases
      with hyperplasticpolyps and 25 cases with TSA/SSAs), 50 cases of sporadic colorectal cancer
      (early cancer), 50 cases with familial inherited colorectal cancer (FAP and LS) or healthy
      controls.

      Phase Ⅱ is a nested case-control study. A total of 250 patients with sporadic colorectal
      cancer (early stage cancer) or sporadic colorectal adenoma will be included in Phase Ⅱ and
      regular follow-up to observe the recurrence and progress after resection of the lesions of
      colorectal adenomas.

      The end point of the study is the recurrence of bowel adenoma or carcinoma and follow-up time
      is five years. After the observation, each case with the study outcome was matched with
      corresponding controls in a 1:1 ratio for further analysis according to the conditions such
      as age and gender.(Due to the particularity of single-cell sequencing, all specimens that
      meet the test requirements were sent for examination, and a nest-type case-control design was
      not adopted.)
