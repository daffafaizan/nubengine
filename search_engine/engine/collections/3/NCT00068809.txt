      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is associated with short- and long-term
      complications, and concerns are mounting about the cumulative effect of these complications
      as adolescents enter the third and fourth decade of life. A management strategy that can
      suppress the virus and decrease overall drug exposure is needed. In addition, the scheduling
      requirements for antiretroviral therapies interfere with the socialization and independence
      that an adolescent must accomplish to gain skills for a successful adult life. Not
      surprisingly, nonadherence to prescribed medications is common in teens. This multicenter,
      prospective, proof of concept trial will evaluate Short Cycle Therapy (SCT) in adolescents
      with sustained viral suppression of at least 6 months. While maintenance of viral load
      suppression can be viewed as either a safety or efficacy endpoint, the trial is constructed
      as an assessment of safety.

      Eligible participants who have been on standard HAART therapy consisting of a Protease
      Inhibitor will switch to SCT therapy(4 days on treatment, 3 days off treatment each week) at
      entry. Participants will be seen in the clinic every other Monday during the first month,
      then monthly up to 24-weeks and then once every two months until the end of the 48-week study
      period. Plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts will be performed at every visit.
      Medication adherence by self-report will be conducted every 2 weeks until week 24 and every
      4-weeks thereafter until week 48. Fasting serum triglycerides and cholesterol will be
      measured at baseline, at week 24 and at the end of the study.
