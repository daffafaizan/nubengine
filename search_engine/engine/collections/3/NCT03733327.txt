      Recent studies have demonstrated that autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (auto-HSCT) could improve the prognosis of these patients. However, the optimal conditioning
      regimen of auto-HSCT remains unclear. In this study, the investigators evaluated the safety
      and efficacy of BUCYE conditioning regimens in PCNSL undergoing auto-HSCT.
