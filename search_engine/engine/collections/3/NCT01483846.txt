      receive daily oral doses of AV-101 for 14 consecutive days. Each cohort has 12 subjects on
      active drug and 4 subjects on placebo. Safety, PK, and antihyperalgesic effects of treatment
      with AV-101 will be assessed.

      At the screening visit between Day -28 and Day -7 before randomization, 250 Î¼g of capsaicin
      will be intradermally delivered into the volar aspect of one forearm. Subjects must report a
      pain score of at least 4 out of 10 to qualify for the study. On Day 1 and Day 14 the
      following data are collected: (1) neurosensory testing (thermal sensation, thermal pain,
      touch, and mechanical pain) on the forearm; (2) neurocognitive evaluation; and (3) 12-lead
      electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. PK samples
      will be collected on Days 1, 2, 14, and 15. The capsaicin-induced pain will be assessed at
      screening, on Day 1, and Day 14. An intradermal injection of capsaicin into the forearm on
      Day 1 and Day 14 will be followed by the efficacy measures. On Day 1 before administration of
      the first dose, subjects will be given a paper diary to record daily self-administration of
      each dose, concomitant medications, and adverse events during the 14-day treatment period.
