    
      The following parameters will be evaluated as part of this study:

        -  Aneurysm morphology

        -  Aneurysm size

        -  For ruptured aneurysms: Hunt and Hess Classification of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

        -  Size of the embolization device(s) used in the procedure

        -  Intra-procedural assessment of aneurysm occlusion and flow stasis

        -  Degree of aneurysm occlusion post-procedure (percentage occlusion, Raymond Scale and
           other scores as appropriate)

        -  Aneurysm occlusion durability

        -  Recanalization rate

        -  Device-related changes in Modified Rankin Scale from baseline

        -  Complications/adverse events

        -  Rebleed/new bleed
