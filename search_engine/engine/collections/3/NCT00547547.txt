    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-selenium Brassica juncea (BJ-Se) and
           capecitabine when administered in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride in patients
           with advanced malignancies.

        -  To determine the effects of BJ-Se on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan hydrochloride
           and capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effect of BJ-Se on the serum selenium and protein profile.

        -  To correlate response and tolerance to this regimen with expression of key enzymes
           involved as targets or with the metabolism of the components of treatment, including
           thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.

        -  To evaluate changes to potential selenium related parameters.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of high-selenium Brassica juncea
      (BJ-Se) and capecitabine. The dose of capecitabine is escalated first, followed by dose
      escalation of BJ-Se.

      Patients receive oral BJ-Se on days -7 to 21 in course 1 and on days 1-21 in all other
      courses. Patients also receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression.

      After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine and BJ-Se are determined, additional
      patients are accrued and receive treatment at the MTD. Blood is collected from these patients
      during course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.
