      handicap of infectious origin in industrialized countries. Around 10% of infected neonates
      have symptoms and more than 50% of those will develop long term neurological sequelae and
      sensorineural hearing loss. Among asymptomatic infected neonates 10 to 15% will ultimately
      develop hearing loss. To establish the prognosis of infected neonates remains difficult and
      the purpose of the study is to better define early prognosis factors The true burden of CMV
      congenital infection is unknown in France: the prevalence of the infection as well as the
      description of its epidemiology (proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, rate of
      long term sequelae, proportion of cases following primary or secondary maternal infections)
      are unknown.
