3805. cisternal fluid oxygen tension in manmeasurement of cerebral oxygen tensionin man has been hampered by technical dif-ficulties.  the authors present a methodin which a beckman microelectrode wasintroduced into the cisterna magna andoxygen tension measured, the hypothesisbeing that measurement of oxygen tensionin a fluid which equilibrates with theaverage cerebral oxygen tension shouldgive reliable measure of cerebral oxygentension.  in their subjects, inhalation ofpure oxygen produced an increase in theoxygen tension in the cisternal fluid aswell as in the arterial blood without anyalteration of the oxygen tension in thebulb of the internal jugular vein, whereasinhalation of 95% oxygen and 5% carbondioxide increased the oxygen tension in thecisternal fluid as well as in the arterialand venous blood.  5% carbon dioxide inair produced an increase in the cisternaloxygen tension; a fall in arterial bloodpressure associated with the introductionof the suboccipital needle was accom-panied by a decrease in cisternal oxygentension which then rose simultaneously withthe increase in arterial blood pressurethat followed infusion of dextran.  intravenousinjection of xanthinol niacinate inducedin all patients a more or less pronounced fallin arterial blood pressure and at thesame time the cisternal oxygen tension fell;administration of aramine was associatedwith a rise in arterial blood pressureplus a rise in cisternal oxygen tension.
