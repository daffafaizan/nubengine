      by buffering systems, in which the main role is played by bicarbonates (HCO3-). For this
      reason, sodium bicarbonate (SB) is often proposed as an ergogenic agent, especially during
      high-intensity efforts. Until now the major limitation to SB supplementation has been the
      gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. There is also a lack of data of the individual SB-induced
      changes of buffering potential kinetics and its actual connection with physical capacity and
      discipline-specific performance. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of acute,
      different-dose SB ingestion on buffering potential kinetics, physical capacity,
      discipline-specific performance as well as changes of diagnostically significant blood
      biochemical indices concentration in athletes, in a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover trial.
