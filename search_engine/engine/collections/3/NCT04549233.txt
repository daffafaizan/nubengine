      sodium; 2) 1.2% added sugar; 3) 1.8% added sugar; and 4) 0.2% added sodium to mask
      bitterness. First, a familiar food will be offered to provide baseline data. Then each of the
      four versions of the novel kale puree will be offered to the infant by their caregiver, and
      the order the kale versions are presented will be randomized. The salt version will always be
      offered last to control for the effects of a very different taste exposure (salt vs. sweet)
      and to try to avoid any significant carryover effects of salt taste on sweet perception.
      Feeding interactions will be video recorded for behavioral coding of infant responses to each
      bite. Additionally, infant and caregiver heart rate and skin conductance will be monitored to
      assess physiological responses in each participant throughout the feeding interaction.

      Several measures will be observed in order to test predictors of infant food acceptance,
      caregiver perceptions of infants' responses, and physiological responses in infants and
      caregivers. These include:

        -  Demographic measures

        -  Observed caregiver height and weight

        -  Observed infant length and weight

        -  Child developmental stage using Ages and Stages screening tool

        -  Caregiver neophobia

        -  Caregiver preferences for and intake of fruits and vegetables

        -  Infant feeding history and food experience

        -  Eating behaviors using the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Toddlers

        -  Infant behavior using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (Garstein & Rothbart
           2003 Infant Behav Dev)

        -  Caregiver feeding persistence
