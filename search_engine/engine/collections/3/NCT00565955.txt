      chronic asthma. There are three randomized controlled trials involving 274 adult patients
      with acute asthma who were treated with montelukast (intravenous in 2 and intravenous and
      oral in one study) to see the beneficial response in spirometry. All the studies showed
      significant improvement in FEV1 in first 2 hours. These studies show that oral montelukast
      causes improved pulmonary function and has a rapid onset of action. However, these studies
      are carried out in adults. Safety of oral montelukast is well established in children, as
      evidenced by use of oral montelukast in long term management of asthma.

      Therefore, we planned this study to see the effect of oral montelukast as add on therapy to
      standard treatment in acute moderate to severe asthma in children between 5-15 years of age.
