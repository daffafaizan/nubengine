      group and control group. Infants in intervention group will attend the follow-up clinic and
      motor development assessment and guidance will be provided every three months in the first
      year. Other lifestyle interventions include feeding guidance and healthcare education.
      Infants in control group will routinely attend the follow-up clinic every six months. Primary
      outcome is the rate of overweight/obesity at two years old and seven years old.
      Neurodevelopmental assessment, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and blood pressure at
      childhood will also be evaluated. The association of the outcome of LGA infants at two years
      old and the biomarkers in cord blood will be investigated, which includes serum leptin,
      insulin, insulin-like growth factors -1 (IGF-1), blood lipid series and adiponectin.
