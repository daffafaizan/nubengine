    
      The PEARL Registry collects real world data about mid-length AngioJet catheters to:

        -  Characterize usage patterns, treatment approaches, and targeted vessels

        -  Document treatment strategies, including specific techniques and concomitant therapies

        -  Collect outcome data during initial hospitalization and at a 3-month follow-up phone
           call or visit

        -  Evaluate the frequency of specific clinical events in relation to risk factors,
           diagnosis, and treatments provided

        -  Identify treatment strategies that may optimize procedural and clinical outcomes, to
           facilitate development of treatment guidelines

        -  Offer sites a valuable resource for tracking usage and performance of the AngioJet
           System at their institution

      Information collected by the PEARL Registry is intended for educational and clinical research
      purposes only.
