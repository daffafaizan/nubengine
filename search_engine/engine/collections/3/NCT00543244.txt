      hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [1,2]
      Recently, treatment with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin has become the standard of care
      for patients with chronic hepatitis C. While genotype 2 patients can have higher sustained
      virologic response (SVR) rates to 80-90%, genotype 1 patients generally have low SVR rates of
      only 40-50%. [3-5] In contrast, genotype 1 Taiwanese patients have superior SVR rates that
      those in Western countries. [6,7] Despite the overall improved response to this combination
      therapy, more than 75% of patients suffer from treatment-related adverse events and the costs
      remain high, [8,9] which make individualized therapy of paramount importance to maximize
      treatment response and minimize adverse events.

      HCV viral kinetics with interferon-based therapies have been studied recently to evaluate
      patient responses. [10-14] Early viral kinetics shown to have favorable SVR rates, which make
      shorter treatment duration possible. [15-18] However, different viral kinetics were found
      through ethnicity. [19-23] Recently, a pilot study to evaluate the viral kinetics of 6
      Taiwanese patients with HCV infection who received peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy
      has shown superior early viral kinetics to those in Caucasian patients. [24] Based on the
      favorable SVR rates in treating Taiwanese patients with chronic hepatitis C, the
      investigators aimed to conduct a large confirmatory study to evaluate the viral kinetics and
      try to define the optimal treatment for these patients.
