    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study that will compare
      the efficacy and safety of L-citrulline versus placebo in subjects undergoing surgery for
      congenital heart defects.

      Eligible subjects undergoing repair of a large unrestrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD),
      a partial or complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), or an ostium primum atrial
      septal defect (primum ASD) will be eligible for enrollment in this study.

      Each enrolled subject will be randomized to receive either L-citrulline or placebo throughout
      all administrations in the study. Subjects will receive an L-citrulline bolus of 150 mg/kg or
      placebo at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, the addition of L-citrulline at a
      concentration of 200 μmol/L or placebo given as a bolus during bypass. This may be
      administered as a one-time bolus or multiple administrations to compensate for fluids
      containing L-citrulline that may be removed from the patient during the course of the
      operation and thus to maintain the concentration of 200 μmol/L. L-citrulline bolus of 20
      mg/kg or placebo 30 minutes after decannulation from cardiopulmonary bypass, followed
      immediately by a 9 mg/kg/hr continuous L-citrulline infusion or placebo for up to 48 hours.

      The study drug or placebo infusion will be discontinued once invasive arterial blood pressure
      monitoring is discontinued or at 48 hours, whichever comes first. Subjects will be followed
      until Day 28 or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first. For subjects discharged
      prior to Day 28, a final assessment via telephone will be conducted at Day 28.
