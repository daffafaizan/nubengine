      mortality and disease progression in HIV-infected patients, nevertheless, cardiovascular
      disease is a major concern impacting morbidity and mortality in this population.

      This study will assess if a potent statin, rosuvastatin, could improve endothelial
      dysfunction, slow carotid intima media thickness (IMT) progression and bone loss, and
      decrease inflammation and oxidative stress in HIV-infected ART-treated subjects with good HIV
      virologic control. The investigators will also see if rosuvastatin will induce beneficial
      changes in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and lipid metabolism as well as improve bone
      turnover markers.
