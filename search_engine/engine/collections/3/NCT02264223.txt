      bioavailability of active compounds on the bioavailability of red clover derived isoflavones.
      20 healthy participants will receive red clover derived isoflavones in five different
      formulations. The five formulations are split up into five phases:

      Phase 1) Fermented extract in liquid form Phase 2) Fermented extract (freeze-dried) in
      capsule form Phase 3) Fermented extract (freeze-dried) in tablet form Phase 4) Fermented
      extract (concentrated) mixed in yogurt Phase 5) Un-fermented red clover in capsule or tablet
      form The trial will last 5-6 weeks for each participant. Plasma sample collection will take
      place both pre-and post- ingestion of a formulation, participants will receive blood tests at
      intervals -15 min, 0 min, 2hr, 4hr, 6hr, 8hr and 12hr (on the day of ingestion) and on the
      subsequent two mornings (24hr and 48hr) following the initiation of a phase. There will be a
      minimum. 5 day intervals between all phases (washout periods). Isoflavones biochanin A,
      formononetin, genistein and daidzein present in plasma will be detected using HPLC-MS for
      each phase, thus creating a bioavailability curve that can be compared to each of the other
      phases. The primary endpoint is to determine whether fermented extract is more bioavailable
      than unfermented extract.
