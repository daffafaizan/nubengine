      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody (MOAB) ch14.18 when combined
      with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) after autologous bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell rescue in children with neuroblastoma.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics, including antibody level, antibody-binding activity, and presence of human
      anti-chimeric antibodies, of this regimen in these patients.

      IV. Determine the activity of IL-2 and MOAB ch14.18 against tumor cells in terms of response
      using standard clinical measurements such as bone marrow immunocytology in these patients.

      V. Determine the extent of coating of tumor cells (bone marrow metastases) by MOAB ch14.18 in
      these patients.

      VI. Determine the feasibility of isotretinoin administered between courses beginning after
      course 2 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of monoclonal antibody (MOAB).

      Patients receive MOAB IV over 5 hours on days 7-10 during courses 2 and 4 and on days 3-6
      during courses 1, 3, and 5; sargramostim (GM-CSF) IV over 2 hours or subcutaneously daily on
      days 0-13 during courses 1, 3, and 5; interleukin-2 IV continuously on days 0-3 and 7-10
      during courses 2 and 4; and oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 14-27 during courses 2 and
      4 and on days 10-23 during courses 3 and 5. Treatment repeats every 24-32 days for 5 courses
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A minimum of 6 additional patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      Patients are followed every other week for 2 months and then every 3 months for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-16 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
