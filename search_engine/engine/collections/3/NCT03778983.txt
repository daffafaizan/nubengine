      increased steadily. Today, pediatric Ltx is a well-established treatment for a variety of
      liver diseases in their final stage. Even in relative indications (i.e. certain metabolic
      diseases), liver transplantation is a promising treatment option that actually is becoming
      increasingly important in clinical practice .

      Importantly, childhood cognitive ability is highly predictive for educational achievement and
      later occupational outcomes as well as health behavior . Current research indicates that
      liver transplanted children are at higher risk for developing cognitive deficits compared to
      the age-matched normal population .

      The aim of present study is to evaluate the cognitive development after pediatric liver
      transplantation. The investigators expect to understand of the association between cognitive
      deficits and certain disease-related variables, which may be contribute to optimizing
      clinical care of these patients.
