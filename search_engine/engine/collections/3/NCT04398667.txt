    
      This is a multinational, multicentre, non-interventional, retrospective data collection
      (manual Medical Chart Review). The identified local site staff (or trained independent data
      abstractors, if requested by the site) will review the medical records of all participants
      meeting the eligibility criteria, who have provided a signed inform consent form (ICF) for
      data collection and analysis. For participants who are less than 18 years of age, in addition
      to the assent form being signed by the participant, an informed consent would be obtained
      from parental or legally authorized representative.

      In line with the retrospective nature of the study: there is no assignment of a participant
      to a particular therapeutic strategy; no additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures shall
      be applied to the participants; epidemiological methods shall be used for the analysis of
      collected data; the prescription of any medication for the treatment of the epileptic
      syndrome occur before the collection of the data in this study and is clearly separated from
      the decision to include the participant in the study.
