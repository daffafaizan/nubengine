      subjects are treated with either atorvastatin or placebo. During treatment periods subject
      are given a standardized diet.

      On the examination days subject are given L-NMMA(L-NG-monomethyl Arginine citrate), a NO
      inhibitor, 6 mg bolus infusion followed by continuous 4 mg/kg/hr infusion for 1 hour. Renal
      function, central hemodynamic and vasoactive hormones are evaluated prior, during and after
      L-NMMA infusion.

      Renal function is measured by renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and urinary sodium, potassium and
      albumin concentration. Urinary excretion of protein from sodium channels such as the NaCl
      cotransporter (NCC), the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC) and the epithelial sodium channel
      (ENaC)will be measured to evaluate channel activity in the nephron.

      Central blood pressure, pulse wave analysis, and augmentation index are measured using
      SphygmoCorÂ® from Atcor.

      The vasoactive hormones aldosterone, renin, angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),
      brain natriuretic (BNP) and endothelin is measured in plasma
