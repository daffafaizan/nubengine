    
      CoQun速 10 ml is a medical device marked by the European Community as class IIb. This device
      has a system of dispensation that permits it to be preservative free (OSD - Ophthalmic
      Squeeze Dispenser). Investigators and patients will be masked to the study treatment. In
      order to mask the treatment, identical kit boxes, identical packaging (bottles and labels)
      will be used for vehicle and active product. The bottles will be dispensed sealed to the
      patient.

      One or two drops of the solution (CoQun速 or Vehicle) will be instilled in the conjunctival
      sac of both eyes, twice daily from 8 to 10 AM and from 8 to 10 PM. Hypotensive therapy should
      be administered in the evening one hour after the CoQun速 or Vehicle administration.

      At baseline, ocular hypotensive treatment, as per inclusion criteria has to be a PGA
      monotherapy. During the follow-up, in case the IOP exceeds 28 mmHg, any additional
      hypotensive therapy will be allowed to obtain IOP control.

      Dose modifications/reductions of CoQun速 /Vehicle are not permitted.
