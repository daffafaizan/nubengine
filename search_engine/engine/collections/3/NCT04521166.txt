      listener. The choice of appropriate hearing aid settings is integral to the hearing
      rehabilitative process. Researchers and clinicians have been influenced by previous work
      showing that individual cognitive abilities, including working memory, are associated with
      hearing aid benefit, especially in adverse listening conditions. However, previous research
      is limited to omnidirectional microphone settings and unrealistic listening conditions. Such
      conditions fail to recognize that most hearing aids are fit with directional processing that
      may improve the listening environment, and that typical environments contain speech and noise
      signals in a range of spatial locations. Therefore, the broad goal of this research is to
      understand how patient variables interact with hearing aid signal processing in realistic
      listening conditions in order to effectively treat hearing-impaired individuals in
      communications situations that are most important to them.
