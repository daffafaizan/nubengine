    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 (DI-Leu16-IL2
      immunocytokine) following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with
      B-cell NHL.

      II. To investigate the optimal biological dose (OBD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 following peripheral
      blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL, which may differ from the
      MTD.

      III. To describe the toxicities associated with the proposed DI-Leu16-IL2 regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by the induction of DI-Leu16-IL2-specific
      antibodies.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DI-Leu16-IL2. III. To document any clinical responses
      associated with the proposed therapy and survival endpoints of the enrolled patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of DI-Leu16-IL2 immunocytokine.

      Patients receive DI-Leu16-IL2 immunocytokine IV over 4 hours on 4 consecutive Wednesdays.

      Patients with detectable CD20-positive B-cells pretreatment also receive rituximab IV on 4
      consecutive Tuesdays.

      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
