    
      Evidence Based Practice (EBP) has become an important issue in nursing. It is considered a
      process consisting of sequential steps. Multiple barriers are found, among them, time
      restriction, lack of personal motivation, professional resistance to research and inadequate
      knowledge. The proposal of this study is to provide Brazilian clinical nurses with tools to
      be used as a guide, with a structured process in stages as a facilitator of the
      implementation of EBP projects in search of best practice in nursing processes, for this the
      investigators will verify the adequacy of authorized translation of the Portuguese version of
      the Johns Hopkins Center for Evidence-Based Practice guide tools and whether these tools are
      facilitators in structuring and describing an EBP project from the perspective of the
      clinical nurse, in addition to verifying whether the EBP project met the requirements of
      preparation from the perspective of the researcher.
