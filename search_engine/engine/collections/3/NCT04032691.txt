      therapeutic intent. Vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and sleep quality will
      be measured repeatedly during a one week lead-in period. Then, the ventricular cerebrospinal
      fluid (vCSF) clearance rates of [11C]butanol will be measured with PET before and after one
      week of treatment with clonidine, 0.1 mg by mouth daily at bedtime. Safety surveillance will
      be augmented with home health monitoring devices that are wifi and blue tooth enabled.
      Surveillance for adverse events related to drug discontinuation will be monitored for one
      week during a washout period.

      Primary Objective: To assess the logistical feasibility and safety of treating normotensive
      adults with clonidine and monitoring its effects with home health devices. The primary
      outcome measure will be the number of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs).
      Other measures will include changes in sleep quality, vital signs and ECG parameters, such as
      the PR and corrected QT intervals.

      Secondary Objectives: To estimate drug-induced changes in vCSF clearance rates of butanol
      with PET scans acquired before and after treatment as a function of steady-state plasma
      levels of clonidine.
