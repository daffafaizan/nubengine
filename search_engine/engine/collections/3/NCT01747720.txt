    
      OBJECTIVES

      Primary:

      - to determine whether adding oral supplementation with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) at doses
      of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 IU/d to baseline total vitamin D intake over a period of 12 months
      reduces mammographic breast density among premenopausal women at moderate to high risk of
      breast cancer who reside in the Quebec City area, Canada.

      Secondary:

        -  to assess the net increase in 25(OH)D levels resulting from this vitamin D3
           supplementation;

        -  to document the compliance with, and safety of, supplementation with tested doses of
           vitamin D3 over one year.

      OUTLINE This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial among
      premenopausal women who live in the Quebec City area and have â‰¥ 20% breast density at
      baseline.

      The intervention consists of the addition, over baseline total vitamin D intake from food and
      supplements, of three different doses of vitamin D3 (1000, 2000 or 3000 IU/day) for a period
      of 12 months. There are four arms in the trial:

        -  Arm 1: 1,000 IU vitamin D3/d (1 tablet vitamin D 1000 IU + 2 tablets placebo);

        -  Arm 2: 2,000 IU vitamin D3/d (2 tablets vitamin D 1000 IU + 1 tablet placebo);

        -  Arm 3: 3,000 IU vitamin D3/d (3 tablets vitamin D 1000 IU);

        -  Arm 4: placebo (3 tablets placebo/d).

      Vitamin D tablets (1000 IU tablets) and the placebo tablets are undistinguishable in size,
      shape, color and taste, and are manufactured by the same company.
