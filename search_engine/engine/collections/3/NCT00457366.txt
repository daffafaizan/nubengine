    
      In the Psychiatric Emergency Room, agitated patients are treated routinely with an I.M.
      Haloperidol "cocktail" (Haloperidol 5 mg, Lorazepam 2 mg, Cogentin 2 mg), which has proved to
      be an effective treatment. However, since it is an intramuscular injection, it is more
      complicated and perhaps less acceptable to patients as well as more likely to cause EPS
      (extrapyramidal symptoms). Of late in our emergency room, we started using high dose
      Quetiapine 300 mg PO to replace the "cocktail" for treating agitation. It has shown promising
      results.

      This study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Quetiapine with the routine
      "cocktail for treatment of agitation.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Quetiapine by
      using high dose Quetiapine (300 mg) PO to treat agitated patients in the psychiatric
      emergency room.

      The secondary purpose is to test the immediate effect on agitation caused by illicit drug
      abuse or the alcohol abuse.
