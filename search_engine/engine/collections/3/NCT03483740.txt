      cognitive impairment related to HIV a significant comorbidity in this population. With the
      development, access to, and early initiation of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), HAND is
      less severe and less common than it once was. However, people who were treated with old
      therapies, ones that were less effective and with higher rates of toxicity compared to
      current regimens, or who experienced AIDS defining illnesses, may be affected by HAND more
      frequently and more severely. Issues with cognition, memory, processing new information,
      problem solving, and decision making are all potential symptoms.

      Psychosocial interventions have been used to decrease stress and depression and improve
      coping and quality of life in the general aging population experiencing cognitive impairment
      and depression. These techniques, which can vary widely, have not been fully tested in people
      aging with HAND.

      CTNPT 029 (a pilot trial funded by the CTN) seeks to enroll 16 people at St. Michael's
      Hospital in Toronto. Study participants will be randomized to either receive cognitive
      remediation group therapy (CRGT) or standard HIV group therapy (control group). Both group
      therapies consist of a series of weekly 3-hour sessions led by a certified social worker and
      a peer. The CRGT group will spend one hour per session on brain training exercises
      (PositScience Software) and the remaining two hours on mindfulness-based stress reduction
      (meditation, breathing exercises, etc.). The control group will focus on general health and
      wellbeing for people aging with HIV. Study investigators will determine the usefulness of the
      structure of the sessions and the feasibility and acceptability of performing a study of this
      kind.
