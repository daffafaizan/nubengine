      which ranks among the leading causes of disability and premature death in young women. The
      investigators propose to test the hypothesis that a novel, couple-based intervention
      developed for adult AN (UCAN) significantly enhances treatment outcome and reduces risk of
      relapse compared with treatment conducted entirely on an individual basis, the standard mode
      of treatment delivery in the community. The investigators plan to compare UCAN with
      individual treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). All participants with AN will
      receive a common set of core interventions, including medical management, nutrition
      counseling, and a base level of individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), with
      randomization either to: 1) UCAN couple-based intervention or 2) a higher "dose" of
      individual CBT. The partners are involved in varying ways and to varying degrees in
      treatment. In addition, progress will be followed for one year after completion of active
      treatment.
