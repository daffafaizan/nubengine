    
      Background: Since the establishment of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in
      Romania in 2015 there has been a growing number of interventions being performed by an
      increasing number of hospitals throughout the country. In 2018, there were more than 250
      implants, which are expected to grow in the following years by about 30% on an annual basis.

      Objective: This is a national quality assurance initiative to improve patient care and
      outcomes. It further serves as a database for the assessment of the safety and efficacy of
      TAVI and its financial implications (e.g. reimbursement).

      Design: National, prospective, observational, multi-center registry. All centers performing
      TAVI in Romania; minimum cases per center for inclusion: 20 cases/year-to-date Population:
      All patients undergoing TAVI in Romania at any of the participating centers with a CE-marked
      valve of any manufacturer given that they provide written informed consent.
