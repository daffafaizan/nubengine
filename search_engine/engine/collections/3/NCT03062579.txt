    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug tocilizumab as monotherapy contributes
      to reduce the average relapsing rate (ARR) and improve neurological disability in NMOSD
      patients, who still have experienced relapses when common immunosuppressive medications
      including rituximab had been used.

      The primary (most important) objectives of this study are to determine: Whether bortezomib
      reduces relapse frequency in patients with relapsing NMO. The number of attacks during the
      one year treatment period will be compared to the number of attacks that occurred prior to
      initiation of tocilizumab treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to determine:

      The safety profile of tocilizumab in patients with NMO and whether tocilizumab improves
      walking, visual function and quality of life as measured by a variety of established
      disability scales.
