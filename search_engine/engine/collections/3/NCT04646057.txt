    
      Plastic surgeons have a variety of biologic and synthetic mesh available for use. However, no
      mesh has adequately evaluated safety and effectiveness for FDA approval or clearance for use
      in breast reconstruction. Therefore, no mesh is an appropriate comparator for a randomized
      clinical study.

      This multi-center, prospective, clinical study with matched historical controls of total
      submuscular 2-stage breast reconstructions with no mesh will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of DuraSorb® monofilament surgical mesh when implanted in subjects undergoing
      2-stage breast reconstruction.

      Women scheduled for mastectomy and immediate 2-stage breast reconstruction will sign informed
      consent and satisfy eligibility criteria prior to the first stage of surgery and DuraSorb®
      implantation.

      Maximum study follow-up is through one year after definitive reconstruction.
