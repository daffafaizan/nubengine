      Sulfate capsules following a single, oral dose in healthy volunteers under fasting and fed
      conditions.

      Twenty-two healthy, non-smoking, non-obese, male and female volunteers between the ages of 18
      and 45 years of age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two
      Quinine Sulfate dosing regimens in sequence with a 7 day washout period between dosing
      periods. On the morning of Day 1, subjects will receive either a single oral dose of Quinine
      Sulfate (2 x 324 mg capsules) following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, or a single
      oral dose of Quinine Sulfate (2 x 324 mg capsules) 30 minutes after a standardized, high-fat
      breakfast. After a 7 day washout period, on the morning of Day 8, subjects will receive the
      alternate regimen. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for 48
      hours post-dose to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of Quinine Sulfate. A further goal
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy
      volunteers. Subjects will be monitored throughout the confinement portion of the study for
      adverse reactions to the study drug and/or procedures. Blood pressure and heart rate will be
      measured prior to dosing and at 1, 2, 4 and 12 hours after each dose and at study exit. A 12
      lead electrocardiogram (EKG) will be recorded at study check-in and at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24
      hours after dose administration. All adverse events whether elicited by query, spontaneously
      reported, or observed by clinic staff will be evaluated by the Investigator and reported in
      the subject's case report form.
