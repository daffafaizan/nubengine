      adjustment of 50% of the tirofiban label dosing regimen (0.4 μg/kg/min for a period of 30
      minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.10 μg/kg/min) is recommended in patients with severe
      renal impairment (<30 mL/min CrCl), including those who require hemodialysis. The dosage
      adjustment for the tirofiban high-dose bolus regimen (25 μg/kg bolus followed by a 0.15
      μg/kg/min maintenance) for patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency is however
      unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent of dosage adjustment for the
      high-dose bolus regimen for patients with moderate (30-59 mL/min CrCl), and severe (<30
      mL/min CrCl) renal insufficiency.

      This non-randomized, single-center, open-label study evaluating the pharmacokinetic (PK),
      pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety profile of a single high-dose IV bolus injection of
      tirofiban (25 µg/kg). A single dose of tirofiban will be administered to the subjects with
      normal renal function (>90 mL/min CrCl), moderate (30-59 mL/min CrCl), and severe (<30 mL/min
      CrCl) renal impairment with non-dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency (NDDRI).
