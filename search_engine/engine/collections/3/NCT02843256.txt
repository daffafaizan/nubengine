      days 0-7 in patients who receive parenteral nutrition. Investigators will recruit subjects
      from inpatient units at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics whose primary team
      consult the Nutrition Support Team to institute parenteral nutrition for clinical reasons.
      Subjects with clinical indications for parenteral nutrition are moderately to severely
      malnourished due to little to no nutrition by other means (oral nutrition or nutrition per
      tube) for a period of time (0-10 days based on state of nourishment prior to admission).

      Investigators will record baseline nutritional status from the medical record notes
      (dietitian, Nutrition Support Team, etc.), as well as medication, demographic information and
      medical history. Investigators will take a baseline exhaled CO2 measurement and then a daily
      measurement at approximately the same time daily (+/- an hour).

      The daily exhaled 12C/13C breath delta value will be matched with the subjects' daily caloric
      intake from parenteral nutrition (and oral nutrition and nutrition per tube, if applicable).
      The breath delta value, the caloric intake, plus the subjects' degree of malnourishment will
      be parameters with which to build further research. Investigators hypothesize that the breath
      delta value will increase from baseline and then stabilize after the patient reaches goal
      energy needs as defined by the Nutrition Support Team.
