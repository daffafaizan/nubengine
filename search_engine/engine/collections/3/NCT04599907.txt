    
      The Sahara Study is intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the N-SWEAT Patch
      for use in subjects with excessive axillary sweating, or primary focal axillary
      hyperhidrosis.

      Safety of the N-SWEAT Patch will be confirmed by assessing the occurrence of local skin
      reactions, treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).

      Demonstration of effectiveness will be assessed by a significant improvement (reduction) in
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) in subjects treated with the N-SWEAT Patch.
      Secondary and additional endpoints based on complementary clinical instruments, including
      Quality of Life Measures (QOL) and Gravimetric Sweat Production GSP), have been included to
      further demonstrate performance.
