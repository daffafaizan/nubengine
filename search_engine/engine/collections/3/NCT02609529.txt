      symptoms (i.e., number of spontaneous bowel movements. abdominal pain, stool consistency,
      reduction in stool number, flatulence, urgency, incontinence), in laboratory parameters,
      and/or in psychosocial measures in subjects with d-IBS receiving 3 weeks of SBI.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, weighted, pilot study evaluating
      effects of SBI (10 g per day), in children or adolescents with d-IBS.

      The primary outcome will be change in the number of spontaneous bowel movements from the
      screening week compared to the final week. This information is gathered as part of the daily
      diary questions.

      Secondary clinical outcome variables will include changes in abdominal pain, stool
      consistency, flatulence, urgency, and incontinence. Further clinical outcome variables will
      be change in number of spontaneous bowel movements during each treatment week compared to the
      screening week. Stool consistency will be assessed with the Bristol Stool Form Scale.
      Secondary laboratory outcome variables will include changes in stool calprotectin, stool
      lactoferrin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and platelet count from the
      screening week and final week. Secondary psychosocial outcomes will include data from
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory for Gastrointestinal Symptoms, and the Pediatric
      Functional Disability Index.
