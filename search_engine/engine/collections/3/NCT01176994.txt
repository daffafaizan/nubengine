      sulphate. copper chloride ,copper bromide, copper iodide, copper nitrate, copper sulphate.

      Keratolytics - salicylic acid , lactic acid, nitric acid, pyruvic acid,oxalic acid, trichloro
      acetic acid, phenol, resorcinol,urea .

      The solvents and penetration enhancers of the ingredients - Water, ethanol, dimethyl

      Patients with skin lesions that after clinical diagnosis are usually treated by
      dermatologists with destructive modalities without an histological evaluation will be
      included in the study. The clinical diagnoses include viral warts, seborrheic warts, skin
      tags, solar keratoses, fibromata and hemangiomata.

      The treated lesions will be located on the trunk and limbs. Lesions on the face will not be
      included in the study.

      The formulations will be infiltrated intra-dermally into the lesions in a maximal volume not
      exceeding 0.05 ml.

      After the achievement of the desired local fixation effect, the lesions will be examined by a
      pathologist.

      The patients will be closely followed-up during the procedure and the degree of possible
      associated pain will be evaluated. Possible local infection and the degree of scarring will
      be evaluated until complete healing of the treated area will occur.

      The histological result will be informed to the patients.
