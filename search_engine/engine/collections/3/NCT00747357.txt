      (Coroflex Blue) deployment followed by Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilatation (SeQuent
      Please) and of Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilatation (SeQuent Please) followed by
      cobalt-chromium stent (Coroflex Blue) deployment in a real world scenario including up to two
      de-novo or restenotic lesions ( no in-stent restenoses) in two different native coronary
      arteries (reference diameter: 2.5mm and 4.0mm, length of stenosis 10mm and 25mm) for
      procedural success and preservation of vessel patency up to 3 years
