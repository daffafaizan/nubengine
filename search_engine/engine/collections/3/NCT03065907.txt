      trial regarding the timing for vision rehabilitation in patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy
      for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Prior to initiating the clinical trial, the
      investigators must be assured that patients with loss in visual ability are willing to be
      randomized and amenable to deferring vision rehabilitation intervention. Although it is
      typical for patients receiving usual care to present for vision rehabilitation services years
      after the onset of anti-VEGF therapy, this manifestation may result from patients being
      unaware of the existence of vision rehabilitation services to enhance function and reduce
      depression. As part of the study recruitment, patients will be informed about vision
      rehabilitation care and, if suffering with difficulty performing everyday activities, they
      may be unwilling to defer vision rehabilitation. Additionally, the study design may not be
      feasible to answer the aim should patients in the delayed intervention arms suffer
      progressive loss in visual ability and seek vision rehabilitation services, resulting in a
      high drop-out rate.
