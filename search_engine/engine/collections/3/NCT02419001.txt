      subjects between the ages of 18 and 80 years, inclusive, with functioning ileostomies were
      planned to be enrolled. In the first treatment period (Period 1) all subjects received an IV
      infusion of 1 g ceftriaxone. Subjects had a 3 - 7 day washout period between Period 1 and
      Period 2. In the second treatment period (Period 2) all subjects received an IV infusion of 1
      g ceftriaxone and 2 oral doses of either 75 or 150 mg of SYN-004, according to the
      randomization schedule, which were administered 30 minutes before and 5.5 hours after the
      start of the ceftriaxone infusion.
