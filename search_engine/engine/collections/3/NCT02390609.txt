    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (study
      medication assigned to participants by chance), 3- or 4-way crossover (participants may
      receive different interventions sequentially during the trial), and single-center study of
      ibrutinib. The duration of study will be approximately 67 to 83 days per participant. The
      study consists of 3 parts: Screening (28 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label
      Treatment (consists of 6 treatments, either Ibrutinib capsule or suspension or sprinkle
      capsule granules under fed or fasted condition), in subsequent 3 periods for Group 1 and 4
      periods for Group 2, each separated with washout period of 7 (plus [+] / minus [-] 2) days;
      and follow up Phase (up to 10 + / - 2 days after last study drug administration). All the
      eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 (Group 1) or 4 (Group 2)
      treatment sequences. In fasted conditions, study drug will be administered following a
      10-hour overnight fast. In fed conditions, participants will also fast from food for 10
      hours, but will consume a high fat breakfast within a 30-minute period. Study drug will be
      administered 2 hours after the breakfast. Participants will not be allowed to have food until
      4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of
      pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative bioavailability of
      Ibrutinib will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
