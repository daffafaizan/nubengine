      bone and soft tissue in a single insitution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      pathological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of epithelioid hemangioma arising
      within bone and soft tissue, in the first cohort of cases where the definitive diagnosis is
      supplemented by molecular techniques.

      The hypothesis is that the improved knowledge regarding this rare entity can more
      definitively elucidate the benign biology of epithelioid hemangioma.
