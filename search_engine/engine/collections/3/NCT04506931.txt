      one of the three arms: 1) SMS or 2) IVR or 3) CATI. Participants in the first study arm will
      receive an SMS survey. Participants in the second study arm will receive a IVR survey.
      Participants in the third study arm will receive a CATI survey. The IVR, SMS and CATI
      questionnaires contain a set of demographic questions and one NCD module (alcohol, or
      tobacco, or diet, or physical activity, or blood pressure and diabetes). The investigators
      will examine contact, response, refusal and cooperation rates and demographic
      representativeness by each study arm.
