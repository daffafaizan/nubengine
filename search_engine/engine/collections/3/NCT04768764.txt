    
      All patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty will be evaluated before the operation.
      Eligible patients will be informed about the study and "Numeric Rating Scale" for pain
      evaluation. Then, patients will be asked for informed consent. After approval from the local
      research ethics committee, first patient will be recruited for study and patient's group will
      be determined by dice roll. Patients who are scheduled for primary total knee arthroplasty
      under spinal anesthesia with a planned sensory block level between T4 and T7 dermatomes, will
      be recruited and assigned to a group.Femoral block or middle adductor canal block will be
      applied to the patients.

      Group1 (Group 1 Middle Adductor Canal Block) patients will be administered middle adductor
      canal block with 20 ml 0.25% Bupivacaine by an experienced anesthesiologist.

      Group2 (Femoral Nerve Block) patients will be administered femoral block with 20 ml 0.25%
      Bupivacaine by an experienced anesthesiologist.

      The selected block will be applied with USG behind the curtain after the operation.Patients
      will be taken to the postoperative recovery unit.Patients will be followed-up in
      post-anesthesia care unit and in the ward for 48 hours. Post-operatively, patients will
      receive 1mg/kg Tramadol when Numeric Rating Scale(NRS) > 3.The duration of the sensory and
      motor block and the mobilization of the patients will be recorded and compared.

      0,2,4,6,8,12,24 of the patient pain scores at hour and 6 months, presence of sensory block
      and motor block, pain score when the patient is mobilized will be recorded.In addition,
      operation time, complications related to block, mobilization time, discharge day, and opioid
      need will be recorded.It will be recorded at what time the first opioid dose was administered
      after the block.
