      reason training of the trunk is necessary in the early period. Taking into account of
      literature, various approaches have been used to improve sitting balance and trunk control
      such as conventional physiotherapy for stroke patients . Bobath concept is another method
      used for stroke rehabilitation. Trunk control is an important issue in the Bobath approach
      since the acute period. It seems that the Bobath method, which includes both approaches to
      increase postural control and sitting, as well as applications to increase the sensation,
      seems to be an appropriate method to improve body control in stroke patients. When the
      studies about stroke rehabilitation are investigated, it is seen that most of the studies
      included only chronic patients and Bobath concept did not adequately take place in literature
      about trunk training in acute stroke. The aim of this study is to determinate effectiveness
      of the Bobath based trunk training on trunk control in acute stroke patients.
