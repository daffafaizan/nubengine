      consisting of three independent assessments: To assess the symptom burden and specific
      palliative care needs the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) is used. To measure the
      generic health-related quality of life the patient has to answer the EuroQoL Group
      5-Dimension 5-Level Self Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). To get an opinion of the general
      condition the patient is to complete the NCCN Distress Thermometer which includes a visual
      analogue scale (with values from 0 to 10).

      Meanwhile, a professional palliative caregiver completes a questionnaire about the main
      demographic aspects of the patients and assess the palliative care needs and the symptom
      burden using the IPOS.

      After one week both, patient and professional palliative caregiver, will receive the same
      questionnaires again to assess the change from baseline.
