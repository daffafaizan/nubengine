           will lower BP faster and to a greater degree overall when receiving vasodilating agents
           - such as ACEI's, ARB's, dihydropyridine CCB's, direct vasodilators, and central alpha
           agonists.

        -  Patients with an elevated cardiac index will lower BP faster and to a greater degree
           overall when receiving agents that reduce contractility, heart rate, or blood volume -
           such as beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine CCB's, and other agents that are known to
           reduce cardiac index.

        -  Patients with an elevated thoracic fluid content or lower orthostatic change in thoracic
           fluid content will lower BP faster and to a greater degree overall when receiving
           diuretics (thiazide, loop, potassium sparing), however - one of these agents will emerge
           as a superior alternative to reduce BP in patients with high thoracic fluid content /
           low orthostatic change in thoracic fluid content.
