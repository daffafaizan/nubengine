    
      A randomized, longitudinal clinical trial with a blinded and prospective evaluator will be
      carried out, in which the knee stability will be evaluated with the following tests:
      Y-balance test and Flamingo balance test. The measurements will be made before and after the
      intervention. The study will be carried out with patients evaluated by a specialist in
      Traumatology and will be randomly divided by a system of numerical tables through a computer
      program between the experimental and control groups. The control group will perform a typical
      warm-up of competitive football; and the experimental one will do this above, added to a
      specific activation of gluteus medius and core. Dynamic stability (Y-balance test) and
      postural and static stability (Flamingo balance test) will be measured before and after the
      intervention.
