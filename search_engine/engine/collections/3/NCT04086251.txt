      intended for use by healthcare professionals for the collection of physiological data in home
      and healthcare settings. Patient information is displayed on a computer located at the
      medical institution. Every 15 minutes, a measurement is plotted on the User Interface of
      heart rate / respiration rate (by a Biovotion device). A non-invasive blood pressure (by an
      Omron device) along with an oral digital thermometer reading are taken per clinician orders
      and displayed on the Gaido dashboard. Wearable data are transmitted wirelessly from the
      Biovotion sensor (heart rate and respiratory rate) to the patient's smart phone that relays
      data to a cloud-based server for storage and analysis. Oral temperature and blood pressure
      are entered by the patient or care-giver into the patient's smart phone that relays data to a
      cloud-based server for storage.

      The Remote Patient Monitoring system uses algorithms that indicate when patient vitals and
      patient reported outcomes have changed. Automatic patient surveys are sent to the patient
      with results displayed both on the computer located in the medical institution and the
      patient's smart phone. The patient surveys gather patient reported symptoms which are
      intended to be used in combination with vital signs to support decision-making. The system is
      intended for use with patients 18 years of age and older who are cared for by healthcare
      professionals.
