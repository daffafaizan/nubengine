      Exp1: motor learning (3 groups, crossover) - motor leaning with and without visual feedback
      and a control group.

      Exp2: sensory learning (4 groups, parallel) - sensory learning with and without feedback, an
      simple activation task and a control group.

      Exp3: observational task (2 groups, parallel) - an motor observational task and a control
      group.

      Exp4: mental imagery (2 groups, parallel) - a motor mental imagery and a control group.

      Exp5: tDCS over the motor cortex (2 groups, crossover) - active and sham tDCS. Note that this
      study has never been completed.
