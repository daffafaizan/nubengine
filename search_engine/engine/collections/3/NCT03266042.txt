      The CHEMOSAT kit containing Gen 2 filters has been used to treat patients since April 2012.
      This registry study is designed to collect safety, resource utilization and treatment
      outcomes in patients who receive this treatment with CHEMOSAT by healthcare professionals.
      The safety and efficacy data from patients treated with CHEMOSAT is important in updating the
      safety profile and for collection of treatment information. The resource utilization
      information is essential in planning treatment strategy for patients.

      This registry does not follow any pre-determined protocol with respect to diagnosis,
      treatment or follow-up of the patient. The data collected will be gathered exclusively from
      current medical practice at participating institutions.

      Delcath holds a list of authorized customer hospitals to whom it supplies the CHEMOSAT
      System. To date these hospitals have treated over 300 patients with cancers of the liver.

      The decision to treat with CHEMOSAT is clearly separated from the decision to collect data in
      the registry. No specific procedures or tests are required in this protocol.
