      recipients. However, very few studies target quality of life parameters for these children
      and their families across all solid organ transplantation. Furthermore, no literature
      directly addresses a comparison of perceptions and wellness, impact on family, and
      vulnerability in a comparative format by these distinct, but definitely related populations.

      The goal of this study is to compare parent and child perceptions of wellness and
      vulnerability in children who have undergone solid organ transplant. It is hypothesized that
      there will be significant differences between parent and child perceptions. Outcomes will be
      measured by using five different instruments:

        1. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)

        2. PedsQL Family Impact Module

        3. PedsQL Family Information Form

        4. Functional Status II-R

        5. Child Vulnerability Scale (CVS)

      Patients will be enrolled at the time of transplant listing, or after transplant. Patients
      and families will complete the survey once every 6 months while the patient is active on the
      respective transplant waiting list. After transplant, the patients and families will be asked
      to complete the survey once every 6 months for the first two years and annually thereafter.

      This study may provide us with an improved understanding of parent and child perceptions in
      wellness, impact on family, and vulnerability within each transplant group. The results may
      also indicate trend differences between these three populations. These differences may help
      to provide insight into family perspectives allowing for greater anticipatory guidance and
      targeted interventions.
