      1. To test the hypothesis that vascular endothelial function in the brachial artery, and
      other associated cardiovascular risk markers are impaired in short sleepers and long sleepers
      as compared to the control group of average duration sleepers.

      To test the hypothesis that the optional intervention to maintain an 8-hour per night sleep
      schedule will alleviate vascular endothelial function impairment.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will measure sleep, physical activity, and blood pressure with at-home devices
      before coming in for one in-lab visit, where they will have vascular function and blood
      markers measured, as well as an optional CT scan to measure calcium in the coronary arteries.
      An optional intervention may occur after this: Participants will continue the at-home
      measures while maintaining a chosen regular 8-hour per night sleep schedule, before coming in
      for a second in-lab visit with all same measures except for CT scan.
