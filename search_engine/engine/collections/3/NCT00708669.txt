      there has been no conclusion yet stating which one of the stents, either Cypher stent or
      TAXUS stent, is superior to the other. In specific disease condition such as in diabetic
      patients, it has been reported that Paclitaxel (TAXUS stent) is more suitable than Sirolimus
      (Cypher stent), due to the difference in the action mechanisms of the drugs. Since TAXUS
      stent was recently approved in Japan, we decided to conduct a randomized multi-center
      comparative study to compare Cypher stent and TAXUS stent regarding the clinical endpoint
      (target vessel failure for 8 months). The study is powered to show equivalence between the 2
      stents in all patients, and to show superiority of the TAXUS stent in the diabetic patient
      population. In addition, for selected patients, quantitative coronary angiography,
      intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy are performed to
      examine the difference of the two stents more closely.
