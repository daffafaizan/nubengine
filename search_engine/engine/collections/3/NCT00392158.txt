      closed-loop anesthesia system can be built using BIS as the control variable, a
      proportional-integral-differential control algorithm, and a propofol target-controlled
      infusion system as the control actuator. Recent studies have shown that such system is able
      to provide clinically adequate anesthesia. We hypothesized that BIS can also indicate the
      adequacy of analgesia and therefore built a combined closed-loop anesthesia system using BIS
      as the control variable, two proportional-integral-differential control algorithms, a
      propofol and a remifentanil target-controlled infusion systems as the control actuators. In
      preparation for a large multi-center control trial, we propose a prospective randomized study
      to evaluate the effectiveness of such a closed-loop anesthesia system. Two groups of patients
      are compared: one in which propofol and remifentanil are administered by the anesthesiologist
      using target-controlled infusion systems, and one in which propofol and remifentanil are
      administered automatically by the combined closed-loop anesthesia system. In both groups, the
      goal is to maintain BIS between 40 and 60, the recommended range during anesthesia by the
      manufacturer. We expect the combined closed-loop anesthesia system group to do similar or
      better.
