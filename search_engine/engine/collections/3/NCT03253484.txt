    
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, assessor - blinded, intra-individual trial
      comparing laser exposed skin lesions to untreated control skin lesions in a split scar set-up
      to investigate efficacy. The study will be performed on patients undergoing an excision at
      Bispebjerg Dermatological Department. One randomly allocated part of each included wound will
      receive three NAFL-treatments and the other part will serve as untreated control wound. Scars
      will be evaluated clinically on-site by blinded evaluator immediately before third treatment
      and 3 months after NAFL-treatments. The clinical data will be supplemented by blinded
      photo-evaluation, patients' evaluation and non-invasive measurements.
