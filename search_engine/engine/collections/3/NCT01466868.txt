    
      Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent subtype of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL) around the world, in all age groups.

      DLBCL is a curable disease and combination of monoclonal antibody against CD20 (rituximab)
      with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen have improved
      the prognosis of patients with a 20% increase of the cure rate. For the remaining patients
      who are not in complete response and/or who relapse after first line therapy, the possibility
      of cure is dramatically reduced.

      As PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates the expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc and Stat3 proteins,
      which are involved in the pathogenesis of DLBCL HL), this signalling axis is an emerging
      therapeutic target for treatment of DLBCL.

      One study has shown that the level of p-Akt is an adverse prognostic feature in DLBCL and is
      found in 52% of tumors samples from DLBCL patients.

      Given the fact that AKT is overactivated in about to 52% of DLBCL and is considered as a poor
      prognosis factor, we postulate that targeting AKT in DLBCL may be an interesting therapeutic
      strategy.

      MK-2206 is an orally selective allosteric inhibitor of AKT developed by MERCK currently
      highlighted as a promising therapeutic option for cancer patients and under clinical
      development in several Phase 1 trials.

      Therefore, we propose to conduct a Phase II study using a two-stage Simon's design with
      objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint.
