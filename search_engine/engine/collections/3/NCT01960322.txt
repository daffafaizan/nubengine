      acute rejection in children who have had a liver transplant, and thus is associated with
      graft loss, increased expenditures on care, and ultimately death. Researchers in this
      application developed a biomarker to identify nonadherence, calculating the standard
      deviation (SD) of consecutive immunosuppressant blood levels for each patient to capture the
      degree of variability between individual levels (higher SD = less consistent levels). By
      applying a threshold, this marker identifies nonadherent patients. A consortium of transplant
      centers is currently testing this marker through the MALT (Medication Adherence in children
      who had a Liver Transplant) study. MALT investigators now propose to take advantage of this
      existing collaboration to pilot-test an intervention to improve adherence in patients who are
      identified by this marker.
