      for sedation of patients in the intensive care setting. ICU patients with acute kidney injury
      requiring renal replacement therapies frequently have changes in volume status causing
      alterations in drug pharmacokinetics. Although dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics have been
      studied earlier on ICU patients, there is no information on its pharmacokinetics in
      critically ill patients needing continuous renal replacement therapy.
