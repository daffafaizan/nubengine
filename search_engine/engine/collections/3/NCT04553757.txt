      I. To evaluate the rate of change of seizure frequency and the status of the tumor at each
      data collection point.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain sufficient number of patients' data in order to power the analysis to determine
      whether a change in seizure frequency correlates with tumor control.

      II. Evaluate progression free survival and overall survival when compared with seizure
      control.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a seizure assessment survey over 5 minutes at each clinic visit.
