      System (VSI) for pre-operative diagnoses when it is used to provide illumination and
      visualization of articular cavities. The study will analyze the VisionScope system's accuracy
      compared to MRI in diagnosing and confirming meniscus tears, chondral defects, loose bodies,
      minor arthritis, and/or any articular or capsular trauma.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the VisionScope System will be able to obtain direct
      visualization and diagnostic images of the intercapsular space without fluid distention in
      the knee. This study will provide feedback on the ability of the VisionScope system to
      potentially eliminate the need for MRI scans. Additionally, a cost-analysis comparison
      between the use of VSI vs. MRI for the diagnosis of orthopaedic knee injuries will be
      conducted. Finally, the study will help develop an algorithm of potential use for the VSI
      system in the management of knee pathologies.
