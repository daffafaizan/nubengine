      the most important reason for disability among elderly adults. Sex hormones are well reported
      to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Several studies showed that estrogens have
      been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system via favorable effects on
      anti-inflammatory effects. Genetic polymorphisms of estrogen related genes are speculated to
      influence estrogen level and will count for human susceptible to risk of stroke in young
      adults. In addition, several studies showed that the decrease in estrogen-induced vascular
      inflammatory markers including adhesion molecules and chemokines might be the mechanism for
      vascular protection. Recently, a novel and unique mechanisms for 17β-Estradiol (E2)
      anti-inflammatory activity which is E2 prevents inflammatory gene transcription induced by
      inflammatory agents by inhibiting NF-κB intracellular transport was found. Therefore, we
      proposed a study to explore the association between the genetic polymorphisms of
      estrogen-related genes, including estrogen synthesis, metabolizing, receptor genes, and NF-κB
      and ischemic stroke in young adults.
