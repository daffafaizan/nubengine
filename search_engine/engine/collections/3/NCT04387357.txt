    
      This is an experimental cross-sectional study which primarily aims at identifying
      characteristic features of spatial disorientation among people with mild cognitive impairment
      and dementia. The features of interest are motion and physiological related changes that
      occur during instances of spatial disorientation, which will be derived from wearable
      sensors.

      Additionally, brain structure and functional connectivity changes associated with different
      levels of spatial orientation and gait parameters will also be investigated through
      resting-state functional imaging.
