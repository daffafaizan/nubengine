      of patients with metastatic brain tumors are in advanced stages of the disease. If not
      treated in time, the natural course of the disease is extremely short. At present, the main
      treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer is radiotherapy, combined with chemotherapy
      and targeted therapy drugs. On the basis of previous clinical studies, the aim of this study
      was to explore the efficacy and safety of combined brachytherapy with Pyrrotidine and
      Capecitabine in patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer, in order to
      provide a new, safer and more effective treatment for patients with brain metastases from
      breast cancer.
