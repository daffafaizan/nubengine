      for Health Care Professionals in Training: Clinical Applications. During the intervention,
      participants will engage in didactic education, experiential mindfulness practices, including
      gentle yoga, and group dialogue. The aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility of
      this intervention in producing measurable differences between the participants and matched
      controls on their perception of their well-being and clinical work.
