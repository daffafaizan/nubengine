      potential utility for passive, non-invasive wearable alcohol monitors is great and could play
      a major role in public safety as well as in both research, clinical, and treatment settings.
      Clinitech, LLC has developed LabPatch, an electronic bandage that continuously and
      imperceptibly samples interstitial fluid from the skin surface and measures relevant
      biomarkers in the fluid. The patch uses novel nanowire technology to sample the interstitial
      fluid from just underneath the skin and then uses an electrochemical reaction to measure
      either glucose or alcohol concentration. The participants' interstitial alcohol concentration
      (IAC) will be measured via LabPatch-alcohol at the same time points as blood samples so that
      a direct comparison can be made. Thus, the LabPatch-alcohol will be tested as the
      participant's BAC rises and falls through the legally intoxicated concentration (0.08%), and
      the goal is to match measures obtained via the prototype LabPatch-alcohol with whole blood
      alcohol concentrations. The LabPatch operational circuit lies on the underside of the
      bandage. The circuit surface is placed in contact with the skin by the application of the
      elastic adhesive bandage with a contact tension that provides modest pressure, as in the case
      of a conventional wound bandage. The temperature of the skin is measured electrically and the
      consistency of temperature is used to verify good contact and to monitor continued contact.
      The entire process takes 3-5 seconds to collect the sample, a pause for 1 sec and then 3
      additional seconds to conduct the analysis.
