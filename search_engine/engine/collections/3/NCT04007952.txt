      herniate through the diaphragm into the chest. This abnormal anatomy can lead to acid reflux,
      trouble swallowing, and shortness of breath, and can also be a risk factor for surgical
      emergencies involving the stomach. For these reasons, the Society of American
      Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons has strongly recommended that all symptomatic
      paraesophageal hernias be repaired.

      These repairs are technically challenging, and the best available evidence suggests that more
      than half of patients undergoing repair will have radiographic hernia recurrence at 5 years
      after surgery. There has been suggestion that use of anterior gastropexy - in which suture is
      used to affix the stomach to the anterior abdomen - may reduce recurrence rates. However, it
      is uncertain whether this data is reliable. While some surgeons use anterior gastropexy
      routinely because they believe it reduces recurrence, other surgeons do not use anterior
      gastropexy due to the concern that patients will have short-term pain at the suture site.
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of using anterior gastropexy on recurrence rates after
      paraesophageal hernia repair, compared to not using anterior gastropexy.
