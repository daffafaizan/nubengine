      headaches. This study will start with a 4-week baseline period in which no treatment is
      given, followed by a 12-week period in which each patient's dose is adjusted and then kept
      stable for the last 4 weeks of the 16-week double-blind phase. The individualized dose will
      start at 25 milligrams of topiramate per day and will be increased 25 milligrams per day once
      weekly and then raised to either the target--100 milligrams per day--or the maximum dose that
      is well tolerated up to 200 milligrams per day. Patients who are randomized to receive
      topiramate will remain on the optimized dose. The comparison phase of the study is a 16-week
      period in which the change in migraine days of patients on topiramate (taking at least 50
      milligrams per day) is compared with the change in migraine days for patients on the placebo.
      Also studied will be the patients' health-related quality of life as assessed by
      questionnaires filled out at specific visits as well as the patients' views of the safety and
      tolerability of topiramate. The study hypothesis is that the number of migraine days,
      periods, and attacks from the baseline period to the last 4 weeks in the double-blind period
      is reduced more in the topiramate group than the placebo group. During the 16-week comparison
      period, patients will take by mouth a dose of 50 milligrams to 200 milligrams of topiramate
      daily.
