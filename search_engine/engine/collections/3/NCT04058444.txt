      new concept because patient have an active role in the whole process. Pregnant patient
      receives the first information about ERAS from obstetrician and anesthesiologist before the
      scheduled cesarean delivery. Patient condition optimization is necessary. Antibiotic
      prophylaxis, no bowel preparation and arriving to the hospital on the day of surgery are
      basic principles. All patients are done under spinal anesthesia. DVT (Deep Venous Thrombosis)
      prophylaxis starts postoperatively. Early mobilization, early oral intake and urinary
      catheter removal on the day of surgery with multimodal analgesia is mandatory.
