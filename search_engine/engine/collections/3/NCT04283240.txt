    
      Patients with PE randomized to a single oral dose of sildenafil 50mg (n=10) or placebo (n=10)
      as add-on to conventional therapy. Right ventricular function evaluated immediately before
      and shortly after (0.5-1.5h) randomization by right heart catheterization (RHC),
      trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The primary
      efficacy endpoint was cardiac index measured by CMR.
