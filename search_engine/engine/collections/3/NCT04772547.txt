      load of vigabatrin within targeted 48 hours of post-anoxic status epilepticus onset in
      unconscious survivors of cardiac arrest undergoing targeted temperature management. The load
      of VGB is in addition to the load of a commonly used intravenous second-line therapy given at
      the discretion of the treating neurologist. Serial blood tests will be obtained, including
      vigabatrin levels, taurine levels, neuron specific enolase, light chain neurofilament, and
      glial fibrillary acidic protein. In survivors that regain consciousness and survive to follow
      up, 6 months visual field perimetry will be obtained.
