    
      Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a treatment modality that is gaining popularity in the
      field of physical therapy for its proposed mediation of pain. LLLT is typically used in
      conjunction with other more conventional physical therapy treatment sessions; therefore, it
      is not clear if the benefits are from the LLLT or the conventional treatment, or the
      combination of them both. The research question: Does low-level laser therapy treatment with
      a class 3B Laser decrease pain and improve function in persons with persistent or acute
      joint/muscle discomfort as compared to before treatment?

      Study participants presenting with pain will be interviewed regarding the location and
      intensity of their primary pain complaints. Participants will also be asked to identify
      functional limitations associated with their pain. Participants will undergo an initial
      screening process to identify the presence of any exclusion factors and precautions
      associated with the delivery of LLLT. Investigators will collect pre-test and post-test
      information from participants regarding pain intensity and perceived functional limitations.
      Investigators will also collect relevant joint range of motion and muscle strength data
      during the first and last sessions. Treatment location for the study will vary within the
      participant group and will be determined during the initial screening process. The
      intervention will include LLLT treatment using a combination of LED and laser light delivered
      by the Richmar TheraTouch LX2 device.
