      and duration of treatment response at 12 weeks of home versus office-based narrowband
      ultraviolet B phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Physician Global Assessment (PGA)
      and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) will be used to assess effectiveness, safety
      (tolerability), and duration of treatment response. This is a three year pragmatic,
      randomized, active comparator effectiveness study.
