    
      This is a single center, randomized & controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the Propel
      mini stent or Propel contour stent vs. Nasopore impregnated with Triamcinolone Acetonide at
      reducing frontal sinus opening stenosis and polypoid edema after endoscopic sinus surgery in
      patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis. Eligible subjects who undergo standard
      of care bilateral frontal sinusotomy will have each frontal sinus randomly assigned to either
      a Propel mini or contour steroid eluding stent or a Nasopore nasal dressing impregnated with
      2.5 ml of Triamcinolone Acetonide 40 mg/ml. Specific Propel stent will be chosen based on the
      shape of frontal sinus opening and best fit as decided by the operating Surgeon. Patients
      will be reassessed on approximately post-operative day 7, 14, 30, 90 days, 6 months, and 12
      months at their standard of care follow-up visits. On the day 14 visit, the frontal sinus
      Propel stent and Nasopore will be completely removed per Standard of care. Video will be
      taken of the frontal sinus opening, and assessed for scarring/adhesions, presence of polypoid
      edema, frontal sinus patency, need for oral steroids or other interventions. Additionally,
      endoscopic scoring of frontal sinus by the above measures will be evaluated by 2 independent
      sinus surgeon reviewers. The reviewers will also be asked to rank the two frontal sinus
      openings as better, same or worse, compared to the opposite side
