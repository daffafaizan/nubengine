    
      Qualifying subjects entered a 3-step dose escalation algorithm:

        -  Step 1: 1500 Units twice per week (starting dosing regimen for all subjects in the
           study)

        -  Step 2: 2000 Units twice per week

        -  Step 3: 2500 Units twice per week

      Each step consisted of 12 weeks of safety monitoring, followed by calculation of average
      monthly angioedema attack rate based on subject reports of angioedema symptoms (regardless of
      intensity) and actual duration of therapy for that step.

      If a subject was deemed a "success" at a given step and the investigator and medical monitor
      determined that it was safe for the subject to continue on that dose, the subject entered a 3
      month follow-up period at that dose level with continued safety monitoring. The subject could
      not re-enter the study for purposes of dose escalation during the follow-up period.

      If a subject was not deemed a "success," the subject initiated the next highest step of the
      dose escalation algorithm provided that the investigator and medical monitor agreed that dose
      escalation was appropriate. If at the end of Step 3 (2500 Units), a subject was not deemed a
      "success," then the Week 12 visit represented study completion and the subject was referred
      to the physician who manages their HAE care.
