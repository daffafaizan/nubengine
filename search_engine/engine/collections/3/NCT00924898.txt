      replication to <200 copies RNA/ml plasma in blood and other body compartments in patients
      with acute HIV infection, reducing infectivity. The treatment regimen will be well tolerated
      during treatment follow-up. A coordinated program of counseling and support will facilitate
      adherence and promote successful therapy. Prevalence of transmitted drug resistant HIV-1 will
      be assessed.

      Study Design: Dual-center, prospective, single-arm pilot study of FTC/TDF/EFV in patients
      with acute HIV infection. Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection
      Study Consortium. Patients will be followed intensively for 96 weeks.
