      etoposide followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue in women with metastatic
      breast cancer. II. Evaluate the response rates, progression free survival, engraftment, and
      nonrelapse related mortality in women treated with this regimen. III. Evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic profile of high dose topotecan with respect to the efficacy and toxicity of
      ifosfamide and etoposide in these women.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested from the patient and stored.
      Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2 hours and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to
      -6, and etoposide IV daily over 24 hours on days -5 to -3. Autologous PBSC are reinfused on
      day 0. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
