    
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study designed to
      investigate the outcome of MACI implant versus arthroscopic microfracture in the treatment of
      articular cartilage defects in the knee in patients between ages of 18 and 55 years.

      All patients who meet the eligibility criteria and are considered suitable for inclusion will
      have a cartilage biopsy taken prior to randomization to study treatment. Eligible patients
      will then be randomized during the index arthroscopy procedure to receive either MACI implant
      or microfracture treatment.

      Patients randomized to treatment with MACI implant will return within approximately 4 to 8
      weeks of the index arthroscopy to undergo the chondrocyte implantation procedure via
      arthrotomy. Patients randomized to microfracture will undergo the procedure during the index
      arthroscopy.

      Patients will be assessed post-arthroscopy and post-arthrotomy at intervals during 2 years
      follow-up. Evaluations include adverse events, functional and pain outcomes, arthroscopic and
      histologic evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
