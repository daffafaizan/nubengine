        -  Determine the objective response rate (partial and complete response) in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with 3-AP and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the progression-free interval and survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Stage I: Patients receive 3-AP IV over 4 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on
           days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Stage II: Patients receive a higher dose of 3-AP IV continuously over 24 hours on days
           1, 8, and 15. Within 1 hour of completing 3-AP administration, patients receive
           gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
           up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3 months for 18
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-95 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
