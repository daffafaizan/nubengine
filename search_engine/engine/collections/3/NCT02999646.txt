    
      Patients with advanced HNSCC after platinum-based palliative chemotherapy have a poor
      prognosis, with no well-defined standard treatment and a survival between 6 to 9 months.

      MVX-ONCO-1 is a patient specific, cell-based, active immunotherapy, where the patient's
      immune response to tumor cells is stimulated and/or increased by triggering an immune
      response against the patients' cancer cells.

      Rationale for this trial is:

        1. HNSCC: there is a clear medical need in this patient population,

        2. Relapsing HNSCC often have accessible tumor tissue,

        3. HNSCC is considered an immunogenic tumor.

      This phase II study is a first step towards a potentially innovative immunotherapy for HNSCC.

      MVX-ONCO-1 is composed of:

        1. An immune-modulator (GM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) released
           from an immuno-protected, encapsulated, allogeneic, genetically modified cell line
           (MVX-1), and

        2. Irradiated, autologous tumor cells as source of antigen.

      Each treatment consists of two macrocapsules containing the MVX-1 cell line implanted
      subcutaneously and lethally irradiated autologous tumor cells injected subcutaneously.
      Eligible patients will receive a treatment once weekly starting on week 1 for 4 weeks
      followed by two additional treatments 2 weeks apart (total 6 treatments over 8 weeks). Each
      pair of macrocapsules is removed after 1 week, and the last implanted capsules are removed in
      week 9. The patients are then followed-up for 5 years.
