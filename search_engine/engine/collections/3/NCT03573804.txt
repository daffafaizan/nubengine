      a different position after completing a standard MRI are of sufficient quality to allow a
      radiologist to identify the edges of the tumor.

      These additional MRI images will only take about 10-15 minutes to obtain and will not require
      a second injection of contrast material.The information gathered in this study will make it
      more feasible to use a new device called the "breast cancer locator" to help surgeons more
      accurately remove breast cancers.
