        1. There is a relationship between genetically distinct metabolic profiles of tamoxifen and
           the frequency and severity of hot flashes in women on chronic tamoxifen therapy.

        2. Genetically distinct metabolic profiles for tamoxifen effect lipid profile, bone
           turnover metabolites and bone mineral density, and coagulation factors.

        3. Different genetic profiles of estrogen responsive genes influence the pharmacodynamic
           effects of tamoxifen in cardiovascular system.
