the human tumor-egg host system iii. tumor-inhibitory properties oftenuazonic acid .the fermented broth of a culture of alternaria tenuis auct. inhibitedthe growth of the human adenocarcinoma (h.ad. 1) in the embryonated eggwith the aid of studies in the egg-tumor system the active agent wasisolated and identified as tenuazonic acid . tenuazonic acid wasproduced by a number of alternaria isolates and by an aspergillustamariiand a phoma sp . compared with tenuazonic acid, on a molar basis, about20 times as much hadacidin or 6-mercaptopurine, 2 times as muchazaserine, but only 1/20 as much triethylenemelamine (tem) were requiredto achieve the same inhibition of h.ad. 1 tumor growth in the egg .tenuazonic acid was more effective against h.ad. 1 than against anothertransplantable human tumor, a-42 . tenuazonic acid, compared withpuromycin, more specifically inhibited tumor growth in the egg-tumorsystem .
