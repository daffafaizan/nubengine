      usually performed to achieve the optimal pressure to maintain upper airway patency, abolish
      obstructive respiratory events and reduce the occurrence of adverse events. This pressure is
      called titration pressure.

      Until now, we used to perform, after an adaptation period, a single-night outpatient test
      with an automated device preset on auto-adjusting pressure modality (APAP).

      The incremental fixed pressure modality (EZ START) was initially developed to ease patients
      into having a positive sleep therapy experience from the very beginning. This mode gradually
      increases air pressure night-by-night until the preset therapeutic pressure is reached. In
      each good therapy session, the device performs in fixed pressure overnight and we get a real
      residual apnea-hypopnea index (rAHI).

      For this study, we will use the same device (DreamStation auto CPAP, Philips Respironics,
      Murrysville, PA, USA), a web-based system to telemonitor patient therapy (EncoreAnywhere) and
      perform for each individual patient the two modalities in a telemonitoring crossover
      randomized single-blind (patient) way.
