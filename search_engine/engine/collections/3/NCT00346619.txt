      peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and assessed for signal point (sj) TREC content relative
      to genomic CCR5 copies by real time PCR in a spectoflourometic thermal cycler. TREC values
      will be expressed as TREC copy number per copies of CCR5 or TREC/PBLs.

      We anticipate that we will confirm our previous observations that nelfinavir therapy will
      increase TRECs, indicating naive T cell production from the thymus. The proposed study will
      determine the time course of the anticipated increase in TREC/PBLs.
