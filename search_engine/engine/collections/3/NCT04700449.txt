    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CBP-307 in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative
      colitis (UC). CBP-307 capsules are administered orally. This study includes stage 1 and stage
      2. After screening, subjects will enter the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      induction therapy for 12 weeks, i.e., the study stage 1. All subjects who complete 12 weeks
      of induction therapy (with CBP-307 or placebo) in the study stage 1 and complete all
      examinations (including colonoscopy) at the week 12 visit can choose to enter the study stage
      2 of a total of 40 weeks, including 36 weeks of continuous administration and 4 weeks of
      safety follow-up after the last dose.
