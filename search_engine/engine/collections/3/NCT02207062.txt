    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Perform a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of single-agent ibrutinib, based on
      overall response rate, in subjects with relapsed or refractory transformed indolent B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R TIL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of chronic ibrutinib therapy in this patient population.

      II. To determine the disease control rate of this regimen.

      III. Evaluate the complete response rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival to
      single-agent ibrutinib in this patient population.

      IV. Determine response rate relative to the underlying B-cell histology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.
