      Primary

        -  To determine and establish the safety profile of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A
           and define the dose-limiting toxicity in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters following administration of Aurora
           B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in these patients.

        -  To evaluate tumor response after at least 1 cycle of treatment with Aurora B/C kinase
           inhibitor GSK1070916A in these patients.

        -  To propose a safe dose for Phase II evaluation.

      Tertiary

        -  To investigate the effects of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A on markers of
           mitosis/cell proliferation and apoptosis in humans.

        -  To investigate the metabolism of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in humans.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A IV over 1 hour once daily on days
      1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients receive escalating doses of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A until the
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD has been defined, 15-18 additional
      patients are recruited for an expanded MTD cohort in which patients receive Aurora B/C kinase
      inhibitor GSK1070916A at the MTD. Patients at the expanded MTD cohort must consent to have
      either tumor biopsies taken or FDG-PET/CT and DW-MRI scans performed.

      Patients may undergo tissue, blood, and urine sample collection periodically for
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other correlative laboratory studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 28 days.
