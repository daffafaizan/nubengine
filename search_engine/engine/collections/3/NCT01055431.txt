      malnutrition in Europe (Stoltzfus, 2003 & Hercberg et al., 2001). Pregnant mothers are
      particularly susceptible to the onset of iron deficiency anemia (Daily & Wylie, 2008). It has
      been estimated that 1 in 2 pregnant women will be diagnosed with iron deficiency (Scholl,
      2005). During pregnancy maternal plasma volume expands, increasing iron requirements (Scholl
      et al., 2000) whilst dietary intakes generally remain unchanged (Milman, 2006).
      Physiologically, intestinal iron absorption may increase during pregnancy but only after iron
      depletion has already commenced (Milman, 2006). Research strongly suggests that pregnant
      women are not meeting dietary guidelines for iron (Derbyshire et al., 2009).

      A Sheffield (UK) study has reported that pregnant women consume around 10.2mg of iron per day
      (Mouratidou et al., 2006). Another investigation undertaken in a London population found that
      expectant mothers had a mean intake of 10.7mg iron per day (Rees et al., 2005). A further
      study investigating the diet of educated, Caucasian pregnant mothers reported similar figures
      (Derbyshire et al., 2006). Diets deficient in iron during gestation may subsequently affect
      infant health, in both the short and longer term (Scholl & Reilly, 2000). Iron deficiencies
      in pregnancy have been linked to preterm deliveries, reduced infant birth weight, length and
      iron stores (Daily & Wylie, 2008). Low iron stores during periods of infant brain growth may
      permanently impede cognitive development (Lozoff, 2007 & Lozoff & Georgieff, 2006).

      Teff (Eragrostis tef) is a staple food consumed in northern, western and central Ethiopia;
      usually in the form of Enjera (flat bread prepared using a range of cereals, including
      Eragrostis tef) (Umeta et al., 2005). Research has shown that Teff is a rich source of
      bioavailable iron which may be attributed to its low phytate content. Bread made with Tef
      enjera contains around 30mg of iron per 100g and up to 35mg when the food is fermented (Umeta
      et al., 2005). The iron content dramatically exceeds that of common Western foods (Corn
      flakes 7.9mg, boiled brown rice, 0.5mg and brown bread, 2.2mg, all per 100g consumed) (FSA,
      2006). Furthermore, studies have shown that the prevalence of pregnancy iron deficiency
      anemia is relatively low in Ethiopia (Gies et al., 2003) which may be attributed to
      Eragrostis tef forming a staple part of the diet (Haidar et al., 1999).

      Incorporation of Teff into the daily diet of expectant mothers may help to reduce the
      incidence of iron-deficiency anemia. Research shows that women do not adhere to taking large
      tablet supplements (Nguyen et al., 2008). Teff may therefore provide an alternative source of
      dietary iron that can be easily incorporated into the daily diet of both pregnant mothers and
      the lay public.
