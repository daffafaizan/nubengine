      department patients. The basis of triage and treatment is often directly influenced by
      temperature measurement. The finding of hyper/hypothermia may differentiate between a simple
      urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis, or in more extreme cases may discern "weakness"
      in the elderly from sepsis. This brief encounter of temperature measurement may be paramount
      to the medical treatment of the emergency department patient.We will explore the different
      modes of temperature measurements in emergency department patients. We will check which
      temperature measurement is beneficial.
