      surgery for sellar lesions were prospectively included. The study protocol was approved by
      the local Ethical Committee (Re.-No. 103_12 BC). Informed written consent was given by the
      participants or the next-of-kin in each case. Exclusion criteria comprised of those below 18
      years of age, pregnancy and a drug intolerance.

      Patients Baseline information included age, gender, BMI and the clinical presentation. The
      pre-operative work-up included an opthalmological examination, a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) with 2mm axial, coronal and sagittal sections revealing the tumor localization,
      extension, and its invasive behavior. Microsurgery was always performed by the same surgeon.
      The macroscopic delineation and invasiveness, the surgical manipulation of the pituitary
      stalk and extend of tumor resection, surgical complications, as well as an intraoperative
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak were documented. The tumor and the dura of the floor of the
      sella were examined histo-pathologically including the proliferation rate, regressive
      changes, atypical findings, and the existence of Crooke cells and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
      expression. Routine laboratory work-up included creatinine, urea, and alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT).

      The pre- and postoperative endocrine testing of the pituitary function comprised the basal
      values of cortisol (CORT), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1, thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), total triiodothyronine (tT3), luteinizing
      hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (TES), estradiol (E2), and
      prolactin (PRL). Insufficiency of the corticotropic axis was determined by a short synacthen
      test (adreno-corticotropic hormone; ACTH)-test stimulating with 0.25 mg Syntropin (Synacthen,
      Novartis Pharma, Nuremberg, Germany) intra-venously and serum cortisol measurement at 0 and
      30 minutes.

      Surveillance Post-operatively, participants were transferred to the general floor. For a
      minimum of 10 days, fluid intake, body weight, and urine volume with specific gravidity are
      documented daily, along with blood pressure and heart rate three-times daily, blood samples
      for the assessment of electrolytes are taken on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. An endocrine
      dynamic testing was performed on day 7.

      Analytical methods Venous blood samples were drawn in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00 am
      into pre-cooled tubes. Clotted samples were promptly centrifuged at 3,000 X g for 15 min at 4
      degree Celsius, and then the plasma was frozen at -80 degree Celsius until analysis.

      An automated system (Immulite®2000, Diagnostic Products Corporation) was used for the
      following serum hormone measurements: Serum cortisol levels > 10.5 µg/dL, with an assay
      sensitivity of 0.20 µg/dL, was considered normal; a cortisol response peak to the ACTH-test
      higher than 18 µg/dl was considered adequate; for IGF-1 of 135-485 ng/mL (18-30 years),
      120-397 ng/mL (31-40 years), 113-306 ng/mL (41-50 years), 100-250 ng/mL (51-60 years), and
      92-229 ng/mL (>60 years) (assay sensitivity of 20 ng/mL); LH > 0.25 U/L (follicular phase)
      and > 20 U/L (menopausal) in women, and > 1 international units (IU)/L in men (assay
      sensitivity of 0.05 mIU/mL); FSH > 0.25 U/L (follicular phase) and > 30 U/L (menopausal) in
      women, and > 1 IU/L in men (assay sensitivity of 0.1 mIU/mL); TES > 90 ng/dL in men (assay
      sensitivity of 15 ng/dL); E2 > 60 pg/mL (follicular phase) and > 10 pg/mL (menopausal) in
      women (assay sensitivity of 15 pg/mL); PRL < 500 micro international units (µIU)/L (assay
      sensitivity of 0.16 µU/L); PRL serum concentrations were considered normal < 360 ng/ml in men
      and < 530 ng/mL in women. TSH serum concentrations were considered normal > 0.45 µU/mL, fT4 >
      0.77 ng/dL, and tT3 > 0.8 ng/mL.

      Study design Treatment of hyponatremia was initiated as soon as a SIADH was confirmed by eu-
      or hypervolemia (daily measurement of body weight and fluid balance), an inappropriately
      concentrated urine (measurement of specific gravity), and exclusion of a cortico- and
      thyreotropic insufficiency. The established treatment regime consisted of a restriction of
      fluid intake < 1 L whenever the serum sodium dropped below 135 mmol/L or the body weight
      gained more than 1 kg (fluid restriction). In a second cohort of patients, the fluid
      restriction was replaced by a low dosage of tolvaptan (tolvaptan 3.75 mg), and in a third
      cohort by a medium dosage (tolvaptan 7.5 mg). Since a rapid correction of hyponatremia is
      hazardous and leaves the patient vulnerable to the risk of osmotic demyelination, we not only
      started the cohort study with a very low concentration of 3.75 mg tolvaptan, but also
      established a tight follow-up regime after medication. The serum sodium concentration was
      controlled at 6:00 pm. Those participants, whose serum sodium concentration further dropped
      below 132 mmol/L, were treated with a second tablet of tolvaptan and the serum sodium was
      measured the next day at 8:00 am. Those participants, whose serum sodium was increased by not
      more than 5 mmol/L underwent the next blood check on the next day at 8:00 am. Those
      participants, whose serum sodium increased by more than 5 mmol/L were treated by 1L tea/water
      or a 500 mL 5% glucose infusion.

      Statistical analysis SPSS statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used
      for all statistical analyses. Analyses were performed using the Chi-squared test and
      Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05.
