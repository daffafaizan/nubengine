      sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) develop a high-frequency of central apneas and/or disruptive
      Cheyne-Stokes respiratory syndrome after application of continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP), a pattern called the complex sleep apnea syndrome (CompSAS). The trial seeks to
      determine the efficacy of the ASV vs. CPAP modes for the treatment of CompSAS over time.
      Baseline clinical and laboratory data will be collected, patients will be randomized to one
      of the two treatments. Overall study participation is approximately 3 months.
