      dysphagia include aspiration leading to chest infection and pneumonia, malnutrition,
      inability to rehabilitate, increased risk of infection, prolonged length of stay in hospital,
      and an increased risk of death.

      Deglutologists who use FEES have long lamented the fact that there was no reliable,
      validated, anatomically defined, image-based, and easily used pharyngeal residue severity
      rating scale. All that one had to rely on was the "impression" of residue severity, the
      definition of which varied from endoscopist to endoscopist In order for any scale to gain
      widespread acceptance, it must be user friendly, easy to learn, reliable to interpret, and
      generalizable to all patients undergoing FEES. Such a scale now exists, and it is the Yale
      Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale

      Need for a trial: The relation between the severity of the pharyngeal residue and the risk of
      aspiration and subsequently the morbidity and mortality in stroke patients is not well
      defined yet.

      Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the morbidity and mortality associated with
      the severity of pharyngeal residue in a specific population: stroke patients

      Another objective of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of Emergency department (ED)
      dysphagia screening in stroke patients compared to a standard swallowing evaluation with
      FEES.

      All patients admitted to HotÃªl-Dieu de France university hospital for stroke will be
      evaluated for dysphagia using the ED dysphagia-screening tool. Preliminary data on the
      accuracy of the "ED dysphagia screening tool" are promising (Sensitivity of 96%)

      In this study outcomes between 2 groups will be evaluated; (ED failed screening group and ED
      Screening passed group) and thus be able to validate results of previous studies concerning
      sensitivity and accuracy of the screening tool mentioned previously and finally to be able to
      identify stroke patients eligible for early oral nutrition.
