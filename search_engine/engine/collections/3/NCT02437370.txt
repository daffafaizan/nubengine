    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) when given in
      combination with docetaxel or gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with
      advanced or metastatic platinum-treated urothelial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess in a preliminary manner the efficacy of this combination (overall response rate
      and progression free survival).

      II. To determine in an exploratory manner programmed death (PD)-ligand (L)1 expression in
      archival tumor specimens and to correlate this with patient outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. (Patients who had received prior gemcitabine hydrochloride/cisplatin or
      gemcitabine hydrochloride/carboplatin [GC] or methotrexate, vinblastine sulfate, adriamycin,
      and cisplatin [MVAC] therapy are assigned to Arm A).

      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1.

      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV as in Arm A and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.
