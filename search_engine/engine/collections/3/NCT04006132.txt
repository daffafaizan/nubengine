      hearing loss, that are already bilaterally implanted with two percutaneous bone-anchored
      devices (BAHS). The study consists of two visits. At visit 1, the patients are fitted
      unilaterally and bilaterally with the investigational device (Ponto 3 SuperPower). After
      fitting, the patients perform a test of spatial resolution (minimum audible angle, visit 1)
      and an auditory working memory test (visit 2). These two outcome measures are conducted in
      the laboratory using the Ponto 3 SuperPower unilaterally and bilaterally. Additionally, the
      patients fill in a questionnaire (SSQ12) to report perceived performance in their everyday
      life with their own devices. This is a post market study and all products used are CE marked
      and used in clinical practice worldwide.
