      is generally based on clinical examination. However, according to former studies
      neurophysiological measures may also have a predictive value. In the acute phase, the
      combination of the motor score and SEPs are best predictive of outcome. Neurophysiological
      measures alone are of limited value in predicting long term outcome. However, predictive
      accuracy is substantially improved through the combined use of both of these measures and
      clinical variables.

      A four-weeks randomized clinical two-period crossover-design study will be conducted. Each
      patient will be randomized in a two separate consecutive treatment periods (Parallel Group
      Design). "Group A" will be treated with functional electrical stimulation (FES) and a second
      "Gruppe B" will be treated without FES for two weeks. After this period Group A and Group B
      will switched.
