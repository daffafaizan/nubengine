      as intended and have not produced results that would bring into question the safety or
      effectiveness of cyanoacrylate adhesive for closure of surgical incisions and traumatic
      wounds in humans.

      As such, this is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study for the purpose of
      comparing two forms of topical skin adhesives, DERMABOND PROTAPE & DERMABOND HVD for closure
      of wounds in the Emergency Department.

      Patients presenting in the Emergency Department with traumatic wounds meeting the acceptance
      criteria will have their wounds closed with DERMABOND PROTAPE or DERMABOND HVD, and will be
      monitored and evaluated at 14 & 30 days.
