      undergoing cardiac surgery during the covid-19 pandemic. This will include mortality,
      morbidity, health-related quality of life, event-specific distress and depression.

      All adult patients having cardiac surgery during the pandemic at St Bartholomew's Hospital
      will be approached to join this study. As of the end of March this is this is approximately
      20 operations a week. Questionnaires will be administered at five time points alongside a
      review of clinical notes.

      Appropriate descriptive and summative statistics will be used to analyse outcomes. If sample
      size is adequate, possible associations/effect of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on each
      of the recovery parameters included in the study will be determined. The differences in
      outcomes between those with and without covid-19 may also be analysed if the sample size is
      adequate. Bias and loss to follow-up in observational cohort studies has been considered.
