      part of the study, a two fase pilot study. In the first part, five song belonging to
      different musical styles (Rock, Bosa Nova, Classical Music, Popular chilean music and New
      age) will be heard by 40 persons and the main emotion produced by every song will be
      registered (chosen among a previously defined list of emotions) and then rated using a visual
      analog scale. Thus, we will be able to select the musical style that with more frequency
      produce "tranquility and/or peace". Once this musical style will be selected we generate a
      set of songs belonging to this style. This set of songs will be validated using again a
      similar methodology in the second part of the pilot study to be sure that is able to produce
      the same emotion that the song previously evaluated. The validated set of songs will be the
      music that will be administered to the patients participating on a multicentric randomized
      controlled trial where the effect of the selected music over the tolerance to colonoscopy
      will be evaluated measuring the level of anxiety, the administered dose of midazolam and the
      intensity of pain experimented during the procedure among another variables on the
      experimental and the control groups, including 150 patients on each arm.
