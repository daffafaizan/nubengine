      partnerships to provide innovations in information sharing and systems implementation
      targeted to reduce treatment disparities. Patient navigators will be able to utilize the
      patient database to track their patients throughout their treatment, and receive guidance
      regarding recommended social resources to patients experiencing hardships via the social
      determinants platform.

      Who: The four Massachusetts CTSA hubs (Boston University, Harvard University, Tufts
      University, and University of Massachusetts) partnered with the Boston Breast Cancer Equity
      Coalition, and the 6 hospitals that care for women with breast cancer.

      Patient population: 1,100 vulnerable inner city women with risk for delay in breast cancer
      care. Massachusetts (MA) Cancer Registry data identified the following characteristics of
      Boston residents with greatest delays in breast cancer treatment: Black, Hispanic,
      non-English speaking, and public health insurance. Six health care institutions care for >90%
      of these women:

        1. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (site PI: Ted James, MD)

        2. Boston Medical Center (PI: Tracy Battaglia MD, MPH)

        3. Brigham Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (PI: Jennifer Haas MD, MPH)

        4. Faulkner Hospital (site PI: Rachel Freedman, MD)

        5. Massachusetts General Hospital (site PI: Beverly Moy, MD)

        6. Tufts Medical Center (PI: Karen Freund MD, MPH)

      UMass Medical Center (PI: Stephenie Lemon, PhD) will play an integral role in the planning
      and implementation of the TRIP intervention but is not a clinical site.
