      domain: executive function, working memory, processing speed, and visuospatial abilities
      (mental rotation and visuospatial memory). These cognitive tasks will be performed separately
      (in single task condition, while seated), as well as while performing different motor tasks
      (in dual-task condition). These motor tasks will also be performed in single task condition
      (without performing the cognitive tasks).

      The study consists of the establishment of normative age-related data for the single as well
      as dual-task protocol in healthy adults, age ranging from 18 to 65 years old (objective 1).
      Subsequently, the test protocol will be validated in persons with bilateral vestibulopathy
      (objective 2). Finally, a cross-sectional study in persons with unilateral vestibular
      impairment will take place, and the results on the single as well as dual-task components
      will be compared to normative data, as well as to persons with bilateral vestibulopathy
      (objective 3).
