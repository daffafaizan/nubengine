      efficacy is not satisfied. Metformin is a widely used oral drug for type 2 diabetes and its
      antitumor effects have got much more attentions recently. It has been shown that metformin
      exerts anti-cancer activities in several cancers, including primary liver cancer. Recent
      studies suggest that metformin treatment can reduce the risk of HCC in patients with type 2
      diabetes and inhibit HCC invasion and increase drug sensitivity to sorafenib, however, the
      safety and efficacy of combined therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma remains
      unclear. In this phase II study, patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, measurable
      disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance scoreâ‰¤1 will be enrolled.
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive the treatment of sorafenib or
      metformin plus sorafenib. The potential improvement of overall survival, time to progression
      and safety will be evaluated.
