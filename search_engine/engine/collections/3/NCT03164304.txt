      control of hypertension, magnesium sulphate for prevention of eclampsia and convulsions, and
      planning for delivery.

      Magnesium sulfate has been used to prevent eclamptic convulsion since 1925, its efficacy was
      confirmed by a large randomized controlled trial in 2002. Eclampsia could be prevented in
      more than 50% after magnesium sulfate administration . The World Health Organization
      recommended magnesium sulfate as the most effective, safe, and low-cost drug for the
      prevention of seizure in severe preeclampsia and eclampsia . The recommended dose of
      magnesium sulfate is 4 to 6 gram intravenous loading dose, followed by maintenance
      intravenous drip at the rate of 1 to 2 gram per hour .

      Although different magnesium sulfate regimens have been tested, two dosing regimens are
      internationally recommended and widely used. The Pritchard regimen is a predominantly
      intramuscular regimen given as a loading dose of 4 g intravenously , and 5 g Intramuscular
      into each buttock followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g Intramuscular every 4 hours. This
      regimen is popular in resource-limited settings where intravenously administration of
      magnesium sulfate may not be feasible. However, it is associated with pain and a higher risk
      of infection at the injection site.

      The Zuspan regimen is given as a 4 gram intravenously loading dose followed by continuous
      intravenously infusion of 1 gram per hour.

      Either 1 gram or 2 gram maintenance dose of Magnesium Sulphate has been reported to reduce
      the development of eclampsia. Randomized controlled trials offering direct comparison between
      these 2 doses are lacking.
