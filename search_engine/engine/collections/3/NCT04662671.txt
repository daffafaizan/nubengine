    
      This is a randomized, sham-controlled dose escalation and bioeffect study. The primary goal
      of the study is to evaluate the safety of the RD-X19 device in SARS-CoV-2 infected
      individuals with outpatient COVID-19 and to assess the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in
      each dose group compared to sham controls.

      The primary safety measure is absence of device-related serious adverse events or patterns of
      severity â‰¥2 device-related adverse events. Safety and tolerability (local reactogenicity)
      will be assessed actively on each clinic visit by review of potential adverse events (AEs)
      and targeted physical examination, as required. Metabolic, liver, kidney and hematological
      laboratory evaluations will be performed at baseline and at Day 8 or early termination (and
      potentially during unscheduled) clinic visits.

      Methemoglobin assessments will be performed at baseline and Day 8.

      Various efficacy assessments will explore the impact of RD-X19 treatment on the reduction in
      log10 SARS-CoV-2 viral load and alleviation of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Both the
      magnitude of reduction as a function of dose as well as time to clearance will be assessed.
