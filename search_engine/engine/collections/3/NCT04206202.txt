      stage osteoarthritis (OA) of knee. With the development of three-dimensional printing (3DP)
      technology in the medical domain, the application of patient-specific instrumentation (PSI)
      in arthroplasty has become more common. The aim of this study was to design a PSI to achieve
      appropriate femoral resection and accurate component rotation for a successful TKA, and to
      explore its clinical effects.
