    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Dovitinib will be administered 500mg orally in a 5 days on, 2 days off dosing schedule.
           Day 12 assessments are intended to be performed on the last dosing day of the 2nd week
           in cycle 1 and cycle 2 and day 26 assessments are intended to be performed on the last
           dosing day of the 4th week in cycle 1 and cycle 2.

        -  Standard of Care: Cystoscopy with tumor biopsy, bladder biopsy, urine cytology

        -  Physician discretion: Anti-emetic medications and/or colony stimulating growth factors

      ECOG performance status 0 - 2

      Hematopoietic:

        -  White blood cell count (WBC) > 3.0 K/mm3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3

        -  Platelets ≥ 100 K/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum total bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x Upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0 x ULN

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or serum creatinine > 1.5 - 3 x ULN if calculated
           creatinine clearance (CrCl) is ≥ 30 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation

      Cardiovascular:

      No impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of the
      following:

        -  History or presence of serious uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias

        -  Clinically significant resting bradycardia

        -  LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram (ECHO) < 50% or lower limit of normal (whichever is
           higher) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA), < 45% or lower limit of normal
           (whichever is higher)

        -  Myocardial Infarction (MI), severe/unstable angina, Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG),
           Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), Transient Ischemic
