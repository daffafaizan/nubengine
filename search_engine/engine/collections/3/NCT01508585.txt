      improving surgical outcomes.

      However, previous studies have examined group-based CBT delivered in person, and most
      patients cannot feasibly attend weekly therapy appointments at the hospital. Telephone-based
      CBT offers greater convenience because the service can be delivered during the evening and
      weekends, and eliminates the need to leave work and travel to hospital appointments. No
      published studies have examined the effectiveness or feasibility of telephone-based CBT for
      bariatric surgery patients. This study will examine the effectiveness of Tele-CBT as an
      adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of care in bariatric surgery patients.
