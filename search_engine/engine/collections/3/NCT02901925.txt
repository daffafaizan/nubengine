      clinical trial of ABY-029. Administration will occur as a single intravenous injection to
      subjects with recurrent glioma, approximately 1-3 hours prior to surgery.

      The protocol is not a safety study since no physiological effects are expected at microdose
      levels of ABY-029. Rather, doses have been selected to determine if a fluorescence signal can
      be detected by wide-field imaging technology with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, which is
      considered necessary for subsequent assessment of diagnostic performance of ABY-029 as a
      tumor biomarker sufficient to guide surgical resection in the future. No diagnostic or
      therapeutic intent is proposed, and administration of the study drug is not intended to alter
      the extent of planned brain tumor resection during the surgical procedure.
