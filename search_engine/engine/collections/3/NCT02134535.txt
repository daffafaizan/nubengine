      priority. An ex vivo challenge model is one such promising surrogate. Colonic tissue exposed
      to rectally applied microbicides in vivo and then challenged with HIV in the lab showed
      significant reduction in HIV replication when compared to tissue exposed to placebo gel.
      Currently, the ex vivo challenge model for ectocervical and vaginal tissue is being developed
      at the Dezzutti lab at the Magee Womens Research Institute in Pittsburgh, PA. Questions which
      need to be addressed in order to optimize the model include which HIV virus is most
      appropriate to use to challenge the tissue, is qPCR a more appropriate endpoint and marker of
      infection, and can frozen tissue perform as well as fresh tissue in the challenge model.

      In this study, we will collect vaginal and cervical biopsies to use in the optimization of
      laboratory procedures. We will obtain the sample(s) from healthy HIV negative women. Samples
      will be collected and taken to Magee-Womens Research Institute as laboratory specimens.
      Written consent will be obtained by an investigator or co-investigator prior to the
      collection of any samples.
