      Primary

        -  Determine if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can induce complete tumor necrosis in women
           with invasive breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether breast MRI can accurately predict residual cancer and tumor necrosis
           in patients treated with RFA.

        -  Determine the toxicity of RFA in these patients.

        -  Determine the cosmetic outcome after RFA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized study.

      Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using gadopentetate dimeglumine.
      Within the next few days, patients undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) over approximately
      20-30 minutes. Patients then undergo a second DCE-MRI 3 to 21 days after RFA, followed by
      definitive surgery (standard mastectomy or lumpectomy).

      Pathologic confirmation of the post-ablation DCE-MRI findings is performed within 1 to 21
      days after the second MRI. Tumor cell viability and proliferative activity are assessed by
      immunohistochemical and biomarker analysis.
