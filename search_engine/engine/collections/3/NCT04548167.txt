      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), is associated with significant morbidity and increase in
      peri-operative mortality. Prolonged CPB usage could be predictive for early bloodstream
      infection following cardia surgery. This study is to analyse the demographics and
      microbiological factors concerning patients undergoing cardio surgical intervention using CPB
      complicated with bloodstream infection (BSI) postoperatively.
