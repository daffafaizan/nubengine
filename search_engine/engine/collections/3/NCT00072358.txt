        -  Determine the efficacy of sargramostim (GM-CSF) in enhancing monoclonal antibody
           3F8-mediated ablation in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the prognostic impact of minimal residual bone marrow disease on relapse-free
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare the effects of short-term (2-hour intravenous) vs prolonged (subcutaneous
           release) daily GM-CSF on granulocyte activation, in order to establish the optimal route
           for tumor-cell kill in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to evaluable disease
      (yes [primary refractory bone marrow disease] vs no [no evidence of disease]).

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days -5 to 4 and monoclonal antibody
      3F8 IV over 0.5-1.5 hours on days 0-4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses and then
      every 8 weeks for up to a total of 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Beginning after 2 courses of GM-CSF and monoclonal antibody 3F8, patients also receive oral
      isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14 (when no monoclonal antibody 3F8 is administered).
      Treatment with isotretinoin repeats approximately every 28 days for 6 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients will be accrued for this study.
