      cells within the human retina initiate this response. Recent research suggests that one of
      the ganglion cell types involved in this pupil response is affected by glaucoma. By measuring
      pupil responses to different colored lights, the function of this class of cells can be
      evaluated quickly, and without touching the eye. An advantage of pupil testing strategies is
      that they do not require subjective feedback from the subject about what they can see, as is
      required for standard visual field tests that are used in the clinic.

      The main aim of this study is to measure and compare the pupil constriction that occurs in
      response to flickering red and blue lights in patients with glaucoma versus matched control
      patients without glaucoma. In addition, the subjects will be asked questions about their
      quality of life and it will be determined whether issues related to quality of life correlate
      to alterations in the pupil responses.
