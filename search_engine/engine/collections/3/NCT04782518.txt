    
      Parkinson Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects more than ten million
      people worldwide. In the United States, more than one million people are living with PD and
      more than 100,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.

      Exercise to Ease the Burden of PD:

      Exercise is an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy for PD that has been shown in many intensive
      research studies to help improve motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. A variety of
      Parkinson-specific exercise programs have been developed to help improve balance, posture,
      mobility, strength, endurance, speech, and/or self-help skills. These classes include various
      modes of exercise and different intensity levels, tailored for patients' personal
      characteristics and functional abilities.

      Current Gaps in Knowledge and Aim:

      The benefits of PD-specific exercise programs on physical function and disease-related
      quality of life have not been evaluated. Furthermore, many patients may not have access to
      PD-specific exercise programs. The proposed project addresses these gaps by exploring
      associations between PD-specific exercise programs and several metrics of physical function
      and quality of life among individuals with PD. In addition, the investigators are studying
      associations among overall exercise patterns, physical activity patterns, physical function,
      and quality of life among individuals with PD.

      Study Involvement:

      Participation in this study involves online surveys completed upon enrollment (i.e.,
      baseline) and at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years. A family member,
      caregiver, or friend may help the participant complete the online surveys.
