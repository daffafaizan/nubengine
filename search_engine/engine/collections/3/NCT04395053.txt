      calculated to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese volunteers after oral
      administration of SHR1459 tablets in new and old formulations.

      During the study, the safety will be assessed by vital signs, physical examination,
      laboratory examination (hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, coagulation examination),
      12-lead electrocardiogram. The incidence and severity degree of adverse events and severe
      adverse events will be evaluated based on CTCAE 5.0.
