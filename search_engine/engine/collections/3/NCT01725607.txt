      whether a single dose of dexmedetomidine or thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with
      general anesthesia would provide hemodynamic stability, reduce stress hormone responses,
      inhibit inflammatory cytokine secretion, and improve sleep quality in patients after thoracic
      surgery.
