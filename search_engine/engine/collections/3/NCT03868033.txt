      regulator of osteoclast development. Thus, it acts as a potent anti-resorptive agent and is
      now widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Because it's easily to be used with very
      low risk of complications, patient has better compliance and persistence of denosumab than
      bisphosphonates. It's market share increasing very rapidly in Taiwan.

      Although denosumab has excellent effect to increase bone mass and prevent fracture in FREEDOM
      study with very low complications, even up to ten years, it's effect is reversible. After
      holding the drug, circulating denosumab levels fall rapidly, and bone resorption reaching
      twice baseline levels for about 6 months. Over the first 12 months off therapy, all the bone
      density gained on treatment is lost4. According to previous meta-analysis study, although the
      persistence of denosumab therapy is better than bisphosphonates, only 62% patients keep the
      treatment after two years. We could image how low the persistence is after five-year or
      ten-year treatment in the real world.

      How to prevent bone loss after denosumab therapy is an important issue, especially when
      considering the compliance, persistence, or other comorbidities of the patient. There is only
      one randomized controlled trial dealing with this problem, although the primary goal of the
      study is designed to compare the compliance and persistence1. After switching from denosumab
      to alendronate for one year, bone mineral density does not decrease rapidly, although there
      is mild elevation of bone turn over marker.

      We want to verify if zoledronic acid could be used as a sequential therapy after denosumab to
      prevent rapid bone loss by randomized clinical trial.
