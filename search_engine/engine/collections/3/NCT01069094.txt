      (leuprolide acetate for depot suspension) was initiated in females with symptomatic
      leiomyomata. A single dose PK visit was conducted only for subjects randomized to the
      Progenta arm, between screening and visit 1. A second PK assessment was conducted at Visit 3
      (one month on drug) to collect steady state data. Treatment period lasted for 3 months.
