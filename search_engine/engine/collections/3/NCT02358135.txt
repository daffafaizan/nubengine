      evaluate the impact of a collaborative connected health model for psoriasis management
      compared to inperson care. The pragmatic trial will compare psoriasis severity,
      quality-of-life, mental health, and access-to-care between the two models. We will enroll 300
      psoriasis patients from Colorado and California. In addition to recruiting patients from the
      general population, we will place a specific emphasis on recruiting psoriasis patients living
      in rural and underserved communities. We will also recruit from the full disease spectrum of
      mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis patients. We will use an intention-to-treat approach to
      analyze outcomes and perform longitudinal data analysis using repeated measures approach to
      identify potential differences in the trend over time between the two arms. To evaluate the
      utility of CCH for increasing access from patients' and clinicians' perspective, the study
      team will conduct key informant interviews and use qualitative analytical techniques with
      investigator triangulation and member checking to enhance the validity of the conclusions.
