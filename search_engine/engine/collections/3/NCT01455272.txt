      relapse was diagnosed in patients for which no GVHD occurred or free of GVHD after 2 weeks
      off immunosuppression for patients receiving GPBPCI after day 90 post HSCT. Before
      administration of GPBPCI, serious infection had to be cleared and no serious organ failure
      could be present. The GPBPCI regimen was comprised of G-CSF-primed PBSCs instead of harvested
      non-primed donor lymphocytes and short-term immunosuppressive agents for prevention of GVHD
      after GPBPCI. Chimerism status was examined before and after prophylactic treatment with
      GPBPCI.
