      re-entry meeting, two monthly meetings and quarterly assessments for 3 years, personalized
      feedback on substance use and high risk behaviors, linkage to community-based substance abuse
      treatment (when needed), on-site HIV booster sessions (when needed), and treatment engagement
      and retention support. Motivational interviewing will provide the therapeutic approach to
      transition women from one step of the change process to another. Combined, these components
      and therapeutic milieu afford an opportunity for immediate linkage to community-based
      treatment and HIV prevention as well as ongoing monitoring for relapse and early
      re-intervention for both substance use and HIV risk behaviors (both public health
      priorities).
