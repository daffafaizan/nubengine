      (MALT) to treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection with antibiotics (amoxicillin,
      clarithromycin, tetracycline, and metronidazole) and with gastric acid inhibitors (omeprazole
      and bismuth subsalicylate). II. Correlate response with endoscopic tumor grade and clinical
      and pathological parameters. III. Assess the incidence of H. pylori infection in patients
      with gastric MALT lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: All patients are treated on Regimen A; those receiving tetracycline on Regimen A are
      switched to Regimen B for their second course; those receiving amoxicillin for their first
      course receive tetracycline for their second course. Regimen A: Antibiotic Therapy with
      Gastric Acid Inhibition. Amoxicillin (or Tetracycline in penicillin-allergic patients);
      Clarithromycin; with Bismuth Subsalicylate; Omeprazole. Regimen B: Antibiotic Therapy with
      Gastric Acid Inhibition. Tetracycline; Metronidazole, METRO, NSC-50364; with Bismuth
      Subsalicylate; Omeprazole.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 75 patients will be entered over 3 years.
