    
      All persons aged 18 - 44 years planning to travel alone and attending the travel clinic of
      the Medical Outpatient Clinic in Lausanne will be asked to participate. The subjects will be
      randomized into three groups: 1. no intervention, 2. free condoms without further
      explanations, 3. a structured intervention of 5 minutes on STI risk reduction plus free
      condoms. The structured interventions will include information about the number of travelers
      engaging in new sexual relationships, the different types of STI and their prevalence in
      different countries and population groups. The subjects will complete a pre-travel
      questionnaire prior to the medical consultation. A post-travel questionnaire will be sent to
      them 10 days after their trip. The questionnaires will include questions on demographic
      characteristics, sexual habits, alcohol/tobacco/marijuana consumption and sexual
      relationships during the trip.
