      unethical not to try any treatment option with a justified rationale.

      The investigators have explained that medical ozone therapy has a clear scientific basement
      thanks to all preclinical and clinical investigation already published. It can be classified
      as chemical stressor that produces a modulation in the redox balance and immunity. Moreover,
      it is easy and safe to administer with insignificant side effects.

      The efficacy in viral diseases has been proved in publications together the modulation of
      interleukin 6 and other proinflammatory cytokines that could potentially help in COVID19
      patients. The improve of exchange of gases and microcirculation will surely contribute to
      enhance this patients' health status.

      As explained above, the investigators propose to carry out a randomized control trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of systemic ozone (indirect endovenous) in these patients.
