    
      Healthy volunteers and people presenting chronic low back pain, will be recruited. A
      standardized grid will be drawn over the participants' lumbar region. Circular electrodes,
      connected to a constant current stimulator, will be applied at points on the grid. All
      participants will be blinded to the electrode locations. Painful electrocutaneous stimuli
      will be randomly delivered for each electrode. Participants will be instructed to draw with a
      stylus pen on a digital body chart displayed on a tablet where they will perceive each
      painful stimulation.

      The body chart will be centred on a canvas 768x1024 pixels (pxl), and pain location will be
      defined by X and Y coordinates. The consistency in reporting the location of each painful
      stimulation will be described through coordinates.

      In addition, only people presenting chronic low back pain will be asked to provide
      information about their lifestyle, level of disability, actual pain and general pain,
      assessment of kinesiophobia and health status.
