      tobacco smoking, diabetes, and atherosclerosis that worsen inflammation, comorbidities common
      in older people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (MCI). Older MCI patients are
      prone to poor oral hygiene and dental health, which if untreated worsens
      inflammation-mediated brain and nervous system function, and accelerates progression to
      dementia. Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) is often a silent disease detected in
      only ~10% of older adults, and may have a strong association with MCI. This study examines
      the effects of intensive therapy for periodontitis on cognition in high-risk older people
      with ACAS. Results could highlight PD as a readily modifiable risk factor for dementia.

      This pilot study examines the hypothesis that intensive treatment of PD (IPT) in older people
      with MCI and ACAS will attenuate their cognitive decline by reducing oral microbial-mediated
      inflammation and improving cerebrovascular endothelial function that contribute to
      neurodegeneration-associated dementia.

      The aims are to determine the effects of intensive compared to control PD treatment
      (randomized: IPT vs. CPT) in 60 MCI subjects with ACAS and PD on 1) Cognitive function
      (Primary Outcome) and quality of life (Secondary Outcome), and 2) The potential mechanisms
      mediating these effects
