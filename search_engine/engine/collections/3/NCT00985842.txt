      resistance to infection, promotion of wound healing, production of collagen, and
      epithelialization all correlate with higher oxygen levels. Unfortunately, simply donning a
      lower limb prosthesis may limit circulation and reduce the level of tissue oxygenation. This
      reduction may be compounded by the biomechanical forces of gait. The compressive loads of the
      body's weight during stance and the inertial loads of the prosthesis during swing may further
      occlude circulation, albeit by different mechanisms.

      For the dysvascular lower limb amputee, the choice of prosthetic socket and suspension system
      may impact the overall health of their residual limb and wound healing capacity. An
      inappropriate choice may lead to skin irritation, tissue breakdown, discomfort, and reduced
      mobility. For these patients, any component that reduces tissue oxygenation is a significant
      problem because compromised circulation can forestall wound healing.

      The objective of the proposed research is to use photo-oximetry to discover which of five
      different prosthetic limb systems results in higher residual limb tissue oxygenation during
      both rest and gait. This experiment will enable evidence-based decision making on this
      clinically relevant problem. Using a prospective, randomized cross-over experimental design
      and the investigators' photo-oximetry system, the investigators will measure and compare the
      tissue oxygenation along the medial and lateral surfaces (3 sites each) of the residual limb
      during rest and walking.
