      advance in therapy for uveal melanoma with hepatic metastases, an fatal orphan disease with
      no established therapy. Studies by Dr. Sato and others have described some activity for
      selective internal radiation with Yttrium90 microspheres (SIR-Spheres).There is limited
      activity as single agents for both the immunotherapy drugs ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and
      nivolumab (anti-PD-1). In cutaneous melanoma the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab is
      clearly synergistic with improvement in response rates and progression-free survival over
      single agents; however this has yet to be established for uveal melanoma.

      Recent experimental and clinical evidence suggests additional synergy between radiation
      therapy and immunotherapy. This synergy seems most evident when radiation is given through
      large fraction stereotactic treatments or brachytherapy. The investigators will explore this
      synergy with a feasibility study of 18 patients who will receive SirSpheres Yttrium-90
      selective internal radiation given through the hepatic artery in two treatments followed by
      immunotherapy with the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab. The immunotherapy will be
      given with the dose and schedule that has been established and FDA-approved for cutaneous
      melanoma. Because of the generally low toxicity of Yttrium-90 selective internal radiation
      therapy the investigators feel it can be given in full dosage prior to full dosage of
      immunotherapy.
