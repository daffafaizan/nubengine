the isolation of thyrocalcitonin and study of its effects in the rat.the thyroid secretes apolypeptide hormone (thyrocalcitionin)which is effectivein lowering plasma calciumand phosphate.  the hormonecan be extracted fromthe thyroid of the rat, dog,pig, goat, ox, and monkey.the isolation of the hormonefrom pig thyroid by a combinationof salt fractionationand gel filtration is described.one microgram ofthe pure material is veryactive in the rat.  thyrocalcitoninremains effective afterparathyroidectomy, afternephrectomy, after overdosagewith vitamin d, during vitamind deficiency, and duringcalcium or magnesium deficiency.its action is not preventedby prior administrationof actinomycin d.  asingle injection does not changesoft tissue calcium butinfusion for 12 hr lowers cardiacmuscle calcium.  it isconcluded that this new thyroidhormone acts on boneand that it probably plays animportant role in normal physiology.
