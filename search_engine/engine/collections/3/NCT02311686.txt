      monitored by detecting biomarkers. In current practice indirect biomarkers (mean corpuscular
      volume, transaminases, gammaglutamyl or carbohydrate-deficient transferrin) are used,
      although direct biomarkers of alcohol, including alcohol itself and metabolites also exist.

      Biomarkers of alcohol consumption are used as tools to prevent health and social problems
      related with alcohol, allowing the identification of subjects at risk of abuse, dependence or
      withdrawal and to assess the efficacy of treatments for alcohol dependence.

      Non-oxidative metabolites (ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulphate and fatty acid ethyl esters)
      have longer biological half-life than ethanol and accumulate in tissues after consumption.

      The objective of the study is to study the profile of ethanol and non-oxidative biomarkers
      (ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulphate and fatty acid ethyl esters) after experimental
      administration of increasing doses of alcohol in adult subjects.

      Subjects will be genotyped for genetic polymorphisms of proteins related to ethanol
      metabolism and effects (as alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase), and the
      genotypes will be used to evaluate their influence in the results.
