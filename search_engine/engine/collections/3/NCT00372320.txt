      Salivary glands in the IR field suffer irreversible damage. There is no conventional
      treatment available to correct this condition. Our research group has been developing the
      AdhAQP1 recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral (rAd5) vector based on the hypothesis that a
      replication deficient rAd5 vector is capable of safely transferring the human aquaporin-1
      (hAQP1) cDNA to parotid glands of adult patients with IR-induced salivary hypofunction,
      resulting in an elevated salivary output, albeit transiently. Salivary glands have proven to
      be valuable gene transfer targets in numerous pre-clinical animal model studies. hAQP1, the
      archetypal water channel, is a plasma membrane protein that facilitates water movement across
      lipid bilayers. Rat and minipig studies have clearly shown that the AdhAQP1 strategy for
      restoring salivary flow to IR-damaged salivary glands is effective, and studies in rats,
      non-human primates and minipigs have shown that AdhAQP1 and similar rAd5 vectors are without
      significant untoward effects after salivary gland delivery. The purpose of this clinical
      protocol is to test the safety of AdhAQP1, with some measures of efficacy, in adult patients
      with established IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction. The targeted tissue site for the
      AdhAQP1 vector in the proposed study is a single parotid gland. In this Phase 1
      dose-escalation study, safety will be evaluated using conventional clinical and immunological
      parameters. The primary outcome measure for biological efficacy will be parotid gland
      salivary output.
