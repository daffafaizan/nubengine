      variety of disease sites. The purpose of this study is to collect and store blood serum from
      patients before, during, and after anti-cancer therapy to find new biomarkers that signal
      disease or response to anti-cancer therapy. The collection and analysis of these biomarkers
      may lead to improved diagnostic and treatment therapies for certain cancers in the future. We
      are also interested in collecting blood serum from healthy individuals such as the spouses,
      relatives, and friends of cancer patients to obtain healthy controls for comparison
