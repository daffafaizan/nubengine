      through shortening and overactivation of other muscles because of their dual function as
      muscles of the upper limb and neck motion which makes them limited in function and decreases
      the range of motion in these joints. Another resultant effect of these changes is the
      shortness of breath taking place following the inability of patients to perform daily
      activities.

      Current research is focusing on the use of Muscle Energy Techniques (METs) for such
      circumstances. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether METs result in an improvement
      in rib cage mobility which could potentially lead to improvements in pulmonary function and
      activities of daily of living (ADLs) in a group of patients diagnosed with COPD. If positive
      results are obtained, such an intervention might provide a possible addition to the
      evidence-based interventions already available for COPD patients. The result of this
      intervention may provide physiotherapists with further techniques for use in such patients;
      ones which will be of benefit to the patients and their quality of life and also to the
      health services.

      A randomised controlled trial (RCT) shall be carried out on an approximate sample of 110
      patients diagnosed with COPD. Participants shall be randomly assigned to an intervention and
      a control group. The intervention group shall be receiving a 4 week programme of Muscle
      Energy Techniques whereas the control group shall continue with their prescribed medications
      and any conventional physiotherapy sessions suggested for these patients.
