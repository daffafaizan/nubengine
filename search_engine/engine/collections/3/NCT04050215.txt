      I. To determine the impact of gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT on initial
      and subsequent treatment strategies of patients with prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan over 3 hours.
      Patients may be reenrolled in the study, if 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is performed for subsequent
      management decision.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 3-12 months.
