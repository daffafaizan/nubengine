      issues. Using soft-tissue undercuts in the palatal side of the upper jaw is so useful for
      prostheses' retention over and above the abutment teeth. The use of flexible materials can
      serve this aim. The current study aims to compare the efficacy of nasal-oral seal using
      flexible materials against the traditional method of using heat activated acrylic materials.
