      non-invasive way to distinguish the presence of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Besides
      detecting elevated ICP in various neurological diseases, ONSD can also be applied to cardiac
      arrest survivors as one of the prognostic factors. It is a simple, quick, repeatable
      technique without the need of contrast medians. In order to make precise interpretations, the
      database of the normal distribution of ONSD and its associated factors in healthy volunteers
      is necessary. The majority of previous reports are from Western countries, and limited
      reports of ONSD in the Asian population have high variability.

      Therefore, collecting local data of ONSD in Taiwan is important. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to analyze the ONSD diameters and its associated factors in Taiwanese
      healthy volunteers. The investigators planed to recruit 150 healthy volunteers aged more than
      20 years old. The ONSD and its associated factors will be measured and recorded by ultrasound
      from September 2020 to August 2021.
