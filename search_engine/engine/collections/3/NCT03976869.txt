    
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase I study to assess the PK, PD and safety of 2 week
      treatment with inhaled AZD7594 in adolescent patients with asthma.

      The study is planned to be conducted at 4-10 study sites in the United States. Eligible 12 to
      17-year-old patients with asthma controlled on Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 2
      medication (ie, low dose inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] or leukotriene receptor antagonist
      [LTRA]), as evidenced by an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5) score ≤1.5, will be asked to
      stop their ongoing asthma maintenance treatment. After a washout period (14 to 21 days), all
      patients with confirmed reversibility will start study treatment, consisting of inhalations
      of AZD7594 (360 µg, delivered dose, via dry powder inhaler [DPI]) once daily for 15 to 16
      days.

      The study intends to include 24 patients in order to have 18 evaluable patients, enrolled in
      equal proportion in the age group of 12 to 14 years (inclusive), and the age group of 15 to
      17 years (inclusive), with at least 7 patients in each subgroup.

      For each patient, the duration of participation in the study will be approximately 5 to 7
      weeks (37 to 52 days)
