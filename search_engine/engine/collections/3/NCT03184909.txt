      believed to bring about a facilitative enhancement of cognitive ability and lower stress
      levels in individuals. Stress and an inability to perform at a required level of cognition
      can induce anxiety. This study is looking at the effects of daily consuming Tulsi among a
      group of individuals who work in an environment that demands memory, attention and executive
      functioning.
