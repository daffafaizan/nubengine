    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study of kidney transplant subjects where
      blood specimens, intended for dd-cfDNA and other future research purposes, will be drawn
      after transplant periodically and also after the treatment of acute rejection up to 8 weeks
      post treatment. The blood samples and all relevant clinical data will be provided to CareDx
      scientists for laboratory assay of dd-cfDNA levels and correlation of dd-cfDNA levels with
      the clinical features of the subjects.

      The primary objective of the study is to correlate circulating dd-cfDNA to clinical and
      sub-clinical acute rejection in renal allograft recipients. The secondary objective of the
      study is to correlate circulating dd-cfDNA to renal function, both serum creatinine and
      estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]).
