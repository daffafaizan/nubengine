      for a number of years, in spite of many initiatives to try and reduce relapse. One of the
      reasons could be that the offered treatments mainly focus on conscious and controllable
      aspects of behaviour. Recent research has however found that much of the craving in addiction
      is guided by automatic processes, which are for a large part unconscious and poorly
      controlled by the individual. Unsurprisingly, many attempts have therefore been made in
      addition research to reduce these automatic impulsive behaviour and improve the control
      processes.

      One way to influence these automatic processes is by applying cognitive bias modification, a
      cognitive-behavioural intervention that can be applied by a computer application. In alcohol
      addition, a common cognitive bias is the Alcohol-Approach bias, the tendency to automatically
      approach alcohol. The Anti-Alcohol Training is a form of cognitive bias modification that was
      developed to reduce this approach bias. Studies have shows that this training can reduce the
      rates of relapse by 4-8%.

      A drawback of the training is that patients often do not continue this at home after
      discharge, probably due to low motivation. One way to resolve this issue could be to offer
      the training in an App-game form, which would make it more accessible and inviting to
      continue using it after return home.

      In this study the investigators have developed a smartphone based training app that allows
      patients to more easily use the Anti-Alcohol training at home after discharge. The study aims
      to assess whether alcohol dependent patients continue to use this app at home, whether the
      use of the app further reduces the alcohol bias, and finally whether it can reduce yearly
      relapse rates.
