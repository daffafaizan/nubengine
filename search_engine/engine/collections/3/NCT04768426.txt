    
      The Primary Objective is to characterize the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profile of
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in participants with residual disease after standard
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) receiving standard-of-care adjuvant capecitabine.

      The Secondary Objectives are to correlate ctDNA levels with genomic features and survival.
