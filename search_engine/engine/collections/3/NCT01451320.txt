      1993 and 2009 were included in the study. The patients were enrolled after informed consent
      if there was no contraindication, to thrombolysis. The study was approved by the local Ethics
      Board. The patient demographics, past medical history, date of the operation, type and make
      of the prosthetic valve, rhythm disorders, aspirin use, NYHA functional capacity, leading
      symptoms and international normalization ratio (INR) values at the time of admission were
      prospectively entered into a database.The diagnosis of PVT was verified each time by
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) when a patient was admitted with thromboembolism or
      persistently low INR for the preceding consecutive 3 months and when a transthoracic
      echocardiography (TTE) documented prosthetic valve dysfunction or thrombus. All patients
      underwent TTE and TEE examination before and after the thrombolysis sessions. The cross
      sectional area and the longest diameter of the thrombus were measured on TEE recordings
