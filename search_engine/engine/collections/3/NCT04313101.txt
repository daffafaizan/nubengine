      care unit as a consequence of critical illness. It affects more than 50 % of patients in the
      intensive care and is related to many problems as difficult weaning from mechanical
      ventilation, prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality.

      There are three distinct entities for ICUAW that can only be differentiated by
      neurophysiological studies. These are critical illness myopathy (CIM), critical illness
      polyneuropathy (CIP) and critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM).

      Identification of risk factors responsible for the development of ICUAW is the first step in
      the prevention and management of this disorder. Till time septic shock, hyperglycemia, high
      dose steroid therapy, prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of neuromuscular blocking
      agents are the main accused.

      Thyroid disorders are also associated with neuromuscular abnormalities. Unfortunately, the
      prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the intensive care is high reaching 90%. Moreover,
      patients with severe critical illness, who are typically prone to the development of ICUAW,
      show changes in their thyroid biochemistry namely low T3 levels (with or without low T4
      levels) in the presence of normal TSH levels. These changes are collectively known as
      Non-Thyroidal illness syndrome (previously low T3 syndrome and Euthyroid sick syndrome) which
      is the most common form of thyroid dysfunction in the intensive care unit.
