    
      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, partially blinded, sequential cohort,
      dose-escalation study designed to obtain preliminary data on the safety, tolerability, and
      early efficacy of Q-Cells® transplantation in subjects with ALS. Following an initial cohort
      receiving cell transplants unilaterally in the lumbar spinal cord, subsequent cohorts will
      receive escalating doses transplanted unilaterally in cervical spinal cord. Subjects and
      outcome measure assessors will be blinded to side of treatment. The study will be conducted
      at sites with extensive clinical experience with the care of patients with ALS.

      The study is planned to enroll up to 30 subjects over 24 months. Each subject will receive a
      single time point administration of Q-Cells®: with 5 or 10 (dependent upon dose level)
      transplantation foci targeted to the anterior horn in either the lumbar or cervical spinal
      cord.

      The study consists of Screening, Pre-operative/Treatment, and Post-treatment study periods.
      The study data will be assessed for safety and efficacy after the last subject has completed
      the 9-month study visit. Following the 9-month study period, subjects who consent will
      continue to be followed for safety and efficacy long-term in a separate protocol.
