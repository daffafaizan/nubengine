    
      This is a prospective, single blinded, randomised controlled feasibility study recruiting
      consecutive appropriate patients in this post-acute rehabilitation unit.

      Feasibility outcomes including safety, recruitment, measurements, adherence, retention and
      satisfaction will be evaluated. There are two groups (i) exercise intervention and (ii)
      control. It will not be possible to blind the treating physiotherapist or the patient to the
      exercise intervention; hence the single (assessor) blinded design.

      The study will be based in St James's Hospital, Dublin. Assessments and the delivery of the
      exercise intervention will be conducted in the Physiotherapy department.

      Patients will be recruited in the inpatient setting. Appropriate patients will be approached,
      and the intervention explained to them. The patient will be given an information leaflet and
      24-hours to consider involvement in the study
