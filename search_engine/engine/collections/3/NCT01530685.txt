      studies; however, the issue of cinnamon intake's effect on fasting blood glucose (FBG) in
      people with prediabetes still remains unclear.

      The main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of supplementation with Glycabiane,
      a dietary supplement rich in cinnamon extract, on fast blood glucose of overweight
      prediabetic subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
