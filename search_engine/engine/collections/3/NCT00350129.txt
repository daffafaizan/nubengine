      hyperglycemia increases retinal vessel diameters in animals and humans. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the effect of glucose on the ocular blood flow in vasospastics and
      nonvasospastics. Body core temperature depends on basal metabolism. Peripheral
      vasoconstriction is a physiological way to preserve core temperature of the body. The
      etiology of primary vasospastic syndrome is unknown and potentially represents simply a
      reaction to a defective metabolism. Based on this hypothesis, vasospastics are expected to
      show a different vascular reaction to glucose.

      On both study days, after an overnight fast, the subjects will be seated for 30 minutes in
      the Lab and local tropicamide will be applied for pupil dilatation. After stabilisation of
      blood pressure Retinal vessel diameter and choroidal blood flow will be assessed. Baseline
      blood glucose levels will be measured. Afterwards study substance (75 gram of Glucose or
      Aspartate) will be applied in 3 dl of water. One and a half hour later, the vascular
      measurements will be repeated. Ath the end of hemodynamic assessments, blood sugar level will
      be measured again.
