      of them. Among the physiotherapeutic interventions, the McKenzie Method (Spine 1983;8:141-4),
      has shown to be an effective approach to manage patients with low back pain. More
      specifically, it consists on standardized repetitive flexion and extension exercises of the
      lumbar spine. Thus far, there has been no randomized intervention testing the effectiveness
      of physiotherapeutic interventions in chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis. In this
      study we selected four of their main proposed exercises (flexion in standing, extension in
      standing, flexion in lying, and extension in lying position) to apply three times a week for
      eight weeks.
