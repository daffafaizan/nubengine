      glaucoma. First is the retina (part of the eye that converts images from the eye's optical
      system into electrical impulses sent along the optic nerve to the brain). Newer technology,
      Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), allows us to look at different layers
      of the retina and carefully measure thickness of each layer. Second area is lamina cribrosa
      (a portion of the white part of the eye which has nerve fibers passing through it connecting
      the eye to the brain). If lamina cribrosa is thin, it is possible it may bend easily and
      disrupt nerve fibers. SD-OCT allows measurement of lamina cribrosa thickness.

      Findings will help monitor changes that occur in the eye as a result of glaucoma.

      Individuals with primary open-angle glaucoma and unilateral visual field defects were chosen
      as the main patient population (in addition to normal controls). By approximating each
      participants baseline anatomy using the fellow, "internal control" eye, investigators will be
      able to better determine if any changes occur in the macula or the lamina cribrosa as a
      result of glaucoma.
