      high percentage of EGFR expression in this tumor subtype.Weekly taxol (paclitaxel) is widely
      used in breast cancer patients with metastatic disease. Erbitux (cetuximab) is a monoclonal
      antibody that shown its ability to enhance activity of chemotherapy in colon carcinoma. Thus
      we wanted to combine the use of anti EGFR therapy in the form of Erbitux (cetuximab) with the
      widely used weekly taxol chemotherapy for the treatment of women with basal like breast
      carcinoma. This is a small phase II study that will hopefully provide initial data as to the
      general tolerability and response rate of this combination in this disease. Furthermore,
      pathologic analysis will be used to try and assess relation of response with the presence of
      immunohistochemical markers such as EGFR expression.
