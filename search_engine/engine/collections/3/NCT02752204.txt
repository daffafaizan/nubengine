    
      This is a prospective, single arm, multicentre, phase II clinical trial utilising a two stage
      design. Stage one will assess the safety and activity of AZD2014 as a single agent in the
      treatment of DLBCL in 30 patients. Stage two will assess the additional toxicity of combining
      AZD2014 with Rituximab in an additional 6 patients.

      Stage two will be recruited following the full recruitment of stage 1. Stage 2 recruitment
      will be staggered with 3 patients recruited and their safety data evaluated prior to the
      recruitment of the remaining 3 patients.

      Post treatment biopsies will be requested at relapse in patients receiving rituximab to
      assess for evidence of synergy.

      Once registered to the study, patients will receive AZD2014 125mg bd on an intermittent
      schedule of 2 days of treatment followed by 5 days with no treatment. Treatment would be on
      days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23 of each course 28 days in duration. Treatment is on-going
      until progression or withdrawal due to toxicity or patient's choice. For the second stage of
      the trial, rituximab 375mg/m2 will also be administered intravenously on day 1 of the 28 day
      cycle for a total of 6 cycles in combination with AZD2014.

      All patients will be followed for a minimum of 1 year up until disease progression or death.

      For patients still on AZD2014 treatment after 1 year (no progression) treatment should still
      be reviewed at least 3 monthly. Safety, progression and survival data will be collected every
      3 months. Assessments should be as per local practice with a CT scan conducted every 3/4
      months.

      At progression, patients will then be followed up annually for survival data. Tissue, saliva
      and blood samples will be collected during treatment to determine the activity of AZD2014 on
      downstream targets, and correlating with response. This will include biopsy tissue from the
      pre-treatment sample, any biopsy performed on treatment and at relapse post-AZD2014 should
      this occur
