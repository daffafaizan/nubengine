    
      Patients will be randomized into either the Forced Air group (FA) or Conductive Heat group
      (CH). Randomization will be based on computer-generated codes that will be maintained in
      sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. Fifty patients will be recruited with 25 patients
      being randomized into each group.

      In patients assigned to the FA group, a Bair Hugger (Arizant Medical, Inc., Eden Prairie,
      Minnesota) forced-air cover will be positioned over the upper body (if lower extremity
      surgery) or lower body (if upper extremity surgery). The forced-air blower will be set and
      activated per standard practice usually after prepping and draping.

      In patients assigned to the CH group, a VitaHeat (VitaHeat, Inc, Aurora, IL) conductive
      heating device will be placed under the torso of the patient. The device will be set and
      activated per standard practice usually just after positioning of the patient on the
      operating table.

      Patients in both groups will be otherwise draped per surgical routine. Ambient temperature
      will be maintained near 20Â°C. Temperatures will be recorded using a temporal artery
      thermometer.
