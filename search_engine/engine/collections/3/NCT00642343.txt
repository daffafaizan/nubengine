      community resources. In the last two decades cochlear implantation has developed into the new
      standard of care for severe to profound haring loss. Recent studies have shown bilateral
      implantation improves sound localization and understanding of speech in noise. For children,
      this is seen as a significant benefit. As we begin to offer bilateral cochlear implants to a
      growing number of children it would be in our patient's best interest to evaluate whether or
      not this may cause balance impairment. We will evaluate the balance scores of children with
      bilateral cochlear implants, and compare their results to unilaterally implanted children and
      a hearing impaired population, with the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test 2nd ed (BOT2). In addition
      we will take a small group of unilaterally implanted patients and test them before and after
      a contralateral cochlear implant as a prospective study group.
