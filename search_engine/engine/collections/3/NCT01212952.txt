      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib in combination with pomalidomide
      and dexamethasone.

      II. To evaluate the hematologic response rate (PR, VGPR, or CR) of pomalidomide, bortezomib
      and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to progression.

      II. To assess the toxicity of pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE : This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II
      study. Patients receive oral pomalidomide on days 1-21; bortezomib IV on days 1, 8,15, 22;
      and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, 22 . Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses.
      Patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising oral pomalidomide on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
