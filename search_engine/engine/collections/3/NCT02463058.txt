    
      In order to physiologically evaluate a new BC protective garment for the Israeli police use
      under exercise-heat stress conditions, 10 young and healthy civilian volunteers will
      participate in this study.

      The subjects will undergo 5 experiment days: Recruitment day, one day of acclimatization to
      heat, and 3 days of performing experiment protocol, each day dressed with different
      protective garment (Protective garment in current use + NBC mask, new BC protective
      undergarment + standard combat uniforms, new BC protective undergarment + standard combat
      uniforms + NBC mask).

      Core (rectal) and skin temperature and heart rate will be monitored continuously, liquid
      balance will be recorded.the physiological heat strain will be assessed and compared between
      the different protective garments.
