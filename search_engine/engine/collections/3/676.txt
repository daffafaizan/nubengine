radiation effects renal enlargement in the mousethree hours following unilateralnephrectomy weanling female cf-1 mice weresubjected to local abdominal or total bodyexposure to either 500 or 600 r.  othergroups were given 1350 r to half the abdomenwith and without prior nephrectomy.  signifi-cant decreases in renal weight gain comparedto controls were obtained in the 600 r totalbody group and in the locally irradiated ani-mals given 1350 r.  when the renal weightchanges are compared on the basis of theratio of renal weight to body weight in percent, an increase from .64% to .95% is seenin animals subjected to nephrectomy alone.the final value in all of the irradiated andnephrectomized groups was similar, rangingfrom .93% to 1.0%.  the results suggest thatirradiation in these dose ranges does notexert a direct inhibitory effect on renal weightincrease but it limits body weight gain whichinfluences kidney weight.
