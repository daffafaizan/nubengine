      incidence of CLE is increasing. CLE is often refractory to care. There is limited scientific
      evidence to support specific therapies.

      PrT and PRP show promise as effective therapy for CLE that can be performed in the primary
      care setting. Pilot-level RCTs of PrT and PRP for CLE have reported large absolute effect
      sizes. Findings from invitro and animal studies are consistent with the results of clinical
      trials and suggest that both therapies can improve clinical outcomes and modify disease in
      CLE. However, prior research is limited by lack of methodological rigor, non-validated
      outcome measures and lack of integrated multidisciplinary outcome measures.

      Positive trends in the proposed study would suggest the effect size of PrT and PRP for CLE,
      and allow the calculation of a robust sample size to power an R01 study, and pilot test the
      use of an integrated set of outcome measures. Statistically significant positive results on
      clinical, biomechanical and radiological outcomes would demonstrate that PrT and PRP can
      treat, modify the disease of and may be a cure for CLE. Such findings would provide enormous
      benefits to patients through improved quality of life, reduced pain and disability, and to
      industry and society at large through reduced workers' injury claims and absenteeism.
