    
      A prospective, open-label, unicentric phase II trial, historical control and non-randomized.

      The study will try to evaluate the efficiency and safety of the experimental treatment using
      a cell therapy product (tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine) in patients
      with glioblastoma multiforme in whom a gross total resection is feasible. Patients will
      receive standard first-line therapy (surgery before radio-chemotherapy) along with the
      experimental treatment. The experimental treatment consists in subcutaneous vaccination with
      a suspension of autologous dendritic cells (cells from the same patient) produced by cell
      culture from monocytes from the same patient extracted by leukapheresis and pulsed with a
      lysate of the patientÂ´s tumoral tissue. The first four vaccines will be administered on a
      monthly basis, concomitantly with the standard chemo and radiotherapy treatments, the next
      four vaccines, every other month and the four last vaccinations every three months.The
      results obtained will be compared with those of an historical control study, where patients
      received a standard treatment without the experimental vaccine.
