    
      We propose a prospective study to investigate the combinational effect of radiotherapeutic
      dosimetric parameters [mean lung dose and percentage of lung volume receiving at least XGy
      (Vx)] and biological parameters
      [interleukin-1α(IL1α),interleukin-1β(IL1β),interleukin-6(IL6),interleukin-7(IL7),transforming
      growth factor beta (TGFB)] and manganese superoxide dismutase(MnSOD) in predicting radiation
      pneumonitis, fibrosis, and radiation esophageal injury. Eligibility included pathological or
      cytological proven thoracic cancer,ECOG performance status [PS] 0-2, no prior thoracic RT or
      chemotherapy,no distant metastasis and signed informed consent prior to study entry.

      Basic pre-treatment information will be collected, which included ECOG PS, UICC/AJCC
      stage,primary lesion site, history of smoking/coexisting lung disease/surgical resection, and
      pulmonary function test of FEV1/VC/DLCO. Computed tomography [CT] of the whole lung in
      treatment position. Blood test of IL1α,IL1β,IL6,IL7,TGFB and MnSOD by ELISA will be done
      before and weekly during RT. RT must be given by photon energies >=6MV. Radiation lung and
      esophageal injury will be assessed according to common toxicity criteria adverse effect
      version3.0 [CTCAE-3.0] during RT and in every follow up visits. Genomic DNA is obtained from
      the blood drawn during RT. Chi-square test, T test, analysis of variance, logistic
      regression, and proportional hazard ratio method will be used to investigate whether the
      parameter(s) can be effective in predicting radiation related sequelae.
