      data during standard clinical care of adolescent bariatric patients (younger than 18 years)
      who were operated (RYGB or SG) for weight loss.

      Medical, psychological, behavioral, fitness and social data will be collected by medical
      personnel guided by checklists and prepared questionnaires. All non-invasive and invasive
      examinations will be performed following the existing protocol of the multidisciplinary group
      at the hospital (no alteration of normal standard care). Data regarding family environment
      (birthdays, weight, length, medication, comorbidities, smoking and education of parents and
      siblings) will also be obtained from caregivers of the patients.
