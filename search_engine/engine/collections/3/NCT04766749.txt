      release of the drug balloon for a long time and even lead to the occurrence of adverse
      events.RIPC was found to improve tolerance to myocardial ischemia in patients.

      At the same time, it can open collateral circulation and improve the tolerance of myocardial
      ischemia in patients.Therefore, this study designed a parallel control group. The
      experimental group was treated with RIPC before PCI, while the control group was not treated
      before PCI.

      The operator does not know whether the patient has undergone RIPC or not, and the operator
      decides the time of drug balloon release according to the symptoms of the patient during the
      operation.Angiography was performed at 6 months, and QCA was used to determine late lumen
      loss at 1 year.The 1-year incidence of target lesion failure events was assessed.
