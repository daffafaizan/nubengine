      detrimental to the kidneys via PVI monitoring. To detect the kidney injury, so-called kidney
      troponin NGAL ,which gives earlier information than creatine in renal ischemic injury, was
      used.

      Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery, 18 to 75 years old, planned
      surgery duration longer than 2 hours, were included in this study. Patients were divided into
      2 groups with respect to their fluid resuscitation, Group 1: goal directed fluid therapy via
      PVI monitoring Group 2: conventional fluid resuscitation. Blood samples were drawn from both
      groups for NGAL measurement before CO2 insufflation (T0), and at 6th(T1) and 12th(T2) hours
      after CO2 insufflation. At the end of the surgery, sugammadex was given to all patients for
      reversal of muscular blockade.
