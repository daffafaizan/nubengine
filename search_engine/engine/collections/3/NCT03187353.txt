      focusing and concentrating. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a
      stimulant medication called VyvanseÂ® (lisdexamfetamine; LDX) on executive functioning, such
      as attention, processing, organization, and memory, in women who are experiencing executive
      functioning difficulties after having undergone a risk-reducing bilateral
      salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). This study involves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see how
      LDX affects brain chemistry while undergoing two 6-week trials of the study drug and placebo
      capsules.

      Individuals wishing to participate in this study are medically healthy women between the ages
      of 35-58 years old who have undergone a risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)
      within the previous 15 years. Participants must have been premenopausal before undergoing
      RRSO (meaning they were having regular periods). They also must not have undergone radiation
      or chemotherapy in the past year.

      Furthermore, participants must not suffer from a mental illness, including Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and must not have a recent history of drug abuse.
      Additionally, participants must not suffer from a fear of small, enclosed spaces
      (claustrophobia), and not have any implanted medical devices such as a pacemaker, orthodontic
      braces, or shrapnel. They must not have a history of seizures, uncontrolled hypertension or
      known renal impairment.
