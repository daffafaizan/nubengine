      days to three years, diagnosed with fever without source, in 26 participating French and
      Swiss emergency departments, during a 36-month period.

      During one period, all children will receive usual care. In a second period, the DIAFEVER
      algorithm will be applied in half of the clusters, and in the remaining clusters, children
      will still receive usual care.

      Then in the last period of one year, all centers will apply the new PCT-based algorithm.

      At day 15 after the first consultation, data concerning death, intensive care unit admission,
      disease-specific complications, diagnosis of bacterial infections and proportion of
      antibiotic treatments will be assessed by questioning parents by use of an online electronic
      case report form or a phone call. The endpoints will be compared between the two groups by
      using a mixed logistic regression model adjusted on clustering of participants within centers
      and period within centers.

      To perform complementary studies, a biocollection will be proposed to parents when blood
      tests will be indicated.
