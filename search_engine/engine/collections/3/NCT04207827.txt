      sustainable interventions to prevent and reduce smoking in families over their reproductive
      life span. So, the purpose of this project is to adapt, enhance, and test the implementation
      feasibility and efficacy of an evidence-based pregnancy and postnatal smoking relapse pilot
      mHealth intervention. The scientific relevance of this research project is given by: 1)
      testing a cultural-adapted version of the iCoach mobile application for the prevention of
      smoking uptake after birth. 2) The cultural adaptation will be obtained based on the existing
      literature regarding the adaptation of preventive interventions for substance use. 3) The
      iCoach app intervention is enhanced with SMS-delivered content addressing the dyadic efficacy
      for smoking cessation aiming to improve both partners' skills to work together as a team to
      prevent smoking uptake after birth.
