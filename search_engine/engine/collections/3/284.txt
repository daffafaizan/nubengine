454. xanthogranuloma (xanthoma) of choroid plexus.  the origin of foamy(xanthoma) cellsa case of a 3-month-old infant with intense pro-liferation of choroidal epithelium with foamy cells, asecond similar case in a 9-month-old infant with gener-alized glycogen storage disease and a case of a 51-year-old male with bilateral xanthogranuloma of choroidplexus and proliferation of the choroidal epithelial cellsare discussed.  the pathogenesis of the foamy xanthomacells in the stroma of the choroid plexus, particularly,is discussed.  the authors believe that the origin of foamycells and the mode of formation of such a xanthogranulomacan be explained by the proliferative capability and thephagocytic activity of the choroid epithelium.  choroidalepithelial cells can be regarded as fixed macrophageswhich becomes wandering phagocytes after detachment.disintegration of these foamy cells then releases thelipid content into the interstitium and provokes a re-sponse of macrophages and multinucleated giant cellsof the foreign-body type.  hemorrhage is also consideredas a factor involved in the formation of xanthogranuloma.
