      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of
      TACE for patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B especially for those
      with tumor larger than 10 cm. Our previous prospective study also revealed similar results of
      large HCC patients treated with TACE. Recently, the results of our preliminary pilot study
      suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve
      the survivals for HCC with large HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective
      randomized control to demonstrate the superiority of HAIC over TACE.
