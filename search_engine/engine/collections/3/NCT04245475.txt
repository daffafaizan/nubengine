      pain stimuli) in healthy college students.

      The primary aim is to conduct a randomized, controlled study with healthy volunteers to
      explore whether interacting with virtual objects in VR via a high tech interactive VR system
      makes VR significantly more effective/powerful compared to a less immersive passive VR
      system, vs. No VR, for reducing pain during quantitative sensory testing.
