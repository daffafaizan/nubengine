      variety of different methods are used to provide analgesia/anesthesia for oocyte collection.
      Our unit has always used an oral pre-medication followed by intravenous fentanyl during the
      procedure but this doesn't seem to provide adequate analgesia for some women. The aim of this
      study was to compare the addition of intravaginal local anaesthetic injection versus saline
      placebo to our usual analgesia regime to see whether less intravenous fentanyl was required
      and whether the women experienced less pain during oocyte collection.
