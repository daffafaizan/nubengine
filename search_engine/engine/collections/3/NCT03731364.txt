    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      design study evaluating, in a pilot stage of the study, up to 3 ascending dose level cohorts
      each evaluating a single dose of CA-008 vs. placebo injected/instilled during an elective
      TKA. Up to 54 subjects will be randomized in the pilot stage. During the second stage of the
      study, subjects will be randomized to one of either 2 or 3 CA-008 dose levels (to be
      determined) or placebo.
