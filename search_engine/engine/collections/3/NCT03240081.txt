      in a new location is experimental. Pain with sex is a common problem experienced by women
      after menopause and the relationship of pain to sexual difficulties is well established. The
      cause has been assumed to be atrophy and the location has been assumed to be the vagina.
      Recent focused studies have shown that the location of pain is the vulvar vestibule and
      usually not the vagina. This study will look at pain before and after therapy with estrogen
      when only the vulvar entryway area is treated. This will be a study focused on sexual
      dysfunction in postmenopausal women.
