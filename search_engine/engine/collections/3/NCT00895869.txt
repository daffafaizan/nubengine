    
      Infants undergoing routine eye screening at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Neonatal Intensive Care
      Unit are to be recruited. Infants will be excluded if they require mechanical ventilation or
      analgesic medication or if they have moderate/severe neurological impairment. The first
      screening examination for each baby was included. Infants' eyes will be examined by both
      WFDRI and BIO with eyelid speculum by 2 experienced pediatric ophthalmologists in random
      order. Observations will be video-recorded during examinations to generate a pain score
      (premature infant pain profile) for both WFDRI and BIO. The pain scores, heart rates, oxygen
      saturations and time taken for WFDRI and BIO will be compared using paired t tests.
