      disease and cancer), the main cause of disability in adults and the second most frequent
      cause of dementia syndromes. The annual incidence of stroke in the general population is
      approximately 0.2%. The risk of stroke increases with age.

      Globally 15 million people are affected each year and 5.5 million die every year for this
      reason (20% in 30 days and up to 40% in a year from getting ill). In Poland, the incidence of
      stroke is around 175/100,000 in men and 125/100 in women.It is assumed that the cause of
      sudden cerebral insufficiency is mainly the embolism coming from the newly formed wall clot
      forming at the site of the atherosclerotic plaque rupture.

      In recent years, the role of inflammatory factors is associated with the occurrence of severe
      atherosclerotic complications such as stroke or heart attack. Cytokines are glycoproteins
      that are released by activated cells of various tissues. They have a significant impact on
      the inflammation processes, they control all phases of the immune response. Interleukin is
      one of the cytokine groups. This study aims to find a relationship between level of IL 33
      concentration and the size of the stroke and neurological deficit.

      Blood will be collected on the first and seventh days of stroke for examination of Il 33,
      blood morphology and hsCRP
