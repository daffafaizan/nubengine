      radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in locoregionally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with a satisfactory tumor response (complete response
      or partial response) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with Docetaxel and Cisplatin
      treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or tomotherapy (TOMO).
