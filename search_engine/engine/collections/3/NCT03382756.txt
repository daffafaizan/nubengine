    
      This clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of food on pharmacokinetics of CKD-337.

      Sixteen male subjects are divided into two groups. A group of subjects are administered a
      single oral dose of CKD-337 after ingesting high fat meal and the other take same
      investigational product (IP) in fasting condition. Then their blood is drawn on a fixed
      schedule to analyse bioavailability of CKD-337.

      Finishing the first treatment period, the two groups switch food conditions and initiate the
      second period. The group of people that were administered CKD-337 with food are then dosed
      the same IP in fasting condition, and the other group undergo vice versa.

      Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 7 days.
