    
      The proposed study is a non-randomized, prospective, single arm study. The safety and
      effectiveness of the Sonablate treatment in subjects with locally recurrent prostate cancer
      will be evaluated with regard to freedom from biochemical failure and disease recurrence
      following HIFU treatment.

      Men with histologically confirmed, locally recurrent, organ-confined, non-metastatic
      prostatic adenocarcinoma two or more years following EBRT, PSA ≥0.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL, 40
      to 85 years of age, and with initial staging of T1c-T2 prior to radiation, who meet the
      criteria for salvage treatment, will be enrolled.

      This pivotal study will cover pre-treatment through the 12-month post-treatment follow-up
      visit (8 visits).

      A 5 year extended follow-up study will be conducted annually for the 2nd-5th years post
      treatment (4 additional visits).
