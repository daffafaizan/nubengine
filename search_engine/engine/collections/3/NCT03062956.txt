      monitored for safety and tolerability over a 7 day period. After the 28 day screening period,
      the eligible subject will be admitted to the clinical site and will receive a single dose of
      study drug or placebo. Subjects will be confined to the clinical site for five days (Day -1
      to Day 4) and will return to the clinic on Day 7 for a safety follow-up.
