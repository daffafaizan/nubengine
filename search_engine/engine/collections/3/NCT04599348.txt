      because of overharvesting, most ginseng is no longer have optimal levels of the active
      ginsenosides. A new technique has been developed to restore the level of active ginseng
      components those found in the wild ginseng used in earlier studies. This is available in a
      form called HRG 80 Red Ginseng.

      The study is an open pilot study to explore whether this treatment would be helpful for
      improving clinical function and symptomatology in chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.
      Current clinical experience is suggesting that it may be.
