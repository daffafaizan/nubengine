    
      We designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to test:

        -  The effectiveness of blood pressure reduction among patients with acute ischemic stroke
           (within 48 hours of onset) on the primary outcome, a combination of death within 14 days
           after randomization and dependency (modified Rankin scale â‰¥3) at 14 day or at the time
           of discharge, if that occurred before 14 days.

        -  The effectiveness of blood pressure reduction among patients with acute ischemic stroke
           (within 48-hours of onset) on secondary outcomes:

             -  Combination of all-cause mortality and dependency over 3, 12, and 24 months of
                follow-up

             -  Combined vascular disease events over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up (vascular
                deaths, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary
                revascularization, hospitalized or treated angina, hospitalized or treated
                congestive heart failure, and hospitalized or treated peripheral arterial disease)

             -  Recurrent fatal and non-fatal stroke over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up

             -  Neurological functional status measured by NIH Stroke Score and modified Rankin
                scale at 14 day or discharge after randomization, and over 3, 12, and 24 months of
                follow-up

             -  All-cause mortality over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up

             -  Duration of initial hospitalization

             -  Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure within 24 hours and over 7 days,
                and 14 days
