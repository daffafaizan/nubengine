      this phenomenon has not been studied in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Our purpose is to
      understand if CMV number increases in monocytic leukocytes during chemotherapy and how is the
      host response to that changes.

      Virus load will be studied by quantitative PCR, host response will be studied by measuring
      patient's anti-CMV IgG, CMV-associated symptoms, serum IFN-r and TNF-a.
