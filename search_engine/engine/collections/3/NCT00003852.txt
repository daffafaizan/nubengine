      pathological complete response, or surgical complete response) to intensive chemotherapy with
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell support in patients with cisplatin resistant germ cell
      tumors. II. Determine duration of complete response and survival of these patients after this
      therapy. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine
      the pharmacokinetics of this regimen and the relationship between these pharmacokinetics,
      nature and duration of response to treatment, and the toxic effects in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive epirubicin IV over 15
      minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1, then filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ)
      on days 5-14. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected on days 13 and 14. This course
      is repeated beginning on day 15. Patients then undergo a three part intensification regimen.
      Part I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and thiotepa IV by continuous infusion on days
      34 and 35. PBSC are reinfused on day 38, and G-CSF SQ is administered from day 39 until blood
      cell counts recover. Part II: Patients receive etoposide IV over 2 hours, ifosfamide IV over
      4 hours, and carboplatin IV over 6 hours on days 62-66. PBSC are reinfused on day 70, and
      eventually G-CSF begins on day 71. Part III: Patients receive etoposide, ifosfamide, and
      carboplatin on days 90-94 as in part II. PBSC are reinfused on day 98 and eventually G-CSF
      begins on day 99. Patients are followed every month for the first year, every 2 months for
      the second year, every 6 months for the third and fourth years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
