      ill adult patients with acute air flow obstruction. Patients were randomized to nebulized
      albuterol alternating with levalbuterol every 4 to 6 hours. Group A received albuterol 2.5 mg
      alternating with levalbuterol 0.63 mg. Group B received albuterol 2.5 mg alternating with
      levalbuterol 1.25 mg. All patients received nebulized ipratropium bromide 500 micrograms with
      each treatment. Heart rate and cardiac rhythm were continuously recorded before and 15
      minutes after finishing each treatment. Any new rhythm abnormalities between treatments were
      also recorded.
