      morbidity worldwide. Rapid admission and acute interventional treatment combined with modern
      antithrombotic pharmacologic therapy frequently establish complete reperfusion and acutely
      stabilize the patient, but the reperfusion itself adds further to the damage in the
      myocardium compromising the long-term outcome. At present, remote ischemic conditioning (RIC)
      is the most promising adjuvant therapy to reduce reperfusion injury in patients with STEMI.
      However, myocardial remodeling continues for several weeks after a myocardial infarction.
      Recent animal studies have shown that RIC may also help the heart muscle recover if applied
      every day during the month after a heart attack.

      The CORIC-MI trial is a single-center, randomized, controlled, parallel group, and open-label
      trial, with blinded evaluation of the endpoints.The primary objective of the trial is to
      evaluate whether comprehensive (per, post plus delayed) remote ischemic conditioning (CORIC)
      as an adjunctive therapy in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PPCI) can improve left ventricular function and remodeling at 30 days assessed
      by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) for a minimum follow-up period of 12 months.
