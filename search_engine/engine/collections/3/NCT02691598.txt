      complications of acute pancreatitis which determine disease severity and outcome.It is
      concluded that systemic inflammation in SAP characterized by the endocrine release of
      different cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6 and many others. These cytokines correlate
      with the severity of pancreatitis.

      Neuroendocrine pathways, such as the sympathetic nervous system or parasympathetic nervous
      system, in turn, have some impact on the immune systems, through a-2 adrenoreceptor
      stimulation or the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride is a
      high selected a-2 adrenoreceptor agonists.Some studies have shown that Dexmedetomidine
      Hydrochloride could improve the outcome of sepsis patients and decrease the development of
      organ failure.

      The investigators aim to use Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride to decrease the activity of
      sympathetic nervous system,thus relieve inflammation response.
