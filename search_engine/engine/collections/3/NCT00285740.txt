      and their overworked physicians often lack psychiatric backup that may make inquiring about
      psychological issues problematic. In the psychiatric community, awareness of the need for
      depression intervention in the primary care clinic has been recognized for many years and
      several treatment models exist. This study will attempt to use one such model, i.e.
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) using a group format and tailoring its use for an epilepsy
      clinic population.
