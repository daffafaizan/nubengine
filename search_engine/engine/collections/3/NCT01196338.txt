      immobilization and non-weightbearing after initial treatment of unstable ankle fractures.

      The primary objective of our randomized control trial is to determine if early protected
      weightbearing and ankle range of motion post open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for
      unstable ankle fractures improves the rate of return to work and functional outcome compared
      to postoperative ankle immobilization in a non-weightbearing cast.

      Our secondary objective is to determine the rate of adverse events (wound healing, infection,
      hardware failure) with early weightbearing and ROM comparable to rates with traditional
      post-op ankle immobilization.
