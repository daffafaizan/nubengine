      compared to the population of the same age. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact
      of the intervention program based on the Health Belief Model involving education, guidance,
      counseling, case management and surveillance, on participation in breast cancer screenings,
      health beliefs and behaviors in women with high risk of breast cancer.

      This study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial with parallel group design. First
      degree biological relatives (mother, daughter, sister) of breast cancer patients who are
      diagnosed with breast cancer at or under the age of 50 and who apply to the Oncology
      Department will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control group.

      The content of the Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program created for the Intervention Group
      was planned according to the Health Belief Model (HBM) theoretical framework. The
      interventions based on HBM were carried out according to the OMAHA nursing interventions
      categories used in the field of Public Health Nursing (training, guidance, counseling, case
      management and surveillance). Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program (BirCarrePro) is a 12-week
      program that includes six interviews. The first intervention in this group will begin with a
      60-minute face-to-face individual training. After the first face-to-face interview, phone
      calls will be made in the second, third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth weeks. Pre-tests and
      post-tests will be completed by the participants via electronic questionnaires. Follow-up
      questionnaires will be applied by repeating the post-test at the 24th week. In the control
      group, post-test will be applied 12 weeks after the pre-test, and follow-up questionnaires
      will be applied 24 weeks after the pre-test.
