      1000 high-risk individuals. However, false-positive results and radiation exposure are
      relevant disadvantages deserving accurate consideration. Candidates for screening can only
      make an autonomous decision if doctors inform them correctly about the pros and cons of the
      method. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate, whether doctors understand the test
      characteristics of lung cancer screening.

      Methods: In a randomized trial, 556 doctors (members of the Austrian Respiratory Society)
      will be invited to answer questions regarding lung cancer screening based on online case
      vignettes. Half of the participants will be randomized to the group 'with data' and will
      receive the correct solutions in advance. The group 'without data' will have to rely on prior
      knowledge or estimate. Primary endpoint will be the between-groups difference in the
      estimated number of deaths preventable by screening. Secondary endpoints will be the
      between-groups differences in prevalence of lung cancer, prevalence of suspicious results,
      sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, and false negative rate. Estimations
      will also be compared to actual values from the literature.
