      post-therapy/post-operative dysphagia leads to morbidity (pneumonia) and mortality following
      surgery. The aim of this study is to reduce pathologic aspiration and pneumonia in the
      perioperative period by providing an oral care and oral hygiene education to patients
      preoperatively. Patients enrolled in the study will be given a dysphagia screening
      questionnaire, an oral care package and oral hygiene education. Patients who screen positive
      for dysphagia will be referred to Speech Pathology for evaluation. The rate of postoperative
      pneumonia will be determined for those who participate in the study and will be compared to
      retrospective patient data from our institution.
