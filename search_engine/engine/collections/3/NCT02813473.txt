    
      The SYNTAX III REVOLUTION Trial is a multicenter, all-comers trial (either isolated
      unprotected left-main or 3-vessel disease with or without left-main disease and candidate for
      either CABG or PCI treatment). In SYNTAXIII REVOLUTION a diagnostic coronary angiography and
      a diagnostic coronary Multislice CT are performed to allow the Heart Team to assess the
      optimal revascularization strategy. In a normal hospital setting the angiography is
      considered standard of care. The multislice CT can already also be part of the diagnosis and
      is at the discretion of the physician. After the images of both modalities are available, the
      patient will no longer participate in the trial. Next step is randomization of Heart Team A
      and Heart B to the sequence of availability of images, i.e. randomizing whether Heart Team A
      will review the angiography first or the multislice CT and, automatically, Heart B the other
      modality. The Heart Teams need to make a decision between surgical or percutaneous treatment
      according to either the conventional angiography or the multislice CT angiography assessment.
      In addition, the incremental value of FFRCT in the decision making of the Heart Team arm
      allocated primarily to the assessment of the MSCT (CT first algorithm) will be a secondary
      endpoint. No intervention to the patient's treatment takes place
