      Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes improved basic preventive measures to reduce
      bacterial transmission and infections for patients undergoing surgery.

      Patients undergoing planned oncologic gynecological and plastic surgery will be entered as
      dyads into a worksheet each day that will rank and select the optimal cases. The research
      assistants consent both patients in the dyad to the study while they are in the Day of
      Surgery Admissions area. The first patient in the dyad will receive the bundle, which
      includes patient decolonization methods, environmental cleaning in the OR, a hand hygiene
      system located on the IV pole for the anesthesia provider, and intravascular catheter and
      syringe tip disinfection practices. The second patient in the dyad will receive usual care.
      Both patients will be surveyed by obtaining swab samples at the beginning and end of the
      surgery using the OR PathTrac kits. The OR PathTrac kits are obtained from and analyzed for
      S. aureus isolates by RDB Bioinformatics. The OR PathTrac software (RDB Bioinformatics,
      Omaha, NE 68154) uses algorithms to guide analysis of the S. aureus isolates and to identify
      transmission events. Transmission stories are processed by the software to generate
      transmission maps that identify improvement successes and failures. It also identifies
      actionable steps to improve the bundle. The perioperative infection control team then uses
      this information to continually optimize the bundle, and the software to measure the effect.
