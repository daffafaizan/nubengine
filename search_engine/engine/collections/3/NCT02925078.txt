      based upon the mucosa thickness (<2 mm and ≥2 mm). A signed written informed consent will be
      obtained from all subjects. Subjects will not be screened or treated until an informed
      consent has been obtained. Patient information will be protected according to the privacy
      regulations of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
      (HIPAA).

      The enrolled patients will receive implants with 1 mm polished collar. Implants will be
      restored at 4 (±1) months after placement. Outcome analyses will be performed until 1 (±1
      month) year after loading and clinical and radiographic parameters will be evaluated to
      compare clinical outcomes between groups. The primary outcome is implant marginal bone loss
      and probing depth from clinical and radiographic measurements.
