    
      HIV-wasting syndrome, which is characterized by severely debilitating anorexia and weight
      loss, is of particular concern because it can exacerbate the primary illness and is
      associated with a poor prognosis. Attempts at maintaining body mass through the use of
      megestrol acetate and dronabinol, two anti-cachectic drugs, may prolong survival.

      Fifty-six patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms, as follows: high-dose
      megestrol acetate alone; dronabinol alone; high-dose megestrol acetate combined with
      dronabinol; or low-dose megestrol acetate combined with dronabinol. Treatment continues for
      12 weeks. Patients are evaluated for toxicity, preliminary evidence of response (e.g., weight
      gain), and steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug therapies.
