      treatment for gastric cancer but most patients present with locally advanced disease and
      recurrence is common after surgery. Many patients (35%) will have early recurrence within 6-9
      months of surgery indicating the need for more aggressive upfront therapy in these subjects.
      In addition, the majority of patients will ultimately have recurrence and 5 year survival
      rates are 35-40% despite aggressive therapy.

      The ability to combine immunotherapy with pembrolizumab gives the potential to increase
      therapeutic options while continuing standard of care chemotherapy. The particular use of
      maintenance therapy may delay or eliminate the growth of residual micrometastatic disease and
      lead to durable disease control. Additionally, this study provides the foundation for
      substantial correlative work to define tumor and patient characteristics that may predict for
      response to pembrolizumab in gastric cancer.
