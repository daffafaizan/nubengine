      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose of ZD 1839 (gefitinib) when given concurrently with
      cranial radiotherapy.

      II. To determine if ZD 1839, given orally on a daily basis starting at the time of
      conventional radiation therapy (RT), may improve the overall survival of adults with
      newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme, compared with historical controls,
      stratifying by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status.

      III. To determine, in a multi-institutional setting, the feasibility and toxicity of
      prescribing ZD 1839.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Whether ZD 1839 also improves progression-free survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of gefitinib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive gefitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 weeks. Beginning 1 week after
      initiation of gefitinib, patients undergo radiation therapy QD 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
      Treatment with gefitinib continues for up to 18 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter.
