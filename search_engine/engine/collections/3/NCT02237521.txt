      environment will be explored during fasting and hyperglycemic conditions in three randomised
      examination days.

      At a preceding screening day, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be performed to determine glucose tolerance and the
      distribution of muscle and adipose tissue. The study will be carried out on three separate
      days differing with respect to the hormones infused: GLP-1, GIP or placebo (saline) which are
      double blinded. The patients will meet from an overnight fast and an infusion of one of the
      hormones is initiated. At the same time labeled glucose will be infused to determine the
      endogenous hepatic glucose production. A glucose infusion is adjusted according to frequent
      plasma glucose measurements to maintain fasting glucose level. After 2 hours a steady state
      of the tracer is achieved and a 2 hour hyperglycemic clamp, 3 mmol/l above fasting glucose
      concentration will be started. The tracer infusions are continued during the hyperglycemia.
      After the 4 hour clamp an arginine bolus will be administered to measure the ability to
      increase the secretion of insulin and glucagon.
