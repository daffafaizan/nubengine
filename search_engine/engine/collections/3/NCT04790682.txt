      at least 1 mutation at NGS on the tumor tissue will ultimately be enrolled in the study, to
      have the possibility to follow the mutation using ctDNA. Main consent will be obtained after
      results of the NGS and before initiation of pembrolizumab. Computed Tomography (CT)-scan
      imaging will be done every 9 weeks as part of routine care practice. Blood specimens will be
      taken with EDTA tubes or streck tubes at the time of puncture for pembrolizumab infusion at
      baseline before starting treatment, at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and then every 6 weeks. Blood
      immunomonitoring will be done before starting the treatment, at 6 weeks and at 18 week. An
      additional measurement will be performed if treatment is stopped before the end of the study.

      - Optional blood samples will be realized to analyse the degree of activity of the plasmatic
      lymphocytes.
