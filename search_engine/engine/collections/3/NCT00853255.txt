      an increasing number of humans are infected. H7 influenza transmission usually occurs in
      humans when they are exposed through direct contact to infected poultry or surfaces and
      objects contaminated by infected poultry feces. A pandemic occurs when a new influenza
      subtype emerges that infects humans, causes serious illness, and spreads easily between
      humans. The development of a safe and effective vaccine is necessary. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a one-dose administration of the live,
      attenuated AI virus vaccine, H7N3 (6-2) AA ca Recombinant (A/chicken/British
      Columbia/CN-6/2004 x A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca).

      This study will last approximately 180 days. Participation in this study includes one 12-day
      hospital stay in an isolation unit at the University of Rochester Vaccine Evaluation
      Isolation Unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, NY. All participants will receive one
      dose of vaccine in nasal spray form at study entry. Participants will be admitted to the
      isolation unit 2 days prior to vaccination. A targeted physical exam, vital signs
      measurement, and nasal wash will occur daily following each vaccination until discharge.
      Participants will be discharged after two consecutive nasal washes on or after Day 7 are
      negative. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected timepoints throughout the study.
      Follow-up outpatient visits will occur approximately at Days 28, 56, and 180. A nasal wash
      and adverse events evaluation will occur at each follow-up visit.
