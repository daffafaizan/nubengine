      may be associated with poor clinical outcomes. A lot of treatment options for HCV have
      rapidly evolved over the past 5 years and various treatment choices for patients with
      advanced CKD are currently available.1 The reappearance of HCV infection months or years
      after sustained virologic response (SVR) may be due to the persistence of HCV in tissue cells
      in spite of being undetected in serum. This situation is known as occult hepatitis C
      infection (OCI).2 OCI is now a challenging entity in the field of post hepatitis management
      and follow-up. OCI is described when HCV-RNA is detectable in liver and/or peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with undetectable serum HCV-RNA. To our knowledge ,
      this is the first research to issue this problem in dialysis patients after treatment with
      direct acting antiviral drugs.
