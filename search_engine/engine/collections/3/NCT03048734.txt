      Determine:

        1. The feasibility of Southern California registry as an effective measure to recruit
           African American men to participate in a new research program.

        2. If men will comply with the study procedures including Actigraphy and ambulatory blood
           pressure monitors.

        3. The within subject coefficient of variation for repeated measures of nocturnal blood
           pressure by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, vertical activity at night by
           Actigraphy monitors.

        4. Whether the ambulatory Blood pressure itself affects the sleep pattern on Actigraphy.

        5. Nocturnal systolic blood pressure and nocturnal vertical activity are higher in men with
           self-reported nocturia â‰¥2 at night than in men with no reported nocturia.

      Purpose:

      Obtain key pilot data to show feasibility and document the reproducibility of the proposed
      measurements.
