      Bristow-latarjet surgery to reduce complications associated with screw fixation. However,
      these studies are not comparative studies, and their data are relatively incomplete.

      Purpose: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes using screw fixation vs
      suture-button fixation.

      Study Design: Retrospective comparative case-cohort study Methods: Patients who underwent the
      modified arthroscopic Bristow-Latarjet surgery between June 2015 and February 2018 were
      selected. Shoulders were separated into two groups based on surgical fixation method.
      Radiological results on 3D CT scan and clinical results were assessed preoperatively,
      immediately after operation, and postoperatively at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and during the
      final follow-up.
