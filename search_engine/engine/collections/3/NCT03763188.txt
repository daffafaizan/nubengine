      withdrawal criterion, according to a recent French study (citations). A rate greater than
      1.35 mmol/kg/d would predict a weaning success of 97.1% at 1 week. This criterion is
      influenced by the use of diuretics, and is easily accessible and achievable. Daily urinary
      urea excretion is representative of the recovery of renal function. The French study
      establishing this new withdrawal criterion was monocentric and retrospective. However, we
      changed our practices as soon as we became aware of them.

      French multicentric (Bordeaux University Hospital, Libourne, Pau and Bayonne Hospitals)
      study, before and after:

        -  Period before: patients who were dialysed in the intensive care units of Bordeaux,
           Libourne, Pau and Bayonne, from November 2013 to November 2015.

        -  Period after: patients selected prospectively in the 4 hospitals.

      When diuresis > 100 ml/d, an urinary ionogram is realized daily. Measurement of urinary urea
      excretion every day. Ablation of the catheter as soon as daily urinary urinary excretion >
      1.35 mmol/kg/d.

      Measurement of daily urinary excretion the following 3 days.
