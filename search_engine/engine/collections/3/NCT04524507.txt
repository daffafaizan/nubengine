      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with less than 8 days of
      symptoms. Eligible participants will receive institutional-guided standard-of-care (SOC) and
      ABO-compatible convalescent COVID-19 plasma (CCP). The CCP units will be tested for the
      presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and pre-assigned as high-titer (CCP1) or
      standard-titer (CCP2) in a 1:1 randomization. Participants and clinical investigators will be
      blinded to the CCP titer group identities.

      The investigators plan to enroll approximately 56 participants (28 in each group) at
      UNC-Chapel Hill. Participants will be randomized within 48 hours of admission to a COVID
      service and will receive convalescent plasma within 24 hours of randomization. At least two
      units of CCP will be transfused 4-24 hours apart on study Day 0. If available, a third unit
      may be administered. All participants will undergo a series of safety and efficacy
      assessments pre-, during, and post-transfusion. Samples for research will be collected on Day
      0 through Day 28, unless previously discharged. Additionally, after discharge, participants
      can provide longitudinal samples collected at 1, 3, and 6-month timepoints after the
      infusion.
