    
      This is a prospective, single-arm clinical trial of patients diagnosed with oral candidiasis.

      designed clinical study. All study participants will have positive oral Candida detection
      with sufficient oral Candida burden to meet the laboratory criteria for a diagnosis of oral
      candidiasis (â‰¥ 400 CFU/mL of salivary Candida, a standard that was established by Dr. Epstein
      at the Department of Oral Diagnosis and Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the
      University of Washington in 1980). All study participants will receive treatment for oral
      candidiasis using nystatin suspension (Brand name: Mycostatin), and be instructed to rinse
      the mouth with (6ml of 600,000 U/mL) nystatin suspension, followed by spitting out the
      suspension, at the frequency of four times per day, for a period of 1 week. The oral
      microbial changes including fungal and cariogenic bacteria (e.g. S. mutans) will be monitored
      immediately (within 7 days) and 3-months following the completion of the 1-week Nystatin
      application. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria and methods see below.
