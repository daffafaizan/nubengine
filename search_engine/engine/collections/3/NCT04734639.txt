      induced once by dietary restriction alone and once by a mixed deficit (50% by exercise and
      50% by dietary restriction) (compared with a control condition). 18 adolescents with obesity
      will be asked to randomly complete three experimental sessions: i) one control session (CON);
      ii) one session with a dietary-induced energy deficit (Def-EI); iii) one session with a mixed
      deficit (50% by exercise and 50% by dietary restriction) (Def-Mixed).

      Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed at dinner time. Appetite feelings will be
      assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be
      assessed.
