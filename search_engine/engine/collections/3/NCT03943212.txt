      cardiovascular events and mortality. Dialysis recovery time (DRT) is a measure of
      post-dialysis fatigue. Internationally, it has been found that more than a quarter of
      maintenance HD patients report >6 hours of DRT. The interventions showing the most
      improvement in DRT involve increases in treatment time, suggesting that post-dialysis fatigue
      may be in part related to the rate of solute clearance. Solute clearance rate is just one
      part of extending dialysis time, and its effect on DRT in patients undergoing typical-length
      dialysis sessions is not known. There is scant evidence to guide blood flow rate
      prescriptions aside from meeting clearance targets. Blood flow rate reductions are
      easily-implementable interventions that would slow solute clearance rates and may have an
      effect on post-dialysis fatigue.
