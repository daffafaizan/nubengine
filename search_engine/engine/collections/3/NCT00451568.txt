      mg/d) or OCP (150 mg desogestrel 30 microgram ethinylestradiol) or combined treatment
      (metformin+OCP).

      Patients attend a biochemical and physical examination at study inclusion and at 12 months.
      Patients attend for registration of side effects and compliance after 6 months of study
      duration. Safety tests are performed at all three visits and include weight, blood pressure,
      HbA1c, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and white blood cell count. Pregnancy tests are performed
      by the participants each month. Patients are given general advice on lifestyle intervention.
      Patients are excluded if they initiated medical treatment with possible hormonal and
      metabolic effects during the intervention period. Lifestyle intervention is allowed. Laser
      treatment is offered to patients with moderate or severe facial hirsutism and patients are
      allowed to shave/wax. The patients accept not applying cosmetic treatment 3-4 days before
      attending for evaluation at the clinic.
