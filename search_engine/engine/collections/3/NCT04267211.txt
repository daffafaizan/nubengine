      enrolled for the 'Standard' consult. These women will receive a questionnaire 6-24 hours
      after their consult. Then 140 participants will be randomized to either the 'Standard
      Upgrade' or 'Illustrated Upgrade' arm. Randomization will additionally be stratified based on
      estimated gestational age. These participants will receive an upgraded consult implementing
      the 'Prenatal Consult Bundle' which emphasizes the parents' role and follow up, with or
      without an illustrated handout. These participants will receive the same questionnaire 6-24
      hours after their consult. Demographic information collected will include maternal age,
      gravidity, use of magnesium, social support and health literacy. All data will be collected
      to assess whether either arm of the consult 'upgrade' reduces anxiety or improves knowledge
      retention after the prenatal consult. Analyses will be completed using Statistical Analysis
      Software (SAS) using appropriate statistical testing.
