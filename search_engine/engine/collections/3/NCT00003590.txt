        -  Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with unresectable benign
           meningioma treated with hydroxyurea.

        -  Assess the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea twice daily for 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study within 13 months.
