      inability to metabolise sugar properly. A diet and treatment with tablets are enough for some
      patients, while others may need insulin injections. In the long term, high blood sugar levels
      may cause problems to the small and large blood vessels in the body. This is complicated by
      nerve, renal and retinal damage, as well as increased risks of cardiac and vascular events
      (such as strokes or heart attacks.) It appears that diabetes is more common and more severe
      in French Guiana than in other parts of France. It seems that the types of diabetes found
      here are more variable than those found in France, and that patients tend to be diagnosed at
      a later stage. We would this like to better understand diabetes and its evolution in French
      Guiana.

      This research is aimed at diabetic patients and it is being carried out in the Andr√©e Rosemon
      Hospital Centre, the Ouest Guyanais Hospital Centre as well as in other Primary Healthcare
      Centres. At some point in the future, some private health centres may also invite their
      patients to take part in this study.
