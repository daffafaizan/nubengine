      knee, and other joint pathology. The equipment used for ultrasound is much less expensive and
      cumbersome than that of an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging. The equipment we will use for
      the analysis of sound produced by the body itself is an order of magnitude less expensive
      than ultrasound; such as a laptop computer with currently available software and an
      inexpensive transducer. Analysis of sound has proved useful in Pulmonology and Cardiology. We
      believe sound analysis will provide a useful yet inexpensive tool for primary care physicians
      as well as musculoskeletal specialists.

      Phase 1: Establish the normal sound patterns emanating from the uninjured knee; we will look
      for the influence of age, height and weight.

      Phase 2: To record and analyze the preoperative sound patterns from the knees with pathology,
      known by MRI and arthroscopy, then compare them with the normal sounds from Phase 1.
