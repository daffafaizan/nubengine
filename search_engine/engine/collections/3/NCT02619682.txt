      I. Evaluate the toxicity of the use of ixazomib (ixazomib citrate) and lenalidomide as
      maintenance therapy after autologous transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the ability to deliver the planned therapy.

      II. Assess initial response to therapy.

      III. Evaluate the median time to disease progression.

      IV. Assess overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 30-120 days after completion of autologous transplant, patients receive ixazomib
      citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days for 2 courses, followed by lenalidomide
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28 for 2 courses. Treatment repeats, alternating after every 2
      courses, for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
