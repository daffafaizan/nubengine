      to dento-alveolar trauma or caries. In some cases, the temporary filling procedure is
      required until the endodontic treatment is completed. The temporary filling material should
      be biocompatible and bacteriostatic. The aim of this study is through a randomized clinical
      trial, double blind, split-mouth, evaluate the success rate (contamination rate, periapical
      lesion relapse and the presence of exudate between the treatment's sessions) of
      endodontically treated teeth that required filling with temporary material. The composition
      of the temporary filling material (cement (Based on calcium hydroxide; and based on mineral
      trioxide aggregate) will be evaluated. Twenty participants with at least two teeth with the
      need of endodontic treatment will be selected. The teeth will be randomly divided into 2
      different groups according to the temporary filling material composition (Based on calcium
      hydroxide; and based on mineral trioxide aggregate). Data will be collected, tabulated and
      submitted to statistical analysis.
