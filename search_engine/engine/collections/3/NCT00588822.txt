      dose and schedule as an initial cycle of therapy, followed by a re-evaluation at 6 months.

      If progression in neuropathy (as indicated by an increase in the Neuropathy Impairment Score
      (NIS) of greater than or equal to 10 or a modified Rankin Score increase of > 1 grade) the
      patient was off study. In addition, if the subject elected to pursue other active treatment
      including but not limited to plasmapheresis, high-dose intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIG),
      chemotherapeutic agents, or high dose corticosteroids, or if conditions in the exclusion
      criteria develop subsequent to enrollment, the subject was off study.

      If the neuropathy is stable or responding (NIS of < 10 or a modified Rankin Score increase of
      < 1 grade) the patient would have received Cycle 2 of rituximab followed by a reevaluation at
      12 months.

      The study had a Simon Optimal two-stage Phase II design (α 5%, β 10%, π0 5%, π1 20%). The
      minimum clinically important response rate was 20%. The first stage was to include 21
      patients and the second stage a total of 41 patients. The treatment would be rejected if
      there were fewer than 2 responders at the first stage or fewer than 5 responders at the
      second stage. The treatment would be accepted for further study if there were at least 5
      responders out of 41 patients.
