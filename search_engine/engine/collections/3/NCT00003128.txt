        -  Determine whether the addition of paclitaxel to ifosfamide improves length of survival,
           progression free interval and response rate when compared to ifosfamide alone in
           patients with advanced, refractory or recurrent carcinosarcoma (mixed mesodermal tumors)
           of the uterus.

        -  Determine the toxicity of ifosfamide with paclitaxel in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to GOG performance
      status (GOG 0-1 vs GOG 2-3) and randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive ifosfamide IV daily for 3 days every 21 days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV on day 1 and ifosfamide IV on days 1-3 every 21
           days. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is given subcutaneously beginning on day 4 until granulocyte
           count is greater than 2,000/mm3. Paclitaxel therapy may precede or be given concurrently
           with ifosfamide.

      Treatment for both arms continues for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for an additional 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 166 patients (83 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 5.5 years.
