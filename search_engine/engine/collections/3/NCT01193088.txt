      expression, along with identifying new forms of CMT which have not been genetically
      determined. Subjects who are eligible will either have CMT type 1A (CMT1A) or an unknown form
      of CMT. Blood will be drawn and sent to the University of Miami where they receive the coded
      sample and process it through exome sequencing. Subjects will be told that this is optional.
