      occurs at an estimated rate of 300,000 events per year in United States, accounting for 5.6%
      of annual mortality22. A significant proportion of patients treated with ICDs (implantable
      defibrillators) will receive shocks due to recurrent VT, resulting in increased mortality8.
      As a result, catheter-based ablation has emerged as an effective treatment for recurrent VT.
      However, no study has assessed the impact of a step-wise approach on the outcome of catheter
      ablation of VT. The investigators propose a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized,
      single-arm trial to evaluate the impact of a step-wise approach to catheter ablation on
      ventricular tachycardia recurrence. Given the increasing use of catheter ablation in patients
      with recurrent ventricular tachycardia, this study will answer a critical question regarding
      the impact of a step-wise approach on the inducibility of VT at the end of the procedure and
      clinical recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias at 6 months.
