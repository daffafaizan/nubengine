      the coordination of care for these patients following inpatient or Emergency Department
      discharge from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Since 2012, the NFC has constructed an
      integrated team care approach, logging about 2000 post-discharge encounters with Medicaid or
      patients without insurance. The NFC model has evolved over the past 2 years in response to a
      need to address mental as well as physical health needs and to interface with community
      resources to address social determinants of health that might otherwise lead to frequent
      re-admission. By working with clinical partners and public payers like Medicaid and County
      Care, the NFC has also worked to transition patients to accessible primary care medical homes
      that will provide behavioral, physical, and preventive care. The current study will provide
      the first reliable evaluation of the clinic's impact on re-admissions, care coordination, and
      costs. This research will allow us to assess the value of the NFC and similar models of care
      for providing a more coordinated care approach that results in better treatment outcomes for
      urban poor populations.
