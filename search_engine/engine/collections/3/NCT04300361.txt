      c.1236G>A, c.2846A>T and c.1679T>G) can significantly reduce severe fluoropyrimidine-related
      toxicity. However, these 4 variants are most likely not predictive for toxicity in patients
      of non-Western descent. In this study the DPYD gene of patients of non-Western descent will
      be sequenced to identify novel variants that could be associated with a reduced DPD enzyme
      activity and an increased risk of developing severe fluoropyrimdine-related toxicity.
      Additionally, the ability to predict if a DPYD variant is possibly deleterious by a
      recombinant model systen (DPYD-varifier) will be studied.
