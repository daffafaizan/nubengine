    
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of agenT-797, an unmodified,
      allogeneic iNKT therapy, in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), requiring
      mechanical ventilation, and with moderate to severe ARDS as determined by the Berlin
      definition.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will employ a standard 3+3 dose escalation
      design of agenT-797. All patients will receive a single infusion of agent-797. Patients will
      also receive other treatments and supportive care per discretion of the Principal
      Investigator. Once the maximum tolerated dose of agenT-797 has been cleared in Part 1, Part 2
      of the study will be opened and enroll eligible patients in the Expansion Cohort.

      Details of the analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan.

      A Safety Monitoring Committee will be established to assess safety and decide on escalation
      to next Cohort and expansion dose, as well as any protocol modification to include less
      severe cases.
