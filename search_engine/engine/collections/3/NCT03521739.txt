      pulse velocity measurement and cardiovascular outcomes have existed currently, the sample
      sizes are relatively small and the data on Chinese populations are lacking.Therefore, a
      multicenter prospective registry planned to recruit more than 100 000 patients aged 50 years
      old and older was carried out in China. This primary purpose of this study was to evaluate
      the association of synchronous four-limb blood pressure and pulse wave velocity with
      cardiovascular events in chinese populations. The secondary purpose was to evaluate the
      incidence rate,prevalence rate, value of diagnosis for peripheral arterial occlusive disease,
      and to follow up the effects of revascularization on cardiovascular events.
