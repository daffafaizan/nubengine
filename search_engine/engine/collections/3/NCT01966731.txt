        1. To assess the feasibility of conducting a prospective research study using hydroxyurea
           therapy for SCA in sub-Saharan Africa (including adherence to monthly clinic visits and
           laboratory assessments, and medication compliance)

        2. To monitor the safety of hydroxyurea therapy, specifically documenting hematological
           toxicities (cytopenias) and serious infections (bacterial and malarial)

        3. To evaluate the benefits of hydroxyurea therapy, using both laboratory (e.g., fetal
           hemoglobin, hemoglobin, white blood cell count) and clinical parameters (e.g., pain,
           hospitalization, growth)

        4. To investigate the effects of hydroxyurea dose escalation on laboratory and clinical
           parameters
