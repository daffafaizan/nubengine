    
      Objective: To describe phenotypes and find genes causing a developmental and potentially
      blinding eye condition, uveal coloboma.

      Study population: Families where more than one family member has uveal coloboma. Both
      affected and genetically informative, unaffected members of the family will be recruited.

      Design: Observational study.

      Outcome measures: Clinical examination, genetic mapping and mutation identification.
