    
      The purpose of the study is to explore the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of
      ascending doses of CDX-0159 in patients with Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria who remain
      symptomatic despite treatment with antihistamines.

      There is a screening period of up to 2 weeks, a 12-week double-blind treatment period and a
      12-week follow-up period after treatment. Patients will receive multiple doses of CDX-0159 or
      placebo as add on therapy to their antihistamine.
