      ketoacidosis (DKA) in children. The cause of cerebral edema during DKA is not well
      understood. Recent studies suggest that it may result from lack of adequate blood flow to the
      brain during DKA, before treatment starts. Brain injury, resulting in edema, may occur before
      treatment because of lack of adequate blood flow to the brain and additional injury may occur
      when adequate blood flow is re-established during treatment (called reperfusion injury).
      Because additional injury may occur during treatment, it is important to understand whether
      the rate of administration of intravenous fluids, and, therefore, the speed of reperfusion of
      the brain, is related to the degree of brain swelling and injury. Most current treatment
      protocols indicate that intravenous fluids should be administered slowly, but it may be
      possible that brain injury and swelling might be lessened if adequate blood flow is
      established more quickly.

      In this study, researchers will use magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to compare two different
      rates of fluid administration during DKA treatment in children. The investigators will use MR
      imaging to measure brain swelling and metabolism at three time points-twice during treatment
      and once after recovery from DKA-and will compare these measurements to determine which fluid
      administration rate has more beneficial effects on brain metabolism and brain swelling.

      The study's researchers hypothesize that more rapid re-establishment of blood flow to the
      brain (via more rapid administration of intravenous fluids) will result in less brain
      swelling and injury than slower rehydration with delayed re-establishment of adequate brain
      blood flow will.
