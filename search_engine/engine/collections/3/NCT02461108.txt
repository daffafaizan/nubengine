      participate in a study in which a 10% price difference between nutritious and less nutritious
      foods was introduced. and then framed as a subsidy, tax, or a combination of a tax and
      subsidy. To determine whether or not the framing of the price difference influenced
      purchasing behavior, the difference was framed as a subsidy on nutritious foods, a tax on
      less nutritious foods, and a combination of a tax and subsidy on less nutritious and
      nutritious foods, respectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the general impact
      of this price difference on purchases of nutritious and less nutritious foods, and whether or
      not the framing of the price difference had a differential effect on behavior.
