    
      1. by selecting the aged 1 to 3, 100 cases of patients with elective surgery, were randomly
           divided into the propofol group (P group), the etomidate group (group E), all the 50
           cases, healthy age 50 cases of children (blank control group, group C) were studied;

        2. the children's intelligence equation of the People's Republic of China
           neuropsychological test: P, E group of preoperative 1 day before operation,
           postoperative day 3, 3 months neuropsychological test, observe and evaluate patients
           POCD is happening; Correspond to the experimental group in the same period in group C,
           i.e., the first test (1 d) preoperatively, 4 days after the second test (3 d) after
           operation, 3 months after the third test (3 months), observed and compared with
           experimental neuropsychological testing of variation;

        3. laboratory of brain damage index determination: extract internal jugular venous blood in
           preoperative and perioperative finish 5 ml, with double antibody immune sandwich
           enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method of determination of serum S - 100 beta
           protein levels, rapid determination of amino acid analyzer, plasma Glu, GABA levels;

        4. statistical analysis: use SPSS13.0 statistical software for children with cognitive
           function before and after operation and serum S - 100 beta protein and serum Glu, GABA
           levels change research results should carry on the analysis of variance, P < 0.05 for
           statistical significance.

        5. clear rapid development period of infants receive propofol and etomidate on plasma
           according to beta protein after intravenous anesthesia and Glu, GABA expression and its
           relationship between the change of cognitive function and clarify all according to
           propofol and etomidate intravenous anesthesia on the brain is in rapid development
           period of infant short-term and long-term postoperative cognitive function and its
           possible mechanism, the influence of safety for children suffering from anesthesia, and
           to provide theoretical basis for the rational use of drugs.
