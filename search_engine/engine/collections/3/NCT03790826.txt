      profile pancake shaped balloon versus the ovoid balloon of a traditional Foley catheter. The
      Kohli Atraumatic Catheter has a short, opened-ended tip that minimally protrudes through a
      patented low-profile donut-shaped balloon. The combination of the low profile and reduced tip
      length prevents the catheter from contacting the bladder walls and thereby minimize
      disruption of the bladder surface mucus layer and trauma to the urothelium - theoretically
      reducing the chance of bacterial invasion. A trial in which sheep were randomized to a
      traditional indwelling Foley catheter or a prototype Kohli Atraumatic Catheter demonstrated a
      dramatic reduction in both bladder wall trauma and edema. The ulcerated area dropped from
      7.2% to 1.8% (75%) and the edema from 26.9% to 13.0% (52%).

      Statistical Analysis To compare the effects of 2 catheter types, data will be analyzed using
      the general linear models tools from SAS/STAT software and presented as means Â± standard
      error of the mean. The model will include 2 catheter types, inflamed vs non-inflamed areas,
      and their interactions.
