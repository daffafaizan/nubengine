      carbon monoxide monitoring offered to all eligible smoking patients presenting for cancer
      treatment to the NCCC at our main Lebanon campus and our very rural St. Johnsbury campus.
      Subjects will not be randomized and study will not be blinded. Cessation rates among the
      intensive tobacco treatment will be compared to usual care, matched historical controls, and
      to patients who refuse all tobacco treatment program elements.
