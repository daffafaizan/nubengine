      with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The hypothesis to be tested is that tolcapone will
      be more effective and well tolerated in adults with OCD compared to placebo. The proposed
      study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder where current
      treatments are often ineffective.

      The primary aim of this application is to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled
      pharmacotherapy trial using tolcapone in 20 participants with OCD. The study will consist of
      two phases: a 2 week active treatment phase with tolcapone, a one-week wash-out phase, and a
      2 week placebo phase. The subjects will be randomized to either receive tolcapone or placebo
      treatment in the first 2 weeks, and the other during the remaining 2 week phase.

      This will be one of few studies assessing the use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of OCD
      in adults. Assessing the efficacy and safety of tolcapone will help inform clinicians about
      additional treatment options for adults suffering from this disorder.
