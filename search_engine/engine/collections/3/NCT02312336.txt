      number of factors are thought to contribute to cardiac dysfunction14, 15. These include : 1.
      reperfusion arrhythmias; 2. microvascular obstruction or no-reflow phenomenon; 3. myocardial
      stunning and 4. cardiomyocyte apoptosis. It is estimated that ischaemia/reperfusion injury
      occurs in > 30% of patients and is associated with reduced myocardial salvage and poor
      prognosis16-18. Ischaemia/reperfusion injury may account for up to 50% of the final infarct
      size9.

      Deep hypothermia (< 30 Â°C) has long been used in protecting the heart during coronary artery
      bypass grafting and heart transplantation. Intermittent antegrade or retrograde infusion of
      cold cardioplegia appears to reduce myocardial ischaemia and improves outcome19, 20. Deep
      hypothermia however can cause spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and impaired cardiac
      function and its application is limited to the unconscious patient.
