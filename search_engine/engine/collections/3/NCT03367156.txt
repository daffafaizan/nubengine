      I. Compare the intensity of dyspnea (numeric rating scale [NRS]) in the dexamethasone arm
      with that in the placebo arm at week 1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the effects of dexamethasone with those of placebo in terms of personalized
      dyspnea response (based on a personalized dyspnea goal), unpleasantness of dyspnea, other
      symptoms, health-related quality of life, respiratory physiologic function, and adverse
      effects at week 1 and week 2, as well as the intensity of dyspnea at week 2.

      II. Identify predictive markers of dyspnea response to dexamethasone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-14 and dexamethasone PO BID on days 15-28
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 28 and 42.
