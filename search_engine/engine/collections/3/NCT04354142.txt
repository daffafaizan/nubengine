      wellness. Helping individuals to understand what they are eating can empower them to better
      manage their diseases. For example, the growing number of youth living with Type 1 Diabetes
      Mellitus (T1DM) struggle with carbohydrate counting, an essential and daily aspect of their
      lives, because of required reliance on memorization and numeracy skills. Effective
      carbohydrate counting has been demonstrated to improve blood glucose control, while
      inaccurate carbohydrate counting results in more variable blood glucose. Concerns related to
      carbohydrate counting accuracy can also limit food choices, provoke anxiety, and decrease
      quality of life. Since there is no cure for T1DM, enhancing patients' ability to understand
      and apply carbohydrate counting is an important part in helping them manage their condition
      most effectively.

      iSpy is a novel healthcare application that addresses an important clinical need by
      facilitating carbohydrate counting using pictures or voice recognition. Proprietary
      algorithms adjust for portion size and identify hidden carbohydrates (such as in ketchup or
      other condiments) and quantify the amount of carbohydrates in a meal.
