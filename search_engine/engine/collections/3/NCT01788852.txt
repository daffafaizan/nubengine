      cervical and anal cancer. Prevalence and incidence of HPV infection among young adults who
      are sexually experienced is high. No data exist for HIV-positive adolescents in regards to
      HPV infection, cervical and anal intraepithelial neoplasia. This study will compare the
      prevalence of HPV infection, intraepithelial neoplasia and E6/E7 biomarker at cervical and
      anal sites among perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, behaviorally HIV-infected adolescents,
      and HIV-negative adolescents.
