      thing to do is the right identification of HER2 in breast tumor cells. The advantages and
      disadvantages of IHC and In-Situ Hybridization (ISH) for the detection of HER2 status is
      still disputable. It is generally agreed on that HER2 study should be applied on all invasive
      breast cancer participants. It can be used together with IHC which measures HER2 protein
      expression or ISH which assesses HER2 gene amplification. With regard to IHC, the
      inconsistency of sensitivity and specificity of marketed antibodies, differences in
      interpretation and technical artifacts cause problems in diagnosis on occasion. There is not
      enough study on reasons which cause the consistence and discrepancies between laboratories in
      HER2 detection with IHC method.
