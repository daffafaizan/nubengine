      diseases. Nicotine dependence may prolong the exposure to these toxic substances. The Central
      Nervous System (CNS) is consisted by a large amount of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAS)
      from omega-3 serie. Omega-3 takes part in several actions, including the modulation of
      dopaminergic neurotransmission. In its deficiency is detected a hypofunctioning of the
      mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway, related to the reward system, involved on the context of
      nicotine dependence. Treatment using dietary supplementation with omega-3 shows improvements
      in several diseases, including mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. The
      investigators hypothesis is that supplementation with these fatty acids can restore the
      levels of omega-3 and could decrease nicotine dependence. Objective: Investigate a possible
      association between increased serum levels of omega-3 and the reduction in nicotine
      dependence. Material and Methods: In the clinical study, placebo controlled, double-blind,
      parallel, randomized, will be administered to 60 volunteers: placebo or fish oil for 90 days.
      Psychometric assessments will be carried out, measurements of serum levels of PUFAS, levels
      of carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine in plasma will be done for monitoring the clinical
      course. Data Analysis: Repeated measures (ANOVA) for the dependent variables (dependency,
      anxiety, depression, motivation, compulsion, dosage of PUFAS, exhaled CO and cotinine) and
      independent (groups and time) to check for significant differences. If so, a second ANOVA
      with covariates will be conducted. Significance is p <0.05 in all analyzes.
