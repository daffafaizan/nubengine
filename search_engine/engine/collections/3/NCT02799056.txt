      combination with the presence / absence of alveolar-interstitial syndrome evaluated through
      chest ultrasound may predict successful extubation in adult patients hospitalized in the
      intensive care unit. The investigators' null hypothesis is the fraction of diaphragmatic
      shortening in combination with the presence / absence of alveolar-interstitial syndrome
      evaluated through chest ultrasound can not predict the success of extubation in adult
      patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit.

      The alternative hypothesis is the fraction of diaphragmatic shortening in combination with
      the presence / absence of alveolar-interstitial syndrome evaluated through chest ultrasound
      may predict successful extubation in adult patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit.

      The study is a no experimental study of diagnostic test, prospective with longitudinal
      capture. The study will consist of two parts: the first with the aim of finding the values
      best combination of sensitivity and specificity compared to extubation success for
      diaphragmatic shortening fraction and the number of lung quadrants with lines B. In the
      second part the study will make the prospective validation of these values.
