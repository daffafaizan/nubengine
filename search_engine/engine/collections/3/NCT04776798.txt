      taping will result in the recovery of increased internal rotation and decreased shock
      absorption during weight-bearing, which is stated to cause pain. The study aims to
      investigate the effects of biomechanical tapping in combination with a home exercise program
      on LBP.

      Participants with a diagnosis of LBP and bilateral increased flexible foot pronation will
      divide into two groups (Biomechanical Taping (BT) group or Placebo Taping (PT) group). Tape
      applications will repeat twice per week, for 4 weeks. And also a home-based exercise program
      will apply to both groups.
