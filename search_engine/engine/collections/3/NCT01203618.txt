      the lack of hormonal overproduction from the tumor. Non-functioning macroadenomas are > 1 cm
      in size that can cause progressive visual loss, headaches, and symptoms of pituitary
      dysfunction (hypopituitarism and/or hyperprolactinemia). Initial treatment for these type of
      tumors is trans sphenoidal surgical resection. In cases where the outcome is incomplete
      surgical resection of the tumor, repeat surgery and external beam radiation therapy may be
      performed. Previous clinical work suggests there may be a role for a folate receptor in the
      treatment of non-secretory, pituitary adenomas. MORAb-003 is a monoclonal antibody that has
      the potential to be an effective agent against resectable, non-functioning pituitary
      adenomas. MORAb-003 has been shown to be well tolerated. This study allows the opportunity to
      determine if therapy with farletuzumab is effective and safe.
