2379. in-vitro culture of pulmonary tumors in hamsters caused by adenovirus 12it is known that the adenoviruses 12 and18 provoke malignant tumors in thenew-born hamster.  the authors made a studyof the histogenesis of these tumors andexamined the specific changes brought aboutin the cells by the virus infectionmalignancy, presence of viral antigen, reactionsto superinfection.  when new-bornhamsters were inoculated in the chest withadenovirus 12, malignant tumorsdeveloped in one or two months, in 16 animalsout of 22.  these tumors presentedan epithelial aspect and were of bronchiolo-alveolarorigin.  they were transplant-able in vivo; if they were cultured in vitro,they consisted in the first few cultures ofmacrophages, fibroblasts and epithelium.in subsequent passages, there was aprogressive disappearance of the macrophagesand fibroblasts.  in some cases, theculture after seven passages was of a purelyepithelial nature, and when it wasreimplanted into hamsters at this time itgave rise to the rapid development of anepithelial tumor.  in the tumor cultures,no adenovirus could be demonstrated.nor could cultures of the pulmonary tumors,or cultures of normal hamster lung beinfected with adenovirus.  it appears that thelung of the hamster in an organotyp-ical culture constitutes a means of choicefor the malignant transformation ofadenovirus 12.
