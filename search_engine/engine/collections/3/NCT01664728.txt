      evaluate the safety and efficacy of continued administration of abiraterone acetate in
      patients who have completed 12 cycles of abiraterone acetate treatment in Clinical Study
      COU-AA-001 and continue to receive clinical benefit from this treatment. Patients will
      continue with the same dose regimen administered at the end of Study COU-AA-001 and will
      receive a low-dose glucocorticoid daily. Patients will be followed every 3 months for disease
      progression and survival for up to 3 years following study entry. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication.
