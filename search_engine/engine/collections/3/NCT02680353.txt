      efficient analgesia in patients with thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, carotis
      end-arterectomy. The present study is aimed to investigate the intraoperative hemodynamic
      responses, anesthetic and analgesic consumption, and postoperative recovery quality of
      bilateral superficial cervical plexus block in patients with total thyroidectomy. After
      approval, patients enrolled in the study is invited to complete the Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale questionnaire. Patients are divided into two groups by computer-based randomization
      technique as control and study group. After standard monitorization, anesthesia induction and
      tracheal intubation, bilateral superficial cervical plexus block is performed to study group
      and no intervention to control group. At the end of the operation all patients received
      paracetamol 1 gr intravenous. In postoperative period, visual analog scale values, opioid
      consumption, presence of nausea-vomiting, anti-emetic usage or any other complications are
      recorded.
