    
      Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD I) is a primary immunodeficiency disease resulting
      from mutations in the gene encoding CD18. Markedly reduced or absent expression of the
      leukocyte integrin component CD18 causes significant impairment in leukocyte mobilization to
      inflammatory sites. Clinically, patients have marked leukocytosis and recurrent infections
      involving soft tissues such as skin, the gastrointestinal tract and gingiva. Death due to
      infections in early infancy is common with the severe form of LAD I (CD18 expression less
      than 0.5%), but patients with the moderate phenotype (CD18 expression 1-10%) may survive into
      young adulthood. To date, therapy consists of antibiotic treatment for infections and bone
      marrow transplantation when possible. LAD I is also a candidate for future gene therapy.
      Recently, it has been shown that in vivo administration of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)
      upregulates CD18 expression in normals and alters leukocyte trafficking. We hypothesize that
      modest increases in CD18 expression in LAD I patients with the moderate phenotype or
      alterations in CD18 independent trafficking could result in detectable clinical changes and
      possible clinical improvement.
