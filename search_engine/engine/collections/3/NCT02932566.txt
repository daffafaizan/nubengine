      medication licensed for the treatment of idiopathic lung fibrosis, for which it reduces lung
      function decline, improves progression free survival and reduces all cause mortality. In
      pre-clinical models, pirfenidone attenuates profibrotic pathways and is associated with
      regression of myocardial fibrosis. Previous studies in HFpEF populations using anti-fibrotic
      medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor
      blockers and aldosterone antagonists have shown some benefit in reaching secondary end-points
      but do not reduce mortality. HFpEF is the final result of a number of specific underlying
      pathological mechanisms, and targeted treatment of these mechanisms has been cited as the
      future approach to further clinical trials. The investigators aim to select a population of
      HFpEF patients with high levels of interstitial myocardial fibrosis as measured on cardiac
      MRI (CMR), and randomise participants to receive pirfenidone or placebo. The primary outcome
      is to detect a significant reduction in myocardial fibrosis as measured on CMR after 12
      months of intervention.
