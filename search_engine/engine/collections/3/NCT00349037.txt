      around the world in seasonal epidemics, killing hundreds of thousands of people and having
      high economic consequences due to healthcare costs and lost productivity. Each year
      governments recommend groups who are at risk of influenza or its complications to receive
      influenza vaccination. Current vaccine supply is not sufficient to meet the demand if this
      recommendation were to be taken up by all. This study will evaluate PowderMed's Particle
      Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) DNA vaccine for influenza as a potential alternative to
      existing vaccine technologies. This study will assess how effective two different PMED
      vaccine combinations are at preventing subjects developing influenza following exposure to
      flu virus 56 days after a single dose of vaccine.
