      there is currently no clinically available method for preventing or overcoming it. To develop
      a therapy able to prevent ABCB1 upregulation and paclitaxel resistance, several ABCB1
      inhibitors have been evaluated in combination with paclitaxel in preclinical model systems.
      Pulsed-dose lapatinib and paclitaxel are synergistic and inhibition of ABCB1 by lapatinib
      increases sensitivity to paclitaxel. Lapatinib is FDA approved, orally available, and
      previously studied in combination with weekly paclitaxel for breast cancer at doses of 1000mg
      to 1250mg daily (7000-8250mg per week). This trial will use twice-daily dosing of lapatinib
      at a starting dose of 750 mg for 2 days (1500mg a day and 3000mg weekly dose), which is less
      than half of the continuous dose and has been shown to achieve plasma concentrations at 48
      hours that are associated with synergy. Therefore, these findings can be translated into a
      novel, well-tolerated, and convenient combination regimen with significant potential for
      clinical activity. This trial will be a phase I dose-escalation study of lapatinib and
      paclitaxel for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which will establish the phase II dose for
      subsequent efficacy trials.
