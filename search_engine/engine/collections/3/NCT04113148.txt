      by nursing staff are carried out to assess a patient's risk of developing a pressure ulcer.

      The aim is to investigate whether non-invasive physiological measurements can be taken from
      patients to predict who might be at risk of pressure ulcers to allow us to intervene and
      reduce the risk.
