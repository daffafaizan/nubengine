    
      EffecT is a prospective, randomized multicenter study to assess whether management of atrial
      fibrillation as well as the early optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy via Home
      Monitoring decreases mortality and morbidity compared to conventional treatment in subjects
      with a standard indication for CRT with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator backup
      (CRT-ICD) and paroxysmal or persistent AF.

      300 patients with a documented history of AF will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to standard
      patient management or AF management and early optimization of CRT via Home Monitoring. The
      patient outcome regarding days lost due to cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular
      hospitalization and inappropriate ICD therapy will be documented during an observational
      period of 1 year.

      Another 300 patients undergoing CRT-ICD implantation without a history of AF will undergo an
      AF evaluation during the first three months of CRT. If a patient shows an AF episode during
      this period, he is eligible for study inclusion. If no AF episode occurs during AF
      evaluation, the patient be treated as screening failure.
