      to changes in the environment, which is known as neuroplasticity. Stroke survivors suffer
      disabling chronic motor impairments that have proven challenging to improve. Increasing
      neuroplasticity using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is a promising approach
      to promote motor recovery in patients with stroke. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) are currently widely used for treatment of depression, but they also have been shown
      to be able to enhance neuroplasticity. A single dose of SSRI has been shown to improve hand
      function in patients with chronic stroke. SSRIs also enhance neuroplasticity in healthy
      individuals, as shown using paired associative stimulation (PAS), a non-invasive method which
      causes the brain's excitability to change. However, the best dose of SSRI to increase
      neuroplasticity is not yet established.

      The purpose of this study is to (1) find the effective dose of the SSRI escitalopram to
      modulate PAS-induced plasticity in patients with stroke and healthy individuals and (2)
      determine the variability of escitalopram's effect on PAS-induced plasticity between
      individuals. We measure neuroplasticity with PAS, which causes the brain's excitability to
      change. During PAS, you would receive electrical stimulation over your wrist and magnetic
      stimulation to their scalp (called transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS) to increase the
      excitability of the motor area of the brain. You will be asked to participate in a screening
      visit and 8 study visits separated by at least 1 week. At each study visit, you will be given
      a single dose of escitalopram (5, 10 or 20) or placebo, and we will measure your brain's
      change in excitability after PAS.
