      metabolic health in animal studies. Data from human studies are limited.

      In this study the investigators will perform an 8-week dietary intervention with SAA
      restriction to characterise the effects on several parameters related to metabolic health
      including body weight, body composition, energy expenditure, lipid profile and gene
      expression profiles in adipose tissue. The aim is to translate findings from previous animal
      experiments to humans
