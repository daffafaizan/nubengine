      Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) using the Hedrocel Cervical Fusion Device, with a
      concurrent, randomized, control group receiving autologous iliac crest bone graft. Success
      criteria include radiographic evidence of fusion, and improvement in pain, function and
      overall quality of life. If shown to be successful, the use of the Hedrocel Cervical Fusion
      Device would eliminate complications associated with harvesting autologous bone graft and
      provide an alternative for those who are unable to provide autologous bone graft from the
      iliac crest.
