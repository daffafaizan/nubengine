      cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Also it is the 7th commonest cancer in Egypt,
      representing 3.47% of male cancers and 3% of female cancers.The Glypicans , a family of
      proteins classified as HSPGs (heparan sulfate proteoglycan) , have been shown to interact
      with a number of growth factors and modulate growth factor activity and are linked to the
      xtracellular side of cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor . Members
      of this large family of transmembrane proteins have been identified in both mammals and
      drosophila: 6 glypicans (GPC-1 through GPC-6) in mammals, and two others in the fly
      .Glypican-3 (GPC3) as one of this family is a protein of about 70 kD . It has multiple sugar
      chains and heparan sulfate modification sites . These proteins (Glypicans) participate in
      organ development by modulating extracellular growth signals and morphogen gradient
      formation, and are involved in human overgrowth and skeletal dysplasia problems .In some
      cancers, they are highly expressed, associated with tumorigenesis, and regulating
      angiogenesis for cancer progression and invasion . Abnormal expression of glypicans has been
      noted in multiple types of cancer. For examples, GPC-1 expression was found to be increased
      in breast cancer tissues and ovarian malignant tumors .GPC-2 is associated with neuroblastoma
      .Expression of GPC-3 was found in high-grade urothelial carcinoma and also reported in some
      non-CNS tumors of the brain.There have been several reports about the clinical usefulness of
      the N-terminal form of GPC3. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods capable of detecting
      the N-terminal form of GPC3 . A study of colorectal cancer tissue speciment shows a
      correlation between expression of GPC3 with the clinicopathologic variables such as the level
      of differentiation, GPC3 was found to be expressed in ( 42.8% ) of the well-differentiated
      tumors, and (50%) of the moderately differentiated tumors, (75%) of the moderately and poorly
      differentiated tumors .Therefore, it was found that the expression of GPC3 was correlated
      with the pathological grade of the tumors .
