      Partnered Research Center for Quality Care (PRC) community partners to co-develop mobile
      interventions to address community priorities. The goal of the workshops was to develop novel
      mobile interventions based on stakeholder input. The specific intervention to be developed
      was determined based on stakeholder input regarding community priorities during the
      workshops. Workshops were audio and/or video recorded to document the process. One of the
      tools used in this process was the Chorus Participatory Mobile Framework created at the
      Center for Health Services and Society at UCLA. Chorus is a web application that allows users
      to easily create mobile (text messaging and interactive voice) applications in real-time
      without requiring any server programming. The investigators used this framework during the
      workshops to develop and test the application in real-time. Participants were also given
      phone numbers to call or text in to the intervention that they co-developed for the purpose
      of testing, providing feedback, and guiding future development.

      In phase 2, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized control trial of the
      B-RESILIENT tool developed during the workgroup phase 1. Investigators will enroll 30 adults
      in South Los Angeles to participate in a randomized, wait-list trial. The study group will
      receive the intervention for 4 weeks, followed by the wait-list group for another 4 weeks.
      Investigators will conduct baseline and follow-up surveys, as well as in-person or telephone
      workgroups, to assess the tool's usability and feasibility for supporting management of mood
      and depressive symptoms.
