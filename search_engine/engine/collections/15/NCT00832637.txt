      have been observed in HCC patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin, inclusing good
      disease stabilization and progression free survival. Cisplatin-gemcitabine enhances the
      cytotoxicity of cisplatin by increasing the formation of cytotoxic platinum DNA adducts.
      Similarly, Oxaliplatin also has DNA cross linkage properties and one could assume that its
      combination with gemcitabine is likely to potentiate the cytotoxicity of the latter.
      Erlotinib has also been reported to result in clinical benefit in HCC and BTC patients. Based
      on these prior findings, we embarked on this phase II protocol of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin,
      and erlotinib in HCC and BTC patients.
