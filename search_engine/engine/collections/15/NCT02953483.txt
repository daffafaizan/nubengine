      Once a decision is made not to transplant the lungs either because of not satisfying ideal
      criteria or in the absence of a potential recipient they will be included in the study.They
      will be ventilated optimally and connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass machine for
      circulating preservative solution through it . Red blood cells will be added to the solution
      either initially or later depending on the group to which it is allocated .Monitoring of
      mechanical and gas exchange function and pathological examination of the lungs will be
      performed at various time points to observe the effect of red blood cells. The lungs will be
      properly discarded at the end of the procedure and will not be used for transplantation.
