      bipolar disorder on treatment compliance, social functioning, and quality of life.

      The study was conducted with 38 bipolar disorder (n=17 intervention group; n=21 control
      group) using a quasi-experimental research design. Patients were evaluated using a pre-test,
      post-test, monitoring test, "Medication

      Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)", "Social Functioning Scale (SFS)", and "World Health
      Organization Quality of Life Instrument Short Form (WHOQOLBREF-TR)." The measurements were
      taken 3 times:

      pre test, post-test and 3-months post-test.
