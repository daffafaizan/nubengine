      and restricted to age > 1 yr). The sweat duct images will be acquired with a CE marked
      skin-imaging device and the sweat rate will be measured using a CE marked pilocarpine
      iontophoresis and collection system. The technologies for both imaging of sweat ducts and the
      measurement of maximal sweat rate have been used safely and without adverse events in our
      prior studies involving HED/XLHED subjects. Furthermore, this study will assess the
      feasibility of developing a non-invasive screening tool that will enable detection of
      clinical signs of XLHED based on an analysis of a two dimensional frontal photograph.
