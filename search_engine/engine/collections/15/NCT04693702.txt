      retinal disorders, including age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, who
      received corneal treatments by a low vision aid device. Patient records will be analyzed to
      determine measures of vision improvement including best spectacle-corrected distance visual
      acuity (CDVA). Analyses will include descriptive statistics and correlation between outcomes
      and baseline characteristics.
