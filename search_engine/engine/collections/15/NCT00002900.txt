        -  Compare the frequency of subclinical congestive heart failure by measuring resting MUGA
           at 5-8 and 10-11 years after randomization in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with
           cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and
           fluorouracil on protocol SWOG-8897.

        -  Estimate the frequency of late cardiac effects (congestive heart failure, cardiac
           ischemic events, and clinical symptoms) in these patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Monitor prospectively the incidence of annual cardiac events between the fifth and tenth
           year after randomization of these patients to these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      The treating physician completes patient cardiovascular and routine history and physical
      examination questionnaires at baseline and yearly. Patients undergo resting MUGA scans at 5-8
      and 10-11 years after registration on protocol SWOG-8897. The first scan must be performed
      within 3 months prior to enrollment or within 1 month after registration on the current
      study, and the second scan must be done in the tenth year of follow-up and within 3 months
      prior to enrollment or 1 month from the anniversary of registration on the current study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients will be accrued for this study. After initial
      accrual is completed, approximately 50 additional patients will be accrued at 10 years.
