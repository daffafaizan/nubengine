    
      There will be 2 parts to the study: a Safety Run-in (Part 1) and the Main Study (Part 2). In
      Part 1 (Safety Run-in), approximately 12 participants will be treated with lenvatinib in
      combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy with either capecitabine and oxaliplatin
      (CAPOX), or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6). Participants will
      be closely followed for dose-limiting toxicities for 21 days after the first dose of study
      intervention.

      In Part 2, up to 778 eligible participants (not including those participating in Part 1) will
      be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy
      (CAPOX or mFOLFOX6) or Chemotherapy alone (CAPOX or mFOLFOX6).

      Participants can receive up to 18 infusions (up to 2 years) of pembrolizumab in the first
      course. Participants may be eligible to receive a second course of pembrolizumab
      (approximately 1 year) at the investigator's discretion.
