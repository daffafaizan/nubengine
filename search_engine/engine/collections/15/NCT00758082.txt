      2 groups. One group will receive a PDA-phone and one month of phone consultations with a
      nurse and a physician. The other group will only have the usual paper support. This study
      compares the evolution of HbA1c in the 2 groups over a period of 3 months. It also assesses
      time spent by nurses and physicians, changes in quality of life, hypoglycaemia frequency and
      weight changes.
