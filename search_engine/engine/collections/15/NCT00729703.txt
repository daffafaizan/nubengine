      a later Sorin Group device offering the same functions. After Enrolment visit but before
      implant, patients will be randomized in two arms according to the parallel study design.
      Whenever possible before implant there will be the first Holter recording for the Tvar risk
      stratification procedure. In case Tvar recording could not be performed before implant it has
      to be performed before patient leaves the hospital post implant in unpaced rhythm.

      The dual-chamber arm will be programmed to 3 detection zones with PARAD+ activated.

      The TDI for the slow VT zone will be set to 500 ms (120 bpm - or in case the resting rate is
      higher than 90 bpm it is recommended to adjust this parameter to: resting rate + 30 bpm) and
      at least one ATP program activated as specified in table 1.

      A VT zone with a TDI of 353 ms (170 bpm) in case of no history of VT or a TDI cycle length
      equalling slowest documented VT interval (spontaneous or induced) plus 50 ms is required. In
      this 2nd VT zone therapies need to be activated in this group.

      AAIsafeR2 mode will be activated with a basic rate of 60 bpm. The single-chamber arm will be
      programmed to optimal detection with Acceleration (Onset), Stability and Long Cycle Search
      (VTLC) activated. A VT zone is requested in this group, with the same programming procedures
      as described above. Therapies will be set according to the clinical judgment of the
      participating investigators but a Slow VT-zone with TDI 500 ms in monitoring setting at least
      is required.
