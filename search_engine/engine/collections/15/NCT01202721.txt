      estimated 280 000 to 560 000 people affected in the Canada. Dilatation of the ascending aorta
      is a common feature in patients with BAV and is a result of inherent vascular abnormalities
      with superimposed effects of age and acquired cardiovascular risk factors. Severe aortic
      dilatation (> 50mm) leads to aortic dissection and premature death.

      Histopathological studies of the aortas in patients with BAVs report similar findings to that
      of patients with Marfan syndrome. Beta Blocker (BB) therapy and more recently, Angiotensin
      Receptor Blocker (ARB) therapy, have been shown to decrease to rate of aortic dilatation and
      be of benefit to patients with Marfan syndrome. There is no such data however in patients
      with BAV and aortopathy.

      Within the context of a randomized clinical trial, the investigators proposed to test the
      hypothesis that BB or ARB will reduce the rate of progressive aortic dilatation in adults
      with BAVs and ascending aortopathy as compared to placebo.

      Design: Multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial of adult patients
      with bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy. Patients who are eligible to take either study
      medication will be randomly allocated to participate in either the BB (atenolol) vs. placebo
      arm, or the ARB (telmisartan) vs. placebo arm. Patients who are ineligible for the BB arm
      will be assigned to the ARB vs. placebo arm and patients who are ineligible for the ARB arm
      will be assigned to the BB vs. placebo arm. Within each arm, all participants will be
      randomized to take either placebo or active medication. The atenolol arm will be up-titrated
      to100mg/day and the telmisartan arm will be up-titrated to 80 mg/day, or to the maximum
      tolerated dose.
