      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer need a temporarily diverting stoma. Recent
      evidence suggests that this is not always necessary. The decision for or against a stoma is
      made by the surgeon in charge and is based on an algorithm of risk factors for anastomotic
      leakage. Many patients receive an adjuvant chemotherapy postoperative. This may influence the
      quality of life e.a. due to mucositis and urge incontinency or the stoma itself.The objective
      of this pilot study is to establish the basis for a randomized controlled trial. The
      long-term goal is to evaluate whether the renunciation of a diverting stoma in patients with
      adjuvant chemotherapy after low anterior resection with TME and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
      leads to a better quality of life without increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with
      rectal cancer. All patients scheduled for low anterior resection of the rectum for rectal
      carcinoma will be invited to participate and prospectively enrolled into the study.
