      Primary

        -  To determine the 4-month progression-free survival in patients with unresectable
           malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with everolimus.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial
           responses) and disease control rate (response or stable disease) in patients with
           measurable disease by RECIST and modified RECIST criteria.

        -  To determine overall survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 years.
