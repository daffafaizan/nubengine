      fungal, and parasitic infections, and those associated with aberrant immunologic responses
      are exceedingly common acute and chronic disorders affecting humans. The pathogenesis of
      these various disorders are being investigated under a number of NIAID clinical research
      protocols. This protocol is an evaluation and long-term follow protocol of such disorders for
      the purposes of maintaining a group of patients on which LCID investigators draw for our
      other various protocols. The patients admitted under this protocol also provide training and
      experience for members of the NIAID infectious diseases and allergy and immunology fellowship
      training programs as well as to provide a mechanism for the members of the Laboratory of
      Clinical Infectious Diseases to maintain their clinical skills. It is anticipated that the
      patients will receive a degree of clinical evaluation, care and monitoring more extensive
      than that generally available and that specimens collected from them can sometimes be used
      for laboratory studies related to inflammatory conditions. Also, this protocol may serve as a
      start point to studies of syndromes or diseases not being addressed by specific protocols,
      and therefore, can be used to evaluate family members of patients with inflammatory
      conditions when appropriate in order to try to understand further the disease before
      embarking in a specific protocol.
