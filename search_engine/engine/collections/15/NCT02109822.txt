    
      Cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-shortening genetic disease, is marked by acute episodes during
      which symptoms of lung infection increase and lung function decreases. These pulmonary
      exacerbations (PEs) are treated with varying antibiotics for varying time periods based on
      needs determined by individual patients, their families, and the health care providers.
      Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines for the treatment of PE published by the Cystic Fibrosis
      Foundation (CFF) in 2009 provided recommendations for treatment and also identified key
      questions for which additional studies were needed.

      Standard treatment for PE involves many facets including selection of antibiotics, duration
      of use, and outcomes that define treatment success. Understanding current treatment practices
      and measures of treatment success are needed before a study can be designed to define optimal
      treatment strategies.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational study designed to prospectively follow
      patients with CF that are initially admitted to the hospital for treatment of a pulmonary
      exacerbation.
