    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of palbociclib when administered along with cisplatin
      or carboplatin.

      II. Establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the tested combinations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of cisplatin, carboplatin.

      II. Obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy of the tested combination regimens.

      III. Conduct PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) correlative analyses using palbociclib trough
      concentration and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibition read-outs in tumor and
      surrogate samples collected on course 1 day 22 (C1D22).

      IV. Assess potential association between tissue-based biomarkers and efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and
      palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and palbociclib PO QD on
      days 2-22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 4 weeks.
