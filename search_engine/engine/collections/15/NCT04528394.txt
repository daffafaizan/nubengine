    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of photon or
      proton combined with carbon ion radiotherapy for newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.Participants will be randomized to 2 arms. Arm 1 participants received photon
      combined with carbon ion radiotherapy (photon: 56 Gy/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15-17.5 gray
      equivalent [GyE]/5 Fx for boost). Arm 2, participants received proton combined with carbon
      ion radiotherapy (proton: 56 GyE/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15-17.5 GyE/5 Fx for boost). Adverse
      events will be documented according to CTCAE v4.03.The response of treatment will be
      evaluated according to RECIST criteria.
