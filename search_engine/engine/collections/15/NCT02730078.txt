      diabetes, as well as social- and work-related relationships. These often lead to emotional
      disorders such as distress, stress, anxiety and depression. Without proper care, these
      patients use more often negative coping strategies and more frequently expect that their
      diabetes will negatively affect their future. A cluster randomised controlled trial will be
      conducted in 10 public health clinics (HC) in Malaysia. These clusters are eligible if they
      are providing standard diabetes care according to national clinical practice guidelines, not
      involved in similar trial and having nurses to be trained to deliver the VEMOFIT educational
      programmes. Pre-stratification by cluster size and geographic areas of the HCs will get
      randomised five HCs to the VEMOFIT group (VG) and attention-meetings group (AG),
      respectively.
