      in mild to severe illness. It is estimated that up to 80,000 deaths and approximately 200,000
      Americans are hospitalized annually due to complications. Vaccination is the most effective
      way of controlling flu and preventing its illness and complications; however, antibody
      responses to seasonal influenza vaccines decrease over time and only target a small number of
      antibody binding sites In 2015, the Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center completed a study
      analyzing human immune responses to a pandemic H5N1, or "bird flu" vaccine, either alone or
      combined with the GlaxoSmithKline adjuvant system 03 (AS03).

      Participants that took part in the 2013 HIPCVAX-010 Systems Biology of Influenza A (H5N1)
      Virus Monovalent Vaccine with and without AS03 Adjuvant study will be enrolled in this study
      to assess the effect of seasonal influenza vaccine in shaping the immune responses. The study
      aims to address important immunological mechanisms that can assist scientists in the creation
      of a universal influenza vaccine.
