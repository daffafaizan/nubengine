    
      Eligible patients (see below) will receive radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the
      initially involved mediastinal lymph nodes to an MLD (Mean Lung Dose) of 20 +/-1Gy,
      irrespective of lung function.

      Other dose-constraints: spinal cord max: 54Gy, brachial plexus (Dmax):66Gy

      In concurrence with chemotherapy, radiotherapy will be delivered as follows:

        -  First three weeks/30 fractions: twice-daily fractions of 1.5Gy, with 8h to 10h as
           interfraction interval, 5 days per week. Total dose: 45Gy/30 fractions

        -  Thereafter: once daily fractions of 2.0Gy, 5 days per week until the target dose has
           been reached.

      In sequential or radiotherapy alone schedules, twice-daily 1.8Gy with an interfraction
      interval of at least 8h will be delivered.

      The radiation doses will be specified according to ICRU 50. Lung density corrections will be
      applied, as well as all standard QA procedures. Technical requirements are the same as in
      standard practice at MAASTRO clinic

      Chemotherapy schedules allowed:

        1. 1-2 cycles induction chemotherapy: any third generation schedule is allowed. The type
           will be registered.

        2. Concurrent part: (day 1 = first day of radiotherapy)

             -  cisplatin - vinorelbine

             -  cisplatin - docetaxel

             -  cisplatin - etoposide

             -  cisplatin - pemetrexed in non-squamous histologies Q 3 weeks; 3 cycles

      When the calculated creatinin clearance is less than 60ml/min, cisplatin may be substituted
      for carboplatin
