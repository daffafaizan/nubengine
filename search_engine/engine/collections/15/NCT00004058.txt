        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of
           12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in patients with relapsed or refractory
           hematologic malignancies or bone marrow disorders.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of TPA in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of TPA on the cellular composition of blood and bone marrow in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8
      followed by 2 weeks of rest. Courses repeat in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of TPA until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients
      experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
