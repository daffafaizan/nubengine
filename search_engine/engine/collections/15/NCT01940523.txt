      total knee replacements who randomly receive either the topical or the intravenous form of
      tranexmamic acid during surgery. Patients in the intravenous arm of the study will receive 1
      gram of tranexamic acid in 10 milliliters of solution prior to inflation of the tourniquet
      and 1 gram of tranexamic acid in 10 milliliters of solution during closure. For patients in
      the topical arm of the study, prior to the release of the tourniquet they will receive 3
      grams of tranexamic acid in 75ccs of solution directly on the site of the incision.

      The primary result measurement will be blood drain output from the knee at 24 hours after
      surgery.
