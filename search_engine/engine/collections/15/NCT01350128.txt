    
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy relative to placebo of PT001
      MDI in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) within
      the range of doses evaluated in this protocol. To this end, each dose of PT001 MDI will be
      compared to placebo with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, FEV1 AUC0-12 relative to
      baseline.
