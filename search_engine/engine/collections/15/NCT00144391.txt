      women and may be important for their health. Among its likely actions in women are the
      building of bone and muscle mass, increase in interest in sex (libido) and effects on the
      mood. Testosterone is commercially available as a hormone replacement therapy for males with
      an absence or lack of testosterone production. Testosterone for males is mainly given in the
      form of shots or skin patches which have certain disadvantages such as pain from shots and
      skin rashes from patches. It is anticipated that this experimental gel application will
      produce levels of the drug in the normal range in women.
