      ambulatory blood pressure clinic at the Western General Hospital. Suitable patients will be
      approached, and if they consent will have pictures of the back of each of their eyes taken.
      These pictures will then be reviewed, with certain measurements taken of the small blood
      vessels which can been seen at the back of the eye. These measurements will then be compared
      to the participants blood pressure readings to see if they might accurately correlate to
      blood pressure.
