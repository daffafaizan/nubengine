    
      On Day 1, following an epinephrine "wash" of the spinal block syringe, eligible subjects will
      receive a single 1.6 mL dose of bupivacaine HCl 7.5 mg/mL within 2 hours prior to the
      surgical procedure as a spinal block. EXPAREL 266 mg in 20 mL (expanded with 70 mL of
      preservative-free sterile normal saline to a total volume of 90 mL) will be infiltrated into
      the surgical site at the end of the surgery prior to wound closure. There will be no local
      co-administration of the two drugs.

      Blood samples for bupivacaine PK analysis will be obtained from subjects at baseline (prior
      to bupivacaine HCl administration for nerve block), 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8,
      12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the beginning of EXPAREL administration, and on Day 14.
