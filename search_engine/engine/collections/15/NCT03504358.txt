      the literature. In this work, we obtained all survival risk factors of ruptured HCC patients
      who underwent partial hepatectomy using multivariable Cox regression analysis. Furthermore,
      we develop and validate a new postoperative scoring system for patients with spontaneous HCC
      rupture based on the these results.
