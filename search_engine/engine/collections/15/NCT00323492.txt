    
      This was a Phase IV, multicenter (in France), open label study. The study was conducted in
      two phases: a comparative randomized phase, which served the primary objective of the study,
      and a follow-up phase.

      Study Phase 1, Day -14 to Week 12: patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to one of two
      groups:

        -  A. Truvada (substitution of their current NRTIs by Truvada [FTC/TDF] with continuation
           of their current NNRTI or PI at the same dose)

        -  B. Maintain Baseline Regimen (continuation of previous HAART regimen, i.e., maintained
           baseline regimen).

      This phase of the study served the primary objective of the study.

      Study Phase 2, roll-over follow-up, Week 12 to Week 48: Patients in the Truvada group
      continued with Truvada + an NNRTI or PI. Patients in the control group could switch their
      NRTIs to Truvada in this phase of the study (Delayed Truvada group).

      Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety during both phases of the study.
