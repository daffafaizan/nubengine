      for tumor drivers, which are then incorporated into the "personal" Drosophila model and
      tested against a library of FDA approved drugs. Fly mortality is used as a surrogate for
      toxicity and increased survival to adulthood; improvements in tumor mutation-linked eye
      and/or wing abnormalities serve to quantify efficacy. This allows rapid and parallel
      screening of FDA approved drugs and subsequent drug combinations. The most efficacious and
      least toxic combinations are tested in xenograft models and a multidisciplinary tumor board
      of experts select the best therapeutic option. The objective is to demonstrate that the
      personalized drosophila model approach is superior to the current standard used in medullary
      thyroid or colorectal cancer.
