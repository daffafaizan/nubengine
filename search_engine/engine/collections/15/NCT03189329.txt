    
      A total of 66 patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery (total duration < 60 minutes) using
      retrobulbar block, who were classified as category I-III according to the ASA (American
      Society of Anesthesiologists) Classification system, who were over the age of 60, and who had
      no cognitive dysfunction were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were as follows:
      contraindication for retrobulbar block, preoperative systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg,
      diastolic blood pressure of above 100 mmHg, uncontrolled diabetes, body mass index ≥ 30
      kg/m2, MMSE ≤ 24, advanced organ failure, or Hb < 9gr/dl.The patients were randomly divided
      into two groups using a sealed-envelope method:

      Group L: Patients undergoing block with lidocaine (n = 33) Group LB: Patients undergoing
      block with levobupivacaine (n = 33) The patients did not undergo premedication in order to
      accommodate the postoperative MMSE evaluation. For intra-operative sedation, remifentanil
      (UltivaR, GlaxoSmithKline, Berntford, UK) was initiated as an infusion at a dose range of
      0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min. The mean arterial pressure and heart rate values were allowed to vary up
      to 20% of the preoperative values of the patients. For this purpose, the remifentanil
      infusion rate was increased or decreased at the determined dose interval.

      Retrobulbar block was performed with 5 ml of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride (AritmalR, Osel,
      Istanbul, Turkey) in Group L patients and 5ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine (ChirocaineR, Abbvie,
      Chicago, USA) in Group LB patients. The block was performed by the same practitioner (fourth
      year assistant of Ophthalmology Department) using inferotemporal approach as described by
      Sanderson using 27 gage disposable needles (Atkinson Retrobulbar NeedleR, Asico, USA).

      Sensory and motor block onset and end times and akinesia score were recorded. The mean
      arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded in the
      preoperative period, at minutes 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60
      intra-operatively, and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes postoperatively in the recovery room.

      . The patients were transferred to the operating table for measurement of bilateral rSO2, and
      preoxygenation was performed for three minutes using 4 L/min 100% oxygen via nasal cannula.
      The basal oxygenation values were determined by taking the average of the last 30 s
      measurements. The rSO2 values were recorded at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30th, 35, 40, 45, 50,
      55, and 60 minutes after retrobulbar block, and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes after the
      completion of the procedure.

      Cognitive functions were assessed by the same technician using MMSE in the preoperative
      period, 40 minutes postoperatively and at 7 days after the operation (short term).Surgeon
      satisfaction was queried at the end of the case and patient satisfaction was questioned at
      the end of day.
