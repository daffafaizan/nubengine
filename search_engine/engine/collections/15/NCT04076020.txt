      called an embodied conversational agent (ECA) on health outcomes in people with atrial
      fibrillation. The study will enroll 264 patients who reside in rural, Western Pennsylvania
      who have atrial fibrillation. Participants will be randomized to the intervention or control.
      Intervention participants will receive a smartphone with a relational agent, which simulates
      conversation and provides coaching, guidance, and assistance with chronic disease
      self-management. In addition participants will receive an AliveCor Kardia for heart rate and
      rhythm monitoring, an FDA-approved, widely used instrument that pairs with the relational
      agent. Control participants will receive a smartphone with as well, which will have the
      health application WebMD. The intervention will last 4 months and participants will have
      visits at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. The study will evaluate the improvement in adherence
      to anticoagulation, quality of life, and health care utilization resulting from the
