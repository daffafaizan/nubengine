    
      A cluster randomized study was designed, randomizing 10 health facilities to the intervention
      arm and 20 to control arm. In each, 10 children will be recruited. The mother, or the main
      caretaker in the intervention arm will receive the intervention package: 1) an educational
      booklet indicating the importance of IPT, adherence to IPT as well as information on how to
      give it daily for six months. Thereafter, the mother or main caretaker receives 2) a chapter
      of a children storybook delivered weekly and 3) SMS to remind her of the pick up, as well as
      weekly SMS containing a motivating message. Until March 2020, component 1 and 2 of the
      intervention package were delivered in person, since September 2020 and in adaptation to the
      SARS Cov2 pandemic, these are delivered via WhatsApp. Children in the control arm will
      receive the standard of care which consists of a advice and counseling given by the doctor
      and nurse at the health facility.

      The investigators will assess the efficacy of the intervention by 1) measuring IPT completion
      at 6 months after treatment initiation. The secondary outcome originally planned (determining
      adherence to IPT by measuring isoniazid in urine at weeks 2, 8 and 24) has been cancelled in
      adaptation to the SARS Cov2 pandemic.

      Fidelity, reach and acceptability will be measured among caretakers and staff with an in
      depth interview at the end of the study.
