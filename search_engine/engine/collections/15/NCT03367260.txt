      ovarian cancer.The investigators anticipate that about 1/3 of the study cohort will include
      patients who are receiving treatment with an oral ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).
      The investigators will begin by conducting interviews with 5 pilot subjects as they test the
      preferences survey. Based on their feedback the survey may be updated for clarity. During the
      final survey phase, subjects will be recruited and invited to participate in the choice
      experiment by Biologics, Inc., a specialty pharmacy company that dispenses oral PARPis.
      Subjects may also be recruited through ResearchMatch.org and at the Gynecologic Oncology
      division at Duke. Up to 300 women may be included in this study, at least 100 women will have
      received treatment with a PARPi.

      Discrete choice experiment (DCE) questions generate limited dependent-variable,
      cross-section/time-series data. The study team will use random-parameters logit (RPL) to
      analyze the choice-format conjoint data collected in the DCE survey. Unobserved variation in
      preferences across the sample can bias estimates in conventional conditional-logit choice
      models. RPL avoids this potential bias by estimating a distribution of preferences around
      each model parameter that accounts for variations among individual preferences not accounted
      for by the variables in the model. The flexible correlation structure of RPL also accounts
      for within-sample correlation in the question sequence for each respondent.

      There are no physical risks to subject participation in this survey protocol.
