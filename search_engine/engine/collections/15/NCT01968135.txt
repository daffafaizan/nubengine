      subdermal contraceptive implant that contains 68 mg of etonogestrel, is approved for use for
      three years, and is one of the most effective forms of contraception available (1). ENG
      contraceptive implants are easily inserted and removed (1,2), offer quick return to fertility
      (2), are cost-effective and cost-saving (3,4) and offer non-contraceptive benefits such as
      improvement in pain for patients with complaints of dysmenorrhea (5).

      Hypothesis: Women using ENG contraceptive implants who report a bleeding-spotting episode of
      at least seven days will be more likely to stop bleeding within 3 days of beginning a 14-day
      course of combined oral hormonal steroids compared to women receiving 14 days of placebo.
