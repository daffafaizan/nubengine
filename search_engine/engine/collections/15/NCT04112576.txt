      clinically diagnosed with HFpEF or HFrEF. Approximately 70% of participants will have HFpEF
      and 30% will have HFrEF.

      There will be one study visit per participant. The study visit includes device placement and
      data collection during postural changes. Echocardiograms will also be collected throughout
      the study and at least 30% of participants will undergo a submaximal exercise test. The
      device will then be removed.
