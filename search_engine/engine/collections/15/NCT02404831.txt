    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a term used to describe a number of lung
      conditions characterised by irreversible damage to the airways causing airflow obstruction.
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a broad programme that helps improve the health and
      well-being of people with breathing difficulties, most commonly COPD. Participation in PR
      leads to improvements in exercise tolerance and functional ability, as well as a reducing
      breathlessness in everyday activities. It is traditionally an outpatient programme based in a
      hospital or community setting run by a multidisciplinary team, and usually lead by
      physiotherapy and nursing staff. Typically it includes a physical exercise programme, and
      advice and education on managing a chronic lung condition. The purpose of this pilot study is
      to compare a six week web-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme with traditional
      hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation classes for people affected by COPD.
