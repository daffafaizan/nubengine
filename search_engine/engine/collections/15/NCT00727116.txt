      figures) will be asked to read written materials and view an 8-minute video on the dangers of
      violent infant shaking. Parents will be asked to voluntarily sign a commitment statement
      affirming their receipt and understanding of the materials; these commitment statements will
      be sent to the Principal Investigator. A random subset of parent participants will be asked
      to voluntarily answer a short questionnaire about their impressions of the materials. In
      addition, 31 counties in central Pennsylvania will be randomly divided into two groups. In 15
      counties, the hospital-based intervention will remain as described above. In the other 16
      counties, all primary care providers having offices in those counties will be asked to
      provide all parents of newborns at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month immunization visits another set of
      written materials about violent infant shaking and voluntarily sign a response form that they
      read and understood the materials. Participating parents in this group will also be asked if
      they would be willing to complete a short telephone survey when the infant is 7 months old
      (and if so, asked to provide a telephone number). The telephone survey asks questions about
      the intervention materials and parents' perception of the information, and seeks to determine
      the mediators of a program effect. An invitation letter will be sent to a control group of
      parents who do not receive the office-based intervention to ask if they would be willing to
      complete the short telephone survey when their infant is 7 months old.
