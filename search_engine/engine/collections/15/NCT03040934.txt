      arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter and ≤100 mm in length (by visual estimate) in no
      more than 10 research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be
      1:1 randomized to receive Firehawk™ sirolimus target-eluting coronary stent or XIENCE
      everolimus-eluting coronary stent.

      Optical Coherent Tomography (OCT) sub study: the first 44 consecutive subjects who consented
      to participate in the OCT sub study will undergo OCT assessment at 3 months and 12 months
      post index procedure. The OCT sub study will be performed in 3-5 pre-selected sites. The
      clinical follow-up will be carried out at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months,and 2-5
      years post-index procedure.The primary endpoint is in-stent late lumen loss at 12 months
      post-index procedure.The secondary endpoint is neo-intimal thickness by Optical Coherent
      Tomography (OCT) at 3 months post-index procedure.
