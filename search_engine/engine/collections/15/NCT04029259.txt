      before and after carotid surgery to evaluate the rationale for the MRI. Brain lesions on MRI
      before and after carotid surgery are registered, and related to clinical findings. The
      purpose of the study is to evaluate whether brain MRI in relation to carotid endarterectomy
      gives additional information to clinical findings, and to CT scan of the brain.
