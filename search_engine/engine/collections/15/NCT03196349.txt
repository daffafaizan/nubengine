      bleeding. Determine if rivaroxaban is superior to warfarin in the reduction of clinically
      relevant bleeding. Determine if apixaban is non-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of
      recurrent venous thromboembolism. Determine if rivaroxaban is non-inferior to warfarin in the
      prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. An exploratory comparison of apixaban versus
      rivaroxaban for the prevention of clinically relevant bleeding and recurrent Venous
      Thromboembolism (VTEs) as a secondary objective.
