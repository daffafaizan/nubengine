      vitamin D. However, to date a correlation between plasma vitamin D levels and headache has
      not been demonstrated. Recently we documented that low levels of Vitamin D are related to a
      low statin efficacy. In this study we will evaluate the plasma levels of vitamin D in
      patients with headache admitted to the Center of Headache of Pugliese Ciaccio Hospital.

      Moreover it will be also evaluated:

        -  the correlation between efficacy and safety of drugs used in headache treatment and
           plasma vitamin D levels.

        -  the role of vitamin D supplementation on both headache symptoms and drug effects.

      Plasma vitamin D levels in patients with headache will be evaluated respect to patients
      without headache.
