      diabetes (CFRD), due to insulin deficiency, is common. CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia occurs
      in about 15% of adult CF patients. Standard insulin therapy has relied primarily on meal
      coverage with rapid-acting insulin. Usually, basal insulin coverage is only provided
      overnight, with modest doses of NPH insulin. The practice of providing minimal basal insulin
      in CFRD is based on the fact that most of these patients, unless they are acutely ill, are
      able to maintain relatively normal blood glucose levels during the day without it. In
      addition, anecdotal experience has suggested that daytime NPH insulin or once to twice daily
      ultralente insulin frequently lead to hypoglycemia in the CFRD patient. This practice, which
      is based on practical clinical considerations, ignores the established relationship between
      insulin deficiency and clinical deterioration in CFRD. BMI and pulmonary function deteriorate
      much more rapidly in CF patients with diabetes than in CF patients with normal glucose
      tolerance. Insulin deficiency leads to increased protein catabolism and fatty acid turnover.
      The resulting loss of weight and lean body mass contributes to pulmonary disease and clinical
      decline.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Basal insulin coverage with insulin glargine will improve hemoglobin A1c, weight, and
           muscle mass in patients with CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia, compared to traditional
           regimens with less basal insulin.

        2. Because of the peakless action of insulin glargine, this will be accomplished without
           serious hypoglycemia.
