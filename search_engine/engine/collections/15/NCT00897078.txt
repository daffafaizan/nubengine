        -  Determine the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) and its component traits (i.e.,
           obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance) in survivors of childhood
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in healthy sibling volunteers.

        -  Identify host- and treatment-related risk factors for MS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients' medical charts are reviewed and patients undergo anthropometric measuring (height
      and weight for BMI calculation and waist and hip circumferences) and blood pressure testing.
      Patients also complete questionnaires on their physical activity, diet, and family history
      over 30-45 minutes. Blood is collected to measure cytokines (e.g., adiponectin, leptin,
      interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein), fasting glucose, and fasting insulin.

      Healthy volunteers undergo anthropometric measuring and blood pressure testing (if they are
      seen in the clinic). They also complete a baseline medical history and questionnaires on
      their physical activity and diet.
