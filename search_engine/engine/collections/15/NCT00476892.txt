      quality of life of many women. Pelvic floor muscle training interventions are commonly used
      by physiotherapists to manage prolapse. However, a Cochrane review found limited evidence to
      support the effectiveness of such interventions. Based on the findings of a successful
      feasibility study, this multi-centre randomised controlled trial will address the paucity of
      evidence. 556 symptomatic women with diagnosed prolapse will be enrolled in 16 UK centres and
      1 New Zealand centre over 16 months and randomised to pelvic floor muscle training plus
      lifestyle advice, or to receive a lifestyle leaflet only. Principal measures of outcome are:
      prolapse symptoms, prolapse severity, and subsequent further treatment up to 12 months after
      trial entry.
