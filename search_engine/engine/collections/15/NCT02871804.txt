      isolating it from the pancreatic parenchyma. This is considered essential to prevent
      disruption of the stump of the splenic vein and the consequent intra-abdominal haemorrhage in
      the event of pancreatic fistula. This procedure can be technically demanding, especially when
      the vein is firmly embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma. The objective of this trial is to
      confirm the non-inferiority of resection of the splenic vein embedded in the pancreatic
      parenchyma compared with the conventional technique of isolating the splenic vein before
      resection during distal pancreatectomy using a mechanical stapler.
