      I. To determine the efficacy based on overall metabolic response rate (partial metabolic
      response [PMR] + complete metabolic remission [CMR]) of brentuximab vedotin/nivolumab in
      previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma patients 60 years of age or older, or those considered
      unsuitable for standard chemotherapy because of a low cardiac ejection fraction (< 50%) or
      impaired pulmonary or renal function.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The complete metabolic response (CMR) rate. II. Safety and tolerability of the regimen in
      this patient population. III. Duration of response (DOR). IV. Progression-free survival
      (PFS). V. Overall survival (OS).

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. T-cell/cytokine - peripheral blood specimens will be used to assess T-cell activation and
      cytokine up regulation as measures of treatment effect.

      II. Biomarkers - intratumoral cell populations, genetic variability, serum cytokines and
      T-cell activation will be evaluated to identify potential biomarkers that correlate with
      response to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over
      60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 7 cycles and 6-8 weeks in cycle 8 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 90 days,
      every 90 days for 2.5 years, and then every 6 months until 5 years from registration.
