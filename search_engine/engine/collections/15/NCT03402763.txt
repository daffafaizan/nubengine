      intervention on the promotion of advance care planning (ACP) among older adults. Participants
      are given either a short informational handout on the process and choices involved in ACP or
      watch a 6-minute video about ACP. The video describes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),
      breathing tube placement, and mechanical breathing support in addition to the general process
      of ACP. Following the video, patients in the intervention will also have an email sent to
      their primary care provider. The email will inform the primary care provider that the patient
      has watched a video about ACP, include a brief synopsis of the video, and provide
      instructions as to how to document the patient's preferences in the hospital's electronic
      health record in a way that will be accessible to other providers. Outcomes will include
      documentation of end-of-life care preferences in the electronic health records and
      patient-reported conversation with their provider as well as conversations with loved ones.
