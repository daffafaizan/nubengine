      or older, with complaints of hand osteoarthritis. Subjects will be randomized into one of two
      groups receiving either LLLT or sham LLLT. Subjects will receive LLLT or sham LLLT weekly
      over a period of six weeks. At each visit, patients will rate their pain using the Defense
      and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and assess their functionality using the Disabilities
      of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Subjects will have a follow up visit six
      weeks after the treatment protocol for a final assessment of pain and function. The Phoenix
      Thera-Lase laser is a Class II, 510k cleared device (#K151521) and is legally marketed in the
      US. Investigators are using in accordance with its approved labeling and no changes to the
      approved labeling are being sought.

      The Phoenix Thera-Lase System is intended to emit energy in the infrared spectrum to provide
      topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for temporary relief of minor
      muscle and joint pain, muscle spasm, pain and stiffness associated with minor arthritis,
      promoting relaxation of muscle tissue and to temporarily increase local blood circulation. It
      is specifically designed as a high-power laser with an output power of 35 Watts and an output
      wavelength of1064 nm. The study will be utilizing an output power of 74 Watts and an output
      wavelength of 1275 nm.
