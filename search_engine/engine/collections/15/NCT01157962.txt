      carried out.

      Four different techniques can be used: 1) laparoscopic transperitoneal 2) laparoscopic
      retroperitoneal 3) open extraperitoneal 4) open transperitoneal. Radioactive labeling of
      sentinel-lymph nodes with 99technetium-marked colloid and/or patent blue is carried out. On
      the day prior to the operation 50mBq 99technetium or on the day of operation 10 mBq
      99technetium is injected subepithelially in the cervix at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock.
      Preoperatively 4 cc patent blue are injected in the same manner subepithelially. At the
      beginning of surgery parametrial tumor involvement, intrabdominal tumor dissemination,
      invasion of vesica-cervical and recto-vaginal septum are excluded. A lavage of cul-de-sac for
      cytological analysis is performed. The retroperitoneum is opened lateral of iliac vessels and
      blue colored lymph or radioactive nodes are removed. Sentinel- lymph node's radioactive
      signal is documented in counts per second (cps).

      If no sentinel-lymph node is detected, complete pelvic lymph node dissection is carried out.
      If tumor involved pelvic lymph nodes are shown, paraaortic lymph node dissection is carried
      out. If sentinel- or pelvic lymph nodes are quoted as tumor free at frozen sections, radical
      hysterectomy or radical trachelectomy is performed. Radical hysterectomy follows in an
      extension a type-2 variation. In patients with positive lymph nodes in frozen section or in
      definitive histo-pathology primary chemoradiation is performed.
