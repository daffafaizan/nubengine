      hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation are included according to the criteria
      of admission. The enrolled patients are treated with lenvatinib (dose: body weight < 60 kg: 8
      mg/day, body weight â‰¥ 60 kg 12 mg/day). The baseline data of patients are collected before
      allocation. Serum and imaging examination are checked regularly every month to monitor the
      recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and the side effects of lenvatinib. The efficacy and
      safety of lenvatinib in the treatment of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma are observed,
      and the clinicopathological factors affecting the efficacy of lenvatinib are analyzed. When
      side effects of lenvatinib occur, the dosage can be reduced according to the patients'
      condition until discontinuation. When tumor advances, a multidisciplinary team will draw up
      specific treatment plans according to the patients' condition.
