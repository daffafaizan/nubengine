      population. Multimodal anesthesia consisting of systemic narcotics, surgical wound
      infiltration with local anesthetic and ilioinguinal and/or iliohypogastric nerve blockade has
      traditionally been employed to achieve acceptable analgesia. Recently, ultrasound-based
      studies have demonstrated that blind abdominal wall injections are done with poor accuracy.
      Ultrasound-guided alternatives, such as the transverses abdominis plane (TAP) block, may
      improve analgesic efficacy and patient comfort in the post-operative period when compared to
      blind landmark based nerve blockade. There has been increasing utilization of the TAP block
      in the adult population due to the described ability to provide effective blockade of the
      thoracolumbar spinal nerves innervating the abdominal wall. We propose a randomized
      prospective evaluation of the analgesic efficacy comparing surgeon performed
      ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric block with ultrasound-guided TAP blockade in healthy ASA I and
      II pediatric patients undergoing unilateral herniorrhaphy on an outpatient basis.
