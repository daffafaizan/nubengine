      women the incidence of ovarian malignancy is 1:1000 in case of symptomatic ovarian cyst.1
      CA125 is unreliable in differentiating benign from malignant ovarian mass in premenopausal
      women due to many false positive results and reduced specificity.1 pelvic vaginal
      ultrasonography is the most effective tool in evaluating ovarian masses due to increased
      sensitivity over abdominal US.1 An estimation of risk of malignancy index is essential in
      evaluating an ovarian mass.26 /2 Risk of malignancy index combines presurgical features serum
      including CA125, menopausal status and ultrasound findings. RMI=Ux Mx CA125 in which each
      feature takes a score and after calculation score less than 25 is mild, from 25-250 moderate
      and more than 250 has a severe risk of malignancy needing oncologist.44/3
