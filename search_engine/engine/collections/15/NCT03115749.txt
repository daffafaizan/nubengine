    
      Primary and secondary objectives:

      Main Objective: Characterize morphologically, molecularly and functionally the MSCs of colon
      and small intestine of patients with IBD and compared to MSCs of colon and small intestine of
      control patients.

      Secondary objectives: To study the reaction of colon and small intestine MHC in patients with
      IBD following stimulation with bacterial compounds.

      Methodology:

      Clinical study exploratory translational physiopathological. Two groups of patients with
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis who require colonoscopy or surgery for intestinal
      resection will be included. These two groups will be compared to a control group consisting
      of patients requiring colonoscopy for screening or intestinal resection for colorectal cancer
      or diverticulum.

      Intestinal sampling by biopsy during the colonoscopy or with surgical specimen during the
      surgery will be performed to isolate the MSCs.

      The outcome measures will be a qualitative and quantitative analysis of MSCs by
      immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell proliferation and differentiation, production
      of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the basal state and after bacterial stimulation.

      Total of 60 patients (20 in groups, 15 with colonoscopy and 5 with surgical specimens).
