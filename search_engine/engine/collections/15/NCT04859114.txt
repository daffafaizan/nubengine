      situation of choosing between comfort care and intensive care at 22 weeks gestation,
      treatment choice was not influenced by the chance of survival. Specifically, there was no
      difference in treatment choice between moms who were told the baby would have a 30% chance of
      survival and moms who were told the baby would have a 60% chance of survival.

      The study was conducted using a written vignette that included a paragraph on the chance of
      survival and the chance of disability among the survivors.

      In this study, we will adapt the vignette the Kidszun et al. (2020) team used, and provide it
      to an internet-based sample of women. In this vignette, participants will be put in a
      hypothetical situation of being in labor at 22 weeks of pregnancy, provided a description of
      the treatment choices of intensive care or comfort care, and provided data on outcome
      information at this gestational age.

      After reading the vignette, participants will be randomized to view either: a repeat of the
      text information on outcome data, a static pictograph, or an iterative pictograph.
      Participants will also be randomized to seeing the chance of survival as 30% or 60%, making
      this a 2 (chance of survival) x 3 (data presentation format) between-subjects experiment.

      After viewing a repeat of the outcome information, participants will be asked to choose
      between intensive care or comfort care for their hypothetical child. As in the Kidszun (2020)
      study, we will also include an option for participants to say they would want the doctors to
      choose for them. We will also collect information on values, religiosity, health literacy,
      subjective numeracy, a subjective probability estimate, and demographics.
