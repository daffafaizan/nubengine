    
      The study will be broken into one (1) arm:

      • AffloVest® & Monarch™

      Within the arm, the order of products will be randomized.

      Baseline spirometry (Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Peak
      Expiratory Flow (PEF), Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF25-75%) and Tidal Volume (TV)) will be
      taken at the beginning, middle and end of each series of measurements with each subject,
      without any device on the subject. A product (AffloVest or Monarch) will be placed onto
      subject and turned ON to the highest frequency and intensity settings. Then the subject will
      be given a certain period of time to adjust and spirometry measurements will then be
      repeated, then the product will be removed and the subject will be allowed a recovery period,
      then the other product will be placed on the subject, turned ON and spirometry measurements
      will repeated.
