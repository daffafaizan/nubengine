      25). Weight loss using a low energy diet (LED, 800 - 1000 kcal/day) has been shown to induce
      a considerable weight loss in obese but otherwise healthy patients and to reduce the risk of
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes in these subjects. Additionally, a British study using a
      very low energy diet (VLED, 600 kcal/day) to obtain weight loss, has shown that subject with
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes had their blood glucose normalized after an 8 week VLED. However,
      the effect of LED has never been examined in overweight patients with IHD.

      Several studies have shown that patients with IHD have a beneficial effect of exercise
      training regarding mortality and reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. A Norwegian group
      has shown that aerobic interval training results in the biggest increase in maximal oxygen
      uptake (VO2max). A high VO2max is correlated to decreased mortality in patients with IHD.

      In conclusion, weight loss and exercise are known strategies in preventing progression of IHD
      and development of type 2 diabetes in these patients, however a head-to-head comparison of
      the two methods has never been made and it is unknown which intervention is the most
      effective in improving cardiovascular risk profile. Furthermore, several mechanisms behind
      the known beneficial effect of these interventions are unknown.
