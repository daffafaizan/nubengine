      health facilities and to pay facilities a bonus if providers perform well on these tests. For
      the intervention, 12 clinical vignettes were created. These vignettes cover typical patient
      cases such as malaria, diarrhea and respiratory infections, and assess providers' ability to
      correctly diagnose and treat hypothetical questions. All medical staff members were informed
      hat every 3 month there would be a knowledge assessment based on these vignettes and that the
      results would determine the total bonus payment made to the facility.

      Each quarter, facilities receive a supervision visit. During the supervision visits, one
      provider is randomly chosen for the knowledge assessments, and is tested on two randomly
      chosen vignette cases.

      In order to create a quarterly performance score, the scores on the two vignettes are then
      averaged. Fifty percent of the overall facility quality score is determined by the general
      quality checklist that captures basic structural and process features of the facility. The
      remaining fifty percent are directly determined by the providers' performance on the
      knowledge assessments. If the overall quality score is below 50%, no quality payments are
      made. If the quality score is >=50%, facilities can receive a top-up payment of up to 25% of
      the quantity-based payments. The total bonus percentage is determined by multiplying the
      quality score (with ranges between 0 and 100%) with the maximum 25% bonus.
