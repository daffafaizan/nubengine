      only recently gained the interest of researchers in Western countries as an alternative form
      of exercise. Tai Chi combines deep diaphragmatic breathing and relaxation with many
      fundamental postures that flow imperceptibly and smoothly from one to the other through slow,
      gentle, and graceful movements. Based on the maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) measured
      during the practice, Tai Chi is characterized as a low- to moderate-intensity form of
      exercise. Tai Chi has been applied as a rehabilitation program in patients with heart
      failure, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.
      Improvements in cardiorespiratory function, balance, muscular strength, flexibility in older
      subjects; preventing falls in the frail elderly; stress reduction, and mood state with Tai
      Chi practices have been well established. A potential immune response effect of Tai Chi
      practice is a frequent claim; however, this is an under-researched area. A nonrandomized
      controlled study of 60 elderly subjects found that the total number of circulating T cells
      were significantly higher in the Tai Chi group (who regularly practiced Tai Chi for 4 or more
      years) than in the untrained group. Irwin et al. demonstrated that older adults with no
      previous Tai Chi experience after practicing for 15 wks (1-3 times/wk), a nearly 50% increase
      in varicella zoster virus specific, cell-mediated immunity was found. Thus in this proposed
      study, we will examine the effects of regular Tai Chi practitioners on innate and adaptive
      immune function.
