      characterised by disturbed body image and extreme and devastating fear of gaining weight. The
      illness leads to a considerable and sometimes dangerous weight loss because of the limited
      food intake and often an exaggerated exercise behavior. AN can affect people of all ages and
      of both sexes, but girls or young women are more at risk. The prevalence among young women in
      Denmark is estimated to be between 0.4% and 1%. AN is associated with a high rate of
      comorbidity and mortality.

      The treatment of AN consist of re-feeding and psychotherapy. Different therapeutic methods
      and theories have been applied, but none have shown to be superior. The patient alliance and
      motivation for treatment seem to be essential for a successful treatment. Drop-out is a
      common challenge. Hence, attention must be directed to how the therapeutic alliance and the
      patient's motivation can be optimized in order to secure a better treatment effect.

      Studies have shown that physical therapy, including supervised exercise and bodily focused
      interventions, may have a positive effect on symptoms of AN. It may reduce the distorted body
      image and anxiety. However, it is unknown whether physical therapy can affect compliance and
      drop out rate to the nutrition therapy. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      feasibility of a RCT design in this group of patients with severe AN at a specialized unit.
      The intervention is supervised, standardized physical therapeutic exercises mainly consisting
      of light strength training. The development of the intervention is based partly on the
      literature, and partly on interviews and observations with two patients with severe AN.
