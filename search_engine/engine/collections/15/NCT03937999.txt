      diarrhea. It is usually a side-effect of taking antibiotics that affect the normal balance of
      bacteria in the intestines. When the "good bacteria" in the intestine are killed by
      antibiotics, the C.diff bacteria begin to grow and produce toxins, causing frequent diarrhea
      and other symptoms such as abdominal pain or tenderness, loss of appetite, low-grade fever,
      nausea and vomiting. C. diff can be treated by using special antibiotics, but it tends to
      come back in about 20% of patients. C-diff is problematic because of frequent relapses after
      apparent cure. The greatest risk factor for relapse is receipt of subsequent antibiotics, in
      the hospital, shortly after being treated.

      Zinplavaâ„¢(bezlotoxumab) is an FDA approved human monoclonal antibody designed to prevent the
      recurrence of C.diff.This is not an antibiotic, as it does not kill C. diff, but is an
      antibody to C. diff toxins, which stops the damage. When Bezlotoxumab is given during a C.
      diff infection together with antibiotics to kill C. diff, it decreases the risk that C. diff
      will come back by about one-half. Bezlotoxumab is approved for use when given during a C.
      diff infection, but it has not been used to prevent C diff in other situations, such as the
      one being studied in this research.
