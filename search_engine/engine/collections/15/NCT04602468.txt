    
      Our aim with RECOVER is to examine the clinical impact of Kaftrio on key clinical outcomes in
      people with CF in a real-world setting. For this study, in addition to some of the more
      traditional ways of monitoring clinical outcomes in people with CF such a standard lung
      function, nutrition, exacerbations and liver disease, we are proposing to include some novel
      outcome measures not typically used in clinical trials such as lung clearance index (LCI) and
      spirometry controlled chest CT.

      By implementing an extensive study protocol that will include important outcomes in a number
      of areas of health in people with CF, and matching this to a comprehensive biosample
      collection plan, we will have the power to gain important insight into how Kaftrio works, and
      what impact it has on rescue of CFTR function in this group of people.

      Data on the following outcomes will be collected during the study:

      Lung Clearance Index Ultra-low dose, spirometry-controlled CT scanning Sweat Chloride Nasal
      Lavage (inflammatory markers and microbiome) Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) Liver
      Ultrasound Liver examination (signs of liver disease) Sputum Collection (inflammatory markers
      and microbiome) Stool Collection (inflammation, microbiome, fecal elastase) Abdominal symptom
      questionnaire CFQ-R (quality of life) Adherence to treatment Height, weight, BMI Forced
      Expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) Microbiological culture of airway specimens (clinical
      laboratories at sites)

      The Lead Investigator is Prof. Paul McNally, with Prof. Jane Davies as Co-Lead Investigator.
      The study will operate in collaboration with our academic and clinical partners and the CF
      registries in Ireland and the UK. The study is supported by the European CF Society Clinical
      Trials Network (ECFS-CTN).
