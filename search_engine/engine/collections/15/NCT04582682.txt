      for adolescent concussion, yielding a non-invasive test that predicts duration and character
      of symptoms, and helps guide clinical decisions. To accomplish this goal, the study will
      enroll 750 adolescents with mTBI. Saliva RNA levels and symptoms will be assessed at <48
      hours, 7 days, and 30 days post-injury. Aim 1 will assess the ability of saliva RNA dynamics
      (Δ from <48 hours to day 7) to predict PPCS 30 days after mTBI (defined by persistence of ≥3
      symptoms on day 30, compared with pre-injury state on the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory;
      PCSI). RNA accuracy will be compared to a validated clinical prediction tool (5p tool). Aim 2
      will assess the ability of saliva RNA dynamics (Δ from <48 hours to day 30) to identify
      recovered participants on day 30. RNA accuracy will be compared to change in composite score
      on a standardized reaction time test (from <48hrs to day 30). Completion of these aims will
      yield an objective biologic test that can be used for prognosis at the time of mTBI, and to
      aid clinical decisions regarding return-to-learn or return-to-play.
