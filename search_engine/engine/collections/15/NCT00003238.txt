      with androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer. II. Assess the toxicity of this
      treatment in these patients.

      treatment in the absence of severe toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for survival after disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 20-40 patients in approximately 2 years.
