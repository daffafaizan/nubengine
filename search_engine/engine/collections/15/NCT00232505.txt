      Primary

        -  Compare the overall response rate in women with estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone
           receptor-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-nonoverexpressing
           metastatic breast cancer treated with cetuximab with vs without carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the time to disease progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate downstream effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor on
           Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), Protein kinase B (AKT), monoclonal antibody
           Ki-67 (Ki67), and EGFR-dependent signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis with toxicity
           and response in patients with accessible tumors treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the changes in biomarkers and gene expression in circulating tumor cells
           during treatment.

        -  Compare the overall survival rate in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once a week.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cetuximab as in arm I and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, and 15.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients not responding to treatment in arm I may cross over to arm
      II.

      Blood samples are collected periodically throughout study for correlative biomarker analysis
      by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 months.
