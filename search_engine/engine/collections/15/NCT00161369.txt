      recognized as potential risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population, and the
      metabolism of each of these substances seems to be closely related. This study investigates
      the association between these substances, and whether elevated serum levels of Hcy and ADMA
      would be related to a high risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events in maintenance
      hemodialysis (HD) patients.

      Methods- The subjects were recruited from both day-time and night-time HD patients at
      Maruyama Hospital. The study inclusion criteria were those patients who had been receiving
      hemodialysis therapy for more than 6 months, were in a stable condition and were under 70
      years old. The degree of atherosclerosis was evaluated by four indices involving the carotid
      artery intima-media thickness (IMT), carotid artery plaque, percentile of calcification index
      in the abdominal aortic wall (ACI) and elongation of the thoracic aorta. At the same time,
      plasma Hcy and ADMA were measured. After the initial laboratory examination and evaluation of
      the degree of atherosclerosis, all the patients were followed up for 5 years.
