      I. To compare the rates of detection of invasive cancers between the initial abbreviated
      breast (AB)-magnetic resonance (MR) and digital tomosynthesis mammography (DBT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsies, call back rates, and
      short-term follow up rates after AB-MR and DBT on both the initial and 1 year follow up
      studies.

      II. To estimate and compare the sensitivity and specificity of AB-MR and DBT, using the 1
      year follow up to define a reference standard.

      III. To compare patient-reported short-term quality of life related to diagnostic testing
      with AB-MR and DBT using the Testing Morbidities Index.

      IV. To compare willingness to return for testing with AB-MRI versus (vs) DBT within the
      recommended screening interval and explore factors associated with willingness to return for
      screening.

      V. To compare the tumor biologies of invasive cancers and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
      detected on AB-MR and DBT.

      VI. To estimate the incident cancer rate during 3 years following the year-1 AB-MR/DBT when
      patients return to standard screening.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (DBT, AB-MR): Participants undergo DBT followed by AB-MR for under 10 minutes on the
      same day or within 24 hours at baseline and then after 1 year.

      ARM B (AB-MR, DBT): Participants undergo AB-MR for under 10 minutes followed by DBT on the
      same day or within 24 hours at baseline and then after 1 year.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at every 6 months for 3 years.
