    
      Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that
      appears during childhood and affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. This
      disorder is generally characterized by motor and sensory involvement including progressive
      and predominant distal clumsiness, muscle weakness, and pronounced gait disturbances. GAN is
      caused by various mutations in the GAN gene that encodes the protein gigaxonin. This leads to
      giant axonal swelling and degeneration due to substantial accumulation of neurofilaments in
      the axon. Currently, there is no effective therapy, with onset occurring before the age of
      seven, and death usually occurring between the first and third decade of life.
