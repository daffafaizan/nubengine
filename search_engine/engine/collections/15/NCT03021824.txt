      associated with mortality rates approximating 40-50%. The majority have been described to
      present with severe disease at baseline, suggesting an opportunity for early intervention. In
      addition, use of evidence-based practices in severe ARDS is highly variable and inconsistent;
      use of unproven treatment modalities is also frequently seen. Given the variability in
      treatment practices in severe ARDS, an understanding of the patient-level and
      institutional-level factors contributing to differences in therapeutic approach is needed in
      order to improve the quality and consistency of care given to these high-risk patients. SAGE
      is a multicenter, observational cohort study examining the patient-level and institutional
      characteristics associated with variability in management of patients with moderate to severe
      ARDS, factors associated with survival or need for adjuvant therapy, and variability in
      ventilator management of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Findings from this
      observational study can subsequently be used to inform future interventional trial
      development.
