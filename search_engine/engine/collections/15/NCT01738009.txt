      have shown that there is progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal airway across breaths during
      expiration (Progressive Expiratory Narrowing, PEN) preceding an obstructive apnea.

      The investigators will test if lung volumes and low respiratory drive play a role in PEN. To
      this end, the investigators will visualize the pharynx of sleep apnea patients during sleep
      using a thin endoscope during sleep while simultaneously measuring lung volumes, genioglossus
      electromyogram, and pharyngeal pressure during flow-limited breaths. Flow limitation will be
      induced by sustained reductions of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
