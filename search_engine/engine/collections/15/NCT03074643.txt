      and women at risk for disability (eSPPB <2.5) who will undergo a 6-month weight loss
      intervention followed by a 12-month follow-up phase to test the overall hypothesis that a
      higher protein (1.2 g/kg body wt/d) / lower carbohydrate (CHO) diet during a 6-month weight
      loss intervention improves physical function compared with an isocaloric lower protein (the
      current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), 0.8 g/kg body wt/d) / higher CHO diet, and
      whether continuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet for 12-months following weight loss will
      result in better maintenance of improved physical function. All participants will undergo a
      6-month weight loss intervention involving caloric restriction and supervised exercise
      followed by 12 months of follow-up with randomization to one of three groups (n=75/group): 1)
      Lower protein / higher CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (RecProt); 2) Higher
      protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (6-mo HiProt); or 3) Higher
      protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss and 12-month follow-up phases (18-mo
      HiProt). Physical function (primary aim) will be assessed by the expanded Short Physical
      Performance Battery (primary outcome) and lower extremity muscle strength at baseline, 6-,
      12- and 18-months. Weight loss maintenance and body composition (secondary aim) will be
      assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) at baseline,
      6- and 18-months. Bone mineral density (DXA) and cardiometabolic risk factors will also be
      measured at baseline, 6- and 18-months.
