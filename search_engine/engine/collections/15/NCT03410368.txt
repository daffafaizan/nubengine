      chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, but it will ultimately progress or relapse and develop
      early resistance to conventional treatments. No effective maintenance therapy except for wath
      and wait after first-line therapy at present.

      NK cells constitute the major component of the innate immune system and kill tumor cells in a
      non-MHC-restricted manner. In our previous pilot study and other reports, adoptive transfer
      of autologous NK cells expanded ex vivo was very well tolerant and effective.

      There is no prospective trial on the maintenance therapy of SCLC after first-line
      chemotherapy based on autologous NK cells. The purpose of this phase II clinical research is
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous NK cells as the maintenance therapy after
      the first-line treatment, comparing with conventional observation group.
