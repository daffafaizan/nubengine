    
      This is an interventional, open-label, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of up to four doses of the IMP topically administered on the target eye of
      patients with LSCD. Patients will be treated in up to four ascending dose groups.

      The allogeneic investigational product LSC2 contains ABCB5-positive limbal stem cells (from
      corneal rims of cadaveric donors, expanded ex vivo, isolated and stored in a donor cell
      bank).

      The IMP will be applied on the target eye. Prior to application, the conjunctival pannus will
      be removed under general or local anesthesia.

      Patients will be followed up for efficacy for 1 year. Efficacy of the IMP will be monitored
      by assessing neovascularization and epithelial defects.

      To assess long-term safety of LSC2 one follow-up visit at Month 24 post IMP application is
      included.
