    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which patients will receive treatment of
      Quetiapine XR for 8 weeks. All patients will receive Quetiapine XR at an initial dose of
      50mg/day to be increased incrementally (dose of 50mg/day 2 and 150mg/day 3) to achieve a
      target dose of 300 mg/day by day 4. Tablets will be self-administered early each night.
      Patient's results will be compared to their own baseline measurements, in a double-blind
      fashion.

      Recruited patients will be evaluated at nine time points: a baseline prior to treatment (t =
      -7 days), an assessment one week after treatment has begun (t = 7 days), two weeks after (t =
      14 days), three weeks after (t = 21 days), four weeks after (t = 28 days), five weeks after
      (t = 35 days), six weeks after (t = 42 days), seven weeks after (t = 49 days) and after 8
      weeks of treatment (t = 56 days). Evaluation of cognition, mood and anxiety, will be done
      blind to which time point is being measured.

      Basic blood work (fasting blood glucose, lipid screen including triglycerides, urea and
      electrolytes, cytokines and neuroimmune markers) will performed on each patient both at
      baseline (t = -7 days) and at t = 56 days. At 4 weeks, blood sample will be taken for fasting
      plasma glucose, HbA1c and transaminases. At baseline (-7 days) and completion (56 days) a
      battery of neurocognitive-impairment tests (see Appendix A) will be administered. In
      addition, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (21-ITEM HAM-D GRID), Montgomery -Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Ratings Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the UKU Side
      Effect Rating Scale, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire
      (Q-LES-Q) will also be assessed by the research team.
