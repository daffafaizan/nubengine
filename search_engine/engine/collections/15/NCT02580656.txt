      the United Kingdom, projected to increase to 4 million by 2030. Around 25% of these survivors
      require treatment for clinical levels of emotional distress. There is scope for improvements
      in the efficacy of current pharmacological and psychological interventions. Reflecting this
      limited efficacy in the face of the need for psychological treatment, the National Cancer
      Survivorship Research Initiative highlighted development and evaluation of practically
      feasible interventions for depression and anxiety in cancer survivors as an urgent research
      priority. It is recognised that current influential psychotherapeutic approaches need to be
      modified to meet the specific needs associated with cancer. However modifications have been
      pragmatic rather than theory-driven and have not improved efficacy.

      This study addresses the stages of 'development' and 'piloting and feasibility' in
      intervention development, albeit with a relatively well-defined starting point given existing
      evidence for efficacy of MCT in other settings and promising preliminary evidence of
      applicability in cancer. The investigators will conduct a phase I open trial to test the
      potential efficacy of MCT in cancer survivors.
