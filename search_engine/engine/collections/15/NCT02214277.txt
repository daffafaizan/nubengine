    
      The Sentinelâ„¢ Cerebral Protection System is indicated for use as an embolic capture and
      retrieval system intended to reduce the ischemic burden in the cerebral anterior circulation
      while performing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Claret Medical
      Sentinel Cerebral Protection System used for embolic protection during Transcatheter Aortic
      Valve Replacement (TAVR) compared to TAVR standard of care (without embolic protection).

      The study population is comprised of subjects with severe symptomatic calcified native aortic
      valve stenosis who meet the commercially approved indications for TAVR with the Edwards
      SAPIEN THV or SAPIEN XT and comply with the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
