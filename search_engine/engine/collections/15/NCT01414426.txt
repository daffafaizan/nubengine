    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the effect of ZD6474 (vandetanib) compared to placebo on microvessel density
      (MVD) from baseline to 3 months in patients at risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
      with preneoplastic lesions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Change in MVD over 6 months. II. Change in putative targets of ZD6474: tissues will be
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor
      (pEGFR), EGFR, phosphorylated-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (pVEGFR2),
      VEGFR2.

      III. Change in proliferative index as measured by Ki-67 IHC. IV. Safety, tolerability, and
      adherence to ZD6474 for 6 months in patients at risk for OSCC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare OSCC incidence in both study arms (ZD6474 and placebo).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive vandetanib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 9 and 12 months and then
      every 6 months for 2 years.
