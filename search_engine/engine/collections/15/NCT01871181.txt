      acute perioperative pain. At the same time, patients undergoing inguinal hernia operation are
      at increased risk to develop chronic neuropathic groin pain. In the literature, several
      approaches to prophylaxis and treatment of perioperative pain have been described including:
      infiltration of local anesthetics by surgeons, ilioinguonal/iliohypogastric nerve blocks,
      neuroaxial blockade, and caudal block in pediatric petients.

      Recent studies have shown that ultrasound guided ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block is
      associated with increased level of safety, improved success rate, and reduction in dose of
      local anesthetic required compared to the "blind" technique.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the role of ultrasound guided
      ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block in prevention of perioperative and persistent
      neuropathic pain following open inguinal hernia repair in comparison with infiltration of
      local anesthetics by surgeons. In the first randomized group of patients we will perform
      ultrasound guided ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block using the same types and amount of
      local anesthetics. In the second group, patients will receive infiltration of the same type
      and amount of local anesthetics by surgeons.
