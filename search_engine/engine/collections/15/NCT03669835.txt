      throughout the world. In majority of patients with chronic viral hepatitis C, dysbiotic
      changes are detected in the intestinal tract. Disturbances of microbial equilibrium are
      associated with the degree of inflammation, morphological changes in the liver, nature of the
      course and the stage of the disease.

      These dysbiotic changes and and associated immune disorders can significantly aggravate the
      course of immune processes in the liver, converting hepatitis C infection to a chronic
      disease.

      Mare milk is frequently reported for having therapeutic and dietary properties, which are
      initially associated with a specific chemical composition and certain physical properties of
      the product. It contains a total of about 40 biologically active components, the most
      important of them vitamins A, C, B1, B2, B6, B12, amino acids, enzymes and trace elements,
      there are low molecular weight peptides, lactalbumins and globulins.

      The use of mare milk can contribute to the restoration of impaired functions of damaged
      organs and tissues, and play the role of an auxiliary pathogenetic therapy, primarily in
      certain chronic diseases of the digestive system, including chronic viral hepatitis C. Mare
      milk can also be used as a powder supplement through sublimation process.

      In this trial, the effect of this supplement consisting of sublimated mare milk on hepatitis
      C patients will be evaluated. There will be two parallel groups: Interventional (sublimated
      mare milk supplement with standard treatment) and Standard treatment group. Differences in
      laboratory characteristics will be quantitively analyzed between groups.
