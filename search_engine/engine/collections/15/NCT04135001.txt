      with subsequent pre-, during, and post-deployment surveys to assess the effectiveness of HBMT
      to influence relevant unit- and Soldier-level outcomes. Soldiers will be Command directed to
      participate. As such, all data will be used for briefing to unit leadership, however,
      participants will be asked to consent whether they allow their data to be used for research
      purposes. Subordinate units within the BN will be randomly assigned to complete either an
      active training or placebo version of the task. The individual briefing the Soldiers during
      training sessions will not know which version of the training the Soldiers are completing on
      the computer. Up to 40 Soldiers will complete HBMT at a time on individual study computers.
      Brief surveys will follow each training. There will also be a survey shortly before
      deployment, during deployment and shortly after deployment. See Appendix Q for tentative
      study timeline. For details on procedure see Section 9.8. Surveys completed during same day
      as HBMT training sessions will be completed on experimenter provided laptops, whereas surveys
      completed independent of an HBMT training session will be completed in pencil and paper
      format. See section 219.8 for details. The current protocol provides details for the first
      time point (initial HBMT training session). Additional amendments will be used to provide
      details and obtain approval for subsequent time points as these are coordinated with the
      unit. However, general information for follow-on time points is provided in this version of
      the protocol.
