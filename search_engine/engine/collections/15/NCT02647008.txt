      being used by the gynecologist to evaluate different pathologies that used to be studied by
      other blind techniques. Although most women tolerate it well, the most common cause for
      failure during office hysteroscopy is pain. In order to overcome this adversity several
      studies have been carried out using different types of pain relievers as local anesthesia,
      misoprostol, music, and NSAID to prevent the occurrence of a vagal reaction, but the results
      have been contradictory. Other analgesic alternatives that prioritize these three points
      should be considered. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has become a very
      common electrotherapy as a pain-reliever because of its attributes, namely a noninvasive and
      non-pharmacological method based on the delivery of pulsed electrical currents through the
      skin, using surface electrodes, effective in many variety of conditions, such as neuropathic
      pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache, gynecological and obstetric pain, to treat both chronic
      and acute pain, even from visceral organs.

      Aim: to compare the pain-relieving effect of a specific application of TENS vs. placebo TENS
      and a control group during unsedated diagnostic office hysteroscopy.

      Design: double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient setting;
      Hospital Provincial de Castellon (Spain) and Hospital General de Castellon (Spain).

      Population: Women who attended annual gynecological check up, and were indicated for
      diagnostic office hysteroscopy
