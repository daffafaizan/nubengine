        -  Determine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):plasma ratio of pemetrexed disodium at different
           IV dose levels in patients with leptomeningeal metastases.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the role of CSF vascular endothelial growth factor and YKL 40 as markers of
           response and/or prognosis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo lumbar puncture and blood collection prior to therapy and 30-60 minutes
      after the first dose of pemetrexed disodium for pharmacological studies. Patients with Ommaya
      reservoirs undergo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection at baseline and 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 4,
      6 and 8.0 hours after pemetrexed disodium administration. CSF is then obtained once during
      each subsequent course of study treatment. CSF and blood are also evaluated for YKL 40 and
      vascular endothelial growth factor.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2-3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
