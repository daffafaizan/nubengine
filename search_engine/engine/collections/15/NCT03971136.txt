      The morbidity of ATS is important (respiratory insufficiency, duration of hospitalization,
      stays in intensive care, brain complications, pain, hypoxia, long-term sequelae, etc.) but no
      study has shown the benefits of curative treatments such as transfusion ( recommended at the
      time of diagnosis and practiced by some teams) or noninvasive ventilation (practiced by other
      teams). The first step before studying curative treatments is to have tools for early
      detection of ATS. Recent studies show non-inferiority of pulmonary ultrasonography compared
      to radiography and thoracic computed tomography in the diagnosis of pulmonary condensation
      (in adults and children). In a study performed in sickle cell adults admitted for ATS,
      pulmonary ultrasound was more sensitive than X-ray in detecting images of pulmonary
      consolidations visible on the chest CT scan.

      Daswani et al have also shown the value of pulmonary ultrasound in comparison with
      radiography in the detection of consolidation lesions, suggestive of STA, in febrile children
      or young adults with sickle cell disease. They showed a good sensitivity (87%) and
      specificity (94%) of the pulmonary ultrasound.
