      Following local anaesthesia and dental dam application, caries excavation will be performed;
      and after exposure, the pulp will be amputated to the level of the canal orifices (full
      pulpotomy) using a sterile high-speed round bur under water coolant. After haemostasis is
      achieved, Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) will be gently placed over the pulp to a thickness
      of 2-3 mm and the tooth will be restored using glass ionomer cement and composite resin. A
      postoperative periapical radiograph will be taken. Patients will be reviewed at 6., 12., 24.
      and 36. months for clinical and radiographical success. The data will be analysed
      statistically using chi square test.
