      I. Examine the 1 year disease free survival (DFS) rate of patients with maternal donors or
      sibling donors who share the maternal haplotype (maternal group) and compare them to patients
      receiving cells from donors who have points from other characteristics such as killer
      immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand mismatching, minor histocompatibility antigen
      (MHag) differences, or number of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches (non-maternal
      group).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the incidences of relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in maternal
      recipients whose only eligible donors are offspring.

      II. Assess the incidence of grades III-IV GVHD in female recipients with male donors.

      III. Compare the rates of DFS in recipient-donor combinations in which there is at least 1
      KIR ligand mismatch versus those without a KIR ligand mismatch.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -9 to -6, undergo
      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV)
      over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant on
      day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV beginning on day -1 with taper beginning on
      day 42, and mycophenolate mofetil IV BID from day -1 to day 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90, 180, and 270 days, and 1
      year.
