      treatment as usual.The evaluator will be blind to the group to which the patients belong. The
      sample for the overall project will be a total of 70 people with a diagnosis of psychotic
      spectrum, less than 5 years of experience and with a score => 3 positive PANSS (last month)
      and treated in one of the participating institutions. The evaluation was performed at
      baseline, at post-treatment and at 6 months follow up. Symptoms, metacognition, psychosocial
      and neuropsychological functioning were assessed.

      The EMC consists of 10 therapeutic units with weekly sessions of 45-60 minutes. The material
      available for the Individualized Metacognitive Training (EMC) program is made up of
      power-point presentations.
