      of multiple daily doses of rifampicin on the PK of darexaban and metabolites after a single
      dose of darexaban. In addition, safety and tolerability of darexaban administered alone and
      in combination with rifampicin is evaluated. Eligible subjects are admitted to the clinical
      unit in the morning of Day -1.

      daily (qd) on Days 4-14.On Day 11, the second single dose of darexaban is given in
