      glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks after kidney transplantation is both safe and effective
      at preventing the spread of HCV infection from donor kidney with known HCV infection (all
      genotypes) to an HCV negative recipient as evidenced by a negative HCV viral RNA at 12 weeks
      post treatment.
