      nursing team of MAC Neonatology Unit. Fecal samples will be collected every 7 days, during 21
      days, from diapers into sterile tubes. Mothers will be asked to collect their own fecal
      samples with an appropriate stool collection kit (EasySamplerÂ®) and will be invited to
      complete a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, previously validated for the
      Portuguese population.

      Infant-feeding profile (breast milk, donor human milk or formula) of preterm infants will be
      recorded every day to select the most representative (>50 %) type of infant-feeding received
      during the 7 days prior to each fecal sample collection.

      Additionally, detailed clinical data will be collected during the preterm infant enrollment
      in the study. Personal clinical data includes sociodemographic information and clinical
      intrapartum and postpartum outcomes, such as newborn's weight, days of antibiotic exposure,
      number of total days of hospitalization and others outcomes related to the preterm clinical
      evolution.
