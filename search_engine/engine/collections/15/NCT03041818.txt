      rehabilitation for children with special needs, including those with cerebral palsy, mental
      disabilities, and autism, with the program conducted by certified equine-assisted therapy
      instructors. However, there is no definite way to assess the ability of children for
      horseback riding and no standard riding program. Therefore, developing a assessment and
      program algorithm for healing horseback riding is expected to contribute to providing more
      activities for children with special needs and also for general people.

      Children older than 4 years old or adolescent with cerebral palsy who voluntarily want to
      enroll this study would be enrolled.

      Participants have 2 times of 30-minute horse riding program for 8 weeks, total 16 times of
      riding program in a local horse riding center.

      Sample size assessment: Calculating for 20% of drop out, 16 patients were calculated to apply
      the assessment and applicable program.

      Drop out: missing more than 2 lessons of horse-riding

      Plan for missing data: not included

      Statistical analysis plan: paired t-test for the outcome measures
