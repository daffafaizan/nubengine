    
      Primary objective of the first study: validation of non-invasive central pressure parameters
      in patients treated with EVAR against invasive measurements.

      Objectives of subsequent studies: Do non-invasive central parameters change over time after
      EVAR? What is the influence of intraluminal thrombus (presence, amount, configuration) on
      non-invasive central pressure parameters (and other obtained parameters of arterial
      stiffness)? Prospective study with consecutive, eligible subject enrollment. All subjects
      will undergo the Endovascular Aneurysm repair procedure with an endovascular device. Subjects
      will be followed procedurally, at 6-8 weeks and 1 year post implantation.

      This study is a collaboration of the following departments of the Vascular Center in the
      Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem: Vascular Surgery, Interventional radiology, Internal Vascular
      Medicine, Cardiology.

      Patients diagnosed with an abdominal aortic or aortoiliac aneurysm who are considered
      candidates for endovascular repair and who meet the study eligibility criteria may be
      screened for enrollment in the study. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled .

      Pre-procedural high resolution, contrast-enhanced CT scan evaluation to determine anatomical
      eligibility for enrollment will be performed within three months of the study procedure,
      according to standard care. Following EC/IRB approval of the study and the written informed
      consent form, patients will be screened for eligibility. Following informed consent, clinical
      characteristics will be reported (from hospital records). Per-procedural PWA measurements
      will be performed simultaneously with intravascular pressure measurements pre-implantation
      and after completion of the endocasular implantation. Subjects will be followed at 30 days
      and 1 year post-implantation.
