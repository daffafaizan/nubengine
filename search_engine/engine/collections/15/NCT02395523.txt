      trial with the historical arm. The expected 3-year local progression free survival for
      patient with HCC patients treated with proton beam therapy would be 80%. With a power of 80%
      and a type I error level of 10%, evaluable 40 patients are required to reject that the null
      hypothesis that true 3-year local progression free survival rate is â‰¤65%. Considering the 10%
      unevaluable patients due to loss of follow up, a total 45 eligible patients will be enrolled.
