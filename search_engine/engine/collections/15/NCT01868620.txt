      impairment by inducing irregular astigmatism and corneal opacities. This disorder typically
      begins during teenage years, progresses until the age of 30 to 40 years and, in severe forms,
      may need a corneal transplantation. CXL has changed the natural evolution of keratoconus. It
      creates links between collagen fibrils in order to rigidify the corneal stroma and slow down
      the progression of keratoconus. The corneal stroma is soaked with a riboflavin solution
      before being exposed to ultraviolet-A radiation.

      In the current standard CXL, the central corneal epithelium must be debrided to allow the
      penetration of riboflavin into the cornea with a risk of side effects, such as pain for the
      first two post-operative days, temporary loss of visual acuity during the first three months,
      and serious complications such as infection and stromal opacity due to corneal scarring.

      Iontophoresis is a non invasive technique in which a weak electric current is used to enhance
      the penetration of riboflavin into the cornea. The iontophoresis technique could allow
      intrastromal riboflavin diffusion, while keeping the corneal epithelium on, combining the
      efficiency of the standard procedure without the side effects of epithelial debridement.
