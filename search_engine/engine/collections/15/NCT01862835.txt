      healthy aging men. Relative sex-steroid deprivation accentuates GH and IGF-I depletion, since
      Te stimulates GH and IGF-I production in older men, hypogonadal males of all ages, and
      patients undergoing (genotypic female-to-male) gender reassignment. Tamoxifen blocks this
      effect of Te, suggesting involvement of E2 in GH's stimulation in men. E2 per se stimulates
      GH secretion in women. Because Te is converted to E2 by aromatization in the body, we
      postulate that E2 is the active moiety in men also. Moreover, we hypothesize that the decline
      of E2 in older men contributes to the fall in GH output. This has never been tested. From a
      clinical vantage, understanding the mechanistic basis of Te's drive of the somatotropic axis
      is especially relevant in boys with pubertal failure, adults with primary hypogonadism and
      men with aging-related hypoandrogenemia. In relation to aging in the male, testosterone and
      E2 bioavailabilities fall by 35-50% in the eighth compared with third decade of life. From a
      medical perspective, aging is accompanied by progressive osteopenia, sarcopenia and
      intra-abdominal obesity. These adverse outcomes are remediable by short-term replacement with
      Te and/or recombinant GH, thus linking GH/Te/E2 availability with key body-compositional
      features.
