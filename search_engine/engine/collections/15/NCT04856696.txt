      Chromosome abnormality increases with age, resulting in reduced pregnancy rate. Nowadays,
      preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) could be used for detection of
      aneuploidy. However, PGT-A needs embryo biopsy which is invasive and may cause embryo damage.
      It was found that cell free DNA could be isolated from culture media. The cell free DNA from
      culture media also could be used to detect embryo ploidy, called non-invasive PGT-A.

      Objective The study aims to investigate the difference of in vitro fertilization (IVF)
      outcomes among non-invasive PGT-A, PGT-A and combined non-invasive PGT-A and PGT-A. Another
      aim of this study is to check the concordance rate between non-invasive PGT-A and PGT-A.

      Methods The prospective cohort study will be performed at the reproductive medical center of
      Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Participants who plan to receive
      an IVF cycle and preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies will be enrolled in this
      study. The investigators will divide the participants into 3 groups: (1) combined
      non-invasive PGT-A and PGT-A; (2) PGT-A; (3) non-invasive PGT-A. Basal characteristics,
      infertility history, ovarian reserve and embryo development of the three groups will be
      recorded. The samples will be detected ploidy by using next generation sequencing (NGS).
      Then, the investigators will choose embryo to transfer according to the embryo ploidy and
      follow the pregnancy outcomes after embryo transfer.

      Outcome

        1. Concordance rate between non-invasive PGT-A and PGT-A

        2. The relationship between morphological grade and ploidy of non-invasive PGT-A

        3. IVF outcomes among non-invasive PGT-A, PGT-A and combined non-invasive PGT-A and PGT-A
