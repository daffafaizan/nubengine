      Ottawa Hospital and six other orthopedic cancer centres across Canada. The Investigator and
      the team will be recruiting 248 patients diagnosed with soft tissue cancer who will be
      treated with radiation therapy followed by surgery. Each of these patients will be randomly
      assigned to receiving either 14 days of vacuum dressing (Incisional Negative Pressure Wound
      Therapy) or a standard dressing. Besides this, patients will receive as identical care as
      possible. The team will then closely follow these patients over a 4 month period to examine
      for differences in wound complications, length of hospital stay, patient quality of life,
      patient satisfaction and function. Statistical analysis will be completed by The Ottawa
      Methods Center and ethical approval will be obtained at each participating site.
