      I. To determine the response rate for the combination of irinotecan and PS 341 in patients
      with previously untreated adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GEJ.

      II. To determine the response rate for PS341 in patients with previously treated
      adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GEJ.

      III. To determine the toxicities and recovery from toxicities for patients receiving PS 341
      alone or in combination with irinotecan IV. To perform GeneChip analysis on biopsy specimens
      prior to and subsequent to treatment with PS341 to determine changes in patterns of gene
      expression

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified (stratum 2 closed to accrual as of 9/19/2006) according to
      prior chemotherapy for advanced disease (yes vs no).

      STRATUM 1 (Previously untreated patients): Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      STRATUM 2 (Previously treated patients) (closed to accrual as of 9/19/2006): Patients receive
      bortezomib as in stratum 1.

      In both strata, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
