      cartilaginous lesions. This will be tested in a prospective multi-reader study of 100
      patients who are scheduled to have knee arthroscopy. Patients will have two MRIs of the knee:
      one standard of care and one experimental 7T MRI. Subjects will visit at one time point prior
      to scheduled knee arthroscopy, for a session time of ~1-2 hours for a single 7T MRI scan.
