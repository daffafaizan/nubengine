      calcium with or without irinotecan in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or
      rectum. II. Compare progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and duration
      of response in patients treated with these 2 regimens. III. Compare quality of life of
      patients treated with these 2 regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by
      fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Arm II: Patients receive
      irinotecan IV over 30 minutes followed by leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil
      IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment in both arms repeats every 7
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arm I who
      develop disease progression begin second-line therapy comprising irinotecan, fluorouracil,
      and leucovorin calcium within 2 months of progression. Patients with complete response are
      taken off study after receiving treatment for one year. Quality of life is assessed before
      beginning study, after completion of each course, at 4 weeks after completion of study, and
      then every 2 months until disease progression or death. Patients are followed every 2 months
      until disease progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 430 patients (215 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
