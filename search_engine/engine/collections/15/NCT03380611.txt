      Secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of wakame and spirulina consumption on
      fasting markers for lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism and blood pressure.

      Study design:

      This study is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention trial
      consisting of three intervention periods of 17 days each, separated by a minimum washout
      period of 14 days.

      Study population:

      The study population will consist of 37 healthy, non-hypercholesterolemic men and women aged
      between 18 and 70 years.

      Intervention:

      All subjects will receive wakame, spirulina and placebo capsules in randomized order.
      Subjects will be asked to consume 12 capsules per day for 17 days, which is equal to 4.8
