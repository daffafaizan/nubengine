      ventilator, the more risk they have of developing problems. For this reason, getting the
      child off the ventilator (called weaning) is an important patient outcome. Sedative drugs are
      necessary so the child can tolerate the breathing tube, but too much can make them sleepy and
      delay coming off the ventilator.

      In 2014, visits to 24 Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) were conducted and it was found
      that weaning was usually performed by doctors and occasionally senior nurses, but weaning was
      not always done the same way and, because everyone was not involved, it was often disjointed.

      This study will determine if a coordinated approach by doctors and nurses to optimise
      sedation and weaning using guidelines will: (a) reduce how long patients are on a ventilator
      without causing any increased risk; (b) reduce the time children spend in a PICU and the
      hospital; (c) be cost effective in the NHS; and (d) be easily adopted by staff delivering
      care.

      Children receiving ventilation, except those that will never come off a ventilator, will be
      weaned using the guidelines. Data collection will start in all PICUs at the same time from
      the very beginning of the study when they are weaning children according to usual practice.
      Each month, one unit will be chosen at random and staff will be trained to use the new
      guidelines. The unit will continue using the new guidelines for the rest of the trial.
      Outcome data collected before (usual care) and after (intervention) training will be
      compared. An evaluation of the process of implementing the new intervention will be
      undertaken. During the process evaluation, study staff will be interviewed about their
      experiences and views with the new approach.
