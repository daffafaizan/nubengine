      75-160) and the fully IgE-reactive recombinant Bet v 1 (aa 1-160)will be used for skin prick
      testing and atopy patch testing in birch pollen allergic patients with birch pollen induced
      exacerbation of atopic dermatitis. For control purposes birch pollen allergic patients
      without birch pollen-induced atopic eczema, persons with allergies other than to birch and
      non-allergic people will be tested.

      The individuals will be subjected to in vivo skin prick and atopy patch testing with rBet v
      1, rBet v 1 fragment 1, rBet v 1 fragment 2 and an equimolar mix of the rBet v 1 fragments.
      In parallel, the IgE reactivity, and in vitro T cell proliferation, and cytokine production
      will be studied. Those analyses should help to determine the relevance of IgE mediated
      mechanisms to chronic skin inflammation and T cell proliferation in AD patients.

      A staining for the surface markers chemokine receptor (CCR4)+ and cutaneous lymphocyte
      antigen (CLA)+ which reportedly are enriched in inflamed skin will further allow to
      investigate whether patients with high numbers of T lymphocytes expressing CCR4 and CLA tend
      to exhibit stronger skin inflammation. Moreover, allergen-specific antibody and T cell
      responses will be analyzed 6-8 weeks after the epicutaneous allergen application.
