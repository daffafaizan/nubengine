      model by offering a new service, Social Network Meetings. The study team will offer Social
      Network Meetings to individuals enrolled in the OnTrackNY@MHA program as an additional
      service option. This option will be completely voluntary and available for a 12 month period.
      Participant entrance into the study will be staggered with no more than approximately 5
      individuals in the Social Network group and no more than 5 individuals not in the Social
      Network group enrolled each month. Participants will choose which group they would like to be
      in, if any. Data will be collected for all participants, both those participating and not
      participating in the Social Network Meetings upon entering the study and then once every
      three months and at the end of their time in the study. For all participants, the study will
      end after 6 months of participation.

      Meetings may occur as often as 3 times a week when there is a crisis or more commonly would
      occur once every other week. These meetings will last between 60 and 90 minutes and will take
      place for however long the clients and their social networks would like within the project
      period.

      Study aims are:

        1. To determine the extent to which clients and their social networks find the Social
           Network meetings acceptable and beneficial.

        2. To compare outcomes (family functioning, recovery) of individuals participating in
           Social Network meetings to those not participating.
