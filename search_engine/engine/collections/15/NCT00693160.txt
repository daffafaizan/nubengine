    
      Intravenous (IV) remifentanil stimulates spinal COX activity, leading to increased
      Cerebrospinal fluid CSF) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations and areas of
      capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity after remifentanil infusion, and these effects
      will be blocked by intrathecal ketorolac.

      Areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia will be established by topical capsaicin +
      intermittent heat in healthy volunteers, who will be randomized to receive intrathecal saline
      or ketorolac during remifentanil infusion, with primary outcome measure area of hyperalgesia
      and secondary outcome measure Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentration
      after stopping remifentanil.
