      youth engage in a PrEP program, the Phoenix PrEP Access Project and as they participate in
      PrEP provided through standard medical care. This study does not investigate the safety,
      efficacy or other medical benefits of PrEP, but looks at the issues surrounding youth who are
      trying to access PrEP.
