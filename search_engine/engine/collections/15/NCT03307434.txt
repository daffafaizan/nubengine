      sent out automatically every Monday the following parameters: injury complaints (presence or
      absence, and characteristics if presence) and exposure (number of hours of athletic practice
      (training and competition) and intensity), and the number of AIPP realization per week. The
      main criterion will be the frequency (percentage) of athletes presenting at least one injury
      complaint that have a consequence on the practice (reduction or cessation of practice).
