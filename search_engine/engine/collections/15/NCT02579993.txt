      vision of the individual, therefore, the use of limbal stem cells has been having increasing
      acceptance in the field of medical therapy. An open clinical study is running with patients
      with limbal stem cell deficiency, performing a limbal stem cell transplantation expanded in
      vitro on amniotic membrane and the value of ABCB5 as a prognostic factor in the survival of
      transplant will be determined. The corneal surface status will be the primary endpoint.
