      Day 1. Patients must meet all Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to participate in the study.
      Eligible patients will provide written Informed Consent prior to any study procedures.

      Each treatment cycle is 28 calendar days in duration. There will be two patient cohorts and
      eligible patients will be enrolled into each cohort in parallel based on EGFR or HER2 exon 20
      mutation status:

        -  Cohort 1 : Previously treated patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation positive
           NSCLC (N=57)

        -  Cohort 2 : Previously treated patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation positive
           NSCLC (N=57) Toxicity will be assessed based on the severity grade of the adverse events
           using CTCAE version 4.03.

      Poziotinib (16 mg) will be taken orally, once daily (QD) with food and a glass of water at
      approximately the same time each morning.

      All patients will be treated until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events
      (AEs), or other protocol-specified reasons for patient withdrawal.
