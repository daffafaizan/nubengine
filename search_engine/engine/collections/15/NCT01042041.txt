      I. To evaluate the toxicity and safety of integrating sorafenib with chemoembolization for
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To observe the imaging response (AASLD/EASL modification of RECIST) and time to
      progression following chemoembolization in conjunction with sorafenib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily. Beginning 2 weeks later, patients
      undergo chemoembolization with cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and mitomycin C.

      Chemoembolizaton repeats once a month for up to 4 procedures in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months.
