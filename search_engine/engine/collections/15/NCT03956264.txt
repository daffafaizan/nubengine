      postoperative day, in the absence of complications. This procedure, realized by nurses, is a
      source of anxiety and pain for patients.

      Nitrous oxide (Kalinox®) is commonly used to manage many situations of anxiety, including the
      removal of mediastinal and/or pleural drains, and has shown a greater effect than placebo in
      this indication.

      Virtual Reality (VR) is a recent technology that allows the representation of a pleasant
      environment in three dimensions with a complete immersion by a helmet. By distracting
      patients, this technology can reduce anxiety, discomfort and ultimately pain associated with
      care.

      This randomized monocentric trial compares VR versus Kalinox® administration for the
      management of anxiety and pain related to post-cardiac surgery care, especially mediastinal
      and/or pleural drain removal.
