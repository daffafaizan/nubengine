      Despite its huge contribution to clinical practice, pain during the procedure is an important
      limiting factor. We aimed to investigate the effect of the trendelenburg lithotomy position
      to the pain and procedural time.However, there is a scarcity of research on this subject.
      Therefore, the rationale of the study was to enlighten the gap in the literature regarding
      the pain score and procedural time during VOH for diagnostic purposes in TL position. In
      order to gain scientific evidence, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare
      pain score and duration of procedure between the standard lithotomy position and TL position.
      Also, the convenience for the physician performing the procedure was assessed. To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature investigating the effect of the
      position of the patient during the procedure on both time, pain, and the convenience for the
      physician simultaneously.
