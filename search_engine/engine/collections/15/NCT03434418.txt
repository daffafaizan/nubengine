      treating advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) by targeting the treatment of epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S7681, or exon 21 L861Q.
      Patients on the study will not have had previous tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment.

      Patients who have one of the following EGRF mutations: exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S7681, or exon
      21 L861Q) may be eligible to participate in this study. If enrolled into the study, the study
      team will give the patient a supply of the study drug, osimbertinib (80 mg) to take at home.
      The patient will be asked to take the study drug by mouth on days 1-28 of each study cycle.
      As part of this study, the patient will have blood samples other tests, exams and procedures
      done for study purposes and their standard of care. Patient participation in the study will
      last for up to 2 years after completion of the last dose of the study drug or until your
      condition worsens or intolerable adverse events as deemed by the study doctor.

      There are possible patient risks to this study that include but are not limited to diarrhea,
