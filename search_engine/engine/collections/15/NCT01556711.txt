    
      The purpose of the current study is proposed to prospectively validate the BrainScope Ahead®
      M-100 device design, performance, and labeling with respect to the device's target intended
      use and indications for use:

        -  Primary Endpoint:

             -  Structural Injury Assessment

             -  There are four co-primary endpoints in this study: two sets of sensitivity and
                specificity to divide the data into three classes.

             -  Using a BrainScope classification algorithm, the Ahead® M100 will identify subjects
                showing sensitivities among 3 classes: Green-normal, nonhead injured
                controls,Yellow-head injured subjects who do not exhibit brain electrical activity
                that is consistent with a structural brain injury observable on CT or for whom CT
                was not deemed necessary,Red-head injured subjects who exhibit brain electrical
                activity consistent with a structural brain injury observable by CT.

        -  Secondary Endpoint:

             -  Functional Injury Assessment

             -  There are two co-secondary endpoints for the secondary objective, the sensitivity
                and specificity to split Yellow from the primary endpoint into two sub groups
                depending on degree of brain functional impairment observable by an evaluation of
                the clinical findings on a clinical charter used as the assessment of truth.
