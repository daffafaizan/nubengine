      steroidal, immunosuppressive, or biologic therapies, and are forced to seek surgery or other

      PROCHYMALÂ® adult human stem cells are manufactured from healthy, volunteer donors,
      extensively tested, and are stored to be available as needed. Human and animal studies have
      shown that the cells do not require any donor-recipient matching. The cells may have both
      immunosuppressive and healing benefits in Crohn's disease. The cells naturally migrate
      specifically to sites of inflammation, so their effects are believed to be local and
      self-limiting rather than systemic.

      Protocol 610 is an extension study offered only to those subjects who successfully achieved
      clinical benefit (reduction of CDAI of at least 100 points) in Protocol 603.
