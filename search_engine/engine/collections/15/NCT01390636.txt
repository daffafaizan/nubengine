    
      The specific aims of the proposed research are to:

      2.1 Determine the degree of variation in glycemic profiles of individuals with an Eating
      Disorder and Type 1 Diabetes (ED-DMT1) and an Eating Disorder only (ED/only); and

      2.2 Determine the impact of nutritional intake and planned physical activity on glucose
      profiles of individuals with ED-DMT1 and ED/only.

      These aims will be examined by characterizing:

        -  glucose exposure, as measured by area under the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) median
           curve;

        -  glucose variability, as measured by the AGP inter-quartile range; and

        -  glucose stability, as measured by change in the AGP median curve.
