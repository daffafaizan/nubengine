      tranexamic acid has any effect on blood loss during maxillofacial trauma surgery, or the
      subsequent postoperative sequelae. Intraoperative bleeding is calculated from anaesthesia
      chart and recorded in ml. Postoperative ecchymosis and bleeding are recorded as dichotomous
      events (yes/no) and are subjectively rated by both patient and surgeon on postoperative days
      1and 2. Any surgical or postoperative complications are noted. Scores are aggregated for
      statistical analysis.
