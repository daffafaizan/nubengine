      areas of the mouth during the required time. By connecting phone to the Oral-B App, the
      genius toothbrush uses facial recognition technology to guide patient's brushing, zone to
      zone. Pressure control and personalization are another characteristics of these toothbrushes.
      Pressure sensor alerts patient if the brushing is too hard and helps her/him not to put too
      much pressure by reducing the speed of brush head. Due to the Bluetooth technology,
      toothbrushing can be performed more efficiently among orthodontic adolescent patients. In
      addition, the position detection and timer can be used to control which area is brushed in
      the mouth and how much total brushing time is continued. The application allows patient to
      see all the days brushing activity and real-time feedback on brushing habits can be received
      by this way.
