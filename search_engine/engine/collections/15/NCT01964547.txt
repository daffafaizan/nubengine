      placebo-controlled, parallel group study which evaluated the effect of Sativex on cognitive
      performance. At each scheduled clinic visit, patients were assessed for cognitive
      performance, mood, severity of spasticity, use of investigational medicinal products and
      number of visits to a healthcare professional. Primary efficacy comparisons were made between
      scores recorded during baseline and scores recorded at the end of treatment.
