    
      A randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled, one-session clinical trial with 30
      male volunteers was performed by applying a microneedle patch in the following regions of the
      oral cavity: lip (inner lower), buccal (cheek: 1 cm behind the month angle), tongue (dorsal
      surface), hard palate (anterior region), and attached gingiva (between central and lateral
      upper incisors). A 30 gauge hypodermic needle and an identical patch but without microneedles
      sticking out, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The application
      force was standardized to 10N by an applicator composed of a 5 mL syringe and a spring.
      Insertions were performed with a gap of 30 seconds. Pain and discomfort associated to the
      procedure was evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), by a blinded-dentist. The safety
      associated to microneedle application was verified immediately after the application (0h) and
      after the next day (24h). The different application sites were inspected visually for
      bleeding, ulceration, bruising, redness or swelling.
