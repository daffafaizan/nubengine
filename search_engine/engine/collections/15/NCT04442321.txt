    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using Percutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (PENS). PENS is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, mid and long-term
      of PENS on intensity of pain as measured by numeric pain rating scale and disability as
      measured by Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) in patients with lateral
      epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS plus exercise program or Sham
      PENS plus exercise program.

      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, medium and
      long-term of PENS on disability as measured by DASH questionnaire, and psychological factors
      (fear and avoidance and catastrophism) and Global Rating of Change (GRoC) in patients with
      lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS plus exercise program
      or Sham PENS plus exercise program.
