      The patient will be prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass. A transversal aortotomy will be
      performed as usual. The aortic valve will be exposed for the resection. The NCB will be
      inserted under visual control from the aorta to the left ventricle. The collection chamber
      will be closed and the circular blade can be advanced forward to resect the diseased native
      aortic valve. Once the resection is completed the device will be retrieved carefully.
      Complementary fine cleaning of the aortic annulus can be done by the surgeon in order to
      prepare the annulus to receive the prosthetic valve. After implantation of the new valve
      classically the aortotomy will be closed. Standard weaning of cardiopulmonary bypass will be
      done and the operation will be safely completed. The aim of this blade is to evaluate the
      resection time, test the efficiency of a circular Nitinol blade during resection of the
      calcified native aortic leaflets. A careful examination of the resection edges, aortic
      annulus, mitral valve and all surrounding tissues will be done in order to validate the
      efficacy of this Nitinol Circular Blade.
