      (Cannabis placebo). The subjects, Investigators and designees involved in the conduct of the
      study will be blinded to the identity of the treatment administered during the study.

      In the active group (Arm A) subjects will be administered four single doses of 20 mg THC over
      3 days, equivalent to 285.7 μg/kg. This dose is considered to be sufficient for eliciting the
      psychoactive effects of THC (> 5 ng/mL in plasma) and modify EEG, avoiding subjects to be too
      much behaviorally impaired.

      THC will be administered in the form of medical cannabis (Bedrocan®) inhaled by
      intrapulmonary route. It is featured in flos form (Cannabis sativa dried female flower)
      containing THC 22% and cannabidiol (CBD) <1%. A vaporization system (Mighty® Medic device)
      will be used for cannabis administration. Through this system, the final inhalation of THC is
      comparable to that of smoking cannabis while reducing the inhalation of toxic and irritating
      substances generated in the combustion of herbs.
