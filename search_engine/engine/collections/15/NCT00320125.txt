      causes of osteoporosis is the inadequate calcium intake during the pediatric age range of
      birth to 20 years of age. We believe that this low calcium may start at birth since the fetus
      is actively accumulating calcium during the last trimester of pregnancy. Adolescents
      generally have poor calcium intake. Our study is to compare the newborn bone mass from
      adolescent mothers who are taking the recommended calcium intake from dairy foods or
      non-dairy foods such as orange juice during pregnancy.
