    
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized crossover study evaluating the performance
      of a closed-loop (CL) insulin delivery system using a subcutaneous glucose sensor and an
      external insulin pump comparing the peak post-prandial glucose levels and the post-prandial
      glucose AUC during either CL control alone or CL control with the InsuPatch in an inpatient
      hospital research unit (HRU) setting. The closed loop visit consists of approximately 67
      hours over 4 days and 3 nights.
