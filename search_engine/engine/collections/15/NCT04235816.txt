      implementation of this intervention, we propose to carry out a large-scale clinical trial on
      the impact on all-cause mortality up to 18 months of age of AZi administration through EPI.
      The potential development of antibiotic and SP resistance, AZi and SP interactions with
      routine immunizations, as well as the safety and the impact on the health system will be all
      assessed in the ICARIA trial.

      To provide the evidence needed to inform policy and practice and to accelerate the
      implementation of this intervention, a large-scale clinical trial on the impact on all-cause
      mortality up to 18 months of age of AZi administration through the World Health Organisation
      Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) will be carried out in Sierra Leone. The clinical
      trial will be individually randomised, placebo-controlled with a factorial design whereby AZi
      will be administered alongside routine preventive health interventions of the EPI, such as
      immunisations and Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi), which is recommended
      by the WHO for malaria prevention in this age group. The potential development of antibiotic
      resistance, the interactions with routine immunisations, the safety and the impact on the
      health system of AZi administration will be all assessed in this trial.
