    
      Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are evaluated for risk factors of CNS relapse
      during initial staging (age > 60years, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > reference range,
      clinical stage III/IV, performance status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) >1, kidney and/or adrenal gland involvement, involvement > 1 extranodal organ)
      including evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid.

      All patients with systemic DLBCL without CNS involvement are treated with systemic
      chemotherapy: either 6 cycles of R CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
      vincristine, prednison) +2xR (rituximab) or 6 cycles of DA EPOCH R (dose adjusted etoposide,
      prednison, vincristin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) +2xR (rituximab). Patients with â‰¥ 2
      risk factors for CNS relapse or with occult meningeal involvement will be randomized in 1:1
      ratio either into arm A with 2 cycles of prophylactic methotrexate 3g/m2 i.v., or into arm B
      with prophylactic 6x intrathecal methotrexate 12mg (1x intrathecal methotrexate in each cycle
      of systemic chemotherapy). Patients with 0-1 risk factor will be allocated into arm C without
      CNS prophylaxis. Patients will be observed for CNS relapse during the follow-up of 1year
      after the end of the first-line treatment.
