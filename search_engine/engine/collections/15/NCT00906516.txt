      practitioner is left with best effort combination therapy for this disease. At present a
      number of chemotherapeutic agents, including nitrosoureas, carboplatin, bevacizumab,
      etoposide, irinotecan, and imatinib, have been used as salvage therapy either alone or in
      combination. Additional trials with a variety of agents are underway, but preliminary results
      from single-agent studies have been disappointing. Currently, only nitrosoureas (lomustine
      and carmustine), including Gliadel® Wafer (carmustine) as adjunct to surgery, are approved
      for use in previously treated GBM. At present the treatment of recurrent disease with any
      available agent results in median survival in the ranges of 22-44 weeks. The historical data
      from previous human exposure with Neuradiab is highly suggestive of a benefit to patient
      survival.

      Since Neuradiab® has shown promising efficacy in patients with recurrent disease with
      acceptable risk-benefit ratio, and since there is no substantial survival benefit from
      currently available agents used to treat this patient population, Neuradiab® is being
      proposed as an experimental alternative to recurrent GBM patients under a Single-Center Phase
      II Trial. Recurrent GBM is a serious and immediately life-threatening disease, for which
      there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative drug or other therapy available to treat
      that stage of the disease. Overall, survival data indicate a need for more effective
      treatments for recurrent GBM.
