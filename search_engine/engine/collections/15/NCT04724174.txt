      alternative-Fistula Risk Score (ua-FRS) >20%) underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with either the
      PJ or PG technique. Optimal mitigation strategy (external stenting and octreotide omission)
      was applied for all patients. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of
      clinically relevant POPF. Data were entered prospectively into an institutional clinical
      database (NCT02871336).
