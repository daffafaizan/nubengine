    
      The study is a prospective, dose-finding, randomised, parallel group, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy and the safety of the oxytocin receptor
      antagonist OBE001 in 240 women undergoing embryo transfer following IVF or ICSI.

      The four-arm study (OBE001 dose 1, dose 2, dose 3, and placebo) design will allow evaluation
      of a possible dose-dependent pattern of action of OBE001 and, simultaneously, comparison of
      active compound with placebo with regard to both efficacy and safety.
