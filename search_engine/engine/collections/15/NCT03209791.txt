      that in turn induce skeletal muscle autophagy.

      Patients with alcoholic steatosis, hepatitis and cirrhosis (n=10 each) will be recruited from
      the liver transplant nutrition clinic or the hepatology inpatient service and their body
      composition quantified using anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, CT image
      analysis and DEXA if available.
