      enroll eligible patients with select IDH-mutant advanced hematologic malignancies. Once the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LY3410738 is
      established, the dose expansion will begin and enroll into 4 cohorts to further evaluate
      safety and clinical activity
