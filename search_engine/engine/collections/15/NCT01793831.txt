      through FMT as a therapy for CD (all age range,HBI>4). We established a standard microbiota
      isolation from donated fresh stool in lab. Then the microbiota is transplanted to mid-gut (at
      least below the duodenal papilla) through regular gastroscope. Patients from multi-clinical
      centers in this study will be assigned to receive FMT only once or traditional treatments
      according to associated guidelines and follow-up for at least one year. Blood tests,
      abdominal X-ray, endoscopy and questionnaire will be used to assess participants at study
      start and at study completion.
