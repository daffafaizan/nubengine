      2) reduce their occurrence, to improve the safety of cognitively impaired elders who continue
      to drive. This will be accomplished by placing small digital video event recording devices in
      the vehicles of 60 older cognitively impaired drivers. A 3-month baseline will establish the
      frequency of unsafe driving events, followed by a 3-month video feedback intervention during
      which the driver and family member will review the video recorded errors on a weekly basis.
      Active treatment will be compared to video monitoring with no feedback. A 6-month
      post-intervention phase will establish sustainability of the treatment.

      The results of this clinical trial will confirm the potential to improve driving safety among
      older drivers with cognitive impairment using a behavior modification approach aimed directly
      at the problem behaviors observed in their natural driving environment. Knowledge gained
      about the magnitude and duration of the treatment effect and the potential of using an
      internet based feedback program will provide the impetus to optimize and ultimately implement
      the intervention to improve the safety of older drivers with mild cognitive impairment and
      early AD.
