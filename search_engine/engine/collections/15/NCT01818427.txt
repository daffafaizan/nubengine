      the last decade, patients continue to be plagued with uncontrolled hemorrhage resulting in
      significant early mortality and the development of multiple organ failure and associated
      complications. A primary driving force for this unbridled hemorrhage has been shown to be the
      early coagulopathy which complicates severe injury. Increasing evidence suggests that blood
      component transfusion protocols that address this early coagulopathy, once a patient arrives
      at a trauma center, are associated with lower mortality and a reduction in blood component
      transfusion requirements. Prehospital interventions which quell this early coagulopathy in an
      earlier setting have the potential to minimize or even prevent this vicious hemorrhagic
      cascade, further lowering blood component transfusion requirements and reducing the resultant
      morbid sequelae which complicates severe injury.

      Objective/Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis will be that prehospital infusion of plasma
      during air medical transport in patients with hemorrhagic shock will lower 30 day mortality.
      The secondary hypotheses include that prehospital infusion of plasma will reduce 24 hour
      blood transfusion, multiple organ failure, nosocomial infection, and acute lung injury,
      reduce or prevent the early coagulopathy as demonstrated by improving presenting coagulation
      and thromboelastography parameters, and reduce the early inflammatory cytokine response,
      thrombomodulin and increase protein C levels.
