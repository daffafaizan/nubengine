      hematologic diseases. However, poor graft function (PGF) is an important complication after
      allo-HSCT that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable mortality
      related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually involves the
      prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF), or second transplantation, but these methods are associated with dismal effect or
      even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated
      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs
      include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host
      disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or
      cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs
      might be effective in the treatment of PGF.

      However, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF is unsatisfactory in our
      previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined
      with MSCs in the patients with PGF after allo-HSCT.
