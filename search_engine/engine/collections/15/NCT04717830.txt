      pharmacokinetics of the medicine for Ebola fever emergency prevention based on monoclonal
      recombinant antibodies in single use in healthy volunteers with a dose escalation. A
      consecutive recruitment of people who signed the Informed Consent Form into three groups of
      volunteers with different drug doses is made according to the volunteers' screening results.
      The total number of volunteers receiving the drug will be not less then 25 people.The purpose
      of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a medicine for Ebola
      fever emergency prevention based on monoclonal recombinant antibodies in a single dose in
      healthy volunteers.

      The study will include volunteers of both sexes, aged 18 to 45 years inclusive. Only 25
      people will take part in the study and will receive the study drug, of which 5 will receive
      1/10 of the therapeutic dose, 5 - 1/2 of the therapeutic dose, 15 - in the full therapeutic
      dose.

      Participation of 5 doubles is envisaged: 1 person for a group of 5 volunteers and 3 for 15.
