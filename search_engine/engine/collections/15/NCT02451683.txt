      grasp movements. Multiple descending volleys in the corticospinal tract generate multiple
      peaks in muscle responses (indirect (I)-waves). I-waves are a mechanism by which
      corticospinal neurons are transynaptically activated at periodic intervals of ~1.5 ms. This
      periodic activation contributes to the recruitment of spinal motoneurons and generation of
      movement. we will use paired-TMS to examine I-waves in surface EMG recordings from upper-limb
      muscles during reach and grasp movements.

      We will also identify motor cortical maps of upper-limb muscles involved in reach and grasp
      movements. We will use TMS guided by a frameless neuronavigation system to define the size
      and location of motor cortical maps of upper-limb muscles during reach and grasp movements.
      We will be able to determine overlaps and functional interactions between distal and proximal
      arm motor cortical representations. Our preliminary data shows that finger and biceps
      cortical maps largely overlap during reach and grasp movements in controls but considerable
      less in patients
