    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 3-month progression free survival (PFS) rate in metastatic urothelial
      cancer patients receiving afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) who have progressed despite prior
      platinum-based chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]),
      median progression free survival, and overall survival for the same treated population.

      II. To determine whether tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or HER2
      overexpression influences 3-month PFS in patients treated with afatinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42. Courses repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
