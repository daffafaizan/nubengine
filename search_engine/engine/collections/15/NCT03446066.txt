      Excessive daytime sleepiness and 20 healthy control group.

      all participants were subjected to:

        1. Careful history taking and Complete neurological examination.

        2. Initial assessment of cognition and sleepiness by two scales which were done once before
           sleep: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Minimental state examination (MMSE)

        3. Scales and neurophysiological studies done before and after sleep:Karolinska sleepiness
           scale (KSS), Trail making tests A and B (TMT), P300, and QEEG

        4. Polysomnography (PSG)

             -  EEG was recorded for 20 minutes duration before and after sleep recording. In each
                EEG recording, alpha attenuation test (AAT) was done after 10 minutes of recording
                basal resting EEG, then the absolute power of 5 electrodes (CZ, T3, T4, T5, T6,)
                were studied in the following frequency bands: delta (0.5-3Hz), theta (4-7 Hz) and
                also the absolute power of (O1, O2) were studied in delta, theta and alpha (8-12
                Hz) bands.
