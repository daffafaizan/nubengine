    
      Objective: This proposal is a part of an integrated project to test the efficacy of a
      candidate anxiolytic, a CRF1 receptor antagonist, provided by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as part
      of The Emory-MSSM-GSK-NIMH Collaborative Mood Disorders Initiative, using fear-potentiated
      startle. The anti-fear and anxiolytic activity of a single dose of the highly specific CRF1
      antagonist GSK561679 will be evaluated in healthy female subjects using models of phasic
      (fear) and sustained (anxiety) aversive states derived from humans and from pre-clinical
      studies in rodents.

      Study population: The study population will consist of 30 healthy female volunteers, 21-50
      years of age, and of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.

      Design: The study will use a double-blind cross-over design in which each subject will
      receive placebo, Alprazolam (1 mg), and a low (50 mg) and high (400 mg) dose of GSK561679. We
      will examine the effect of these drugs on the potentiation of startle during anticipation of
      no-shock, predictable shock signaled by a discrete threat cue, and unpredictable shock.

      Outcome measures: The main outcome measures are the magnitude of the startle reflex and
      retrospective anxiety during each condition. Secondary measures will include the skin
      conductance response and changes in heart rate, as well as measures of HPA activity.
