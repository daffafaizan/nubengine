      retinopathy (DR) have decrease in central vision from damage to photoreceptors. One of the
      mechanisms causing damage is high levels of oxygen in the eye. This damage produces specific
      biomarkers that can be measured in eye fluid (aqueous humor). In this study, these biomarkers
      will be assessed in people with Stargardt disease, age related macular degeneration and
      diabetic retinopathy, compared to controls.
