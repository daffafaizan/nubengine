      an increase of the symptoms (above all, the cough, the dyspnea and the quantity of sputum
      purulence). This is known as exacerbation, and it is the most frequent reason for hospital
      stay, urgences services and death in this condition. A physiotherapy program and an
      occupational therapy intervention are carrying out in patients attending to the Hospital
      because of an exacerbation.. Participants will be assessed at baseline and again at the end
      of the study.
