      clinical setting, infants' eyes are inspected for eye development, defect, and disease. There
      is anecdotal and clinical evidence that infants experience stress after eye dilation.
      Investigators will evaluate whether eye shields for infants after dilated eye exam lessen
      stress and discomfort.
