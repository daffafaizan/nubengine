      8 weeks versus placebo in IBS-D patients. Efficacy is evaluated in terms of overall symptom
      relief and abdominal pain/discomfort relief after 8 weeks of treatment. The clinical phase of
      the study comprises a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free),an 8-week double-blind treatment
      period and a 2-week treatment withdrawal period, resulting in a 10-week overall duration of
      the study for each patient.

      Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in an electronic diary (web-and telephone
      based)during all periods of the study.
