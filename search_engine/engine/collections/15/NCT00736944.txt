    
      Primary objective:

      To determine the clinical CR rate (CR-p) at the primary tumor site to an IC regimen of weekly
      Abraxane and cetuximab with CF (ACCF) given for two cycles (over 6 weeks) in patients with
      locally advanced non-metastatic HNSCC. The assessment of primary tumor site response will be
      performed by the treating physician by careful clinical examination using WHO criteria.
      Radiographic studies will also be performed to assess primary tumor site response but will be
      used primarily to confirm lack of disease progression that may not be detected based on
      clinical examination alone.

      The secondary objectives include:

        -  Document the clinical PR rate (PR-p) at the primary tumor site with this IC regimen

        -  Document the clinical CR and PR rates at the involved regional nodes (CR-n and PR-n)
           with this IC regimen

        -  Document the clinical overall CR rate (CR-o) (defined as achievement of a CR at the
           primary tumor site and at the involved regional nodes) and the clinical overall PR rate
           (PR-o) with this IC regimen

        -  Document the CR (CR-p, CR-n, and CR-o) and PR (PR-p, PR-n, and PR-o) rates by FDG uptake
           on PET scan after this IC regimen

        -  Document radiographic CR (CR-p, CR-n, and CR-o) and PR (PR-p, PR-n, and PR-o) rates as
           assessed by conventional CT scan using RECIST criteria after this IC regimen.

        -  Correlate primary tumor site, nodal and overall tumor response rates based on WHO
           criteria of assessment with that based on CT scan and FDG-PET/CT.

        -  Document and quantify SPARC expression by IHC in primary tumor tissue obtained at
           baseline in each patient and attempt to correlate these results with primary tumor site
           response to ACCF.

        -  Document and grade AE's with this IC regimen with a pre-planned safety analysis after
           the first ten patients have completed the IC regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free
           survival (PFS) of this patient population.
