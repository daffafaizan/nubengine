      enriched with plant sterol esters and fish oil on fasting TG concentrations.

      The study also aims to investigate the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting TC,
      LDL-C, HDL-C and non-HDL-C.

      At last, the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting apolipoprotein concentrations
      will be explored. This exploratory objective will only be analyzed if a relevant treatment
      effect on fasting triglycerides concentrations is observed.
