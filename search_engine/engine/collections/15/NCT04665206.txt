    
      Dose escalation will employ a traditional 3 + 3 design to assess safety of VT3989 in patients
      with refractory metastatic solid tumors or advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. The RP2D may
      be less than the MTD depending on the type and severity of AEs that occur during and after
      the first cycle.

      In Dose Expansion, patients will be enrolled into 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 - malignant pleural
      mesothelioma patients with mutations of NF2 that have progressed on or following standard
      therapy; and Cohort 2 - solid tumor patients with mutations of NF2 that have progressed on or
      following standard therapy. Patients will be treated at the MTD or RP2D identified in Part 1,
      to provide further characterization of the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and biological
      activity of VT3989.
