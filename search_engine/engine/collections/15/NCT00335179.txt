      profiles of actinic keratosis (AK) lesions that were treated with imiquimod 5% cream or
      vehicle cream once daily 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Secondary objectives were to assess
      the utility of confocal microscopy (CM) to visually track cellular response to treatment with
      study cream compared with clinical and histological evaluations, and to evaluate the safety
      of treatment with imiquimod in subjects with AK on the balding scalp.
