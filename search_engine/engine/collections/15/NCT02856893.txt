    
      Primary objective To evaluate the best strategy for delivering Osimertinib (AZD9291) in NSCLC
      patients with EGFR mutation. The objective is assessed by Progression Free Survival rate at
      18 months (PFS-18).

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate PFS on Osimertinib measured from randomization by RECIST criteria 1.1 [Ref
           33].

        -  To evaluate PFS measured from switching to Osimertinib by RECIST criteria 1.1 [Ref 33].

        -  To determine the proportion of patients receiving Osimertinib based on the determination
           of cfDNA T790M mutation positive.

        -  To evaluate time to symptomatic brain metastases in patients with presence of brain
           metastases at study entry.

        -  To evaluate PFS-2 (defined as the sum of the PFS to Gefitinib and the PFS to Osimertinib
           treatment).

        -  To evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR) to Osimertinib.

        -  To evaluate the Treatment duration.

        -  To evaluate Time to progression (TTP) on Osimertinib (measured from switching to
           osimertinib).

        -  To evaluate Overall Survival (OS).

        -  To evaluate time to brain progression (TTBP).

        -  Safety.
