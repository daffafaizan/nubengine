      Education and Reaching Target), a multi-component hypertension intervention was developed.
      Eligible patients were identified via the healthcare system's electronic health record.

      Inclusion criteria included:

        1. 18-39 years old at the start of the study,

        2. previous hypertension ICD-9 coded office visits and

        3. uncontrolled hypertension (â‰¥140/90 mmHg) based on the last ambulatory blood pressure
           reading.

      Exclusion criteria included a pre-defined list of co-morbidities, in addition to planned or
      current pregnancy, any health condition that limits physical activity or dietary changes,
      current participation in another study, and planning to leave the area in the next three
      months. During the feasibility study, all participants continued to receive usual
      hypertension care from their primary care provider. The intervention involved health coach
      calls over a 3-month period using self-management modules. The order of the modules was
      guided by the participant's choice. All encounters were documented in the electronic health
      record. Patient acceptability and home blood pressure monitoring survey data was acquired.
