      manifest some deterioration in their renal function. The latter is associated with
      unfavorable outcomes: prolonged hospitalization and death. Cardiorenal syndrome type 1 (CRS1)
      is defined as a deterioration in renal function manifested by an increase in serum creatinine
      level by >0.3 mg% compared to patient's baseline level. The etiology of CRS1 is not clear and
      may be related to body fluid overload congesting the kidneys or dehydration reducing
      perfusion to the kidneys. Body fluid status is affected by diuretics. Presently, the
      practitioner has no objective data to assess whether CRS1 resulted from fluid overload or
      dehydration.

      In this study investigators plan to measure hemodynamic parameters from all patients admitted
      with CRS1 to our department. Parameters will be measured using the noninvasive bio-impedance
      system (NICAS). Randomly, patients will be allocated to either a study or control group. In
      the study group, the hemodynamic variables of the NICAS system will be available to the
      caring physicians. The physicians will use the data according to their discretion. The
      hemodynamic system is a decision making supporting system and therefore the physician may use
      the data according to his/her understanding. In the control group, the hemodynamic variables
      of the NICAS system will not be available to the caring physicians.

      We hypothesize that using the NICAS system as a decision making supporting system will
      improve patient management by decreasing length of hospitalization, and shortening the time
      interval to reverse creatinine to its baseline level.
