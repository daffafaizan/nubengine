      derangement to the alveolar structures, airways, pulmonary blood vessels, pleura and/or
      mediastinum. The purpose of this project is to permit the comprehensive evaluation of
      patients referred to the Pulmonary Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
      (NHLBI) in order to: (1) develop an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of these
      disorders; and (2) identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for other NHLBI
      protocols. Testing and procedures will only be performed when medically indicated for the
      purposes of making a diagnosis or obtaining information likely to be useful in the management
      of the subjects' disease or condition.
