    
      Objective of the study is to characterize the cardiovascular phenotype of patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, relative to the presence of hypertension or not.
      Hypertension should not have been previously treated. 2 groups of apneic patients (SAS+HTA+
      and SAS+HTA-) will be compared together, referred to group of non apneic but hypertensive
      patients (SAS-HTA+) and non apneic / non hypertensive patients (SAS-HTA-).

      Apneic and hypertensive patients may have a sympathetic nervous system activation and a much
      more important vascular and baroreceptor reflex impairment, than non apneic but hypertensive
      patients.

      During the study, a second visit as control will be done for apneic patients only, 3 to 6
      months after SAS treatment setting.
