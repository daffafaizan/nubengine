      settings, there is a growing need to obtain safer, faster, and more secure hemostasis
      following these procedures. Due to its automatic deployment feature and simplicity in
      operation. AbsorbaSeal (ABS 5.6.7) will lead to more widespread use and improve patient
      outcomes. The active closure system used in the ABS 5.6.7 ensures a secure closure. The
      composition of the seal used is completely bio-absorbable and does not require the use of
      adjunct materials (i.e. collagen, sutures, staples, etc.) needed in many of the devices
      currently available.

      Extensive laboratory testing, acute animal labs and deployment in chronic animal studies were
      performed with ABS 6. After a few device modification to create the improved ABS 5.6.7, only
      minimal confirmatory testing was performed with the current, modified ABS 5.6.7. The
      extensive test results on the previous device iterations are used to complete the
      confirmatory testing of the ABS 5.6.7 design.

      The First in Man (FIM) trial (CP001) supports the initial safety and effectiveness of ABS
      5.6.7 in humans (n=20) and was completed prior to application for a pivotal Investigational
      Device Exemption (IDE) Study in the United States and a CE Mark Study approval (CP004CE) in
      the European Union.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the ABS
      5.6.7. Enrollment into this study will include anatomically eligible patients requiring
      diagnostic and interventional procedures. Patients will be followed procedurally to
      discharge, at one month, (follow-up commitment). Secondary objectives are to further
      characterize adverse events (serious and non-serious), clinical utility measures, and
      health-related quality of life.
