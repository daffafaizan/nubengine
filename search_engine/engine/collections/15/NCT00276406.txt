      managed with laxatives. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase colonic motility. The study
      evaluated the effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor (pyridostigmine vs. placebo) on
      gastrointestinal and colonic transit and bowel function in diabetic patients with
      constipation.

      After a 9-day baseline period, patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic constipation
      without defecatory disorder will be randomized to oral placebo or pyridostigmine, starting
      with 60 mg three times a day, increasing by 60 mg every third day up to the maximum tolerated
      dose of 120 mg three times a day; this dose will be maintained for 7 days. Gastrointestinal
      and colonic transit (assessed by scintigraphy) and bowel function will be evaluated at
      baseline and the final 3 and 7 days of treatment, respectively.
