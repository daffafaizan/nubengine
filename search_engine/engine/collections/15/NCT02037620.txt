      in the proposed experiments. Participants will be screened for eligibility, followed by 80
      days of usual care, epidural implantation, 80 days of cardiovascular epidural stimulation
      training, 80 days of voluntary movement (VM) epidural stimulation training and finally 80
      days of stand epidural stimulation training. These interventions are done in sequential
      order, however they are cumulative. In between each intervention, participants will undergo
      motor and cardiovascular experiments and assessments.
