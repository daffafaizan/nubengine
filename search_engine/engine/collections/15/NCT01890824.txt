      healthy controls. The first visit includes the informed consent and a screening and the
      second and third visit for the study days before chemotherapy and the fourth and fifth visit
      for the study days after chemotherapy. For the first test day, 2 hours of the subjects time
      will be for urine and blood sample collection, and to ingest the deuterated water. Subjects
      are allowed to go home after and eat normally. On the second study day, subjects will arrive
      early that morning and a DXA scan will be performed first. For the duration of the study,
      subjects have to lie in the bed (except for bathroom privileges). They can watch tv or bring
      and use a book/tablet. The research nurse or study staff will be present in the human subject
      area to assist the subject if necessary. Subjects are not allowed to eat or drink during the
      second test day, except for the test drink (meal) and water. One IV catheter will be placed
      in a vein of the arm/hand for blood draws. The hand will be placed in a hot box during blood
      collection. Another IV catheter will be placed in the contra-lateral forearm for a primed and
      continuous infusion of 2H5-glycerol. Over the two day time period, a total of 100-120 ml of
      blood will be obtained over approximately 19 samples. Stable isotopes will be ingested on the
      first test day, added to the test drinks on the second test day after the second hour, and
      infused on the second day. On the second test day, subjects will fill out questionnaires and
      perform muscle function tests. After completion of the study, we will provide the subject
      with a meal.
