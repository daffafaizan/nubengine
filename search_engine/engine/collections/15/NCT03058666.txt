      superior to "usual care" and provides for some patients effective surfactant therapy with
      less need for endotracheal intubation and instillation of a surfactant suspension into the
      airway. Two cohorts will be recruited: (a) patients who did not receive surfactant at birth
      who develop RDS in the first hours of life and (b) patients who received instillation of
      surfactant for RDS in the first hour of life, were extubated, and have continuing RDS.
