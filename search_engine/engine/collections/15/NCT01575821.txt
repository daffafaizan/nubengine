      and parents miss a day of work. In an attempt to threat cough, caregivers frequently
      administer OTC medication to their children,with their attendant risks, kack of proven
      efficacy and the disapproval of professional organizations such as the AAP and the FDA. The
      WHO has noted honey as a potential treatment for cough and cold symptoms. Honey has
      antioxidant properties and increases cytokine release. The objective of this trial was to
      compare the effects on nocturnal cough and the sleep difficulty associated with URIs of a
      single nocturnal dose of three different honey products compared to placebo
