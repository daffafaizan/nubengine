      additional respiratory management such bi-level positive airway pressure.We supposed the
      patients with stroke can take benefit of functional recovery form bi-level positive airway
      pressure. We choose the patients who suffered ischemic stroke in 48 hours ，then evaluate the
      respiratory status. Stroke patients who were diagnosed as sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome will
      accept additional treatment with bi-level positive airway pressure for 7 night（per night 6
      hours）.Then the modified Rankin scale score and NIHSS will be recorded at 30 days and 90 days
      after stroke.
