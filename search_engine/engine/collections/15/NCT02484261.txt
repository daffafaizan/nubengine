      chimerism in peripheral blood will be monitored in real time at scheduled intervals. If
      chimerism of CD34+ cells diminishes post-HSCT or clinical signs or symptoms of relapsed
      leukemia, relapse in bone marrow will be confirmed, after which immunosuppression will be
      withdrawn and treatment initiated with bortezomib and pravastatin. Patients will be monitored
      for disease response until 1 year post-HSCT or post-study therapy. Patients with confirmed
      relapse post-HSCT will also be eligible to enroll and receive novel combination.
