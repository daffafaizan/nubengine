      enlargement in approximately one third of neutropenic patients who are chronically treated
      with this drug. Short courses, 5 to 6-days, of G-CSF are used to increase the yield of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis from peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      donors. G-CSF mobilized PBSC concentrates are increasingly replacing marrow as a source of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells for transplants involving HLA-compatible relatives. PBSC
      donors experience splenomegaly and rarely, spontaneous rupture of the spleen. Since
      splenomegaly is a risk factor for splenic rupture, it is important to determine the incidence
      and time course of splenic enlargement in PBSC concentrate donors. This protocol will
      prospectively study 40 subjects donating G-CSF mobilized PBSC for HLA compatible relatives or
      donating PBSC's for laboratory investigations at the Department of Transfusion Medicine in
      the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center. The subjects will be given G-CSF for 5 days and a
      PBSC concentrate will be collected on day 5. Ultrasound scans will be used to assess their
      spleen size. The scans will be performed before G-CSF administration and the day the last
      PBSC concentrate is collected. A third scan will be performed 10 or 11 days after the last
      PBSC is collected. The effects of several parameters on spleen size will be assessed
      including: donor age, gender, race and changes in liver function assays, white blood cell
      counts, platelet counts, and CD34+ cell counts.
