    
      a CT image that includes a contrast agent that helps to identify the location of the tumour.
      Small markers will be placed on the participants head prior to the scan so that the
      investigators can align this CT image with the tracking technology used during the surgery.

      The participant will be moved to the surgical table, where the surgery will proceed as it
      would for standard of care procedures. The tracking technology and optical imaging will be
      used to identify where the tumour is located at the tissue surface

        -  Tumour tissue and extra tissue surrounding the tumour will be removed, as would occur
           normally in surgery. Some markers may be placed on the tissue where it is cut. These
           will be helpful in matching the tissue that is removed with its location in the images.

        -  A second CT image will be taken immediately following the tissue removal. This will be
           made using an imaging device called a cone beam CT.

        -  In collaboration with the pathology department, whole mount tissue samples will be
           assessed to determine the location of tumour tissue. Using the markings on the tissue
           and images taken of the tissue sample after it has been removed, the location of the
           tumour in the tissue sample will be compared to the location of the tumour in the CT
           image and the location of the surface tumour determined by the optical imaging
           technology.

        -  The CT images may be analyzed by radiation oncologists, surgeons and physicists.
