      procedure occurs in a significant proportion of patients (25% at Hackensack University
      Medical Center in men >60) and is a significant management problem. Typically, this
      complication needs to be treated with placement of a bladder catheter (foley). In addition to
      the discomfort of placing a foley in an awake patient, these patients are at a significantly
      increased risk of a catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), potential
      genito-urinary injury during the placement, and bladder muscle damage due to distention.

      The goal of this study is to investigate whether the use of Tamusolin could lower the high
      incidence of POUR in older men undergoing a thoracic surgical procedure.

      The investigators hypothesize that pre-operative administration of Tamusolin (Flomax,
      0.4mg/day x 1 week), with ongoing use post-operatively until normal voiding resumes, will
      result in a significant decrease in the incidence of POUR after a thoracic surgical
      procedure.
