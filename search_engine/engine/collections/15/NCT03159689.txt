      nuts (1.5oz) per day, while the other diet will include an equal amount of calories from a
      carbohydrate source, such as a pretzel snack. All subjects will receive a dietary plan that
      reduces their usual intake by 500kcal/day with the same percentage of fat, protein and
      carbohydrates for the first 12 weeks followed a diet with their usual intake for 12 weeks
      without nuts or pretzels.
