      study. Dynamic vision will be assessed through the administration of the Dynamic Visual
      Acuity (DVA) test and the Gaze Stabilization Test (GST). Additionally, the 6-condition
      Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), which is currently a component of CSUN's established
      concussion protocol, will be administered to assess balance impairments. This cluster of
      tests will be administered three times per athlete: (1) during preseason to establish
      baseline measures, (2) acutely post-concussion once the athlete subject has been cleared by
      the team physician for return to exercise, and (3) when cleared to return to sport. The
      results will be used to evaluate whether or not dynamic vision results have returned to
      baseline by the time that CSUN Athletics clears the athlete to "Return to Play."
