      to oxygenate, not failure to intubate, that ultimately leads to brain injury and
      cardiovascular collapse, effective mask ventilation is at least as important as successful
      intubation. Therefore optimizing mask ventilation is crucial for clinicians. When difficult
      mask ventilation encounters, clinicians often switch to two hand technique to hold the mask
      including either "C-E" clamp or "V-E" clamp. Both volume mode ventilation and pressure mode
      ventilation are superior with the V-E technique as compared to the C-E technique. The study
      will test the hypothesis that a novel reversal V-E mask ventilation technique will retain its
      high efficiency as that of standard V-E technique but be easier to use than standard V-E
      technique.
