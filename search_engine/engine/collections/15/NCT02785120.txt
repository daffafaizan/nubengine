    
      This randomized, double-blind (within dose), placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be
      conducted in 2 parts to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TF0023 spray versus placebo in
      functional improvement in patients with ischemic strokes. Part A will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of TF0023 spray in a higher dose . Efficacy will be assessed by the change in
      modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score from baseline to Week 16. At Week 16, a blinded interim
      analysis will be performed to determine if TF0023 shows positive results with a higher
      proportion of patients in the TF0023 group showing a more favorable outcome compared with the
      placebo group. If the results are positive, then Part B will be initiated to further evaluate
      safety and efficacy of TF0023 spray as well as to determine the best dosing regimen for the
      signs and symptoms and functional improvement of patients with ischemic strokes.

      Part A In Part A , approximately 200 patients who are stable per the NIHSS will be screened
      as early as 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and approximately 75 will be
      randomized to active or placebo treatment in a 2:1 ratio (TF0023 [50 patients] and placebo
      [25 patients]).

      Each patient enrolled in Group A will receive study treatment in a double-blind manner for 16
      weeks starting between 3 and 60 days after the onset of stroke symptoms (Day 1 of the study).
      Qualified study personnel will instruct the patients and/or caregivers how to apply the study
      treatment accurately so that patients or caregivers will administer high dose of either
      TF0023 or placebo twice daily (approximately every 12 hours).

      Patients will return to the study site at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 for efficacy and safety
      assessments. After the Week 16 assessments have been performed, patients will receive active
      treatment in an open-label manner starting the next day through the end of the study (EOS) at
      Week 32. Patients will return to the study site at Week 24 and Week 32 (EOS) for efficacy and
      safety assessments. An Early Termination visit will occur if the patient is discontinued from
      the study prematurely. Patients will have a follow-up visit approximately 14 days after the
      Early Termination visit or the Week 32 (EOS) visit.

      An interim analysis will be performed using the data collected through the study up to and
      including the Week 16 visit. If the analysis of the mRS shows that treatment with TF0023 is
      positive compared with placebo (mRS score of 0 to 2 indicates functional independence), Part
      B will start to enroll patients. If the analysis shows that treatment with TF0023 is not
      positive compared with placebo (mRS score >2), Part B will not enroll any patients.

      Part B In Part B, approximately 400 patients who are stable per the NIHSS will be screened as
      early as 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and approximately 150 will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Group B (middle dose of TF0023 or placebo twice daily) or Group
      C (low dose of TF0023 or placebo twice daily ). Patients will be further randomized in a 2:1
      ratio within each treatment group: Group B - TF0023 middle dose bid [50 patients] or placebo
      [25 patients]) and Group C (TF0023 low dose bid [50 patients] or placebo [25 patients]). The
      study design in Part B will be the same as used in Part A.

      Each patient enrolled in either Group B or Group C will receive study treatment in a double
      blind manner for 16 weeks starting between 3 and 60 days after the onset of stroke symptoms
      (Day 1 of the study).

      Patients will return to the study site at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 for efficacy and safety
      assessments. After the Week 16 assessments have been performed, patients will receive active
      treatment in an open-label manner starting the next day through the EOS at Week 32. That is,
      patients who were receiving active treatment during the double-blinded period will continue
      to receive active treatment, and patients who were receiving placebo will switch to active
      treatment for the remaining 16 weeks of the study. Patients will have a follow-up visit
      approximately 14 days after the Early Termination visit or the Week 32 (EOS) visit.
