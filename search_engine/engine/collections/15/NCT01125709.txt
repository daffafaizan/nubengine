      of this study is to be able to compare the results of clinical trials done by different
      networks using distinct strength endpoints. If results indicate a distinct difference in
      reliability of one tool over the other, a standardized tool could be established for research
      groups throughout the world to interpret strength in the context of clinical trials. If the
      results indicate minor differences then it would be possible to interpret and
      compare/contrast strength measurements used in different studies.

      Understanding the relationship between the HHM vs CQMS will help us examine other surrogate
      measures capable of predicting functionality that are based on strength measurements.
