      that insulin resistance is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including
      ischemic stroke, and that dietary and lifestyle intervention can reduce insulin resistance as
      well as these disease risks. Nonetheless, current intervention strategies have done little to
      reduce overall stroke incidence. Therefore, an intervention, such as prolonged medically
      supervised water-only fasting, might be an effective strategy to both reduce insulin
      resistance and encourage dietary and lifestyle changes that reduce incidence of stroke.

      This pilot study is designed to investigate the effect of water-only fasting and refeeding on
      the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a measure of insulin resistance.
      Additionally, the study will assess if markers of cardiovascular health and inflammation
      change before and after water-only fasting. Water-only fasting participants will be recruited
      from patients who voluntarily elect to water-only fast for 10 or more consecutive days.
      Clinical variables and blood will be collected at baseline, every 7th day during fasting and
      refeeding, and the final day of fasting and refeeding.
