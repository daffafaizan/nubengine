    
      This first in-patient randomized, double blind, multicenter, multinational,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-dose 2-phase study combines a dose-escalation phase (1b) and a
      consolidation phase (2a).

      Dose Escalation (Phase 1b):

      Phase 1b was designed to (I) assess the dose- related safety and potential efficacy of
      glenzocimab administered as soon as possible and no later than 3 hours after the start of
      thrombolysis with tPA (itself administered within 4.5 hrs of the onset of acute ischemic
      stroke symptoms), and (II) identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      During this phase, patients were unevenly randomized between groups, to obtain a total of 60
      patients, 12 at each dose level. At the starting level, 8 patients received either
      glenzocimab at the lowest pharmacologically active dose of 125 mg (n=4) or the matching
      placebo(n=4). After real-time review by the DSMB of clinical safety and a CT scan (and where
      available MRI) and giving a favorable opinion, the next patients were randomized in the
      second cohort (n=8) with 4 patients under a higher dose of 250 mg, 2 patients remaining at
      the initial starting dose (125 mg), and 2 patients under placebo. Following the same process,
      and after favorable opinion from the DSMB, patients were randomized in the third cohort
      (n=10) and received glenzocimab 500 mg (n=4), randomized versus 250 mg (n=2), 125 mg (n=2) or
      placebo (n=2). Similarly, the fourth cohort (n=12) randomized patients between ahigher dose
      of 1000 mg (n=4), versus 500 mg (n=2), 250 mg (n=2), 125 mg (n=2), or placebo (n=2). Once
      this fourth cohort completed, the DSMB issued a further positive opinion and the fifth cohort
      (n=22) randomized patients to 1000 mg (n=8), versus 500 mg (n=6), 250 mg (n=4), 125 mg (n=2),
      or placebo (n=2).

      Consolidation Phase with Final Dose (Phase 2a):

      After having reviewed patient's safety data included in the first part of the study, the DSMB
      confirmed that the study can continue with the glenzocimab recommended dose of 1000 mg.
      During this phase, a group of 100 patients will be treated, 50 with glenzocimab and 50 with
      matching placebo to complete the group of 160 patients planned to participate in this study.

      In addition, patients in each treatment arm will be stratified by type of Standard of Care
      (SOC) administered:

        -  Thrombolysis with tPA only;

        -  Thrombolysis with tPA AND mechanical thrombectomy Each treatment arm will contain 25
           patients with one SOC, and 25 with the other SOC. The active glenzocimab dose will be
           that recommended after the last safety analysis has been performed.
