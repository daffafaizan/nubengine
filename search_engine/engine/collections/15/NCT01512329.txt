      be randomized to either 3 weeks of pacing activity self-management or relaxation therapy.
      Both treatment groups will receive 3 weekly sessions spread over 3 consecutive weeks. All
      treatments will be delivered by occupational therapists or physiotherapists. One treatment
      session lasts for about 45 minutes each.
