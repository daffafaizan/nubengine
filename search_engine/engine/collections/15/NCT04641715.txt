      complications of this procedure have already been extensively described in the literature.
      Our goal is to collect data from 21 Italian centers that practice MGB / OAGB to evaluate the
      reasons and complications that led surgeons to revise this surgery with a subsequent
      bariatric procedure. For this reason we have analyzed the data provided by the centers on
      8676 patients undergoing MGB / OAGB, focusing attention on phenomena such as GERD,
      anastomotic stenosis, bleeding and marginal ulcers which are the most frequent causes of
      re-intervention. We also evaluated the changes in BMI between the primary procedure and the
      revision procedure to ensure that the bariatric purpose of the surgical program was
      maintained.
