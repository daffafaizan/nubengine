      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effect of erlotinib and stereotactic body radiotherapy on 6-month
           progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the actuarial rate of in-field local control and out-of-field disease
           progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the duration of erlotinib usage and time to initiation of third-line
           systemic therapy (chemotherapy or biologic agent) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1-4 weeks after the initiation of erlotinib
      hydrochloride, patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
