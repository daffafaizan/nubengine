      screening have localized and potentially curable disease. Patients have a number of excellent
      treatment options to consider, and quality of life following treatment is often a
      consideration in treatment choice. One critical quality of life concern for patients
      diagnosed with prostate cancer is sexual function. Studies of sexual function post-radiation
      therapy fall into three categories: incidence studies; correlative (dose and toxicity)
      studies; mechanism(functional) studies. All these studies point to a vascular mechanism of
      impotence post-radiation therapy, as opposed to a nerve-based mechanism following surgery. In
      this study, the critical vascular structures (internal pudendal artery and corpus cavernosum)
      are defined by MRI-based imaging and included in treatment planning for radiation treatments.
      Investigators propose that this technique will improve quality of life, sexual function, and
      relapse-free survival.

      This study's primary aim is to determine erectile function preservation rates at 5-years
      post-vessel-sparing radiotherapy with or without aids using the patient reported using the
      simplified three-question erectile function scale.
