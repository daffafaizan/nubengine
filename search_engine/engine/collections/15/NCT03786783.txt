    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the feasibility and tolerability of administering ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) in combination with a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen during cycles
      3-5 of the Induction phase for patients with newly-diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To describe the response rates, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for
      patients receiving the combination of standard Induction chemotherapy and ch14.18
      (dinutuximab) followed by tandem transplant, radiation therapy, and post-consolidation
      immunotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the clinical relevance of naturally occurring anti-glycan antibodies in
      patients receiving ch14.18 (dinutuximab).

      II. To describe the clinical relevance of natural killer (NK) receptor NKp30 isoforms in
      patients receiving ch14.18 (dinutuximab).

      III. To describe the association between host factors, including human anti-chimeric
      antibodies (HACA), and response to protocol therapy.

      IV. To describe the immune environment (gene expression; immune effector cells, activities
      and signaling molecules; immune target expression) during and following treatment.

      V. To describe the association between levels of circulating GD2, and tumor cell GD2
      expression with response to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CYCLES 1-2 (21 days): Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over
      15-30 minutes and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      INDUCTION CYCLE 3: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, etoposide IV over 2
      hours on days 1-3, dinutuximab IV over 10-20 hours on days 2-5, and sargramostim
      subcutaneously (SC) on day 6 or 7 of a 21-day cycle.

      INDUCTION CYCLE 4: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute on day 1, doxorubicin IV
      over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-2, dinutuximab IV
      over 10-20 hours on days 2-5, and sargramostim SC on day 6 or 7 of a 21-day cycle.

      INDUCTION CYCLE 5: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, etoposide IV over 2
      hours on days 1-3, dinutuximab IV over 10-20 hours on days 2-5, and sargramostim SC on day 6
      or 7 of a 21-day cycle.

      Patients may undergo surgery after the fifth cycle of Induction at the discretion of treating
      doctor. Patients with stable disease or better tumor response at the end of Induction proceed
      to Consolidation. Consolidation treatments begin between 4 and 6 weeks from the start date of
      Induction chemotherapy cycle 5. For patients who have surgical resection delayed until after
      Induction chemotherapy cycle 5, Consolidation starts within 4 weeks from the date of surgery.

      CONSOLIDATION #1: Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -7 to -5 and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2. Patients then undergo autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT) on day 0.

      CONSOLIDATION #2: Patients receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -5, etoposide
      IV over 24 hours on days -7 to -4, and carboplatin IV over 24 hours on days -7 to -4.
      Patients then undergo ASCT on day 0.

      RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning 42-80 days following Consolidation #2, patients receive external
      beam radiation therapy (EBRT) daily for up to 20 days.

      Patients then receive post-Consolidation therapy starting 1 week following radiation therapy.

      POST-CONSOLIDATION CYCLES 1-5: Patients receive sargramostim SC on days 1-14, dinutuximab IV
      over 10-20 hours on days 4-7, and isotretinoin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 11-24.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      POST-CONSOLIDATION CYCLE 6: Patients receive isotretinoin PO BID on days 15-28 of a 28-day
      cycle.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,
      24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60.
