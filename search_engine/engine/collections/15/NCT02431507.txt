      invasive than reconstructive surgery, more tolerable than positive airway pressure, and more
      effective than non-invasive therapies for OSA. The Magnap device consists of a
      neodymium-iron-boron rare earth magnet with a ferromagnetic directional back-plate encased in
      titanium. The device will be implanted surgically on the hyoid bone. Following surgery, the
      patient is fitted with a custom, removable external neck accessory containing a second
      magnet, which is worn during sleep and prevents airway collapse by attracting the internal
      hyoid magnet with sufficient force to keep the airway open .
