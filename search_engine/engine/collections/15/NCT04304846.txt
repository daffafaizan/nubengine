      caregivers and establish privileged relationships with them. These attachment relationships
      are gradually established and, from the end of the first year, interindividual differences
      can be observed according to temperament, quality of interactions with adults and responses
      to children's needs for proximity and comfort.

      Prematurity is a situation that can disrupt parent-child interactions. The physiological
      characteristics of the premature infant attenuate and distort his/her stress signals. Visual
      interactions are shorter, alertness is more labile and reactivity is less clear than that of
      babies born at term. In such situations of stress and trauma, maternal sensitivity and
      responsiveness can be affected. In addition, changes in the quality of mother-child
      interactions have been reported, with more controlling maternal behavior. This maternal trend
      has been associated with behavioral disorders in children, such as eating disorders or lack
      of interest in social communication. More frequent disruptions of maternal caregiving
      associated with relational withdrawal in the child have also been shown in the case of
      prematurity.

      We hypothesize that the experience of establishing relationships with parents in a context of
      extreme prematurity can alter the development of secure attachment representations in the
      child and that maternal representations and their possible interactions with prematurity
      factors prevent or contribute to the development of insecure or disorganized attachment in
      the child. We also hypothesize that disorganized attachment representations are associated
      with somatic, environmental, affective, and neurodevelopmental complications (motor,
      cognitive and behavioral).
