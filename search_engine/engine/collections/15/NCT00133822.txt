    
      Individuals with PTSD often experience anxiety attacks, nightmares, or repeated unwanted
      memories after experiencing or witnessing life-threatening events, such as serious accidents
      or natural disasters, or traumatic events such as physical or sexual abuse.

      Risperidone has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      psychotic disorders and has been found helpful for PTSD and depression, but is still
      considered investigational for the purposes of this study.

      All qualified participants will be started on sertraline (Zoloft) for eight weeks. Patients
      who are still symptomatic at the end of this phase, will be invited to join the second
      portion of the study where they will be randomly assigned to receive risperidone or placebo
      (sugar pill) in addition to the sertraline. Participants will be monitored regularly for
      medication effects, adverse events, and PTSD symptoms.
