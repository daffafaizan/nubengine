      our center. However, the short, and especially the long term prognosis of these children were
      barely known.

      Since last decade, Clinical Reproductive Medicine Management System/Electronic Medical Record
      Cohort Database (CCRM/EMRCD) has been used in Reproductive Medical Center, First Affiliated
      Hospital of Zhengzhou University, and Henan Province Key Laboratory for Reproduction and
      Genetics. Information of patients (POI, PCOS, Endometriosis, azoospermia, ect) were recorded
      comprehensively. In addition, information of each newborn from our center has also been kept
      in CCRM/EMRCD. The current project plans to recruit these newborn babies in our center.
      Biological samples, questionnaires and short/long term health data will be collected. The
      study is aimed to provide evidence for Newborns from patients treated with ART prognosis.
