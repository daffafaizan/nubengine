      procedures performed in the practice of obstetrics. Continuous monitoring of the fetal heart
      rate is used to identify infants at risk for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and allow for
      intervention to prevent this terrible complication. The quality of the fetal heart rate
      signal is critical for appropriate interpretation of the characteristics that identify risk.

      This is a prospective, randomized pragmatic trial comparing the Novii Fetal ECG/EMG system to
      external fetal heart rate and tocometry (standard of care) for the amount of time of
      interpretable fetal heart rate during labor. Randomization will occur in blocks based on BMI
      to control for the potential effect of BMI.

      Fetal heart rate tracings from both groups of women will be reviewed in a blinded fashion by
      experienced Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) physicians who will assess the tracing for quality
      and interpretability. In addition, both approaches will be compared with respect to the need
      for additional monitoring modalities, amount of nursing intervention, cost and satisfaction
      of the patients and healthcare providers.
