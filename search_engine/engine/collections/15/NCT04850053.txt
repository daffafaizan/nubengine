      could detect small quantities of Aβ and Tau seeds by taking advantage of their ability to
      nucleate and enhance aggregation, enabling a very high amplification of the signal. This
      study examines the effectiveness of using the AD-seeds-detector as a novel technique for
      discriminating AD from cognitively normal control and non-AD dementia by detecting small Aβ
      and Tau seeds in plasma.

      This will be an observational study aiming at using the AD-seeds-detector to detect minute
      amounts of Aβ and Tau seeds in plasma as novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and
      specificity for the accurate diagnosis of AD. To achieve this goal, we will conduct two
      studies using the AD-seeds-detector to detect the Aβ and Tau seeds in the plasma samples.

      Study one:

      A single-center cohort that consists of well-characterized AD patients (n=150), cognitively
      normal controls (n=100) and non-AD dementia patients (n=50).

      Study two:

      A multi-center cohort with well-characterized AD patients (n=400), cognitively normal
      controls (n=400) and non-AD dementia patients (n=400).
