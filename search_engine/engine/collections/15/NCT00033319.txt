        -  Determine whether aspirin and/or folic acid prevents recurrence of colorectal adenomas
           in patients who have had colorectal adenomas removed.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral aspirin and oral folic acid daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral aspirin and oral placebo daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo and oral folic acid daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive 2 oral placebos daily. In all arms, treatment continues for 3
           years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the 3-year intervention, all patients undergo a surveillance colonoscopy.
