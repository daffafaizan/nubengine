      cancer, called chemoprevention, may be useful. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether taking a green tea preparation may have effects on your leukoplakia. It is hoped that
      these effects may reduce the subsequent risk of cancer in or around the area of leukoplakia.
      To assess for these effects, samples of the lining of your mouth will be obtained, and they
      will be analyzed looking for certain features (biomarkers).
