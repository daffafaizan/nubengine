      protocol for lower extremities in shorter time periods. The focus of this study is to compare
      the effectiveness of the ROMTech PortableConncect device only rehabilitation program
      following total knee arthroplasty to an active comparator group of continuous passive motion
      with a standard of care combination HHPT and OPPT rehabilitation program. The technology used
      to develop the ROMTech PortableConnect device has been reported in a pilot study to tend to
      be highly effective in decreasing the recovery time of patients post TKA, as discussed in the
      findings from the pilot study with the ROMTech Pro Cycle. The expedited recovery resulting
      from use of the ROMTech rehabilitation technology is noted to be contributed to the ability
      of the ROMTech technology to achieve a more rapid range of motion in this patient population.
