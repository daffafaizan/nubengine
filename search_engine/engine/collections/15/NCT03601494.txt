    
      Diabetic Peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM).
      Among several complications that contribute to reduce patient's quality of life and life
      expectancy diabetic neuropathy (DN) generalized or focal leads to an impaired life quality.

      The clinical symptoms of DPN range from pain and burning sensations, more at rest or at
      night; to hypoesthesia or paresthesia, and or numbness.

      Different types of peripheral neuropathy are observed in diabetes, axonal or demyelination or
      both can be present, involves myelinated and un-myelinated, large and small fibers. Nerve
      conduction studies can detect these changes. Till now, there is no effective therapy for the
      treatment of DPN.

      Since 1950 Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used in dermatology and oral maxillofacial
      surgery, but its role as an effective alternative treatment in many other clinical
      applications has been increased over the last years.

      Platelets contain more than 1100 proteins, include enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, growth
      factors, immune messengers, and other bioactive compounds which play a role in tissue repair
      and wound healing.

      Autologous platelet-rich plasma found to promote axon regeneration in studies involving
      animal models. Platelet derived angiogenesis factors are capable of stimulating new capillary
      growth by inducing migration of endothelial cells. It was suggested that this was the
      mechanism by which platelet factors influence the process of angiogenesis and
      revascularization.
