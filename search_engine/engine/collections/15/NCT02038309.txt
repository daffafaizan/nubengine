      analyzed by the laboratory. Maximal aggregation intensity and velocity are measured by light
      transmission aggregometry induced by arachidonic acid (AA) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
      Platelet function analyzer will be also used. No changes in treatment in response to the
      results is planned.
