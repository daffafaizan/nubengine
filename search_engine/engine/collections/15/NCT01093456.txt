      phosphate metabolism (phosphate, FGF23) and microbiotic protein fermentation (p-cresyl
      sulphate [PCS], indoxyl sulphate [IS]) on the one hand and increased risk of all-cause and
      cardiovascular death on the other hand.

      Hypothesis: Due to failing feed-back mechanisms, diurnal variation of serum concentrations of
      serum phosphate and fermentation metabolites will be more pronounced in dialysis patients,
      especially in those with negligible residual kidney function.

      Clinical studies assessing this issue are scarce to non-existing.
