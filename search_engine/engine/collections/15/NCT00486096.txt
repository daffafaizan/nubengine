      for the smallest manufactured cannulas. In these instances, it may be feasible to utilize
      angio-catheters for arterial access until central cannulation can be achieved safely. In an
      in vitro model, we have simulated a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and arterial cannulation
      with angio-catheters.

      It appears that angio-catheters may be used with acceptable flow hemodynamics for blood
      vessels too small for standard cannulas.

      We have performed this successfully in a 5 kg child.

      We have completed the cardiopulmonary bypass model and are ready to submit the hemodynamic
      data. We would like to submit to a national meeting and hopefully for publication thereafter.
