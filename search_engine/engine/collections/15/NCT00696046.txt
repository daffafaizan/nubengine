      80% at days 100 are defined as success. The limit of 60 days for neutrophil recovery was
      chosen because it represents the time at which rescue with a second transplant is decided in
      case of failure to engraft; the day 100 for platelets recovery is taken corresponds to first
      form reported after transplant to the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry.

      HLA-A and -B antigens will be identified by low resolution DNA typing, whereas HLA-DRB1 type
      was determined by high resolution DNA typing techniques. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 typing
      was used to select the most closely matched donor unit-recipient pair, with preference given
      to HLA-DRB1-matched unit
