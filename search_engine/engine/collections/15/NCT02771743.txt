      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/autoSCT), the outcome still needs
      to be unsatisfactory.

      In the investigator's previous study, good responders who had greater reduction of tumor
      volume after induction chemotherapy showed lower relapse-free survival compared to poor
      responders.Simultaneously, the reduction in tumor volume also was greater in patients who
      died of treatment related mortality than patients who had relapsed tumors. These findings
      suggest that tailoring treatment intensity according to the early tumor response to induction
      chemotherapy may improve patient outcomes. So, in this study investigators tailored the
      treatment intensity of high dose chemotherapy according to the treatment response to
      induction chemotherapy.
