      function recovery of the subset of tetraplegic patients, who have initial grade 0 muscle
      strength immediately after their injuries. We are interested in conducting a pilot study
      comparing the surgical group to the non-surgical group. A larger trial will be planned if the
      preliminary results show positive improvement in hand function recovery.
