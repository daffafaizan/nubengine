      increases in prevalence with age. Severe aortic valve stenosis accounts for considerable
      disease and death, especially in older patients. Aortic valve stenosis is the primary
      indication for valve replacement in western countries, and the number will only increase as
      elderly people are a growing subpopulation. Measures to identify AV disease earlier, to
      identify factors that influence disease progression and treat AV disease pharmacologically or
      with less invasive approaches would be a significant improvement over the current standard of
      care. These advances will only be possible with a better understanding the mechanisms
      underlying valve development and disease. Preliminary data suggest a novel pathophysiological
      concept for impaired valvular endothelial cells regeneration, leading to the progression of
      age-associated calcific AV disease and a potential treatment target is the disrupted
      endothelial cell layer of the valve leaflet.

      The research objectives are:

        1. To assess the number and function of endothelial progenitor cellss and apoptotic
           endothelial progenitor cellss in patients with mild, moderate and severe aortic
           stenosis.

        2. To study the association between aortic stenosis progression, severity, symptoms and
           left ventricular function and the number and function of circulating endothelia
           progenitor cells. By understanding the correlation between valve severity, left
           ventricular longitudinal function and endothelial progenitor cells we will indentify
           high risk patients population that need early intervention. We hope to add new
           information on the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis and to indentify factors that predict
           disease progression.
