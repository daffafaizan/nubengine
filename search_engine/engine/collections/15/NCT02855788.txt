      limited treatment options including systemic chemotherapy with or without radiation. Commonly
      used maximally tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy such as DCT, ECF, FOLFOX regimens induce
      responses in the range of 20 to 50% with median survival in the range of 10 to 12 months.
      Metronomic chemotherapy has been found to have more consistent anti-tumor effects through
      anti-angiogenic and immunomodulating effects. Preliminary clinical studies of weekly POLF
      have found very encouraging clinical activities and low overall toxicities in pancreatic
      cancer and gastric cancer. Here we conduct a formal clinical trial to determine the clinical
      efficacy and side effect profiles of this regimen in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
