    
      Patients with ischemic stroke or TIA will be included in the 48 hours following the onset of
      symptoms, in 3 university hospitals.For each patient will be collected

        -  1 blood sample for the BNP measure in pg/ml

        -  1 blood sample for the Cystatin C measure in mg/l

        -  2 urinary samples to measure the albumine/creatinine ratio, at inclusion and 5 days
           after the inclusion, and to study the variation of albuminuria in micrograms/min.

      The clinical follow-up will be organized during 3 years. The following events will be
      notified: poor outcome (defined with the Barthel and Rankin scores), recurrence of
      cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, vascular death.

      After adjustment on the main clinical prognosis factors, we want to determine wich one of
      these markers has the best prognosis significance and allows to identify in the acute phase
      the "high-risk" patients, in order to intensify individual treatment and secondary
      prevention.
