      nortriptyline (7.5 mg) plus topiramate (10 mg), the second is verapamil (30 mg) plus
      paroxetine (4 mg), and the third is a placebo group. This is a double-blinded trial.
      Participants will be randomized to one arm for the duration of the trial using simple
      randomization with a computer-generated number. Both medication combinations and placebo may
      include dosage increases weekly if symptoms do not improve. Nortriptyline may be increased by
      7.5mg weekly (to a maximum of 60mg), topiramate by 10mg weekly (maximum 80mg), verapamil by
      30mg weekly (maximum 240mg), and paroxetine by 4mg weekly (maximum 32mg). Symptomatic survey
      scores from each arm will be obtained before and after treatment and weekly. An unblinded
      neurotologist attending (Dr. Harrison Lin) will also become involved with patients'
      treatments as they start to report changes in symptoms in order to monitor their safety and
      provide advice on change in dosage if patients have questions.
