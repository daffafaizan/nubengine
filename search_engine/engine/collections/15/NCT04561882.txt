      its prevalence is about 1%. In adult patients with stroke and normal carotid arteries, ASA is
      an important predictor of recurrent stroke. The most common abnormalities associated are
      interatrial shunts, that is, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD).
      For large ASA with interatrial shunt, it is difficult to cover ASA with conventional devices,
      which might result in unstability of occluders and related complications . For isolated ASA
      with high risk, thrombus and emboli have been reported and anticoagulation has been used
      empirically.

      In addition, the left atrial septal pouch can be considered as a special subtype of atrial
      septal aneurysm, in which thrombus might arise from the cavity of the pouch. Pervious
      researches have noted that left atrial septal pouch was a site of origin of thrombus
      formation and a source of embolism, and it was associated with cryptogenic stroke. For
      patients with ASA, we hypothesizes that transcatheter reconstruction of atrial septum might
      be achieved with PFO occluder through transseptal perforation. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter exclusion of ASA via transseptal
      perforation.

      This study will enroll subjects with ASA (including left atrial septal pouch), and enrollment
      will be divided into three phases.

      Phase 1: large ASA patients with interatrial communication (ASD or PFO). A maximum of 30
      patients is reached.

      Phase 2: ASA patients with intact septum and high risk of cryptogenic stroke. A maximum of 20
      patients is reached.

      Phase 3: left atrial septal pouch with high risk of cryptogenic stroke. A maximum of 20
      patients is reached.
