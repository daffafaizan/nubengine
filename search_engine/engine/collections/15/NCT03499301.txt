      pain because of their mechanisms, treatments and therapeutic objectives. CP is associated
      with an alteration of quality of life with psychological, social and economic consequences.
      The prevalence of CP in France is 15%. In ED, the rate of CP in patients with acute pain was
      around 40%. Patients with CP come more frequently to ED than patients without CP. Their use
      of care structures, particularly ED, is all the more frequent that their disability is
      important. The satisfaction of these patients in ED is associated with age, nature of pain,
      wait duration, realisation of imaging, and administration of painkillers and relieving of
      pain. The reasons why these patients go to ED were pain exacerbation, inadequate strategy of
      coping, severity of disease and sometime despair associated with stress or anxiety. Currently
      the investigators do not know if these managements in ED are adequate or not. And finally the
      investigators do not know whether the satisfaction about their ED management is different
      from patients without CP. The investigators are going to collect data about all patients
      admitted in ED with the objective to compare the satisfaction between patients with CP and
      patients without CP. The follow up will be restricted to the area of ED. The last data will
      be collected just before the exit from ED.
