      CSF-1/ c-fms autocrine, endocrine, or paracrine loop in the progression of endometrial
      adenocarcinoma. If so, alterations in this loop may provide novel medical therapies for this
      disease. Additionally, these experiments will determine which are the predominant cytokines
      expressed in these tumors, and will help the investigators to determine the role, if any,
      these cytokines play in cancer cell growth and proliferation in relationship with each other
      and within and outside of the estrogen-mediated pathways.
