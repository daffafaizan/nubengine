      or minimally conscious state (MCS). At present, there are no evidence-based guidelines
      regarding the treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). A previous study
      showed that a single stimulation (using transcranial direct current stimulation - tDCS) of
      the left prefrontal cortex induces an behavioral improvement in some patients in DOC.
      Nevertheless, patients with DOC suffer from other invalidating dysfunctions such as
      spasticity (muscle hypertonia). In sroke patients, the inhibition of the motor cortex through
      cathodes placed over the motor region showed to reduce spasticity.

      In this study, investigators aim to assess the effect of single session of transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right and left fronto-central areas (using 2 anodes
      and 2 cathodes), on the level of hypertonia and the level of consciousness of patients with
      DOC, in a double blind randomized sham controlled study. The anodes will be placed over F3
      and F4, and the cathodes over C3 and C4.

      tDCS is a form of safe non-invasive cortical stimulation, modulating cortical excitability
      under the electrodes, via weak polarizing currents. It has been reported that anodal tDCS
      transiently improves motor functions in healthy subjects and patients with stroke or
      Parkinson's disease.

      By reducing the activity of the motor cortex (cathodes) and increasing the activity of the
      prefrontal cortex (anodes) we expect to observe a better motor function in patients with DOC.
