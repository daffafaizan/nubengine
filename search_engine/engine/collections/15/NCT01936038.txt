      Main objective: To increase the percentage of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (nCPAP) compliance.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To increase the CPAP's tolerance.

        -  To decrease the CPAP's pressure.

        -  To decrease the daytime sleepiness.

        -  To increase the quality of life related to sleep.

        -  To assess the level of subjective utility of CPAP by the patient.

      METHODOLOGY

      Type of study: Controlled randomized simple blind study

      Randomization of groups

      Once the patient is into the study (because s/he has the inclusion criteria and has signed up
      the informed consent), an opaque envelope is opened in order to know the assigned group.The
      envelopes are consecutively numbered and the assigned group is randomized through the
      software.

        -  Group 1 or control group: 55 subjects undergo the CPAP treatment.

        -  Group 2 or study group: 55 subjects undergo the CPAP treatment and Upper Airway Toning.

      Homogeneity of groups:

      Investigators check out the homogeneity of groups in baseline:

      Specific features: Neck circumference, presence or lack of nasal clinic, presence or lack of
      nasal structural alteration, age, gender, weight, height, BMI, smoking habits.

      Polysomnographic parameters: Number of apnea, number of hypo-apneas and Apnea Hypopnea Index
      (AHI).

      Symptoms: Presence or lack of severe comorbidities, level of daily hyper-somnolence, presence
      of insomnia
