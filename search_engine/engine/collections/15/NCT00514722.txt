      and a transplant related mortality rate of < or equal to 50%. A TRM of >50% will be
      considered unacceptable. The present research will also:

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of busulfan, fludarabine, and etoposide as preparative therapy
           prior to umbilical cord blood cell transplantation.

        -  Evaluate neutrophil and platelet recovery following UCB transplantation.

        -  Evaluate lineage-specific chimerism following transplantation and to assess the
           contribution of each individual CB unit to post-transplantation hematopoiesis.

        -  Evaluate event free and overall survival.

        -  Evaluate the incidence, severity and timing of acute and chronic GVHD following UCB
           transplantation.
