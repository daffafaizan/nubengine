    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study to determine the
      MTD of AP in subjects with AUD. Eighteen (18) subjects will be randomized to receive either
      AP or placebo in a 2:1 ratio; ie, 12 subjects will be assigned to AP and 6 will be assigned
      to placebo. Efforts will be made to enroll all subjects in the same period of time at one
      clinical center. The expected maximum duration of participation for each subject is 11 weeks
      and will consist of up to a 3-week screening period, up to a 30-day residential (inpatient)
      treatment period, up to a 4-week non-residential (outpatient) treatment period, and an end of
      study / early termination clinic visit.
