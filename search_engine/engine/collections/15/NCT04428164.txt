    
      Aim(s)/Objective(s)

        -  Improve patient sleep during their hospital stay.

        -  Determine patient self-reported pain assessment using non-pharmacologic strategies.

        -  Determine if the "patient toolkit" improves patient experience of pain and sleep.

      Hypothesis 1. Primary Hypothesis Patients' experience of pain and sleep will improve with the
      implementation of interventions from our "patient toolkit".

      .2. Secondary Hypothesis Patients will report an increase in sleep and a decrease in pain
      after use of the interventions provided in the "patient toolkit".

      3. Tertiary Hypothesis Patients will report satisfaction with results gained through
      implementation of our "patient toolkit".

      STUDY DESIGN

        -  60 to 80 medical surgical patients per campus (MCMC, MDMC, MMMC, MRMC) will be recruited
           to participate (total: 240 to 320 patients) Only adult medical surgical patients over
           the age 20 will be recruited.

        -  Quasi-experimental, pre-/post-test, repeated measures interventional study

        -  Length of patients hospital stay will determine length of intervention used; average
           estimate is a four-day length of stay

        -  Give pre-assessment the morning after first night of admission (Day 2)

        -  Participants will receive a toolkit upon informed consent completion that will include
           intervention strategies (eye mask; ear plugs; puzzle book; adult coloring book; colored
           pencils; aromatherapy patches; herbal tea bags) and data collection booklet for
           pre-survey, daily survey, and post-survey

        -  Data will be collected over 6 to 10 weeks to achieve desired number of participants

        -  Anticipated completion of study will be December 2021
