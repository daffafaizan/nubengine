        -  Clinical data collection: surgery date, age, weight, height, medical and surgical
           history

        -  Prospective collection of peritoneal and adipose biopsies of patients during their
           surgery at the Oscar Lambret Center (Dr L. BRESSON)

        -  Transportation of the samples to the 1008 INSERM Unit.

        -  Isolation of cells from the samples : mesothelial cells from the peritoneum and adipose
           stem cells from adipose tissue

        -  Cell culture and expansion of mesothelial cells; and cell culture and differentiation of
           adipose stem cells

        -  Identification by the morphotype and phenotype of mesothelial cells

        -  Comparison of the results according to the cell source, peritoneum or adipocyte, to the
           purity of cells and to the efficacy of the expansion
