      I. To determine whether systemic administration of interferon (IFN) gamma (recombinant
      interferon gamma) will increase class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in
      synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether systemic administration of IFN gamma will increase class II MHC
      expression in SS and MRCL tumors.

      II. To examine changes in the immune response to MRCL and SS by examining changes in the
      immune infiltrates, antibody response and antigen specific T cell response before and after
      IFN gamma treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive recombinant interferon gamma subcutaneously (SC) every 7 days for 4 weeks
      before surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks post-surgery.
