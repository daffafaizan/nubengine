      fat emulsions composed of soybean oils. Lipids are necessary in PN dependent patients due to
      their high caloric value and essential fatty acid content. Intravenous lipid emulsions have
      been implicated in predisposing patients to PN associated liver disease. Phytosterols such as
      those contained in soybean oils are thought to have a deleterious effect on biliary
      secretion. Accumulation of lipids in the hepatic Kupffer cells may further impair liver
      function.

      Omega 6 fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid deficiency, it
      is thought that they are not cleared in a manner similar to enteral chylomicrons and
      therefore accumulate in the liver and resulting in steatotic liver injury (neonatal
      cholestasis). It is hypothesized that a fat emulsion comprised of omega 3 fatty acids (i.e.:
      fish oil), such as de novo lipogenesis, the reduction of arachidonic acid-derived
      inflammatory mediators, prevention of essential fatty acid deficiency through the presence of
      small amounts of arachidonic acid, and improved clearance of lipids from the serum. Animal
      studies have shown that IV fat emulsions such as fish oil that are high in eicosapentaenic
      and docosahexaenoic acid reduce impairment of bile flow which is seen in cholestasis caused
      by conventional fat emulsions. Furthermore, intravenous omega-e fatty acids are well
      tolerated and might reduce the hepatic dysfunction. By administering Omegaven in place of
      conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsion, the progression of PN-associated cholestasis
      can be prevented or reversed.
