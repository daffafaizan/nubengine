      volunteers in Thailand. Data collection consists of demographic, clinical data, ECG and blood
      sample for genetic studies. Genotyping was done by whole genome sequencing and SNP array then
      compared between cases and controls. Each BrS patient will be followed up prospectively for
      symptoms and AICD shock. Subsequently, the study will analyze relationship between genetic
      variants and clinical data against clinical severity of BrS patients.
