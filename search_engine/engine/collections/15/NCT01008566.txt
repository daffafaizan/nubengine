      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMC-A12 given in conjunction with
      standard doses of sorafenib to patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      II. To describe the toxicity and tolerance of IMC-A12 at each dose studied in combination
      with standard-dose sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.

      III. To evaluate the impact of IMC-A12 on biomarkers related to the IGF-1R/IGF pathway which
      is thought relevant to HCC progression and drug resistance.

      IV. To obtain preliminary assessments of efficacy through description of progression-free
      survival (PFS) and objective response rate (RR).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of cixutumumab followed by an extended
      accrual phase in which patients are treated at the maximum-tolerated dose.

      Patients receive cixutumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral sorafenib
      tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
