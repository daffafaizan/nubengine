      interferon/ribavirin combination therapy. These patients are prone to develop liver fibrosis
      leading to cirrhosis and its complications. Interferon has proven to be efficient in liver
      fibrosis treatment even in case of virological non response. Maintenance low dose pegylated
      interferon therapy is currently under investigation in large multicenter trials. The aim of
      our study is to assess wether peginterferon alpha 2 b (0.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin
      (800-1200 mg according to body weight) is more efficient than peginterferon alpha 2 b alone
      in a long term 3 years treatment of liver fibrosis. 454 patients, non responders (VHC RNA
      positive after 24 weeks of treatment or absence of ≥ 2 log HCV RNA drop after 12 weeks of
      treatment) to a previous peginterferon/ribavirin antiviral treatment will be randomized
      between the 2 arms, with a double-blind masking of ribavirin. The efficacy will be assessed
      on Metavir liver fibrosis score improvement between pre and post therapeutic liver biopsy.
