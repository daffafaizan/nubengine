      the world today and is responsible for introducing a number of diseases including many types
      of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. Extensive literature indicates
      that cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for introducing erectile impairment in
      men. Controlled clinical trials examining the effects of smoking cessation on sexual
      functioning are necessary in order to investigate whether quitting smoking improves sexual
      health.

      Design: This is a 12-week clinical trial in which 80 male long-term smokers will be tested at
      baseline (while smoking) and then randomized to an 8-week nicotine patch treatment regimen (n
      = 50) or to a delayed treatment wait list condition (n = 30). All participants will be
      reassessed at mid-treatment (4 weeks), and at 1-month follow-up.

      Main Outcome Measures: Physiological (penile circumferential change via penile
      plethysmography), and subjective (continuous self-report) sexual responses to erotic stimuli
      will be examined, as well as global changes in self-reported sexual functioning.

      Implications: If participants do in fact demonstrate a significant increase in sexual arousal
      and sexual functioning as a result of smoking cessation, these results may have the potential
      for facilitating programs and interventions targeting the prevention and cessation of
      cigarette smoking in men. This would alleviate enormous economic burdens caused by erectile
      dysfunction and other smoking-related diseases.
