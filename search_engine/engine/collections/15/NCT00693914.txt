      conformal radiation therapy. Brain tumor survivors (n= 50, solid tumor survivors (n=40), and
      healthy sibling controls (n= 40) are evaluated once only with laboratory measures of
      cognitive skills (working memory, episodic memory and estimated IQ) and parental
      questionnaires (executive and adaptive functions). We also use buccal (cheek) swabs to gather
      samples for DNA extraction. We hypothesize: brain tumor survivors will perform significantly
      worse than solid tumor and healthy controls on measures of working memory, working memory
      will correlate significantly with IQ, working memory will be associated with parent report of
      executive functions and a specified genotype related to dopamine metabolism will be
      associated with working memory impairment.
