    
      This is an observational, retrospective and prospective study where subjects who have
      received mogamulizumab either within one year before or within 18 months after
      transplantation will be followed for data collection. Data will be collected at baseline
      (retrospectively), 100 days post alloHCT, 6-months, 1 year and at 2 years post alloHCT
      (retrospectively and prospectively).

      A cut-off time limit of 18 months post alloHCT exposure will allow at least 6 months of
      follow-up within the 2 years post-alloHCT follow-up period.
