      (SSI) rates after no antimicrobial prophylaxis use during laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.
      Target ranges of SSI rates after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy were determined based on the
      previous reports and our data. If SSI rates are within the target range, the investigators
      will proceed to a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of no antimicrobial
      use for laparoscopic gastrectomy.
