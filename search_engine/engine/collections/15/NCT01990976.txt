      study, NCT01116570) will be repeated in the medium (12 months) and long term (30 months) in
      the same laboratory NMR AIM - CEA , Institute of Myology in Paris (P Carlier ). The data
      obtained from NMR repeated examinations and those obtained from biochemical analyzes and
      additional muscle histomorphometric (cellular aging estimation of involution fibroadipose )
      on biopsies already programmed (initial, 6 months and 30 months, FSHD2 study, NCT01689480)
      will be respectively compared to initial time to follow the evolution food and energy
      capacity of trained muscles. The study of biopsies provide mechanistic arguments and
      morphometric specific cellular response to exercise, data will be advantageously complemented
      by NMR specialized examinations extended to all the muscles of the thigh (target of training
      ) and muscle quantification whole body MRI.
