      performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit. After achieving normovolemia and a mean
      arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg, 20 septic shock patients were randomized to receive
      either levosimendan 0.2 μg/kg/min, or dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min. Interstitial tissue
      concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were obtained by using muscle
      microdialysis. All measurements, including data from right heart catheterization were
      obtained at baseline and every 6 hours for the following 72 hours after randomization.
