    
      RSV is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. Most infants and
      children who get RSV recover fully after 1-2 weeks, but RSV infection can sometimes worsen
      and may lead to hospitalization and admission into an intensive care unit. The main purpose
      of this study is to learn how well the study drug (lumicitabine, also known as JNJ-64041575
      or ALS-008176) works, how the human body handles the study drug, which dose of the study drug
      is effective for treatment of RSV infection in infants/children and how safe it is compared
      to a placebo (placebo looks just like lumicitabine [given in same way] but has no effect
      against RSV). Approximately up to 180 participants aged between 28 days to 36 months and
      hospitalized with RSV infection will take part in this world-wide study.
