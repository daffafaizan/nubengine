      therapeutic advances, patients with chronic heart failure remain at high risk for HF
      progression and death. The two primary goals of its management are preventing further disease
      progression(mortality, hospitalizations and deterioration of left ventricular function)and
      alleviating patient suffering.Sacubitril /valsartan (previously known as LCZ696) is a
      first-in-class medicine that contains a neprilysin (NEP )inhibitor(sacubitril) and an
      angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan). NEP is an endopeptidase that metabolizes
      different vasoactive peptides including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin and Ang -II. In
      consequence, its inhibition increases mainly the levels of both natriuretic peptides
      (promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilation) and Ang- II whose effects are blocked by
      the angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan (reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone
      release).
