    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-part trial.

      In Part A, EYP001a will be administered as 29 days monotherapy. Three dose-levels and 2
      dosing regimens of EYP001a will be explored against placebo. The design also includes an
      open-label standard of care Entecavir monotherapy arm (comparator). Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of the 6 treatment arms:

        -  Treatment A: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment B: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment C: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment D: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment E: oral placebo

        -  Treatment F: oral Entecavir

      In Part B, EYP001a or placebo will be administered as 29 days combination therapy with the
      standard of care Peg-IFNα2a. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment
      arms:

        -  Treatment G: oral EYP001a plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous
           injection

        -  Treatment H: oral EYP001a plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous
           injection

        -  Treatment I: oral placebo plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous
           injection

      Subjects enrolled in Part A are eligible for participation in Part B.

      Participation will include a 40 day screening period, a 29 day treatment period and a 6 day
      follow-up evaluation period. For subjects who participate in both Parts A and B, a 14 washout
      period between Parts A and B will be included.

      The safety and tolerability of EYP001a will be assessed by evaluating physical examinations,
      vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters, and adverse events.
