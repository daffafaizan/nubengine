      emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-RGD PET/CT) scan can predict the efficacy and
      adverse events of apatinib in patients with malignancies.

      Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is the process of generating
      neovascularization from preexisting vessels. It can promote tumor growth and metastasis by
      providing nutrients and oxygen. Integrin αvβ3 has been shown to play an important role in
      angiogenesis and up-regulated obviously in various types of tumor cells and activated
      endothelial cells. Since the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide sequence can
      bind to integrin αvβ3 with high affinity and specificity, RGD PET/CT may be helpful to
      evaluate the biological and metabolic activity status during angiogenesis. However,
      18F-ALF-NOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT as response biomarker for antiangiogenic therapy has not been fully
      proved and is still without universal understanding according to current publications.
      Apatinib (YN968D1) is the first orally antiangiogenic drug targeting VEGFR-2 tyrosine
      kinase.In the current study, investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of 18F-RGD
      PET/CT in monitoring efficacy and adverse events of apatinib in malignancies. Patients
      confirmed malignancies histopathologically will be prospectively enrolled in the study. All
      patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Patients will receive
      apatinib therapy, and undergo 18F-RGD PET/CT scans berore and after first cycle of therapy.
