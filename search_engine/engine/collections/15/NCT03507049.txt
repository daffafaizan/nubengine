      It is shown to be the source of pain in 13-30% of patients with low back pain. Former
      surgical techniques had a high level of complications and low success rates. Newer
      mini-invasive surgical approaches have shown promising results in scientific studies. It is
      difficult to find an adequate control group for surgery as most patients already have tried
      conservative and alternative treatments without effect. A sham-designed study is the best
      alternative. This study is designed as a prospective randomized double blinded controlled
      mulitcenter trial. The investigators want to examine whether there is a difference in SI
      joint pain in patients operated with miniinvasive arthrodesis of the SI joint compared to a
      sham operated control group. Patients with SI joint pain are included. They will be
      randomized to either surgery with arthrodesis or sham surgery. Neither patient nor health
      personell who work with the patient after the surgery will know what has been done. The
      primary end point for the study is sacroiliac joint pain on the operated side after 6 months.
