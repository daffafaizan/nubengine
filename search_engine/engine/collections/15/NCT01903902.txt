    
      Drug-eluting balloon (DEB) have emerged as a potential alternative to overcome the
      limitations of drug-eluting stents such as restenosis or stent thrombosis.

      DEB angioplasty is proven to be effective clinically for the treatment of in-stent
      restenosis. However, DEB for de novo lesions, especially in small vessels is less studied.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-eluting
      balloon (SeQuentÂ® Please) for treatment of lesions in native small coronary arteries.
