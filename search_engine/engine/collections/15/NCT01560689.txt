    
      Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a life-threatening pulmonary late-onset complication
      following allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT), commonly attributed to graft versus host
      disease (GVHD), and carries a poor prognosis. Although immunosuppressive treatments (IS)
      represents the main therapeutic approach in this disorder, these medications are rarely
      efficient and alternative approaches are strongly needed. Because, the combination of inhaled
      steroids and long-acting bronchodilator are known to decrease respiratory symptoms, prevent
      exacerbations and improve lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases with
      bronchiolar component, they may have beneficial effects in BO. Thus, the investigators
      conducted a pilot open-labeled trial to evaluate the therapeutic effects of inhaled
      Budesonide/Formoterol combination (400/12 Âµg twice a day) without modifying systemic IS
      received by the patients.
