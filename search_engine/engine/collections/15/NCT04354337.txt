      preliminary effectiveness of a technology-based sleep intervention - Sleep Innovation for
      Preschoolers with Arthritis (SIPA) - that provides JIA parents with the necessary tools
      (self-efficacy, motivation, activation) to set goals, problem solve, and improve sleep in
      young children with JIA. SIPA will address the causes of sleep deficiency including
      behavioral sleep problems (e.g., sleep onset delay, frequent night awakenings, and sleep
      onset association disorder) in preschoolers with JIA using a single-arm pre- and post-test
      pilot study. Investigators will pilot test the intervention with 18 parents and preschoolers
      with JIA. Investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention
      among users, as will as analyze its preliminary effectiveness in terms of changes in
      behavioral sleep problems in the preschoolers pre- and post-intervention. The specific aims
      are to:

      Aim 1. Apply a user-centered iterative design approach to develop and test the usability of a
      technology- based sleep self-management intervention - Sleep Innovation for Preschoolers with
      Arthritis (SIPA) - for 2-5-year-old children (preschoolers) with juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis (JIA).

      2. Describe the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the SIPA
      intervention to address the causes of behavioral sleep problems (e.g., frequent night
      awakenings, and sleep onset association disorder) that are the main cause of sleep deficiency
      in preschoolers with JIA using a single-arm pre- and post-test pilot study.
