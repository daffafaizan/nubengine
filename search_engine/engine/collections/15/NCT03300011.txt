    
      UCEPPCIOCT maintains a prospective clinical registry of all individual who undergo cardiac
      angiography,PCI or optimistic medicine treatment.

      1. research objective to observe the changes of cardiac function postoperative PCI in
      patients with CTO and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, and provide the
      reality basis for PCI strategy in clinical patients with CTO . 2. research content: follow up
      the patients with CTO by using echocardiography in preoperative and postoperative PCI in 1m,
      3ms, 6ms, 12ms to assess the changes of cardiac structure and cardiac function. 2, comparison
      the 'incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events undergo PCI treatment in success and
      failure group in patients with CTO (such as severe angina attack, severe acute coronary
      syndrome, severe heart failure should be rehospitalized , fatal arrhythmia and sudden cardiac
      death, etc.)
