      if infected with COVID-19. Also, there are reports on fewer treatment activities among
      psychiatric patients (e.g. higher heart disease mortality), lower hospitalization rate and
      fewer invasive cardiac procedures among persons with schizophrenia than among the general
      population. This conveys a risk not only for the patient but for the spread of COVID-19 in
      the community. At present, we expect the outcome of a COVID-19 infection to be worse among
      the mentioned psychiatric patient population, but whether the spread of COVID-19 differs from
      the pattern observed in the general population is unknown. This information is of pivotal
      interest to come up with sufficient treatment strategies - especially when facing a possible
      second surge in the COVID-19 spread. Moreover, it is to the best of our knowledge unknown
      whether a possible CNS COVID-19 infection will worsen existing psychopathology among patients
      with severe schizophrenia, schizoaffective- or bipolar affective disorder. The study is
      exploratory in nature including as many patients as possible for testing. The target
      population is patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or a bipolar
      affective disorder receiving in-patient or out-patient care via one of the psychiatric
      centres in The Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark. Each patient will
      attend 3 study visits during a period of 12 months. A blood sample for IgG and IgM analysis
      for will be drawn at every visit.
