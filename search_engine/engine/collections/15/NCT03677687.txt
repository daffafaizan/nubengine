      physical health interventions. There appears to be some consensus about the benefits of
      standard mindfulness courses, such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy on stress, anxiety and depression, and other health
      conditions. In terms of physical activity, however, evidence for the use of mindfulness
      training to promote and improve physical activity is scarce and shows conflicting results.
      Evidence suggests that mindfulness training may enhance psychological factors related to
      exercise, such as intrinsic motivation to engage in physical activity, tolerance of physical
      activity-related discomfort, and physical activity self-regulation, which could potentially
      enhance physical activity maintenance in the long run.
