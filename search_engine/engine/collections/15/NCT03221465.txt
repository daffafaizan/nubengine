      obese. Among kidney (KT) and liver transplant (LT) recipients, weight gain and obesity is
      associated with poor graft function. Yet, within a year of transplantation, habituation to a
      sedentary lifestyle, changes in metabolism, and immunosuppression drugs contribute to an
      average 4-10 kg weight gain for recipients. Recent innovations in wearable device technology
      can passively monitor an individual's physical activity. Additionally, incentives and health
      questions designed using insights from behavioral economics have been shown to motivate
      device engagement and improvements in health behaviors. A remotely-monitored exercise program
      could improve behavior change and potentially be durable because it takes advantage of the
      high motivation for improving health in this population. The objective of this study is to
      use a randomized, controlled trial to test the efficacy of a home-based exercise program
      using wearable devices, health engagement questions and financial incentives. Participants in
      the intervention arm will establish a baseline step count during the first two weeks,
      followed by a 12-week intervention period and a 4-week follow-up period.
