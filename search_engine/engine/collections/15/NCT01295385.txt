        1. to quantify the myocardial blood flow at rest and after "cold pressor test" in a
           population of healthy volunteers. The myocardial blood flow will be obtained by
           estimating myocardial blood flow at the venous coronary sinus site. This allows us to
           quantify a possible endothelial dysfunction in a reproducible way. No MRI study in
           diabetic patients has ever been led until now with this technique.

        2. to estimate the metabolic and structural abnormalities in this population, with
           particularly:

             -  Quantification of the myocardial metabolism in vivo by spectrometry of phosphorus
                31.

             -  Structural abnormalities: become integrated into the description of diabetic
                cardiomyopathy.
