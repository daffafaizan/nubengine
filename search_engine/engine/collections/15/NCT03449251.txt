      cardiovascular complications and mortality. Unfortunately, current therapies for diabetes
      have failed to be translated into improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting an
      urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies that can ultimately achieve the dual
      outcome of improving glycaemic control and improving cardiovascular function.

      While the precise cellular mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated, we hypothesise that
      the apelin and relaxin pathways meet these two criteria and therefore are potential
      therapeutic targets in conditions of abnormal glucose metabolism and heart failure.

      Apelin and relaxin are safe for parenteral use as they are naturally occurring peptide
      hormones, have a short half-life and will be rapidly cleared. They target endogenous
      receptors and post-receptor signalling, and have been used in human trials without any
      significant side effects reported.
