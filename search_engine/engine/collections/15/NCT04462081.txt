      optional following liver biopsy. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether liver fat
      fraction and liver stiffness, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, are associated
      with subclinical cardiovascular disease, as evaluated by coronary artery calcium scan in
      diabetics. During the visit, patients will undergo review of medical history, vitals
      (including body mass index, blood pressure), physical exam, blood work, urine collection,
      ECG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including MR proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF)
      and MR elastography, ultrasound using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, and
      computed tomography (CT) scan for coronary artery calcium scoring. Blood work will be sent
      for labs relevant to traits of metabolic syndrome including markers for diabetes (hemoglobin
      A1C, fasting glucose) and hyperlipidemia (lipid panel). Serum, plasma and whole blood will be
      stored for future studies. Results from history, physical exam, and radiographic imaging will
      be analyzed and if they indicate the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, patients will
      be offered an optional liver biopsy for further assessment. All patients will be invited to
      continue in the study and have follow-up visits every two years for a total duration of the
      study of 5 years.
