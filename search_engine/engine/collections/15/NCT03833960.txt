      cancer patients presenting initially with involved axilla but shifted to clinically negative
      followed neoadjuvant treatment. This retrospective analysis is designed for period of one
      year before and one year later to compare the clinical outcomes for this patients in the
      setting where ALND was performed to the setting where SLNB was performed.

      The main hypothesis was to establish that SLNB after neoadjuvant treatment, in initially node
      positive breast cancer patients that achieve complete clinical remission following
      neoadjuvant treatment, is reliable alternative to ALND in maintenance of locoregional control
      of disease.

      For the purpose of this trial four groups were created and the results would be compared
      among them. In first postoperative year patients were monitored for the appearance of
      locoregional and distant recurrence.

      Data were collected individually for each patient and recorded in register. All data are
      available to all members of investigation team, members of Ethic Committee and statistician.

      Data collected in this trial would be used for publication.
