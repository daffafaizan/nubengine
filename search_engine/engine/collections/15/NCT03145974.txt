      outcomes of adult mechanically ventilated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
      [defined as a PaO2/FiO2 â‰¤300 mmHg on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O or
      more and FiO2 of 0.3 or more] admitted in a network of Spanish hospitals. Although there are
      few previous published observational studies examining the incidence and mortality of
      patients with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, there are no studies specifically assessing
      the epidemiological characteristics, patterns of ventilation and clinical outcomes in
      patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the current era of lung protective
      ventilation.

      Since the study is prospective, with consecutive collection of clinically relevant data from
      patients and with the participation of several ICUs from different geographical regions of
      Spain, the findings would be highly generalizable. The study is aimed to improve the
      knowledge on the epidemiology and outcome of ventilated patients, to identify the percentage
      of patients developing ARDS under the current definition, to validate a bedside scoring
      system developed by us for stratification of lung severity, and to examine the prognosis of
      hypoxemic respiratory failure, and risk factors associated with fatal outcome.
