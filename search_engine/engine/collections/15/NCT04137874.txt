        1. The proportion of patients hospitalized with a suspected acute stroke and discharged
           with a stroke diagnose is significantly increased using the ParaNASPP model compared
           with conventional prehospital care

        2. Time from onset to hospitalization is significantly reduced with the ParaNASPP model

        3. The ParaNASPP model identifies patients eligible for direct transportation for
           comprehensive stroke center
