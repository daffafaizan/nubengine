    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability of a single
      0.6 mg tablet of Colcrys® (colchicine, USP) when crushed and sprinkled on applesauce (1
      tablespoon) relative to the same dose given as an intact tablet to healthy subjects following
      an overnight fast. Sixteen healthy, non-smoking, non-obese, male and female volunteers
      between 18-55 years of age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each
      of two dosing regimens in sequence with a 14 day washout period between dosing periods. In
      each of the dosing periods, after an overnight fast, subjects will receive one intact
      Colcrys® 0.6 mg tablet (followed by 240 mL of water) or one Colcrys® 0.6 mg tablet crushed
      and sprinkled on 1 tablespoon of applesauce (followed by 240 ml of water) according to the
      randomization schedule. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and
      for 48 hours post-dose at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of
      colchicine. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature) will
      be measured prior to dosing, 1 hour ± 30 minutes post-dose and upon discharge from the
      clinical facility. Subjects will be monitored throughout their participation in the study for
      adverse reactions.
