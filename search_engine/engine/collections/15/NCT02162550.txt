      approximately 2.25 years and be randomly allocated for 18 months to Bydureon (2 mg/week) or
      matching placebo subcutaneous injections 1x/week in a 2:1 ratio. Participants are expected to
      have a wide range of cardiovascular (CVD) risk and will therefore allow us to explore the
      importance of disease extent at baseline as a predictor of response. Blocked randomization
      will be used to ensure equal distribution of gender and CVD history. Carotid plaque MRI
      assessments will be performed at baseline, 9 and 18 months.
