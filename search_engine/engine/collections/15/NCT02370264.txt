      I. To characterize patients' upper extremity functionality (using the Disabilities of the
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] questionnaire) and their perception of quality of life (using
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast [FACT-B] questionnaire) one to ten years
      after breast cancer surgery and compare it to the general population.

      II. To investigate whether patients' upper extremity functionality and their perception of
      quality of life after completion of breast cancer treatment changes over the duration of time
      between 1 -10 years after breast cancer surgery.

      III. To characterize patient perception of the impact of breast cancer on their quality of
      life in relation to current upper-extremity functionality 1-10 years after breast cancer
      surgery.

      IV. To characterize patients' upper extremity functionality (using the DASH questionnaire)
      and their perception of the impact of breast cancer on their quality of life (using the
      FACT-B questionnaire) in a sub group of individuals with stable metastatic breast cancer 1-10
      years after initial diagnosis and surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assist the multidisciplinary team to identify musculoskeletal barriers (if any) that
      impact a patient's long-term recovery with respect to the breast cancer treatments they have
      received.

      II. To assist in developing and implementing a physical therapy component within the
      Personalized Medicine to Breast Cancer Care Plan; this includes early detection of potential
      physical barriers, physical therapy intervention models, and development of survivorship
      planning for cancer-related musculoskeletal impairments.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete the DASH and FACT-B questionnaires over 30-45 minutes.
