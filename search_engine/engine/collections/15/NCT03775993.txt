      subgroups of patients with higher mortality. Apart from CHF, GH deficiency (GHD) per se
      increases cardiovascular mortality in the general population and low IGF-1 levels in the
      general population predict the development of ischemic heart disease and CHF. GHD modifies
      cardiac size and function, through a reduction in both myocardial growth and cardiac
      performance. The investigators therefore completed 2 studies aimed at evaluating the clinical
      status, neurohormonal parameters, exercise capacity, vascular reactivity, and left
      ventricular architecture and function in patients with GHD and CHF, at baseline and after 6
      months of GH replacement therapy. They subsequently extended the observation period up to 48
      months. At 6-months, GH replacement therapy improved clinical status and exercise capacity,
      as shown by a significant reduction of the Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire
      score, increased peak oxygen consumption and exercise duration, and flow mediated
      vasodilation of the brachial artery. No major adverse events were reported in the patients
      receiving GH.

      However, the encouraging results of these studies are limited by the lack of a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled design, insofar as the investigators performed a randomized controlled,
      single-blind study.
