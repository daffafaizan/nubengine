           ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).1 PPCI restores thrombolysis in
           myocardial infarction flow 3 (TIMI 3) in over 90% of patients. However ,there remains a
           small proportion of patients, who continue to exhibit overt impairment of myocardial
           reperfusion despite successful opening of infarct related epicardiual artery (IRA). This
           phenomenon is called no-reflow, which is largely because of severe microvascular
           obstruction (MVO).

        -  Belonging to the class of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs), tirofiban, can be
           useful in primary PCI for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).1,2The administration of
           tirofiban is an efficacious treatment option to reduce ischemic events in patients with
           The ACS and/or those undergoing PCI.2,3 In most guidelines, abciximab is recommended as
           the drug of first choice4 due to the finding that tirofiban is less effective than
           abciximab in platelet inhibition within 60 min of intravenous administration. However,
           some recent systemic reviews of randomized trials have not demonstrated obvious
           difference between smGPIs (eptifibatide or tirofiban) and abciximab in terms of
           angiographic, electrocardiographic, and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing primary
           PCI.5,6 Tirofiban may provide similar efficacy with an improved safety profile when
           compared with abciximab, particularly with a high-dose bolus regimen.7,8 In the new
           guideline, the recommended class of smGPIs has changed from IIb to IIa, but tirofiban
           remains with a pre-PCI indication of IIb, B.4 Although early treatment was associated
           with a significantly better TIMI flow and superior TIMI myocardial perfusion grades
           (TMPG) in some trials,9,10 no difference in clinical outcome was found between the 2
           strategies in later study.11 One potential cost of administration of GPIs could be
           increased bleeding, although both major bleeding and minor bleeding rate are low in the
           tirofiban-treated patients..
