      may be functionally normal. Hence the emergence process can be complicated in patients having
      diseased limbic structures or those having therapeutic removal of limbic structures as in
      epilepsy surgery. Limbic structures are responsible for memory, language and executive
      function and hence loss of some of these higher functions is to be expected in the
      postoperative period. Preoperative neuropsychological assessments are often used to predict
      their risk for postoperative loss of higher functions and behavior changes. In our experience
      the investigators have seen that there is a spectrum of emergence characteristics in patients
      undergoing temporal lobectomy that can vary from dangerously agitated patient to much
      sedated, unarousable patient. Delirium and agitation can be dangerous and have serious
      consequences for the patient such as injury, increased pain, hemorrhage, self-extubation and
      removal of catheters requiring physical or chemical restraint. On the other hand the
      unarousable patient may pose dangerous airway complications and limit neurological assessment
      in the immediate postoperative period. Hence it is essential to have a clue about post
      anesthesia emergence behavior in patients having epilepsy surgeries. The aim of this study is
      to look at the pattern of emergence from anesthesia after epilepsy surgery and to determine
      if preoperative neuropsychological assessment help predict the pattern of emergence in
      patients undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy.
