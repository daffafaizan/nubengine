      usually treated with oral iron supplements. Blood transfusion is reserved to women with
      hemoglobin levels < 6 g/dl and/or clinical symptoms of anemia. Without treatment, the
      restoration of blood parameters in postpartum anemia can take approximately one month
      (hemoglobin levels increase to 2.8 g/dl in 30 days). Several reports have demonstrated the
      efficacy of intravenous iron in severe anemia in non-obstetric pathologies. However, the
      clinical effect of intravenous iron in patients with postpartum hemoglobin levels ranging
      from 6.0 to 8.0 g/dl has been not reported. There has not been evaluated its capacity to
      restore hemoglobin levels and to minimize clinical side-effects of anemia (sickness,
      weariness, depression, anxiety).
