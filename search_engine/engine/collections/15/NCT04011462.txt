      perioperative period of patients submitted to digestive system surgeries and to evaluate a
      perioperative "Zero-Heat-Flux Cutaneous" body temperature thermometer in comparison to the
      standard care (temporal thermometer in the preoperative and postoperative, and esophageal in
      the intraoperative period). This is a randomized clinical trial consisting of three groups,
      namely: preoperative warming of patients with blanket and cotton sheet (control);
      preoperative warming with forced air warming system for 20 minutes (Intervention 1), and
      participants submitted to preoperative warming with a forced air warming system for 30
      minutes (Intervention 2)
