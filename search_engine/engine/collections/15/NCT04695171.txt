      subjects who underwent a prior hiatal hernia repair and anti-reflux surgery with either
      Magnetic Sphincter Augmentation (MSA) using LINX placement or fundoplication construction
      more than 2 years prior to initial study visit. Subjects will be enrolled by invitation only
      by participating investigators. Enrollment will consist of 300 LINX MSA patients and 150
      fundoplication patients with a total of 450 from 4 sites within the United States. Data will
      be collected for up to 6 years.The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      long-term incidence of hiatal hernia recurrence in patients who undergo hiatal hernia repair
      of a large (>3 cm) hernia with LINXÂ® device placement, and to compare this with hiatal hernia
      recurrence rates in patients who underwent hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication.
