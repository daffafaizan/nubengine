      after scaphoid non-union advanced collapse (SNAC) and scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC):
      the proximal row carpectomy and the four corner fusion. Both surgical procedures are rescue
      operations. They are used to reduce pain and to maintain the mobility, compared to a complete
      stiffening of the wrist.

      In previous studies are shown that the proximal row carpectomy shows a better mobility of the
      wrist postoperatively and a lower complication rate, whereas the four corner fusion has a
      lower progression of radiocarpale osteoarthritis and a better grip strength.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical, radiological and subjective outcomes
      after the treatment with a proximal row carpectomy or a four corner fusion.
