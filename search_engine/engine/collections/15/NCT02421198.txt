      prevention in peripubertal (9-12-year-old) youth. Efficacious community programs for youth
      are not available (although promising components exist), and thus the investigators propose
      to adapt the successful adult-focused YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP) for youth and
      families, and assess its impact on anthropometric, behavioral and physiological outcomes in
      support of the design (power calculation) of a full-scale trial. The proposed study will
      evaluate the adapted program using two formats (with and without mobile technologies).
      Secondary endpoints will include participant perceived burden, adherence, and program costs.

      Aim 1: Adapt an efficacious diabetes prevention program in adults (the YMCA Diabetes
      Prevention Program, or YDPP) for delivery to overweight peripubertal youth and their
      families, thereby establishing a YMCA Family Diabetes Prevention Program (YFDPP).

      Aim 2: Test the feasibility, participant acceptance (child and parent) and retention rates of
      the YFDPP using two formats, a 12-week YMCA-based face-to-face program and a 12-week program
      with content delivered through a combination of face-to-face and mobile devices.

      Aim 3: Test the impact of the new YFDPP using two formats on anthropometric (height, weight,
      BMI and waist circumference), behavioral (diet and physical activity), and physiological
      (fasting insulin, glucose, lipid) outcomes, using the resulting data to design an
      appropriately powered full-scale trial.
