      serum PTX3 levels, fasting plasma glucose and fasting insulin and other factors were
      measured. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at 24-28 weeks in all
      participants. According to the occurrence of GDM, subjects were divided into two groups: GDM
      group and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group.
