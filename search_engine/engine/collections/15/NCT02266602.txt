      electronic brachytherapy system, in patients with limited-volume in situ and early stage
      breast cancer, with endpoints of:

        -  Local recurrence in early stage breast cancer patients treated with IORT.

        -  Toxicity associated with IORT.

        -  Long-term disease-specific and overall survival

        -  Cosmetic results using the Harvard Scale at start and follow-up periods in patients
           treated with IORT.

        -  Quality of life in patients treated with IORT.

        -  Health care costs associated with IORT.
