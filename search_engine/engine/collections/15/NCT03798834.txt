      preoperative 0.25% bupivacaine FIB as a sole anesthetic technique in thromboembolectomy of
      unilateral chronic lower limb ischemia compared to neuraxial anesthesiaas a primary goal.
      Intraoperative hemodynamics variation, postoperative pain score, total analgesic rescue
      requests and the total amount of systemic rescue analgesia used in the first postoperative
      day in addition to any detected postoperative complications were secondary goals. The
      hypothesis is that; FIB will provide adequate anesthesia as neuraxial anesthesia.
