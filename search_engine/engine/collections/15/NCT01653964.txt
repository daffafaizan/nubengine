      performance of MBI at an administered dose of 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi, which is reduced from
      the previously used doses of 20-30 mCi. In order to safely introduce MBI as a screening
      modality, we aim to perform MBI using 4 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi. An image processing algorithm
      called Wide Beam Reconstruction (WBR) has been tailored for MBI technology with the goal of
      allowing either the current administered dose or current acquisition time to be reduced by
      half.
