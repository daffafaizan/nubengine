      transvenous phrenic-nerve-stimulating diaphragm pacing on clinical outcomes in mechanically
      ventilated patients. By delivering electrical stimulation to the phrenic nerves, which in
      turn causes the diaphragm muscle to contract, the PROTECT DPTS is intended to protect the
      diaphragm from atrophy and preserve lung mechanics to reduce lung inflammation and injury
      associated with short-term mechanical ventilation. Sustained lung and diaphragm health during
      early mechanical ventilation is expected to reduce the risk of comorbidities, improve
      clinical outcomes such as weaning success, and thereby reduce the number of patients who
      require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
