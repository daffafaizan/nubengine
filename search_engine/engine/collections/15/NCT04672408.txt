    
      Monocentric, randomized, double-blind comparative crossover clinical study.

      Patients with a standard pacing indication with >20% ventricular pacing, with a baseline LVEF
      >40%, implanted with a functioning His bundle lead and a backup right ventricular lead, will
      be randomized to 6-months periods of right ventricular pacing and of His bundle pacing. The
      primary outcome is LVEF assessed by gated Equilibrium Radionuclide Angiography. Secondary
      outcomes are diastolic function, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, quality
      of life, 6-minute walk test, heart failure hospitalisations and device electrical parameters.
