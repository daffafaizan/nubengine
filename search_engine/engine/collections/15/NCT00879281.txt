      to be clinically relevant. Until now, research failed to identify the effectiveness of a
      written individualized Action Plan (AP) to achieve this. The current multicenter,
      single-blind RCT with a follow-up period of 6 months, evaluates the hypothesis that
      individualized AP's reduce exacerbation recovery time. Patients are included from regular
      respiratory nurse visits and allocated to either usual care or an additional AP providing
      individualized treatment prescriptions (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) related to a
      colour coded symptom status (reinforcement at 1 and 4 months). Although usually not possible
      in self-management trials, we ensured blinding of patients, using a modified informed consent
      procedure in which patients give consent to postponed information. Exacerbations in both
      study arms are defined using the Anthonisen symptom diary-card algorithm. The Clinical COPD
      Questionnaire (CCQ) is assessed every 3-days. CCQ-recovery time of an exacerbation is our
      primary outcome. Additionally, healthcare utilisation, anxiety, depression, treatment delay,
      and self-efficacy are assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.
