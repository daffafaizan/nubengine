      important public health problems, it affects 70 million Europeans, accounts for 42% of
      patients with chronic low back pain and costs over $100 billion each year in the European
      Union. DDD results in a disabling loss of mechanical function. Today, no efficient therapy is
      available. The disease results from degeneration of cartilage discs with loss of the collagen
      matrix and nucleus pulposus chondrocyte. Chronic cases often receive surgery, which may lead
      to biomechanical problems and accelerated degeneration of adjacent segments. Our consortium
      partners have developed and studied stem cell-based, regenerative therapies with encouraging
      results in phase 1 and 2 trials. Patients exhibited rapid and progressive improvement of
      functional and pain indexes by 50% within 6 months and by 65% to 78% after 1 year with no
      side effects. In addition, MRI T2 relaxation measurements demonstrated a significant
      improvement of cartilage signal. To develop the world's first effective treatment of DDD,
      RESPINE aims to assess, via a randomized, controlled, phase 3 clinical trial including 112
      patients with DDD, the efficacy of an allogenic intervertebral mesenchymal stem cell
      (MSC)-based therapy. This innovative therapy aims to rapidly (within 3 months) and durably
      (at least 24 months) reduce pain and disability. In addition, the consortium aims to provide
      new knowledge on immune response & safety associated with allogeneic BM-MSC intradiscal
      injection.
