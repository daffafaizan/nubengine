      2-year period in an emergency department of a training and research hospital and compared
      success of manual and mechanical chest compressions in terms of return of spontaneous
      circulation, 30-day survival, and hospital discharge. Investigators present the study as an
      in-hospital cardiac arrest study; however, all of the resuscitation performed in the cases
      included in the study were performed in the emergency department.
