    
      this study is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      parallel-group study to evaluate Hemay005 efficacy and safety of the treatment of patients
      with Beh√ßet Disease(BD). Around 252 subjects will be randomized into this study.

      The whole study will including 4 phases that a screening phase, core-treatment
      phase(12weeks), extended-treatment phase (12weeks) and follow-up phase(4 weeks).

      Screening: All subjects will undergo a screening period of up to 6 weeks prior to baseline
      visit (visit 2, day of randomization, Day0).

      Core treatment phase: eligible BD patients will randomly assigned to Hemay005 high-dose
      group, Hemay005 low-dose group, placebo (core treatment phase) + Hemay005 high-dose group
      (extended treatment phase), or placebo (core treatment phase) + Hemay005 low-dose group
      (extended treatment phase). During the core-treatment period, hemay005 will be administered
      twice daily for 12 weeks. The randomization was stratified to minimize the imbalance between
      treatment groups.

      Extended treatment phase: Subjects in the high-dose and low-dose groups during the extended
      treatment period will still given the dose of core-treatment phase for 12 weeks. Subjects who
      received placebo during the core treatment will assigned to either a high-dose group or a
      low-dose group according the allocation at visit 2 until 12 weeks after. During this period,
      the subject and investigator are remain blind at this stage.

      Follow up phase: Subjects in the study (also including those who withdraw from treatment for
      any reason) will have another follow up for 4 weeks after the end of the last administration.
