      muscle is the primary site of glucose deposition, and decreased muscle mass plays a role in
      impaired glucose metabolism in patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Skeletal
      muscle resistance to insulin action appears to be the link between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and
      sarcopenia. Hyperglycemia is a metabolic dysfunction which can potentially damage muscle
      cells. Insulin deficiency leads to marked muscle catabolism that can be reversed by exogenous
      insulin administration.

      The metabolic disorder in diabetics may be reversible.Thus, it may be possible to restore
      physical ability by restoring the musculoskeletal system.Therefore, the diagnosis of
      sarcopenia if made can lead to interventions which may prevent the deterioration of body
      composition and the subsequent deterioration of quality of life. According to the results of
      the aforementioned studies it is still inconclusive if the metabolic disorder in diabetes may
      be related to sarcopenia, or sarcopenia may be a consequence of diabetes.
