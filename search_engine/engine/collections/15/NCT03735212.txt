      substance abuse treatment providers, obstetricians, and child welfare providers, and (ii) to
      enhance child welfare outcomes for pregnant women who are at risk of substance misuse and
      their babies. There is a particular need for a partnership in this area as New York State
      implements the 2016 Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) legislation, which
      focuses on a multi-agency approach to the problem of substance abuse for families at risk of
      child welfare involvement.

      Services are delivered through Montefiore's Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's
      Health (Obstetrics). Mothers-to-be who have screened at risk or tested positive for
      substances will be randomly assigned to receive services as usual as part of the comparison
      group, or to receive enhanced prenatal services as part of the program group. Program
      services include 3 empirically supported interventions: Motivational Enhancement to enhance
      intrinsic motivation to change unhealthy behaviors and support their referral to substance
      abuse treatment; Incredible Years to improve parenting skills, especially related to infancy
      and early childhood; and Contingency Management to reinforce healthy behaviors, including
      attendance at treatment and abstinence.

      Women enrolled into the study are randomly assigned into a program or comparison group.
      Parent, child, and family outcomes are evaluated using self-report and administrative data.
