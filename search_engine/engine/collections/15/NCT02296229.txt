      I. To establish the efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with
      high-risk localized prostate cancer compared to historical data from clinical trials.

      II. To establish the safety with physician-reported outcomes after SBRT in patients with high
      risk localized prostate cancer.

      III. To establish the quality of life with patient-reported validated questionnaires after
      SBRT in patients with high risk localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT daily or every other day for a total of 5 fraction not exceeding 14
      consecutive days. Patients may also receive androgen deprivation therapy for up to 9 months
      at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 5 years, and then every 12 months thereafter.
