      antagonist to metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGlur5) developed by Novartis, in a
      double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced manner on alcoholism risk-relevant tasks.

      Drug/placebo will be administered on 2 separate visits separated by 1 week. More
      specifically, this project examines 4 functional MRI tasks related to different aspects of
      reward and/or impulsivity-related behavior in different contexts, compares the underlying
      neural circuitry across tasks, and uses a pharmacologic probe of the glutamatergic system to
      examine N-methyl-D-Aspartate and Dopamine (NMDA/DA) interactions.

      The combined measures provide the opportunity to advance our understanding of specific
      aspects of brain function related to familial alcoholism vulnerability in an already well
      characterized population as some members evolve into alcohol abuse. In addition, as well as
      conventional within-task analyses, functional network connectivity and allied approaches will
      be used to examine brain networks across the above tasks.
