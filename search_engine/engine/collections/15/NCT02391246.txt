      through the use of positron emission tomography (PET) as well as other techniques. The
      best-studied PET radiotracer for this application is [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Normal
      brain matter is very FDG-avid, making it more difficult to identify lesions and in addition,
      inflammation associated with radiation injury has been shown to be FDG avid.

      In light of this, variations of the standard FDG protocols have been proposed in order to
      increase overall accuracy, including dual time point imaging (DTPI), consisting of injecting
      the patient with the standard radiotracer and acquiring two sets of images several hours
      apart, typically the normal initial images in addition to a delayed acquisition set.

      There is good reason to suspect that DTPI FDG-PET would be useful a technique for
      characterizing lesions in the brain. It's been shown that FDG uptake by normal brain
      parenchyma initially increases then decreases with time, while tumor uptake typically
      increases and then plateaus. This pattern of increasing and then decreasing FDG activity has
      also been seen in inflammatory tissue. The difference in FDG uptake at different times is
      what allows for a better distinction between malignant and benign tissue.
