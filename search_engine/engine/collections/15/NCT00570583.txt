      with distinct clinical, cognitive, and neural phenotypes during acute LLD, which in turn have
      distinct genotypic correlates.

      Specifically, CN individuals will have earlier first onset of depression (EOD) relative to
      AD, more negative life stress during acute depression compared with AD and PCI, and greater
      white matter integrity; CN will also be associated with the AA genotype of the COMT val158met
      polymorphism, which may confer both neuroprotection and higher stress sensitivity. PCI will
      have more EOD relative to AD, greater frailty, and lower white matter integrity than NC. AD
      will be associated with later age of depression onset (LOD), greater appetite loss, lower
      anxiety, smaller hippocampal volume, and greater memory impairment. To test these hypotheses,
      we propose the following
