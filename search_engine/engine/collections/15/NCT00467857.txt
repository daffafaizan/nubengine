      endogenous and exogenous. The endogenous flora of the patient's skin, mucous membranes, or
      hollow viscera are the source of pathogens for most SSIs. In addition to the known sources of
      SSI pathogen, there are also known risk factors for SSI. The risk factors for SSIs may be
      patient-related, or related to the preoperative, intra-operative, and post-operative surgical
      treatment and care of the patient. Many known risk factors that contribute to SSIs include,
      but are not limited to age, nutritional status, co-morbidities, length of pre-operative stay,
      duration of operation, preoperative skin prep, and surgical techniques. In addition, there
      are certain surgical procedures in which the risks for developing SSI are greater than other
      surgical procedures. While there are various pre-operative and post-operative techniques or
      approaches to prevent these infections in patients undergoing surgeries, such as
      pre-operative skin care techniques, appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis, and the use of
      other post-operative anti-microbial methods, by immobilizing the patient's endogenous skin
      flora, an opportunity exists to reduce the rate of skin flora contamination which leads to
      wound contamination.
