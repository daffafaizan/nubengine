    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, two-part study of AZD5213 in adolescents (ages 12-17
      years) with Tourette's Disorder.

      In Part 1 of the study, following an up to 21-day screening period, on Day 1, after baseline
      procedures are performed, eligible subjects will receive a single, low dose of AZD5213,
      in-clinic.

      After study drug dosing on Day 1, safety and tolerability will be assessed in-clinic, and
      blood samples will be taken for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. On Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
      subjects will take study drug, and will be contacted via telephone and adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be assessed. On Day 8, safety, tolerability, and blood sampling
      for PK analysis (predose and 2-4 hours post-dose) will be performed in-clinic. Part 2 of the
      study will consist of six consecutive crossover periods. In Part 2 of the study, each study
      drug will be administered in two 4-week periods (six treatment periods, total). Each study
      drug will be received in one of Periods 1-3, and again in one of Periods 4-6. Approximately
      24 subjects will receive study drug in Part 1 of this study in order to complete
      approximately 18 subjects in Part 2.
