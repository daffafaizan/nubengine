      and in patients relapsing after Allo-SCT. The mechanisms of action involve immunomodulation,
      anti-angiogenesis activity, direct anti tumor activity and effects on microenvironment. So
      far, the experience with lenalidomide after Allo-SCT has been limited to patients with
      progressive disease. In such patients, some responses are observed but most of them are
      transient with median progression-free survivals of less than one year. Lenalidomide used as
      maintenance therapy in patients with persistent rather than progressive disease might be a
      better approach.

      Lenalidomide is interesting in the Allo-SCT setting also because some recent studies focusing
      on its immunological properties have suggested that the molecule could stimulate the graft
      versus myeloma effect. First, it has been demonstrated in vitro that lenalidomide can inhibit
      the proliferation and the suppressor function of regulatory T cells. Secondly, a clinical
      study using lenalidomide as salvage therapy after Allo-SCT demonstrated an increase of
      activated T cells and NK cells. Finally, a case report described a patient's response to
      lenalidomide associated with the development of an acute graft versus host disease.

      Taken together, these data suggest that patients with MM who have a persistent disease after
      a reduced-intensity Allo-SCT might benefit from a post-transplant maintenance strategy with
      lenalidomide by a direct anti-tumor effect and a stimulation of the graft versus myeloma
      effect. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of such a strategy.
