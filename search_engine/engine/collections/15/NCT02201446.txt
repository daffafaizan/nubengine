      of morbidity and mortality characterized by alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury.
      Despite recent advances in pathogenetic mechanisms and therapy strategies of ALI, efforts to
      identify circulating factors that predict severity of ALI/ARDS patients have been
      unrevealing.

      CD74 (also known as a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II invariant chain) is a
      type II transmembrane protein, recently found to be the high-affinity receptor of macrophage
      migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF promotes neutrophil accumulation in alveolar space via
      binding to CD74 expressed on the cell surface. Our previous studyï¼Œ consistent with others,
      has shown that MIF was highly expressed in acute lung injury (ALI). In addition, we also
      detected highly CD74 expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model.
      Recently, a circulating form of CD74 was discovered in autoimmune liver disease. Similarly,
      we investigated the existence of soluble form of CD74 in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid (BALF) in ALI mouse model and burn or trauma related ALI patients. Based on these
      finds, we postulated that soluble CD74 might participate in regulating lung inflammation and
      be a potential novel ALI/ARDS biomarker.
