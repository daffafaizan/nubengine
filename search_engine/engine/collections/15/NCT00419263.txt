      treatment of human experimental influenza using an oral formulation. Parenteral formulations
      of peramivir (for intramuscular and intravenous injection) entered clinical development at
      the time of this Phase 2 study. A series of Phase 1 studies in human volunteers was completed
      that provided safety and pharmacokinetic results that supported the initiation of this Phase
      2 multinational, randomized, double-mask study that compared the antiviral efficacy and
      safety of peramivir administered intramuscularly versus placebo in adults with uncomplicated
      acute influenza. Because of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of
      peramivir - a long terminal half life in plasma and an extended duration of binding to the
      neuraminidase enzyme - subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of
      one of three treatments: peramivir 150 mg, peramivir 300 mg, and placebo. Study drug was
      administered as one 2-mL intramuscular injection in each gluteal muscle (total of 4 mL,
      injected in divided doses). This multinational study was originally to be conducted at
      approximately 80 sites in the US and Canada. When enrollment during the North American
      influenza season of 2006-2007 did not achieve the target, the study was extended to sites in
      Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Hong Kong.
