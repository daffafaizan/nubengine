      I-II pilot study.

      Thirty-two (32) elderly patients (70-85 years of age) with type 31A2 y 31A3 fracture of the
      femur (AO/ASIF (Association for the Study of Internal Fixation) classification) admitted at
      the emergency room of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona will be randomized 1:1 to one of the
      two treatment-arms (endomedullary nailing + XCEL-MT-OSTEO-BETA or isolated endomedullary
      nailing as the standard treatment). Once surgically treated, patients will be followed for 12
      month with the primary objective of safety. Secondary objectives are efficacy through axial
      tomography and xRay, clinical efficacy and quality of life questionnaire (EUROQOL-5D).
