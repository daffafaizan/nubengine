      atrial fibrillation performed either using the RCS, or manually. Contact force information
      will be collected during the procedure, but the operators will be blinded to this
      information. Patients will have follow-up to include post-procedural cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging and ambulatory electrocardiograms.
