      brain activity) training for self-modulation of neural plasticity to boost memory performance
      in Veterans. The recent advance of NF with Brian-Computer Interface (BCI) has provided a
      novel way to examine brain functions and plasticity. Thus far, there have been limited
      applications that have developed effective experimental and clinical paradigms for
      rehabilitation in Veterans. Historically, brainwave patterns during memory task performance
      have been analysed offline, a methodology which does not allow real-time NF modulation and
      training. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that optimal memory-related
      brainwave patterns of a Veteran can be trained. The online NF allows maximization of
      brainwave patterns associated with healthier memory states.

      The development of efficient NF paradigms to augment memory performance is an important first
      step for the application of this nonpharmacologic intervention to improve combat Veterans'
      memory functions and potential for treating MCI due to mild TBI or pain. The pilot work will
      start with wider range of Veterans using state-of-the-art wearable wireless brain-computer
      interface headset, which is affordable and can be easily set up in VAMCs and eventually in
      remote assessment settings. This innovative, cognitive neuroscience based, nonpharmacologic
      intervention serves to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of combat Veterans who are
      at risk for degenerative dementia.
