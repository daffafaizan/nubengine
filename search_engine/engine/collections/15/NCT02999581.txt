      exercise. This includes providing carbohydrate and a number of ergogenic nutrients prior to,
      during and/or following exercise. As a result, a number of pre-workout supplements have been
      developed to increase energy availability, promote vasodilation and/or positively affect
      exercise capacity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of ingesting a
      pre-workout dietary supplement during resistance training on training adaptations.
