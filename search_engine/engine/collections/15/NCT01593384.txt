      DM (digital mammography) and DM+DBT, in our practice and the impact on cancer detection in
      our screening population. This is a two-site study in which all asymptomatic subjects
      undergoing the FDA-approved combination standard of care Digital Mammogram and Digital Breast
      Tomosynthesis (DM+DBT) exam will be eligible for the trial. Each subject will be her own
      control.Only radiologists who have gone through 8 hours of Tomosynthesis training will
      interpret the DM and DBT images. These radiologists will categorize each case as either dense
      (BI-RADS density score of 3 or 4) or fatty (BI-RADS density score of 1 or 2). The radiologist
      will initially read the standard of care DM part of the study first and record their
      interpretation and final BIRADs category. The same radiologist will then interpret the DM+DBT
      combination study and record their final interpretation and BIRADs category. Prior mammogram
      studies will be used for comparison when reading the DM and DM+DBT studies.
