      chance of being given the tranexamic acid or the placebo. Neither you nor the study doctor
      will know which treatment you are getting.

      You will receive one 1000 mg dose of either tranexamic acid or placebo immediately before
      surgery. This dose of tranexamic acid or placebo will be given in your vein over 15 minutes.

      Information from your medical record related to your surgery and recovery time in the
      hospital will be collected by medical staff assisting with this study and recorded on study
      forms. These study forms will be labeled with your study number instead of your name.
      Additionally, if you return to the hospital within 90 days after you went home from the
      hospital, information about that hospital visit(s) will also be collected from your medical
      record.
