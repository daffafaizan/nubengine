      sarcomatoid carcinoma with or without metastasis, sequenced transcriptomes, perform whole
      exome sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling for triplets, each
      comprising normal lung tissue, primary pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, and its synchronous
      matched metastasis, as well as analyzed genomics of lung cancer characterized previously by
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
