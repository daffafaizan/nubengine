      International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) classification applied to
      transbronchial biopsies, which represents an arbitrary international consensus. Recent
      data-driven approaches using molecular and conventional technologies indicate that this
      system produces frequently incorrect diagnoses with potential harm to patients due to
      inappropriate treatment. especially in relationship to the correct diagnosis of chronic lung
      allograft dysfunction is a pressing need. To address this unmet need and improve diagnostics
      in the area of organ transplantation, the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC,
      University of Alberta) has developed a new diagnostic system - the Molecular Microscope®
      Diagnostic System (MMDx) that interprets biopsies in terms of their molecular phenotype. The
      MMDx, developed first in kidney transplant biopsies with thoroughly established phenotypes,
      will now be adapted to lung transplant transbronchial biopsies (TBBs). Microarray analysis of
      lung allograft biopsy specimens will be compared to conventional allograft phenotyping,
      including clinical, physiologic, radiographic and histological assessment. The present study
      will use the MMDx™ system to assess and report TBBs, and validate and refine this system in
      300 unselected prospectively collected lung TBBs. A subset of the study will examine the
      third bifurcation mucosal endobronchial biopsies (3BMBs) paired with TBBs from 50 patients to
      see if the safer 3BMBs can substitute for the TBB to be used by MMDx™. Due to a considerable
      interest and support from participating Centers, the study is further extended and collected
      818 TBBs and 657 3BMBs from 657 patients. Thus this is the extension of the INTERLUNG study -
      INTERLUNGEX.
