      with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause
      mortality. Non-enzymatic glycation plays an important role in the development of
      physiological and pathophysiological processes such as aging, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and
      chronic renal failure. Preventing glycation can minimize diabetic complications. Advanced
      glycation end products (AGEs) are formed endogenously when the carbonyl groups of reducing
      sugars nonenzymatically react with the free amino groups on proteins. AGEs are generated in
      vivo as a normal consequence of metabolism, but their formation is accelerated under
      conditions of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and increased oxidative stress. It can also form
      in food processing and the variety and the amount of dietary AGEs (dAGE) depend on food
      nutrients, the heating used in food processing, pH conditions, presence of some metal ions
      (Cu++, Fe++) and water content. In this study 2 groups of metabolic syndrome patients(22 in
      each group) will receive same low calorie diet and one of the groups plus restricted dietary
      AGEs according to the international references.Along 8 weeks the investigators will talk to
      each patient by phone and every months the participants will come and the investigators will
      take anthropocentric measurements and the recommendations for diets will review. The
      three-day 24-hour recall food questionnaire will take at first,middle and the end of program.
