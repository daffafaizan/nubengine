      informed consent, will be eligible for participation in this study. At the Visit 2 (Day1)
      subjects will receive the study medication and instructions for its administration.
      Thereafter, subjects will return to the investigational site at week 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48,
      for efficacy and safety assessments.

      Subjects who meet the virologic failure criteria will return to the investigational site
      approximately one week later to repeat viral RNA testing (Virologic Failure Confirmation
      visit). If virologic failure is confirmed and the viral load meets the criteria for
      resistance testing, viral resistance testing will then be performed.
