        -  Determine immunologic responses in patients who have completed first-line therapy for
           Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with Hodgkin's antigens-GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccine.

        -  Determine the durability of these immunologic responses in these patients.

        -  Determine the utility of an Epstein-Barr virus reporter system for monitoring cellular
           vaccine responses.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Beginning 4-6 months after last chemotherapy, patients receive Hodgkin's
      antigens-GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccine on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4
      courses.

      Immunologic responses are serially monitored along with disease status.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
