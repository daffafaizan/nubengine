      Climb Test) were preceded by a 10-minute rest in sitting position. The time of test
      performance, the walked distance and steps made as well as the mean and maximum gait velocity
      and the calories burned were assessed using the above-mentioned Samsung Health application .
      ECG results were assessed with the use of ECG M-Trace Base II application described above. In
      addition, cardiological parameters such as: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and arterial blood saturation were assessed. The measurements
      were performed at rest and directly after SCMT and SCT. Additionally, after the tests, the
      level of dyspnoea and fatigue was assessed according to the modified Borg scale (score 0-10).
