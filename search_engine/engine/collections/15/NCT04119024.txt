      I. Safety.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Clinical response. II. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell tumor infiltration and
      persistence. III. Impact of IL-2 on the persistence and tumor infiltration of IL13Ralpha2 CAR
      T cells.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Cytokine release syndrome analysis. II. Evaluation of endogenous anti-tumor immune
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IL13Ralpha2-specific hinge-optimized
      4-1BB-co-stimulatory CAR/truncated (Cluster of Differentiation 19) CD19-expressing autologous
      TN/MEM cells (IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells).

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -5 to -4 and
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 15-30 minutes on days -4 to -1. Patients then receive
      IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells IV on day 0. Patients may also receive recombinant interleukin-2
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, then every year for at least 15 years.
