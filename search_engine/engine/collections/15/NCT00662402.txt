      created to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical and translational research through
      the provision of expert consultation. The program is divided into units that provide access
      to expert consultants in biostatistics, research design (with consultants representing
      multiple distinct methodologies and disease interests), data management (including data
      structure and database design), ethics, and scientific writing. With funding from the NIH,
      the program is able to offer a free hour of consultation in each of its units (up to 4 hours)
      but charges for additional services to cover costs.

      There have been no studies of research consultation services. Though the benefit may seem
      self evident, such programs are expensive and distract senior researcher from more creative
      work. Justifying research consultation is important given the multitude of activities vying
      for attention and funding. Observational studies of the impact of research consultation
      services will always be limited by confounding, particularly confounding by indication since
      those seeking such services may be more highly motivated and organized. Thus, a randomized
      trial is warranted.
