      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.

      After 3 months of low cholesterol diet, patients are randomized to receive atorvastatin
      tablets daily (arm I) or placebo tablets daily (arm II) for 3 months. Arm I patients receive
      increasing doses of atorvastatin every 4 weeks until individual maximum tolerated doses
      (MTDs) are determined.

      After 3 months of treatment, all patients are given atorvastatin in a 6-9 month open label
      extended evaluation. Arm I patients receive atorvastatin for an additional 6 months and arm
      II patients receive atorvastatin for 9 months with increasing doses of atorvastatin every 4
      weeks for the first 3 months until MTDs are determined.

      Patients are followed every 6-8 weeks for one year.
