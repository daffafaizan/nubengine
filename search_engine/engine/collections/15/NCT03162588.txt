      Moyamoya disease (MMD) and Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) registry. MMD or MMS patients with acute
      neurological presentation such as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are eligible.

      After inclusion, initial evaluation including transfemoral angiography is performed. A 3 day
      pre-procedure IV erythropoietin (120000 international units[IU] #3) is given for promotion of
      arteriogenesis, than multiple burrhole procedure is performed. Arteriogenesis is evaluated by
      6 month transfemoral angiography.
