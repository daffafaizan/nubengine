      guidance of neural rehabilitation. The tool monitors patient attention level and guides the
      therapist online regarding the effectiveness of the current exercise employed. It is well
      established that maintaining a high level of attention plays a major role in the clinical
      outcome in rehabilitation. The monitoring is achieved using a cheap and simple to use EEG
      system and a breakthrough signal processing algorithm. The feedback provides the caregiver
      and patient with online information regarding the effectiveness of attention recruited during
      a given exercise. Furthermore, the investigators are developing and fine-tuning a set of
      guidelines to attain optimal attention levels. These guide lines include : Choosing an
      appropriate goal/movement for each patient; Regulating the optimal degree of effort by
      changing the difficulty level of the exercise, changing the exercise or suggesting a short
      rest period; Integrating supportive exercises such as stretches, strengthening of stabilizers
      normalization of muscle tone, sensory stimulation etc. which may enhance the performance of
      the target goal/movement; Motivating patients to exert more effort; And taking advantage of
      the quality control aspect of the BEI index in-order to augment attention of both therapist
      and patient.
