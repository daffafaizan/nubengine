      modern health care practice. In the present pilot study, using evidence from research on
      technology in clinical practice facilitated development of a hybrid intervention that
      combined lifestyle modification with routine clinical care. Chief among the benefits of this
      hybrid smartphone technology-based intervention (STB) was the potential to improve health
      outcomes and reduce obesity in overweight and obese adolescents. The purposes of this study
      were to (1) measure effects of an innovative smartphone-technology-based (STB) intervention
      for overweight and obese adolescents and to (2) examine the intervention's feasibility for
      use in primary care clinics.The STB intervention had 3 components: use of Fitbit Flex,
      participation in the online educational program, and receipt of bi-weekly text message during
      the maintenance phase. A randomized control study design was utilized. Data regard to
      anthropometrics (BMI and waist-hip ratio), blood pressure, levels of physical and sedentary
      activity, diet, and self-efficacy regarding physical activity and diet were collected at
      baseline, 3 month and 6 months after the baseline assessment.
