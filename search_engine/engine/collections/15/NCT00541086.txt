        -  To compare sequential tamoxifen for 2 years followed by anastrozole, letrozole, or
           exemestane for 3 years vs anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane for 5 years in terms of
           disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with nonrecurrent, nonmetastatic invasive
           endocrine-responsive breast cancer.

        -  To compare disease-free survival in patients treated with anastrozole vs letrozole vs
           exemestane.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hormone receptor
      status (estrogen receptor [ER]-positive and progesterone [PgR] receptor-positive disease vs
      ER-positive and PgR-negative disease vs ER-negative and PgR-positive disease vs ER- or
      PgR-positive disease or ER or PgR status unknown), HER-2/neu status (positive [3+ by IHC or
      positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH)] vs negative vs unknown), prior
      chemotherapy (none vs adjuvant vs neoadjuvant vs both adjuvant and neoadjuvant), and nodal
      status (pN0 vs pN1 vs pN2 vs pN3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral anastrozole once daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate once daily for 2 years followed by oral
           anastrazole once daily for 3 years.

        -  Arm V: Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate once daily for 2 years followed by oral
           exemestane once daily for 3 years.

        -  Arm VI: Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate once daily for 2 years followed by oral
           letrozole once daily for 3 years.

      Treatment in all arms continues in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
