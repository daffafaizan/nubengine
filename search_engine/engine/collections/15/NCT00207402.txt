      CHC, genotype 1 patients who have failed previous treatment with pegylated interferon and
      ribavirin. Pre-treatment with rosiglitazone may become the new standard of care prior to HCV
      therapy for those patients who are insulin resistant, increasing their chance for achieving
      an SVR on interferon alfacon-1 combination therapy and decreasing the morbidity and mortality
      associated with chronic hepatitis C.
