      disability 6-24 months following an ischemic stroke will be enrolled following confirmation
      of eligibility. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to undergo a stereotactic surgery and receive
      a single administration of CTX0E03 Drug Product by intracerebral implantation or undergo sham
      surgery only (placebo). Patients will be followed for 12 months after surgery with follow-up
      assessments occurring at various time points over the 12 months. All eligible patients will
      be assigned a standardized Physical Therapy (PT) program. Patients will complete their daily
      PT exercises at home for 12 weeks after their surgery.
