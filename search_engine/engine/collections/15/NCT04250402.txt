      with radical gastric cancer is higher than that in the normal population. However, its
      pathogenesis has not been clarified, and there is still controversy about the prophylactic
      removal of gallbladder in patients with gastric cancer. The investigator's previous study
      found that there was no statistical difference in the incidence of gallstones after
      laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG), laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) and laparoscopic
      proximal gastrectomy (LPG). A common feature of the three surgical methods is that the vagus
      nerve were more or less cut during the operation. Therefore, we plan to further collect
      gastric cancer patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery in order to
      answer whether the vagus nerve cut during surgery will increase the incidence of gallstones.
