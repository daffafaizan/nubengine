      I. To determine the maximum tolerate dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when used in combination with
      docetaxel therapy in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase1) II. To
      evaluate the response rate in patients receiving CPI-613 in combination with docetaxel
      therapy. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of CPI-613 addition to docetaxel therapy. II. To determine the
      progression-free survival with CPI-613 in combination with docetaxel therapy at 27 weeks.

      III. To determine the median progression-free survival with CPI-613 in combination with
      docetaxel therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of CPI-613 followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 3, and docetaxel IV on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients that achieve stable disease after 6 courses
      then receive CPI-613 alone on days 1and 3. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then
      periodically for 2 years.
