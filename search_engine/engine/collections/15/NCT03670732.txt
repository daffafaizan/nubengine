      types of non-invasive respiratory support. Preterm infants < 34 weeks gestational age, who
      are stable on either of the two modalities of support will be studied in a cross-over study
      design, such that each subject acts as his/her own control. The study will assess the
      relative efficacy of these modalities when used with equal mean airway pressure comparing
      measures of oxygenation, CO2 removal, apnea/bradycardia/desaturation events and work of
      breathing. The initial phase of the study is complete and preliminary analysis supports the
      hypothesis that there is no difference between the modalities when the mean airway pressure
      is equal. However we recognized that use of the RAM cannula, which does not transmit pressure
      effectively is an important study limitation. The findings are valid, but may only be
      applicable to this interface, which is widely used, but increasingly recognized as flawed. We
      are now extending the study to determine if the findings will be the same when short bi-nasal
      prongs are used.
