      to be obtained from all volunteers.

      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for
      variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2/ exact fisher test, will
      be used for differences inter-group Mann-Whitney U Test and coefficient of variation,
      Wilcoxon Test and index of variability for the within-groups differences. It will be
      considered statistical significance p â‰¤0.05.
