    
      This study consists of a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group comparison of 23 mg
      donepezil SR with the currently marketed donepezil formulation (10 mg donepezil IR) in
      patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Patients must have been taking 10 mg IR
      (or a bioequivalent generic) for at least 3 months prior to Screening. The study will consist
      of 24 weeks of daily administration of study medication, with clinic visits at Screening,
      Baseline, 3 weeks (safety only), 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks and 24 weeks or early
      termination. Patients will receive either 10 mg donepezil IR in combination with the placebo
      corresponding to 23 mg donepezil SR, or 23 mg donepezil SR in combination with the placebo
      corresponding to 10 mg donepezil IR.

      A total of approximately 1600 patients will be enrolled to obtain complete data from
      approximately 1200 completed patients (Revised per Amendment 02). During the Baseline visit,
      patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (23 mg donepezil SR to 10 mg donepezil IR). The
      study will be performed at approximately 200 global sites (Asia, Oceania, Europe, India,
      Israel, North America, South Africa, and South America) (Revised per Amendments 01 and 02).
      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to review safety aspects
      of the study and to evaluate the results of a planned interim analysis.

      Patients who complete the study may be eligible to undergo evaluation for enrollment into the
      open-label extension study, E2020-G000-328.
