        -  Determine the survival and local control in previously irradiated patients at high risk
           for local failure following regional resection of recurrent or second primary head and
           neck cancer.

        -  Determine the acute and late toxicities of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the pattern of disease failure in these patients on this treatment.

        -  Determine any change in quality of life in these patients on this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fractionated doses of radiotherapy five times weekly for 6 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to study, 2 months after radiotherapy, every 3 months for
      remainder of year 1, every 4 months for years 2-3, every 6 months for years 4-5, and then
      annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed 2 months after radiotherapy, every 3 months for year 1, every 4 months
      for year 2, every 6 months for years 3-5, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
