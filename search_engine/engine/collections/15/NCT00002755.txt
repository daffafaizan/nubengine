      peripheral blood stem cell support vs conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
      fluorouracil (CMF), both following doxorubicin induction, in women with high risk breast
      cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by the number of
      positive axillary nodes (4-9 vs at least 10) and by center. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive induction therapy consisting of doxorubicin IV
      every 3 weeks for 4 courses followed by consolidation therapy consisting of cyclophosphamide
      IV, methotrexate IV, and fluorouracil IV every 3 weeks for 8 courses. At week 4 of
      consolidation therapy, patients receive radiotherapy to the breast, chest wall, and axilla
      over 3-5 weeks or as appropriate. Following recovery from consolidation therapy, patients
      receive maintenance therapy consisting of oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years. Arm II: Patients
      receive induction therapy as in arm I followed by consolidation therapy consisting of stem
      cell mobilization with high dose cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously beginning 24 hours after cyclophosphamide and continuing until blood counts
      recover. At 13-28 days following peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection and/or
      autologous bone marrow collection, patients undergo chemoablation consisting of thiotepa IV
      and cyclophosphamide IV continuously over 4 days followed 72 hours later by PBSC infusion
      with or without autologous bone marrow. Following hematologic recovery, patients receive
      radiotherapy and maintenance therapy as in arm I. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2
      years, then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: More than 600 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years.
