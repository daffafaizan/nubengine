    
      an intrauterine device can cause pain and discomfort in several ways: Use of the tenaculum to
      grasp the cervix and straighten the uterus for proper insertion; trans-cervical actions
      including measuring uterine depth, inserting the intrauterine device insertion tube, and
      removing the tube; and placement of the device in the uterus.
