      I. To evaluate the response probability (complete, complete unconfirmed, and partial) in
      patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. To estimate 1-year progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with
      relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with SAHA.

      III. To assess the toxicity profile of SAHA in this patient population. IV. To perform gene
      expression profiling on tumor tissue before and after treatment in order to explore in a
      preliminary manner the association between response and specific gene expression results.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete
      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy beyond CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
