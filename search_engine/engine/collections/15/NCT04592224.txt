      single interview either by phone or video call, lasting around an hour.

      Interviews will be semi-structured and follow a topic guide, exploring how participants have
      been given information, how decisions have been made, and any particular challenges they may
      have faced.

      Consent will also be sought for collection of demographic and disease data from the
      participant's medical record
