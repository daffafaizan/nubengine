      The etiology of this problem is diverse (burns, infections, trauma, cancer) however, many
      times the availability of donor areas are insufficient and morbidity and complications that
      may arise make prohibitive the use of this technique in many situations.

      Skin micro grafts technique consists in using a very small part of skin (0.8x 0.8 mm) and
      keratinocyte growth-factor solution that allows a 1:50- 1:100 skin expansion. It has many
      advantages: it can be performed with local anesthesia and donor area is tiny.

      The study consists in using the conventional and the new technique in the same patient. The
      skin defect will be divided in two parts, and with a randomized method each half of this
      defect will be assigned to one of the two different techniques. The result variable will be
      the "percentage of epithelialization" and will be compared in the two halves. This variable
      will be measured at day 14 using clinical and image software methods. The patient and the
      investigator that record the outcome variable will be blinded to the type of technique.

      The investigators will take skin biopsies of two halves and will perform pathology studies.
