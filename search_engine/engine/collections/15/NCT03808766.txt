    
      Embolization is performed within 2 weeks before the scheduled date of partial hepatectomy.
      The purpose of the timing is two folded, it allows observation of the embolization effect to
      be differentiated among the various embolic agents, it also allows time for the patient and
      the liver to recover from the embolization.

      The patient then receives partial hepatectomy within 2 weeks unless the result of liver
      function tests shows contraindication to surgery, in which case the liver function test is
      further evaluated on a weekly basis until the findings are acceptable, and surgery is
      scheduled accordingly.
