      symmetry, and increase walking ability. Generally, there are many walking training theories
      and methods for patients with chronic stroke and treadmill walking training is applied in
      recent years. Previous studies showed that patients with stroke improve the walking abilities
      and speed after the walking treadmill training. However, most studies have demonstrated that
      forward walking treadmill training improved balance and walking ability in patients with
      stroke, but fewer studies have investigated the effects on backward walking treadmill
      training. However, no studies to date have investigated the effects of backward walking
      treadmill training for patients with chronic stroke.
