      non-randomized (patients are not assigned by chance to treatment groups), Mechanistic Study
      (a study that focuses on the biologic activity of the drug, rather than on disease
      treatment). Up to 10 patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) will be enrolled in the study.
      Participants will receive a single dose of siltuximab and blood samples will be obtained a
      total of 6 times until 12 weeks after dosing. Cells will be isolated from the blood samples
      and used to measure specific activities of cells in the immune system. Safety evaluations for
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination will be
      performed throughout the study. The end of study is the date of the last assessment for the
      last patient.
