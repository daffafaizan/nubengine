    
      This is a Phase 1 study to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of CART123 cells
      following lymphodepleting chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Subjects
      will be treated with a split dosing approach of CART123 cells (10% Day 0; 30% Day 1; 60% Day
      2) for Cohort 1a/1b or a single IV administration of CART123 cells for Cohort 2.

      The total dose administered to each subject will be based on body weight obtained at the time
      of apheresis. Thus, the target total transduced dose, preceded by lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy, is 1-2x10^6 CART123 cells/kg for Cohort 1a, 5x10^6 CART123 cells/kg for Cohort
      1b, or 2x10^6 CART-123 cells/kg for Cohort 2. The protocol-specified minimum acceptable dose
      for infusion is 1x10^5 CART123 cells/kg for all cohorts.

      It is recommended per routine clinical care, that all subjects with marrow aplasia at Day
      28+/-5 undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) as a rescue strategy.
      If required, this procedure will be performed as part of routine care, outside of the scope
      of this research study, however subjects will continue to be followed on study. All subjects
      should therefore have a previously identified stem cell donor in order to participate in this
      study. Please see Section 6.8 for additional details.

      All subjects will be followed monthly for up to 6 months post the first CART123 cell infusion
      (Day 0). Thereafter subjects will be transitioned into LTFU for up to 15 years post infusion.
