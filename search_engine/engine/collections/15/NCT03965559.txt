      antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) by acute AbMR treatment according to the guidelines for
      care for kidney transplant patients in Thailand, 2014. The introduction of a single filter
      plasma (plasmapheresis) or 2 filters (DFPP) in combination with IVIG (intravenous
      immunoglobulin), which may or may not be given methylprednisolone. If the patients did not
      response to the treatment, Rituximab or Bortezomib was considered.

      Only one previous study showed that among 29 graft rejected patients treated with
      plasmapheresis, 37.9% had subsequently graft loss and the rest of them had significantly
      decreasing creatinine level at 1 month follow-up. Another group of 10 graft rejected patients
      treated with DFPP, 40% had subsequently graft loss. Six patients had decreasing creatinine
      level at 1 month follow-up.

      Both groups do not have complications or side effects from plasmapheresis or DFPP.

      The researcher therefore conducted a comparative study.

      Is plasmapheresis or DFPP effective or different side effects in treating post-kidney
      transplant patients who suspected of graft rejection?
