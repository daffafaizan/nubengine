    
      Molecular genetic screening in patients with:

        -  supraventricular

        -  ventricular arrhythmia

        -  syncopes of unknown origin and/or suspicion of an arrhythmogenic origin

        -  family members of patients with sudden cardiac death and aborted sudden cardiac death

      Examination of patients includes routine testing like electrocardiogram (ECG), sequential
      ECGs, exercise testing, invasive electrophysiological stimulation, cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging, intravenous drug challenge for identification/exclusion of eg Brugada syndrome.
      Examples are patients with Long QT Syndrome, Short QT Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, familial
      atrial fibrillation, WPW-syndrome, arrhythmias due to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or
      arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Blood samples are taken for further molecular
      genetic screening.
