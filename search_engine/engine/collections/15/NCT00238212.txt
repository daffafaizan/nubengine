      I. To assess the objective response probability (complete responses and partial responses)
      for BAY 43-9006 in patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder or
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      II. To assess overall survival, time to treatment failure and progression-free survival in
      these patients.

      III. To assess quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen. IV. To evaluate in a
      preliminary fashion relevant prognostic and predictive molecular markers of clinical outcome
      in gallbladder and cholangiocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.
