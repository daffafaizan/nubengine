      causing dissatisfaction and discomfort to the patients. Their incidence varies from 30%-70%.

      Both non pharmacological and pharmacological measures have been tried to minimize the
      incidence and severity of POST with variable success rate. Prophylactic use lidocaine and
      steroids have been used independently for this purpose. Dexamethasone as an adjuvant to
      lidocaine has shown to improve the quality of analgesia. However, there is no study assessing
      the combine effects of lidocaine and dexamethasone for POST.
