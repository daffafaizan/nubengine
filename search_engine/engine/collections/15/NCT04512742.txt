    
      This is a clinical study in up to twelve healthy Leishmania-na√Øve subjects aged between 18
      and 50 years old who develop a confirmed sand fly bite. Initially six subjects will be
      studied and exposed to biting by Phlebotomus duboscqi infected by Leishmania major. An
      adaptive design will be used, that has been pragmatically designed to minimise unnecessary
      exposure of volunteers to Leishmania and maximise the likelihood of developing a reproducible
      Controlled Human Infection Model.

      The primary objective is the development of a controlled human infection model of Leishmania
      major using sand fly transmission which is (a) effective and (b) safe.

      The first six subjects will be exposed to biting by Phlebotomus duboscqi (sand fly species)
      infected by Leishmania major (species of leishmaniasis causing cutaneous, ie skin disease)
      and assess the 'take rate', that is the number of subjects developing parasitologically
      confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (PCCL) lesions. If 6/6 subjects develop PCCL lesions no
      further recruitment will take place; if only < 6 subjects develop PCCL lesions, then an
      adaptive design will be followed.

      This study is based on an initial study, entitled FLYBITE (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
      NCT03999970).

      the FLYBITE study was a clinical study to develop a sand fly biting protocol using
      pathogen-free blood-fed sand flies. Twelve healthy participants were enrolled into the study
      and all 12 participants experienced at least one successful sand fly bite.
