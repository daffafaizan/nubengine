      hysterectomy and gave their informed consent were included. Exclusion criteria included
      additional abdominal, chronic pelvic pain, malignancy, and allergy to Bupivacaine.

      Solutions of either Bupivacaine-Hydrochloride 0.5%, or Sodium-Chloride 0.9% as a placebo,
      were prepared prior to surgery, according to randomization. The chosen solution was injected
      before incision, as a modified paracervical block, and in each resection line (sacro-uterine
      and cardinal ligaments). The amount of fluid administered was 10 ml. When colporrhaphy was
      also performed, an additional 5 ml of solution were injected in the midline of the vaginal
      wall prior to each incision line.

      By utilizing the 10 cm Visual-analogue-scale (VAS) we examined the differences in
      post-operative pain at rest at 3, 8, and 24 hours, and during ambulation at 8 and 24 hours
      using multivariate linear regression models. We also assessed the differences in analgesics
      given at the different time points between the groups using multivariate negative binomial
      regression models.
