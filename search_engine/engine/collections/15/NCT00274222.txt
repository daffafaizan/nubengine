      bronchodilator treatment (BDT), Group II received SC (40 mg prednisolon) plus BDT, and Group
      III received nebulized budesonide (NB)(1500 mcg qid) plus BDT. Improvement rates in multiple
      parameters during 10-day hospitalization, and acute exacerbation and re-hospitalization rates
      within one-month after discharge were compared between the groups.
