      product containing an over-the-counter (OTC) drug monographed ingredient for treatment of
      eczema. The other group was supplied with a cosmetic test product which is a standard dry
      skin daily moisturizer. Both groups were also provided with a cosmetic test cleanser to use
      in place of their normal cleanser. Subjects used the products for 14 days, followed by a
      7-day regression period (no product use).

      Subjects were assessed at Baseline and at Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14 of product use.
      They were assessed again 7 days after stopping product use. Only the group provided with the
      test product containing the monograph ingredient for treatment of eczema were assessed for
      eczema endpoints after the Baseline visit.
