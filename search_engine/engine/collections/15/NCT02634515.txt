      order to treat hyperglycemia. Julphar Insulin R and Huminsulin® Normal are both soluble
      insulins intended for subcutaneous administration and consist of a neutral solution
      containing recombinant human insulin as the active ingredient. The new insulin, Julphar
      Insulin R is biosimilar to Huminsulin® Normal. Demonstration of bioequivalence from a PK and
      PD perspective of the two insulins are necessary to achieve market approval for Julphar
      Insulin R.
