    
      AmnioFix is a dehydrated Human Amnion/ Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft and is composed of
      multiple layers including a single layer of epithelial cells, a basement membrane and an
      avascular connective tissue matrix. Amniotic membrane is a unique material and its
      composition contains collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VII. Amniotic membrane is composed of
      structural extracellular matrix (ECM), that also contains specialized proteins fibronectin,
      laminins, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, amniotic membrane contains
      essential, active, healing growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-b), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet derived growth
      factor (PDGF).

      The study is designed to compare AmnioFix to the current standard of laser care.

        -  Patients coming in for fraction or total ablative resurfacing with any methods will be
           studied

        -  patients will be assessed prior to any treatment by clinician

        -  additionally patients will participate in a clinician constructed survey

        -  patients will be assessed on a rating scale of 1-4 based on erythema, edema/induration,
           oozing/drainage, and epithelialization

        -  preoperative photos will be taken of patients

        -  laser resurfacing will proceed under clinician guidance, and under clinician selected
           settings

        -  repeat photographs

        -  patients will be randomized as to which side of the face receives AmnioFix treatment,
           and which side receives standard of care

        -  epifix will be applied appropriatly

        -  repeat photographs and repeat assessment on 1-4 scale

        -  patients will follow up at day 1, 4, 7, 14, and 28 +/-3 days to repeat scoring and
           photography
