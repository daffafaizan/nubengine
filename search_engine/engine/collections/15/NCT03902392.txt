      exposure is able to provoke local and systemic allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Ni-mediated
      ACD is characterized by loss of epidermal integrity, urticaria/angioedema, flares, and
      itching, whose extent depends on many variables such as genetic, time of sensitization and
      environmental exposure.The aim of the present research is to verify whether the oral
      administration of polyphenols (NATUR-OXÂ®) to patients with Ni-mediated ACD is able to modify
      immune parameters.
