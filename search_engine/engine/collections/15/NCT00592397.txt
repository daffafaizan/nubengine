      improper diet. Recent research has shown that especially total amount and composition of the
      macro nutrients, protein, carbohydrate and fats, is important.

      A time course experiment has been performed where 5 subjects underwent a diet intervention
      for four weeks with a controlled, balanced macro nutrient energy content of every meal. The
      sampling time points were 0, 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 days. The goals were to determine optimal
      length of intervention with stabilization of gene expression to occur and compare blood and
      subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue as source of biological material for RNA for DNA microarray
      analysis. Microarray analysis were performed on 3 of the 5 subjects.
