      (ETCO2) via nasal cannula (ETCO2-NC) and routinely measured physiologic and participant
      reported parameters in extubated participants who have received a continuous flow left
      ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD), and to determine if the addition of ETCO2-NC monitoring
      to usual care is associated with decreased incidence and severity of respiratory issues.

      A convenience sample of 60 participants either scheduled for mechanical circulatory support
      device (MCSD) implant or who have been readmitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with a
      CF-LVAD will be recruited and randomized to usual care or usual care plus ETCO2-NC throughout
      their stay in the ICU.

      Investigators seek to examine the relationship between ETCO2-NC with traditional physiologic
      measures, clinical assessments, and participant reported symptoms in persons with a CF-LVAD.
      Additionally, this study intends to compare the respiratory outcomes of extubated persons
      with a CF-LVAD randomized to usual care to those receiving usual care plus ETCO2- NC.
