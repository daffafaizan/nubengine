    
      Specific Aim 1: Implement ePRISM and the RESOLVE Decision Aid (DA) at 2 sites (Saint Luke's
      Hospital in Kansas City and Saint Luke's North) for Emergency Department (ED) access and
      decision support.

      1. Procedures and Evaluation

        1. Map process flow and define the optimal points of care for both the informed consent and
           decision aid.

        2. Pre-implementation registry or data retrieval of patient/family satisfaction with
           information during consent process pre-PRISM, as well as time from presentation to
           treatment.

        3. Implementation of ePRISM software and the RESOLVE DA.

        4. Monitor proportion of patients in whom the RESOLVE DA is used.

        5. Post-implementation registry or data retrieval of patient/family satisfaction and
           knowledge, as well as time from presentation to treatment.

        6. Interviews of providers on confidence in making treatment decisions.

        7. Monitor patient outcomes through 90 day follow up phone call as per the standard of
           care.

      Specific Aim 2: Implement ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA onsite at the the Barnes Jewish Hospital
      Emergency Department. After optimizing the integration of ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA at Saint
      Luke's Hospital and Saint Luke's North, we will evaluate strategies for implementation at
      Barnes Jewish Hospital's Emergency Department Telestroke Program.
