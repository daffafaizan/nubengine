      community. Among African Americans adults almost 1/3 have hypertension, 1/10 have heart
      disease, 1/20 have coronary heart disease, and 1/30 have had a stroke. Compared to their
      Caucasian American counterparts, African Americans are 3 times more times as likely to die
      from cardiovascular diseases than Caucasians, 1.5 times more likely to die from heart
      failure, and 1.8 times more likely to die from stroke. In addition, both lower socioeconomic
      position and minority race/ethnicity are associated with poorer health and shortened
      survival. These alarming statistics highlight the health disparities in the African American
      community. In our study, the investigators propose that interactive physician-led education
      through partnership with an African American church will improve awareness and knowledge of
      CVD in the African American community and will result in objective improvement in major risk
      factors associated with cardiovascular disease.
