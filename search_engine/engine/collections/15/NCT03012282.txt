      I. To develop, test, and refine a CT perfusion protocol for its feasibility, reproducibility,
      and quality with a limited number of patients with a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).

      II. To analyze preliminary date regarding perfusion parameters that improve accuracy in
      predicting response and resectability for a subset of patients with locally advanced (LA) and
      borderline resectable (BR) PDA treated with neoadjuvant therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo CT perfusion sequence during the first 40 seconds of the baseline standard
      of care CT scan and during follow-up CT scans at 2 and possibly 4 months after chemotherapy,
      at 4-6 weeks after radiation therapy, or prior to definitive surgery.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
