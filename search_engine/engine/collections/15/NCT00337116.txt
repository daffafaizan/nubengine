      heightened sympathetic activity that is particularly prominent during periods of acute STEMI,
      NSTEMI and unstable angina and consequentially causes elevation of tissue oxygen demand.
      Control of cardiac pain is typically accomplished with a combination of oxygen, analgesic
      (e.g. morphine) beta blockers agents and primarily nitrates.

      Sublingual nitrates are currently the guidelines recommended preparation for instant relief
      of brief episodes of pain. In patients with prolonged periods of waxing and waning chest
      pain, drip of intravenous nitrates may be of benefit in controlling of symptoms and
      correcting ischemia.

      Intravenous nitrates are also indicated for the treatment of acute decompensated CHF patients
      with pulmonary edema, nevertheless the current treatment for these patients edema is repeated
      intravenous boluses of and not sublingual isosorbide dinitrate, followed by continuous drip.
      Although there is no hard data on intravenous high-dose nitrates for the relief of acute
      anginal pain episodes, our clinical impression with this method is excellent.

      Intravenous boluses of isosorbide dinitrate in a hospital setting provides immediate,
      accurate (bioavailability ) and is an easily controlled modality for providing nitrates.

      Since intravenous boluses of isosorbide dinitrate is the standard care for acute anginal pain
      episodes in our ICCU at this time, a well designed comparative study for the two methods
      would help it to become a guideline and not a matter of choice in these cases.
