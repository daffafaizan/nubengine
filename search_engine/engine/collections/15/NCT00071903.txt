      the Treatment of Cystinosis", we found that 6 of our NIH patients developed papilledema and
      were diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), whose occurrence has not been previously
      reported in cystinosis. The goal of this protocol is to identify the role of thrombosis
      susceptibility in the development of PTC in nephropathic cystinosis patients in view of our
      recent findings regarding genetic susceptibility to thrombosis in PTC in general. We propose
      a case-control study. A total of 9 nephropathic cystinosis patients who developed PTC and 9
      control nephropathic cystinosis patients without PTC will be screened based upon a thrombosis
      susceptibility screening panel, including total homocysteine, protein C and S, antithrombin
      III, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor XI levels, testing for PT, PTT, activated
      protein C resistance, antiphospholipid antibodies (ACA panel and Lupus AC) and screening for
      FV Leiden mutation, FV G1628A polymorphism, FV R2 allele, Prothrombin 20210 mutation and
      5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T polymorphism in patients with
      severe homocysteinemia (greater than or equal to 100 micro mol/l).

      We will compare the prevalence of the factors that lead to thrombosis susceptibility in the
      cases and controls.
