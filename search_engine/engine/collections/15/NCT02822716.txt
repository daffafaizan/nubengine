      it induces apoptosis of tumor cells by creating irreversible damage in the cell membrane
      using electric current. The use of thermal ablation for tumors adjacent to major blood
      vessels is not advisable because the "heat-sink effect" owing to blood vessels render the
      thermal treatment not effective. On the other hand, application of thermal ablation to a
      tumor adjacent to blood vessels or bile ducts will cause thermal damage to these structures.
      It has been shown in animal experiments that IRE is effective in causing cell death while
      blood vessels, bile ducts, and nerves in the vicinity are preserved. Early evidence of
      clinical studies has shown that IRE is a reasonably safe and effective treatment for
      pancreatic and hepatic tumors.
