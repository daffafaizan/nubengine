      outdoor activities. To accomplish this goal our approach will be multifaceted and will
      include:

        1. individual sessions with school principals to facilitate a school policy that encourages
           hat use when children are outdoors.

        2. sessions with fourth grade teachers that explains the importance of sun protection and
           hat use, and that addresses potential concerns by teachers.

        3. classroom sessions with fourth grade children that improves sun protection knowledge,
           fosters more positive attitudes about hat use. and that changes the subjective norm of
           wearing hats when at school.

        4. follow-up sessions in which children are provided free hats with a customized design
           that represents their school.

        5. sun protection educational materials that are mailed to the parents of targeted
           children.
