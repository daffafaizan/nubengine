      management may improve outcome after intrabdominal surgery. In these studies, however, the
      number of patients was often small, and management in control groups as well as postoperative
      complications were usually not precisely defined. In addition, widespread use of oesophageal
      doppler cannot be advocated in routine surgery, and the strategy necessitates repeated volume
      loading. This may lead to unnecessary intravenous fluids which may be deleterious, and
      intraoperative fluid restriction has also been shown to improve clinical outcome. In this
      context, indices reflecting the hemodynamic changes during mechanical ventilation (the
      so-called "dynamic indices", and more specifically the respiratory-induced pulse pressure
      variation) have been shown to accurately predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically
      ventilated patients. Automated and continuous calculation of pulse pressure variation
      variation from standard peripheral (typically radial) arterial line has recently been
      validated. This study was thus designed to determine whether intraoperative goal-directed
      fluid management (with goal = cardiac stroke volume maximization) based on pulse pressure
      variation monitoring would improve outcome after intrabdominal surgery.
