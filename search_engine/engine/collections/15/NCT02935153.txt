    
      CD22 is a type I transmembrane protein expressed on most mature B lymphocyte in the B cell
      malignancies，and plays a significant role in signal transduction pathways．Despite of the fact
      that CD19-targeted CAR-T can re-induce remissions for many patients with relapsed and
      refractory B cell malignancies, a part of those patients will relapse with CD19-negative
      malignancies. To explore a rescue for those with CD19-negative B cell malignancies, we design
      and conduct this trial to test the safety and effectiveness of CD22-targeted CAR-T.
