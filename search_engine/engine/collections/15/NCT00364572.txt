      Clinical Investigation, patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 2
      transforaminal epidural etanercept or saline injections at 2-week intervals. Both patients
      and physicians will be blinded as to the injectate and treatment group. There will be 3 study
      groups. Group I will receive either 2 mg of etanercept or saline per injection. Group II will
      receive either 4 mg of etanercept or saline per injection. Group III will receive either 6 mg
      of etanercept or saline per injection. In each group there will be 8 patients: 6 who receive
      etanercept and 2 who receive saline. As per a previous study we just completed, etanercept
      doses will not be escalated until all 6 patients have completed their 1-month follow-up
      visits without any evidence of toxicity or complications.
