    
      A retrospective, multi-centre, observational study to describe the treatment patterns, the
      demographic, clinical outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and healthcare resource utilization
      (HCRU) for patients diagnosed with primary Small Cell Lung Cancer SCLC (Extensive stage &
      Limited Stage)and stage III NSCLC in a real-world setting

      Cohort of patients diagnosed with primary SCLC (limited or extensive stage) or stage III
      NSCLC, aims to characterize the treatment patterns from the index date (defined as the date
      of initial diagnosis of locally advanced stage III NSCLC and SCLC) to the end of follow-up
      (defined as the earliest of death, last available medical record or end of the observation
      period "defined as the date of data abstraction") including the type of treatment received,
      duration of each treatment regimen, and reasons for stopping treatment regimen.

      The study population will be identified by participating physicians involved in the
      diagnosis, treatment and management of these patients through the review of established
      patient medical records. Eligible patients (both alive and deceased) will have their data
      anonymously abstracted from their medical records into a centrally designed electronic case
      report form (eCRF).
