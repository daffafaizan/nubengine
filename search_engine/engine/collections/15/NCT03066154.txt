      study of ModraDoc006/r combined with ADT and radiotherapy in patients with high risk prostate
      cancer, as defined by node positive prostate cancer with all of the following primary tumor
      characteristics: stage ≥cT2c, Gleason score ≥ 4+3, any PSA level.

      Phase IB part After determination of the MTD of ModraDoc006/r in the combined treatment with
      radiotherapy and hormonal therapy and good tolerability of the treatment without unexpected
      adverse events during the radiotherapy until 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, the study
      will be further conducted to the phase IB part. This part will explore the feasibility and
      tolerability of long term treatment with ModraDoc006/r.
