    
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial using a 2-phase data collection. The first phase
      is the initial assessment for ADHD and includes all patients eligible to be assessed for ADHD
      as determined by their clinician in the course of usual care. The baseline measurements will
      be used to compare groups at baseline, and also for longitudinal analyses of medication
      management. Patients are randomized at this point. Patients in both treatment arms who then
      receive an ADHD diagnosis and who start medication for ADHD will be eligible for the second
      phase of the study: three follow-up assessments over six months. Patients who do not have an
      ADHD diagnosis will not continue in the study, and will be treated by their clinician as
      usual.
