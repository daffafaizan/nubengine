      fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels. Since age affect insulin sensitivity and the
      metabolism, we aimed in this randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of vitamin
      D supplementation on glucose homeostasis and index of insulin resistance in elderly subjects
      living in Beirut, Lebanon.

      Participants (n= 115) deficient in vitamin D were randomly divided into two groups, a group
      receiving 30,000 IU cholecalciferol/week for a period of 6 months, and a placebo group. The
      index of insulin resistance HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) was the primary outcome.
      Glucose homeostasis and metabolic markers were also measured at start of treatment and at 6
      months.
