    
      During the 6-month observational period, subjects will report respiratory symptoms using COPD
      Co-Pilot on a daily basis and will receive feedback and clinical recommendations from their
      health care provider when their symptoms change from their baseline symptoms. Final clinical
      recommendations, medical advice, diagnoses, and treatment are in the full and sole discretion
      of the provider.

      All subjects will receive current standard of care under the supervision of their health care
      provider. No experimental drugs, dosages, or treatment protocols will be administered at any
      stage during this trial.

      Subjects will receive monthly calls to determine whether any changes to the subject's medical
      history, hospitalization history, medications, etc. have occurred so they may be added to the
      subject's profile.

      At approximately 6 months post enrollment, all subjects will have an in person end of study
      visit.
