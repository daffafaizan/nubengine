      months and older be immunized to prevent influenza. Currently the only approved influenza
      vaccine across the entire age group is inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). A Biologics
      Licensing Application (BLA) for Flublok was approved by the FDA for influenza immunization of
      adults 18-49 years of age. Additional safety and, ultimately efficacy, data is needed to
      support use in adults ≥50 years of age, an important age group as adults ≥65 years of age are
      among those at increased risk of influenza complications.
