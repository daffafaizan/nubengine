      centres. At the Royal Free Hospital, London, the inclusion criterion is simply attendance at
      the vascular clinic; in Leicester patients >70 years or 50-69 years with a history of
      diabetes, smoking, known PAD or at least 2 risk factors (previous ischaemic event,
      hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease) will be recruited
      from both primary care and the hospital diabetes clinic. The anticipated peripheral arterial
      disease detection rates are approximately 75% in London and 25% in Leicester.

      In addition to standard questionnaires, participants will undergo bilateral Padd and resting
      ABPI. CDU will be performed by an accredited vascular technologist who will employ a scoring
      method consistent between both sites. The vascular technologist will be blind to the Padd and
      ABPI results. The results obtained with Padd and ABPI will be compared with CDU as the gold
      standard for this study.

      The primary objectives are:

        1. Performance: to compare Padd and ABPI for detecting PAD against a gold standard, CDU,
           performed by an experienced vascular technologist.

        2. Safety: to compare adverse events using Padd, ABPI and expert CDU

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. to compare time taken to perform Padd and ABPI

        2. to calculate specificities for Padd and ABPI

        3. to investigate the impact of subject posture on the Padd results

        4. to determine if skin colour has any impact on Padd performance

      There are no treatments or interventions determined exclusively from the Padd readings.
