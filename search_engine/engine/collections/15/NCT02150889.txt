      skeletal muscle the largest site of insulin resistance in the human body. In sedentary
      humans, insulin resistance correlates with levels of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and lipid
      metabolites that adversely affect skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. However, even modest
      endurance training has been shown to reduce insulin resistance while increasing skeletal
      muscle IMCL. Moreover, lean endurance trained participants have IMCL levels comparable to
      those of patients with T2DM, yet have significantly lower insulin resistance. These findings
      suggest that the physiological changes caused by training protect against lipid induced
      insulin resistance and that this protection is present even at rest, however our preliminary
      data suggest that training facilitates utilization of readily available fuel, with lipid
      preferentially used over glucose when available. We will test the overarching hypothesis that
      training increases resting skeletal muscle lipid metabolism, as measured by markers of IMCL
      lipolysis, accumulation of fatty acid metabolites and mitochondrial utilization of fatty
      acids.
