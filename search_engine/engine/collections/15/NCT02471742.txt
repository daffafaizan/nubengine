      mastectomy, of which 361 invasive BC patients underwent NAC-sparing mastectomy as first
      treatment (NAC-group), whereas 61 T2-T3 invasive BC patients underwent surgery after primary
      chemotherapy (NAC-PC group). 151 BC patients underwent primary chemotherapy and conventional
      mastectomy (PC group) from 2004 to 2009, has been evaluated as comparative group respect to
      NAC-PC group.

      Using propensity score matching, local disease-free survival (LDFS) in NAC-PC patients was
      first compared with that in PC patients.

      The NAC-PC cohort was then compared to NAC patients in terms of LDFS using two different
      matching criteria, one with tumor size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and one with tumor size
      before neoadjuvant chemotherapy as balancing covariates.
