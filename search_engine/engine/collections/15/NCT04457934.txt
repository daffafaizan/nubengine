      investigated in randomized controlled trials in patients undergoing gut cleansing prior to
      colonoscopy. Data on the specific screening population and for patients suffering from IBD
      however is limited to date. The aim of the current study is to fill this gap and to provide
      data of the effectiveness of PLENVU for the specific patients groups in order to provide
      specific recommendations for an adequate bowel preparation in those groups.

      In general, bowel-preparation in IBD patients is often more challenging. This might be due to
      the chronic disease burden but also according to compliance factors of individual patients.
      Of note, an adequate bowel-preparation is of paramount importance in IBD in order to detect
      subtle neoplasia and to perform chromoendoscopy, which is still recommended by the updated
      ESGE guideline.

      It is anticipated, that PLENVU will help IBD patients to achieve a better bowel preparation,
      thereby yielding in more effective screening colonoscopies and higher acceptance rates of
      patients for surveillance colonoscopies. In order to show that no significant differences are
      seen in the included IBD cohort compared to the general screening population (bias risk), the
      investigators aim to also include patients from the normal screening population.
