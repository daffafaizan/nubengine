      treatment and often results in more frequent hospital visits for patients. To reduce the risk
      of patients to COVID-19, there has been a shift towards reducing on-site visits with
      increased use of technology e.g. virtual visits. Patients may have also been using devices at
      home to aid in their care, including digital devices, mobile applications, smart watches and,
      rarely, trial-specific devices, to monitor aspects of their own health.

      Our project will explore the impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on clinical trial
      patients and how they feel technology could help or create barriers in their future care.

      In order to quantify how clinical trial visits have changed and to evaluate patient's
      attitudes to the increasing use of technology in clinical trials, we will be disseminating
      questionnaires to 100 patients currently on clinical trials over a 2 month period. We will
      follow these up with three virtual focus group discussions with 8 participants in each to
      delve further into patients' experiences.
