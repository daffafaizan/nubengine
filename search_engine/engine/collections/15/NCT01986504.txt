      hospital stay (before or after transplant) in order to introduce the study and obtain
      informed consent for participation. A letter to transplant physicians will introduce this
      study. Data collection will begin immediately upon consent and continue for up to five years.
      The informed consent form specifically requests permission to contact the subject in the
      future to verify information or if the subject is lost to follow up by Transplant services.

      The Day of transplant will be considered day 0 for enrollment in this observational study.
      Data will be collected on clinical template forms completed by study team members, as
      infectious complications become apparent in either outpatient ID clinics or on the inpatient
      service. A member of the research team will complete data collection in the registry,
      maintained on the REDCap platform. In addition, patient electronic records will be reviewed
      every 3 months to identify and record infectious complications, treatments administered, and
      outcomes. During these intervals, subjects will be contacted by phone to review the same
      outcomes.

      Creation of the registry relies on use of standardized definitions to define infections. An
      electronic database has been constructed in the REDCap system, documenting subject
      demographics, transplant variables, infection variables, treatments administered, and overall
      outcomes, during each interim time period.
