      homeostasis. Hemojuvelin is mainly produced by muscle, and the relationship between exercise
      and iron metabolism can be questioned about.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of muscular exercise on iron metabolism in
      healthy volunteers. Fourteen healthy male subjects will be investigated at two periods
      according to a cross-over design after:

        1. 45 minutes of exercise on the ergocycle; and

        2. no physical exercise.

      Urine and blood samples will be collected at both periods regularly to measure hemojuvelin,
      hepcidin, iron and transferrin levels.
