    
      Participants who discontinue pembrolizumab after achieving a complete response (CR) and
      subsequently develop progressive disease (PD) may be eligible to enter a Second Course Phase
      and receive pembrolizumab again.

      The end of the study for each participant will occur with: 1) the marketing approval of
      pembrolizumab for melanoma, 2) the completion of safety follow up or 3) the time when a
      possibility of entry to second course of treatment is lost, whichever occurs last.
