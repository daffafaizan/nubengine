    
      The clinical trial, titled "Safety and performance evaluation of an electro-stimulator
      mounted on an intra-oral removable appliance (GenNarino) for the treatment of xerostomia" is
      a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled multi-center trial, followed by an
      open-label study. Study subjects are patients with xerostomia. The purpose of the trial is to
      test the safety and efficacy of electrostimulation using the GenNarino device.

      The primary endpoint is significant symptomatic improvement, and the secondary ones,
      increased salivary output and event free use (no adverse side-effects). The clinical
      follow-up consists of periodic clinical examinations.

      In this clinical trial the use of the device is compared between active vs. sham mode for one
      month each in a double-blind design (Stage I). Thereafter, at Stage II the xerostomia
      relieving effect of the active device is assessed in an open label design for additional 6
      months. Clinic- and home-based questionnaires and whole saliva collections are performed.
