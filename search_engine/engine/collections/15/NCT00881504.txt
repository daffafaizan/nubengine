      unresectable biliary tract cancer. This trial will follow a Simon's two-stage optimal design.
      For the first stage, 9 patients will be accrued. If none of the 9 patients have controlled
      disease with mFOLFOX6 in combination with bevacizumab, the combination will be rejected and
      the trial stopped. However, if at least 1 patient of the 9 (11%) respond to treatment in the
      first stage, then an additional 15 patients will be entered into the second stage, for a
      total of 24 patients in the phase II study. If 3 (13%) or more patients respond to therapy,
      then the combination will be considered for further investigation.
