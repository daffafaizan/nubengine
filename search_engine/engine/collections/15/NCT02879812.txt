      multi-component intervention consisting of in the era of the new national kidney allocation
      policy and educational materials targeting dialysis facility Medical Directors, staff, and
      patients. The investigators will randomize ~750 dialysis facilities in up to 18 End Stage
      Renal Disease Network regions across the United States, where approximately half of
      facilities will receive the intervention materials and half will receive an informational
      brochure. This pragmatic, clinical effectiveness-implementation study will test the
      effectiveness of the multicomponent, multilevel interventions consisting of a tailored,
      facility-specific transplant and disparity performance report, educational videos for staff
      and dialysis patients, and an educational webinar for dialysis facility Medical Directors and
      staff.
