      randomized to either placebo or montelukast (10 mg). In one week, subjects return, undergo a
      blood draw, medical history questionnaires, nasal lavage, and nasal allergen challenge
      (followed by lavage in 6 hours). Subjects will then cross-over to the other study drug. One
      week later subjects will undergo a blood draw, medical history questionnaires, lavage,
      allergen challenge, and repeat lavage (after 6 hours).
