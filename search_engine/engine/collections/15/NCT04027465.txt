      protocol for egg allergy. This study would enable the investigators to better determine the
      potential benefit of desensitization in individuals with egg allergy.

      More specifically, the investigators will address the following research objectives:

      Objectives A. To develop a protocols for egg desensitization

      B. To determine the rate of desensitization to egg.

      C. To characterize predictors of successful desensitization.

      D. To characterize molecular mechanisms involved in the process of desensitization

      These objectives will be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial
