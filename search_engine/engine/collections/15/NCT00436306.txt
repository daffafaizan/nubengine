      (HIV), and unintended pregnancy can be achieved with the use of dual methods of
      contraception. This proposal was designed to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of
      an innovative, computer-assisted stage-based individualized interactive intervention
      (Individualized Intervention) based on the transtheoretical compared to enhanced standard
      care counseling on the use of dual methods of contraception. Primary outcomes, including
      behavioral and biological outcomes, were assessed in this randomized clinical trial of 550
      high-risk women. Participants were followed at 6 month intervals for 24 months with follow-up
      interviews to determine reported use of dual methods of contraception (behavioral outcome).
      Clinical examinations at 12 and 24 months and with new onset of symptoms assessed biological
      outcomes including incident or recurrent cases of STI and unintended pregnancy. Secondary
      outcomes included intermediate outcome variables such as changes in stage of change,
      processes of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy. The primary hypotheses of this
      study were: 1. the Individualized Intervention will result in increased dual contraceptive
      use; 2. the Individualized Intervention will result in protection against new cases of STIs,
      re-infection with sexually transmitted organisms, and unplanned pregnancies; and 3. the
      Individualized Intervention will lead to the greatest changes in secondary outcome measures.
      If found to be effective, the stage-matched intervention has potential for widespread
      dissemination in schools, clinics, offices, and community centers to prevent STIs/HIV and
      unintended pregnancy.
