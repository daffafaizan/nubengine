      therefore immunoglobulin gene rearrangements (the sequence of nucleotides at the V(D)J
      recombination site) serves as a specific marker for each clone. Methods of analysis have
      changed over time to improve the sensitivity and to allow its application in clinical
      settings.

      Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) displays molecular heterogeneity. In this context,
      IgNGS allows for detection of tumor clonotype from plasma (ctDNA) (Liquid Biopsy-LB) of DLBCL
      patients with high sensitivity and specificity. ctDNA can be tracked with this methodology in
      the vast majority (>90%) of patients, in contrast to NGS-methods based on genotyping for
      specific DLBCL mutations, which have overall low frequency. Furthermore, most newly
      discovered neoantigens in lymphoma derive from immunoglobulin variable sequences, supporting
      the relevance of the analysis of this particular region in contrast to the use of specific
      B-cell mutations. Importantly, preliminary studies on clonotype detection by IgNGS at the end
      of treatment correlate with outcome (poorer progression-free survival) and the persistence or
      reemergence of the tumor clonotype by ctDNA studies may anticipate the clinical relapse. We
      propose to evaluate IgNGS at different time points in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients treated
      with RCHOP to address its correlation with conventional techniques (i.e., PET/CT imaging) and
      outcome.
