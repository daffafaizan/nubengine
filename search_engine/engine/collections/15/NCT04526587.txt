      I. Delineate clinical features of disease progression and responses to subsequent therapy
      following progression on ciclib-based therapy.

      II. Define pharmacogenomics relationships that could provide a more precise approach to drug
      dosing.

      III. Interrogate biomarkers related to response and acquired resistance in standard clinical
      practice.

      IV. Develop patient-derived models from resistant disease to functionally assess the
      mechanisms occurring with resistance.

      V. Elucidate the socio-demographic features related to the use of ciclibs clinically in the
      Roswell Park catchment area.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients electronic medical records are reviewed to capture clinical information, and
      patients undergo collection of blood, tissue, ascites or pleural effusions, and fresh body
      fluids or fresh biopsy samples for diagnosis/treatment decision, biomarker assessments, and
      description of mechanisms of resistance/response related to ciclib-therapy.
