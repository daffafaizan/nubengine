      days, the participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous dose of
      VIB4920 and/or placebo in 5 cohorts. Participants are to be followed on their stable
      background anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy at least through 12 weeks (Day 85), at
      which time rescue therapy may be instituted. All participants will be followed at least
      through the primary (interim) analysis (Day 113), and those who have not instituted rescue
      therapy will be followed through Day 309 to determine the duration of clinical response. The
      primary analysis will be after all participants have completed Day 113, and the final
      analysis will be after all participants have completed follow-up.
