      never be able to be healed normally, and may lead to permanent vision loss. Standard medical
      treatments often fail. Histologically and somehow functionally, human amniotic cells are
      similar to ocular surface cells, and these cells have been shown to be safe to be
      transplanted to another subject and will not be rejected by the recipient. In animal studies,
      amniotic cells demonstrated that they can re-establish the integrity of ocular surface in
      more than 30% of recipients without apparent toxic side effects. This study will investigate
      this novel strategy for its effect on human ocular surface disorder. It will provide a
      potential alternative therapy for this difficult and devastating disease.
