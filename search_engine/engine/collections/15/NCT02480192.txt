      (e.g., hot flashes/night sweats, sleep difficulties, sexual concerns) in addition to
      emotional difficulties (e.g., depression, anxiety) that can significantly impact functioning
      and overall quality of life. To date, hormone therapy (HT) has been the most commonly used
      treatment to relieve symptoms of menopause. However, reports have questioned the safety of HT
      long-term (e.g., risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancer) for some women.
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), has been proposed as a low-risk treatment for menopausal
      symptoms. The investigators developed a comprehensive non-pharmacological, CBT for menopausal
      symptoms (CBT-Meno), published the treatment manual (Green, McCabe, & Soares, 2012), and
      obtained initial evidence supporting the effectiveness of CBT-Meno in a single-sample pilot
      study (Green et al., 2013). The goal in the study reported here was to conduct a larger
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CBT-Meno program compared to
      a waitlist condition. The investigators hypothesized that participants would experience less
      intense/disruptive hot flashes/night sweats, reduced depression and anxiety, improvement in
      sleep difficulties, and sexual concerns. The investigators also predicted that these benefits
      would be maintained at 3-month follow-up and that participants would report high treatment
      satisfaction.
