      Axitinib is designed to decrease blood supply to the tumor, which may slow tumor growth.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take axitinib by mouth 2
      times a day every day for 12 weeks. The dose may be changed based on any side effects you may
      have. You should take the drug about 12 hours apart. You should take the pills at about the
      same time each day. If you vomit anytime after taking a dose, you must not "make it up" with
      an extra dose, but instead take the next dose as previously scheduled. Any missed dose may be
      taken late up to 3 hours before the next scheduled dose, otherwise, it should be skipped.

      A blood pressure monitor will be given to each participant for home use. You will be given
      instructions and shown how to monitor your blood pressure.

      You will be provided with a calendar to record the date and time of each dose, and your blood
      pressure reading before taking the drug. Missed doses should also be recorded. You must also
      bring the study drug bottle to each study visit so the research nurse can count any remaining
      pills.

      A drug list will be given to you to record drugs taken within 4 weeks before you enrolled on
      the study and while on study. A new list will be provided during each clinic visit. You
      should not start a new prescription or over-the-counter drug before talking with the study
      doctor, except in the case of a medical emergency.

        -  You will have a CT scan of chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.

        -  At Week 12 only, you will have an ECG.

      At Week 13, you will have surgery to remove the kidney tumor. You will receive a separate

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check your thyroid
           function.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about kidney cancer care.

        -  You will have a CT scan of chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.

        -  If you have been treated for high blood pressure while taking the drug, your blood
           pressure will be monitored and your blood pressure medication will be reduced. Once your
           blood pressure reaches a certain level, this will be managed by your primary care
           doctor.

      After Week 19, every 4 months (+/- 2 weeks) for the first 1 year, every 6 months (+/- 2
      weeks) for the third and fourth year, then every year (+/- 1 month) for a total of 5 years
      post surgery:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about kidney cancer care (only during the first 2
           years).

      Length of Study:

      You will take axitinib for up to 12 weeks. You will stop taking axitinib earlier than
      expected if the disease gets worse or if you have severe side effects. In both cases, you
      will move on to surgery after axitinib has been stopped.

      After surgery, you will be contacted by the study staff every 4 months (+/- 2 weeks) for 1
      year, every 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) for the next 2 years and every 12 months (+/- 1 month) for
      2 more years (for a total of 5 years after surgery).

      This is an investigational study. Axitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat advanced kidney cancer in adults when 1 previous drug treatment for this disease has
      not worked. In this study, it is being used for research purposes.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
