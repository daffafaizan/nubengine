      postabortal pelvic inflammatory diseases, screen-and-treat approach has the potential benefit
      of altering women's sexual behavior and preventing further re-infection by sexually
      transmitted infections. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of
      the two approaches in preventing postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease and the women's
      sexual behavior.
