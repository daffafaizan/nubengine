      every year due to various causes (falls, motor vehicle accidents, sports, work, etc.) [9] at
      an estimated combined cost of $110 billion made up of direct (e.g., medical) and indirect
      (e.g., lost productivity) costs [6]. Insomnia is one of the most common symptoms of traumatic
      brain injury (TBI). Sleep disturbance disrupts TBI recovery and increases the likelihood of
      developing neuropsychiatric symptoms, specifically putting TBI patients at enhanced risk for
      depressive and anxiety symptomatology. Standard pharmacological treatments used for managing
      insomnia are poor targets in this population, as they are vulnerable to medication
      side-effects. Very few non-pharmacological studies have been conducted to intervene on
      insomnia in this population. One such study hints at the effectiveness of cognitive
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The current study seeks to evaluate CBT-I in recent
      TBI patients compared to a sleep education control intervention. Participants will wear a
      Fitbit and an Actiwatch to objectively evaluate sleep measures. Patients will participate in
      CBT-I treatment (or sleep education treatment) weekly for six weeks, and will have a 3-months
      follow-up visit in order to examine the efficacy and time course of treatment. In addition,
      participants will complete several self-report questionnaires in order to examine sleep and
      neuropsychiatric symptoms throughout treatment. This type of non-pharmacological multi-target
      therapy is much needed for persons with TBI, as they are at high risk of developing chronic
      neuropsychiatric sequelae but are vulnerable to medication side-effects.
