      side effects. Studies performed on American and Chinese populations have shown positive
      results. These studies need confirmation in different populations. Molval Fort is a natural
      product available in the Lebanese market with a combination of red yeast rice extracts,
      EPA/DHA and coenzyme Q10. The investigators are conducting this study to explore the effect
      of red yest rice extracts based product on LDL and its side effects in a sample of primary
      care Lebanese patients.
