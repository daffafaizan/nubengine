      I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in operative patients with recurrent
      or progressive glioblastoma multiforme treated with cilengitide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups for
      the preoperative treatment component.

      Preoperative Treatment Group I: Patients receive high-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days
      -8, -4, and -1.

      Preoperative Treatment Group II: Patients receive low-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days
      -8, -4, and -1.

      Resection: All patients undergo tumor resection on day 0.

      Postoperative Treatment: Beginning within 2 weeks after surgery, all patients receive
      high-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients (22 per preoperative treatment group) will be
      accrued for this study.
