    
      20 patients with severe to total Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD) in one eye attributable
      to injury or ocular surgery. The first 5 eyes will receive the cLSCs to determine the
      feasibility and safety. Then the subsequent 15 eyes will be randomized into cLSC group and a
      scleral lens treatment (SCL) control group in a 2:1 ratio in blocks of 3 or 6 using a random
      number generator.
