      strategy for transfusing red blood cells (RBC) remains to be elucidated. Postoperative anemia
      may cause dizziness and fatigue which delays early mobilization after surgery and may trigger
      the transfusion of one or more RBC units. However, it is not known whether the administration
      of 1-2 units of RBC to patients suffering from moderate postoperative anemia (HB 7.5 - 10
      g/dl) will improve postoperative dizziness.

      Thus, this randomized controlled study aims to evaluate whether the administration of 1-2 RBC
      units on the first postoperative day improves postoperative dizziness in patients undergoing
      total hip arthroplasty.
