    
      This study is a prospective two-arm cohort study with both groups (CAD and PAD) undergoing
      the same intervention (standard 6 month out-patient cardiac rehabilitation program offered at
      the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Rumsey Centre). The standard 6-month out-patient cardiac
      rehabilitation program consists of weekly 1.5 hour visits to the TRI Rumsey Centre. After
      determining baseline VO2peak from the exercise stress test, an individualized walking
      exercise prescription will be developed by a cardiac rehabilitation supervisor which
      corresponds to approximately 60 to 80% of the participant's VO2peak. Participants will be
      invited to walk around the track and attend education sessions at the same time every week
      for six months. Patients will be encouraged to gradually increase their exercise time walking
      speed. Patients will be encouraged to exercise five times a week with four sessions occurring
      outside of the cardiac rehabilitation program. Both PAD and CAD participants will undergo the
      same standard cardiac rehabilitation program.
