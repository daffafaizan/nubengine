      achieve a bloodless surgical field, known as a patient's limb occlusion pressure (LOP).
      However, LOP is not yet routinely measured in all patients due to limitations of current
      techniques. This study evaluates a novel technique for measuring the LOP through the
      tourniquet cuff that overcomes many limitations of current LOP measurement techniques.

      The goal of the study is to determine if the LOP measured by the new technique is
      statistically or clinically different from the LOP measured by a gold standard Doppler
      ultrasound technique in adult and pediatric patients
