      liver cirrhosis can be stabilized and/or improved through investigational microbiota
      restoration therapeutic treatment. The main objective of this study is to determine if
      investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic treatment alters the cognitive function in
      individuals with cirrhosis who have been previously diagnosed with overt hepatic
      encephalopathy (HE). Once individuals have one HE episode, they are more likely to experience
      additional episodes, even after complying with standard of care. The number of HE episodes
      each study group experiences during the post-treatment follow-up will be compared among
      treatment groups. It is also anticipated that cognitive improvement will correlate with
      specific changes in the intestinal microbiota composition of these individuals likely
      shifting their microbiome away from baseline samples and becoming more like donor samples.
      Novel blood biomarkers potentially related to episodes of HE will be assessed in individuals
      before and after treatment.
