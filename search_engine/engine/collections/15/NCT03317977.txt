      CHM). 170 adolescents with poorly controlled asthma and their primary caregivers will be
      enrolled. Families will be randomly assigned to six months of home-based family treatment
      consisting of either RFC or Michigan MATCH , a model program endorsed by the State of
      Michigan for treatment of poorly controlled asthma. Treatment content of RFC consists of
      weekly sessions focusing on asthma education, asthma management skills, improving home-school
      community for asthma, access to care and case management. MATCH includes asthma education but
      is less intensive and does not focus on family management skills. Treatment will be provided
      by community health workers (CHWs) employed by a community agency providing MATCH as their
      standard of care. Consent and data collection will be completed in the home at baseline with
      additional data collection visits at 6, 12 and 18 months after baseline. Data collection is
      completed by project research assistants and consists of questionnaires and interviews with
      the adolescent and parent to assess asthma management, asthma symptoms and hospital
      utilization. The adolescent also completes a pulmonary function test on a portable spirometer
      and is observed using medication devices to assess asthma care skills objectively.The data
      analyses will be intent-to-treat, meaning that all randomized participants are included
      regardless of the intervention dose received. Trial data will analyzed using the linear mixed
      effect models.
