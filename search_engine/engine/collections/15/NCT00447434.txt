      inclusion/exclusion criteria and give written consent to participate will be assigned to one
      of the three groups according to their condition: Group A- normal volunteers; Group B-
      patients under dialysis; Group C- patients of cardiovascular high risk group. Each group will
      enroll 15 subjects. After two to four weeks run-in period, subjects will be given nattokinase
      orally for 8 weeks, and will be asked to stop taking nattokinase for 2 weeks to evaluate the
      effect of long-term intake and cease of intake of nattokinase.

      Laboratory tests, including fibrinogen, T-PA, PAI-1, D-dimer, total cholesterol, LDL-C,
      HDL-C, and TG, vital signs and body weight will be evaluated at screening visit, 3 days, 1
      week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks (2 weeks after cease of intake) visits. Patient
      self-evaluation of tolerance and physical improvement will be assessed by a Patient
      Questionnaire at 3-day, and 1-, 4-, 8-, and 10-week visits. Each patient will be carefully
      monitored for the development of any adverse events (AE).
