      controlled mechanical ventilation. With these modes, ventilatory cycling is under the
      patient's control to an extent depending on the type of ventilatory modality.

      Sigh improves oxygenation and lung mechanics during pressure control ventilation and pressure
      support ventilation (PSV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

      In order to better quantify the effects of both PSV and PSV plus Sigh on respiratory
      mechanics, the esophageal pressure monitoring could be helpful. However, esophageal pressure
      (Pes) assessment requires esophageal ballon calibration (EBC) as demonstrated in intubated
      patients under controlled mechanical ventilation.

      At our knowledge, no data exist about EBC during assisted ventilatory modes. The primary aim
      of the present study is to evaluate the effects of PSV and PSV plus Sigh ventilation on
      esophageal balloon best volume in patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute
      respiratory failure.
