      assumed that only a minority has already been elucidated so far. This project aims to
      investigate the consequences and health-related outcomes of various hormone therapies in the
      treatment of gender dysphoric patients. The main scientific interest lies in the research of
      the effects of sex hormones on psychological, metabolic and behavioural parameters. For this
      purpose, various investigations are aimed at, including a clinical-diagnostic interview
      (external rating) and psychometric measurements in self-rating, behavioral experiments (e.g.
      in a virtual reality Elevated Plus Maze and the computer-based Ultimatum Game) and genetic
      investigation of the body's own materials (blood samples, stool samples, hair samples and
      saliva samples). The results of this study should form the basis to better understand
      consequences of the long-term administration of sex hormones.
