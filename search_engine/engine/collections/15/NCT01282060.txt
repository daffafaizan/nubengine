      aim of which is to assess the link between glycaemic balance (evaluated on the basis of HbA1c
      levels) and total mortality at 5 years in diabetic patients aged 70 and over, and suffering
      from type 2 diabetes. An extension to 10 years is considered given the innovative features of
      this cohort follow-up procedure.

      The secondary endpoints are as follows:

        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and the mortality rate with specific
           causes.

        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and the onset of or change in
           diabetes-related complications: cardiovascular diseases, change in renal function,
           diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, perforating ulcer of the foot and acute
           metabolic complications.

        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and nutritional status, the onset of or
           changes in cognitive disorders and a loss of autonomy.

        -  To specify the role of other cardiovascular risk factors combined with glycaemic
           balance, in mortality, diabetes-related complications, cognitive disorders and loss of
           autonomy.
