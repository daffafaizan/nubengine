      population will be recruited among individuals attending the UCLH Centre for Weight Loss,
      Metabolic & Endocrine Surgery (UCLH bariatric clinic) and have given written informed consent
      to the study.

      Experimental Design All individuals who consent to this study will receive as part of their
      routine care a medical examination, where a series of parameters are recorded (including age,
      gender, smoking status, Bio-impedance for full body composition, ethnicity, and body mass
      index). These data will be copied for this study. A blood sample will also be collected for
      genetic analysis unless the patients have DNA already collected and it has been verified that
      the results are available. In that case no venepuncture will be needed.

      All subjects will receive a basic periodontal examination (BPE). For individuals with signs
      of destructive periodontitis (BPE scores 3-4) full mouth plaque and gingival bleeding scores
      will also be calculated. In addition to that also a comprehensive full mouth periodontal
      probing depths assessment will be performed.
