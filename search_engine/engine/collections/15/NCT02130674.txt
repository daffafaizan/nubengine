      neuromonitoring during pharmacological coma will receive alanyl-glutamine dipeptide
      (Dipeptiven) as part of standard clinical nutrition.

      In two groups of patients the influence of different duration of infusion (group 1: 24 hours;
      group 2: 5 days) will be investigated. For this, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      parameters in plasma and brain are determined.

      Increased plasma glutamine and alanine in arterial and jugular venous plasma and in cerebral
      microdialysates are to reflect efficacy of Dipeptiven infusion.

      Plasma glutamate levels as well as changes in cerebral glutamate, lactate, lactate/pyruvate
      ratio, intracranial pressure, bispectral index electroencephalography will be measured to
      exclude potential adverse effects
