      examinations are consistent with the normal surgeon care as part of Total Knee Replacement
      surgery. The study objective is to assess the safety, functionality, and survivorship of the
      Freedom Knee System through a multi-center clinical trial. Study endpoints include a
      comparison of Pre-Surgery (baseline) versus Post-Surgery data for Range of Motion and
      Flexion, Quality of Life (KSS), and survivorship (defined by 'no revisions'). Additionally,
      the structural integrity will be evaluated based on the x-ray performed 36-months after knee
      replacement.
