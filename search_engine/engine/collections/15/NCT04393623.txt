    
      Aims for the current study are two-fold: 1. conduct a randomized trial testing the effects of
      an emotion regulation skill (cognitive reappraisal) on stress-induced drinking among women
      with alcohol misuse and varying levels of co-occurring PTSD; 2. examine whether progesterone
      levels and/or severity of co-occurring PTSD - factors which impact women's stress reactivity
      and emotion regulation - moderate the effectiveness of the cognitive reappraisal in reducing
      stress-induced drinking.

      The proposed study will combine experimental, in-person sessions with daily self-report data
      from the Veterans to assess the effect of cognitive reappraisal on alcohol craving, cognitive
      (inhibitory) control, physiological arousal (HRV), and alcohol use. Participation will take
      place across a period of at least 35 days, to encompass an entire menstrual cycle. All
      participants complete all sections of the study - the experimental sessions and the
      longitudinal (35-day) data collection.
