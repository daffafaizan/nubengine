      pressure (PL) representing the difference alveolar pressure and pleural pressure. Spontaneous
      deep breath increases the PL by reducing pleural pressure (active breathing exercises,
      breathing supporters and manual operation).

      Muller resuscitator consists of a pneumatic valve feature designed to operate with medical
      oxygen. It is used intermittently or continuously for pulmonary re-expansion, with lower load
      imposed work, and increase the efficiency of gas exchange by improving volumes, lung capacity
      and breathing pattern, and reverse atelectasis.

      However, studies show the paucity of data in the literature regarding the Muller Resuscitator
      in different forms and respiratory rehabilitation protocols. In addition, studies show lack
      of standardization of methods and resources used in respiratory therapy in patients with
      chest tube.
