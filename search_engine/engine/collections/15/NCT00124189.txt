      activity in a variety of tumor model systems. Telomerase is an enzyme that is active
      primarily in tumor cells and is crucial for the indefinite growth of tumor cells. Inhibition
      of telomerase may result in antineoplastic effects. High telomerase levels and short telomere
      lengths correlate with other markers of poor prognosis in patients with chronic
      lymphoproliferative disease.
