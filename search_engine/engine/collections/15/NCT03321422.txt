      Apart from the age at diagnosis and surgery, the severity of femoral head flattening and the
      signs of "head at risk" are also associated with the final clinical outcome. The current
      surgical treatment options, including proximal femoral varus osteotomy, innominate osteotomy,
      lateral shelf acetabuloplasty,triple pelvic osteotomy, and Chiari pelvic osteotomy have
      proved to be effective in covering the femoral head within the acetabulum. To promote the
      coverage of the femoral head, shelf acetabuloplasty directly increases the size of the
      acetabulum by implanting graft bone to the lateral rim. When used as salvage surgery, it may
      provide relief from pain and benefit the involved hip via femoral head flattening, especially
      in older children. It also improves the spherical remodeling of the femoral head and
      acetabulum by stimulating lateral acetabular growth. Lateral shelf acetabuloplasty is able to
      increase the coverage of the femoral head, which is an important tissue for remodeling and
      preventing further femoral head deformation.
