    
      This will be a single-blind three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial involving
      post-partum mothers and/or caregivers of infants (age 0-12months) attending immunization
      clinics in 12 randomly selected Primary Health Care Centres (clusters) across Sokoto, Jigawa,
      Kano, Ogun, Oyo and Lagos States of Nigeria. Additionally, a photovoice methodology will be
      implemented in 6 community clusters (one in each State) involving group discussions between
      community members (pregnant women in their third trimester, parents/caregivers of infants age
      0-12 months), community leaders, service providers and policy makers on benefits of timely
      immunization and consequences of non-vaccination. Parent-infant pairs will be followed up for
      12 months during which SMS and phone call immunization clinic appointment reminders will be
      provided to mothers and/or caregivers in intervention arm 1, and photovoice intervention
      provided at study commencement to participants in intervention arm 2. Respondents in the
      control group would receive standard care (routine paper-based appointment scheduling alone).
      The investigators will document and compare immunization uptake (all doses and vaccines),
      timeliness of receipt and completion rates of scheduled immunization between the three
      groups, as well as incidence of VPDs between the groups using multivariate statistical
      analyses.
