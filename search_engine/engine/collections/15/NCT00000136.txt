      to affect 35 to 40 percent of patients with AIDS. Untreated CMV retinitis is a progressive
      disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. The first two
      drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      CMV retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene) and foscarnet (Foscavir). At the time of this
      trial, both ganciclovir and foscarnet were available only as intravenous formulations. Both
      drugs were given in a similar two-step fashion: an initial 2-week course of high-dose therapy
      (induction) to control the infection followed by long-term lower dose therapy to prevent
      relapse (maintenance). The FGCRT compared foscarnet and ganciclovir as initial therapy for
      CMV retinitis.

      The FGCRT was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing foscarnet and
      ganciclovir as initial therapy for CMV retinitis. Patients with previously untreated CMV
      retinitis were randomized to therapy with either intravenous ganciclovir or intravenous
      foscarnet. The outcome measures of this trial were survival, retinitis progression, loss of
      visual function (visual acuity and visual field), and morbidity.
