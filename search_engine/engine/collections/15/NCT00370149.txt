      adults. The antibiotic-coated CVC is a newer CVC gaining popularity for use in adults. The
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) support use of
      the antibiotic-coated CVC for adult patients. But the FDA and CDC have not yet endorsed use
      of the antibiotic-coated CVC for infants and children due to lack of research on this CVC in
      infants and children.
