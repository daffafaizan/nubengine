    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the performance of Optiflow THRIVE relative to Standard Non-Rebreathers in
      patients with high risk of difficult airway management undergoing interventional radiology
      procedures for the planning of future clinical studies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To describe the episodes of hypoxia (defined by peripheral capillary oxygen saturation
      [SpO2] less than or equal to 92%) and the episodes of airway support which include: jaw
      thrust, chin lift or insertion of an airway supporting device, such as oral/nasal airway or
      supra airway device in order to recover the level of oxygenation above 92% associated with
      Optiflow THRIVE.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive 100% oxygen at a high flow rate via Optiflow THRIVE over 3 minutes
      prior to anesthetic induction and at a higher flow rate until the end of procedure.

      ARM II: Patients receive 100% oxygen at a lower flow rate via non-rebreather mask over 3
      minutes prior to anesthetic induction and maintain the same flow rate until the end of
      procedure.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 15 minutes.
