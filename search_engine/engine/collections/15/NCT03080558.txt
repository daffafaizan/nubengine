      indocyanine green after dilution (2,5mg/ml). With de SPIES system (KARL STORZ GmbH & Co. KG,
      Tuttlingen, Germany), the vascularisation would be imediately fluorescent. Investigators are
      going to estimate the vascularization of the rectal serosa and mucosa where the nodule was
      located.

      If a vaginal resection has been performed, investigators are going to estimate the
      vascularization of the vaginal scar.

      To estimate de vascularization, investigators are going tu use a scale with a score between 0
      and 4.

      After the surgery, the post-operative follow-up with be the same as usual after a Rectal
      Shaving.
