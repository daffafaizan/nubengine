      active or placebo) during the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period and continue to meet
      other eligibility criteria will have the option to receive open label CR845 for an additional
      52 weeks.

      Week 52, or Early Termination.

      Follow-up Period: A final safety Follow up Visit will be conducted 7-10 days after the End of
      Treatment/Early Termination Visit.
