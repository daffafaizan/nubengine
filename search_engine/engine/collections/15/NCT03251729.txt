      birth found to have a short transvaginal ultrasound cervical length (<=25mm) and meeting all
      other eligibility criteria will be randomized to either cervical cerclage or control (no
      cerclage). Aside from cerclage placement, management of included women will be the same
      including recommendation for daily vaginal progesterone 200mg suppository or 90mg gel from
      randomization until 36 6/7 weeks. The primary outcome will be the incidence of spontaneous
      preterm birth <35 weeks
