      healthy individuals were included in the study between January 2019 and October 2020. Liver
      stiffness measurements with 2D-SWE, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and aspartate aminotransferase to
      platelet ratio index (APRI) scoring and additional liver biopsy in patients with CHB were
      performed in all cases with the help of the propagation map. Depending on the degree of
      fibrosis, liver stiffness was measured again at 24 and 48 weeks in patients who received
      antiviral therapy. Spearman rank correlation test was used for analysing correlation between
      variables, and receiver operating curve analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic performance
      in terms of fibrosis.
