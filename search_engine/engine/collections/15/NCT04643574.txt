    
      The objective of the trial is to define the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of NeoTIL-ACT
      in combination with LDI in patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid tumors, as
      categorized in two molecularly defined cohorts.

      Study treatment will begin with intravenous (IV) non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy composed by fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Both treatments will be started on
      the same day. Fludarabine will be administered from for five days, and cyclophosphamide ffor
      two days. Low-dose irradiation (LDI) will be administered once, to tumor lesions using
      tomotherapy.

      Patients will receive NeoTIL infusion intravenously followed by high dose IL-2 administration
      every eight hours, for a maximum of eight doses. Supportive care will be given as needed
      during the whole treatment period.

      Patients achieving a stable disease, partial response or complete response after NeoTIL-ACT
      treatment will then enter a clinical follow-up period for 5 years.
