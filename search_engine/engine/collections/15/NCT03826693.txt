    
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling disorder characterized by
      recurrent intrusive thoughts and associated compulsive behaviors that is estimated to affect
      more than 3 million individuals in the US each year.

      This study seeks to explore whether a single inhalation of nitrous oxide gas may bring about
      rapid symptom relief in OCD.
