      deeply across different age groups and with different vaccine formulations and to probe the
      influence of genetics on these responses using monozygotic and dizygotic twins. On an
      investigational basis, investigators plan to compare various immunological responses,
      identify age-specific biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of
      influenza-specific T-cells pre- and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of
      T-cell repertoire to an influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to
      what degree this is genetically determined.

      Twin Groups A-E will receive a single administration of the 2010-2011 formulation of seasonal
      trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Group F, elderly monozygotic twin
      participants, will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of inactivated vaccine,
      either the usual dose or the High-Dose TIV. Blood samples to conduct the assays described
      will be taken at pre-immunization, Days 7-10 and 28 post-immunization. Each twin is counted
      as a single participant. All reporting numbers reflect the number of participants, not the
      number of twin pairs.
