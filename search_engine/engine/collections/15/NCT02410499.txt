      people who have diabetes with macroalbuminuria. This study will look at the urinary
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio in people who take MLN1202.

      The study will enroll approximately 156 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  MLN1202 75 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection

        -  MLN1202 105 mg SC injection

        -  MLN1202 150 mg SC injection

        -  Placebo matching MLN1202 SC injection (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution
           that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will receive a loading dose of placebo or MLN1202 on Day 1 followed by
      once-weekly injections of the study medication they were randomized to receive.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 5 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 5
      weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
