      treadmill training. Indeed, this rehabilitation approach has been utilized with some success
      in various clinical populations, such as stroke and spinal cord injury, and is believed to
      target neuroplasticity. Specific to persons with MS, body weight supported treadmill training
      has shown great promise in improving quality of life, symptoms and functional mobility in two
      small (n=4 and n=6) pilot investigations. However, previous research has been hampered by
      methodological limitations including small sample size, lack of a control group and limited
      training sessions. Consequently, no firm conclusion regarding the benefit of body weighted
      supported treadmill training in persons with MS can be drawn. The proposed project seeks to
      determine if twenty-weeks of body weight supported treadmill training leads to improvements
      in physiological function, mobility and quality of life in persons with MS with severe
      mobility limitations. The outcomes of this project have the potential to lead to new
      rehabilitation approaches capable of improving function and quality of life in persons with
      advanced MS.
