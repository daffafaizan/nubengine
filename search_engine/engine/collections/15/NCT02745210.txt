      morbidity remains a public health challenge and is the leading cause of disability in the
      United States To combat these effects, new research is needed to identify mechanisms of
      injury that will lead to potential targets for therapeutic interventions that improve
      neurological outcome. One promising area of research is the cerebral metabolic dysfunction
      following TBI. Studies of post-traumatic cerebral metabolism have shown that cerebral
      metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) decreases for a period of days, weeks or months after
      injury with the duration and degree of hypometabolism correlating to level of consciousness
      and a strong predictor of long-term neurological outcome. However, specific changes in
      intermediary carbohydrate metabolic pathways have not yet been identified. In addition, the
      role of astrocyte metabolism in the post-injury metabolism has not been studied. This study
      uses in vivo 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3 Tesla, a novel method in the
      clinical study of TBI, to non-invasively study the metabolic fate and flux of glucose
      (metabolized in both neurons and astrocytes) and acetate (metabolized in astrocytes) through
      metabolic pathways during the hypometabolic period.
