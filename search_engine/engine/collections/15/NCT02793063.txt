      will be sent to all RDCRN BBD Contact Registry participants that meet the inclusion criteria
      to complete the online PROMIS CAT instruments. The email invitation will contain a link to
      the informed consent form. Once participants have consented to the study, they will have
      access to the online instruments. Follow-up emails will be sent to participants that have not
      completed any of the instruments. Reminder emails will be sent to participants with partially
      completed instruments.

      Data will be collected and stored by the RDCRN DMCC at USF.

      Data from patients co-enrolled in the "Longitudinal Study of Osteogenesis Imperfecta" and the
      BBD RDCRN Contact Registry will be linked and compared. Additional disease specific
      information will be collected by the survey (e.g., information on OI type and diagnosis,
      height, number of fractures, concurrent medication use, utilization of any mobility aid,
      hearing aid, or other device that they may use.
