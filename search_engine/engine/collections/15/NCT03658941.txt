      rate after craniotomies. Almost a century ago Walter Dandy reported dural tenting sutures as
      an effective way of preventing postoperative EDH. Over time, his technique gained in
      popularity and significance to finally become a neurosurgical standard.

      Yet, there have been several retrospective reports questioning the ongoing need for dural
      tenting sutures. Dandy's explanation that the hemostasis under hypotensive conditions is
      deceiving and eventually causes EDH may be obsolete. These days, proper intra- and
      postoperative care, including maintenance of normovolemia and normotension and the use of
      modern hemostatic agents, may be enough for effective hemostasis. Evading of this suturing
      technique by some surgeons supports this argument even further.

      Thus, there is a fundamental need to evaluate the necessity of dural tenting sutures in an
      unbiased, evidence-based manner.
