           tools to reduce patient deterioration triggered by respiratory complications. The lack
           of this crucial knowledge leads to errors in further cases, and errors in medical
           documentation leads to limited learning from errors and potentially preventable harm to
           patients.

        -  The respiratory measurement is an early indicator of disease, yet many clinicians
           underestimate its importance and hospitals report a poor level of respiratory rate
           recordings. As respiratory abnormalities are early markers of patient deterioration, it
           is hoped that improved and continued data collection and monitoring will have an impact
           on the nature and timeliness of the response to critical illness. Data concordance plays
           a major role in documentation quality, especially for data-mining and knowledge
           extraction analysis, therefore it is essential to address the reliability of
           'respiratory abnormalities' labelled data within the Electronic Health Record (EHR)
           system.

        -  It is hypothesized that an exploratory analysis of historical medical records by using
           an advanced algorithm could reveal novel and improved knowledge about the nature of
           Respiratory Abnormalities. However, the quality, computability, reliability, accuracy
           and completeness of the data are questionable.

        -  It's also hypothesized that efficacious and preventive intervention can reduce the
           increased burden of illness followed by respiratory abnormalities, reduce the enormous
           number of treatable incidences and be cost-effective when delivered in the real-life
           clinical environment.
