    
      A multi-center treatment study assessing the efficacy and safety of an immunotherapeutic
      vaccine (DPX-Survivac) combined with low dose cyclophosphamide. Subjects with measurable,
      histologically proven DLBCL expressing survivin will be treated in this open-label, single
      arm study. Survivin is a protein commonly over-expressed in many types of cancer, including
      DLBCL.
