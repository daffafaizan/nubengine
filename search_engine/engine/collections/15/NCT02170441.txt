    
      The goals of this study are to test, fine tune, and compare three tests (line probe,
      pyrosequencing, MODS assays) to rapidly detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains that
      are resistant to first and second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs allowing for rapid
      diagnosis of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB).

      Primary Specific Aims

      Aim 1: To reduce the average XDR-TB detection time from months to a week.

      Aim 2: To determine agreement between rapid tests and standard drug susceptibility testing
      (DST) results.

      Aim 3: To identify the genetic basis of discordant results from Aim 2.

      Aim 4: To characterize genotypic, phenotypic and epidemiological features, as well as
      geographical relationships, of XDR-TB strains compared to other drug-resistant and
      susceptible strains.

      Secondary Aims Aim 1: Cost-effectiveness study. The costs associated with rapid-test
      implementation will be compared with the performance of the new tests to rapidly and
      accurately detect drug resistance and XDR-TB.

      Aim 2: To determine the predictive value of resistance-associated mutations in determining
      sputum culture conversion.

      The investigators hypothesize that analysis of the genotypic basis of anti-TB drug resistance
      will allow for the development of improved rapid molecular drug susceptibility tests that
      will detect resistance to fluoroquinolones and injectable anti-TB drugs and reduce the
      current XDR-TB diagnosis time of up to three months to less than seven days.
