      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend cardiac
      surgery, especially in those patients who are undergoing left side valve surgery.
      Nevertheless many patients are not eligible for surgical tricuspid valve repair due to an
      high risk of mortality. Therefore interventional devices for treatment of tricuspid
      regurgitation have been established to offer these patients an alternative treatment option.
      The aim of this study is to analyse the success and saftey aspects of different
      interventional repair techniques for severe tricuspid regurgitation. Therefore in this
      prospectively designed observational study clinical, echocardiographic and laboratory
      parameters will be collected.
