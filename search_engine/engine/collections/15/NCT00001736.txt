      of cysteamine eye drops to treat children and adults with cystinosis and cystine crystal
      accumulation in the cornea. The safety of this new formulation will be evaluated among 30
      children and adults with a history of cystinosis under treatment at the NIH with the current
      preparation of cysteamine eye drops. Patients will be randomized to the current preparation
      in one eye and the new formulation in the other eye. Vision, blurring, redness, pain,
      irritation, and itching will be evaluated in each eye at Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, and Month 6.
      Complete ophthalmic evaluation including corneal slit lamp examination with photographs will
      be performed at baseline and 6 months at the NEI Clinical Center.

      Efficacy will be evaluated among 15 patients (5 each from the NEI Clinical Center, Ann Arbor
      Michigan, and La Jolla, California) who have not received cysteamine eye drops prior to
      enrollment. Patients will be randomized to the current preparation in one eye and the new
      formulation in the other eye. Vision, blurring, redness, pain, irritation, and itching will
      be evaluated in each eye and a complete ophthalmic assessment including a corneal slit lamp
      examination with photographs will be performed at baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, and
      Month 12. The primary efficacy outcome measure will be the improvement in the new formulation
      treated eye by 1.00 unit on a corneal photograph scale from 0.00 to 3.00 in 0.25 increments
      compared to the baseline grade. This scale grades the density and number of crystals in the
      cornea. The safety and efficacy studies will be conducted concurrently.
