      plus usual care, or the usual care arm. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will
      receive usual oncologic care and phone calls from a nurse. Outcome measures will be collected
      at baseline and at the end of the patients' primary cancer treatment. The study will be
      performed at the Puget Sound Health Care System, Birmingham VA and Portland VA. The
      investigators will recruit individuals (n=138) with lung cancer over 2.5 years. The primary
      objective is to determine the efficacy of the nurse-led telephone-based palliative
      intervention on improving patients' quality of life, symptom burden, and satisfaction of
      care. In addition, using validated instruments, the investigators will assess the effect of
      the intervention on patient activation to discuss treatment preferences with their clinician
      and on clinician knowledge of patients' goals of care. The results of this study will inform
      a future effectiveness/implementation study.
