      participate in the study will be recorded on a structured form. Participants will be randomly
      divided into three groups: Massage application group, Foam Roller application group and
      Control group. Afterwards, thermal imaging, perceived fatigue and pain level, blood lactate
      level measurements, and vertical jump assessments will be done for the quadriceps femoris
      muscle. Then, the fatigue protocol will be applied for the quadriceps femoris muscle and
      five-minute applications will be made according to the groups in which they are randomly
      separated. Evaluations made in the first applications will be made immediately after the
      applications, 24 hours and 48 hours later, as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th measurements. The assessor
      will not know which group the participants are from.
