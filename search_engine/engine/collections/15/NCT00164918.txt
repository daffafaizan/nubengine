      exposure of operative field during elective subtotal gastrectomy, but whether it should be
      retained post-operatively is controversial. Nasogastric decompression helps to drain the
      gastric remnant in case there is edema around the gastrojejunostomy, ileus and delayed
      gastric emptying, which can theoretically relieve nausea and abdominal distension. Besides,
      it may help decrease diaphragmatic splintage and hence decrease chance of chest infection if
      ileus occurs. However, nasogastric intubation could cause patient discomfort; also it has
      been shown that it would cause gastroesophageal reflux which may be associated with chest
      complication. There have been studies showing that routine post-operative nasogastric
      decompression is not necessary for gastrectomy in general, but the role in subtotal
      gastrectomy for stomach cancer is not well defined.
