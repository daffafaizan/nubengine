      using molecular profile-based evidence to determine individualized cancer therapy for
      patients with incurable malignancies. This is a non-randomized, histology-agnostic trial.
      While it is known that individual histologies are composed of a heterogeneous mix of genomic
      alterations, it is not clear that one case mix is better or worse than another. Thus, a
      strategy of molecular matching that may apply across cancers is being tested. All eligible
      and consented patients will have their tumor tissues genomic profiled by Foundation
      Medicine's FoundationOne genomic analysis. Patients will be stratified into Group 1
      (treatment naïve, unresectable/medically unfit for surgery), Group 2 (treatment naïve,
      metastatic), and Group 3 (prior treated), respectively. Following analysis for genomic
      alterations, matched therapy, if available, will be recommended by the Study Committee or
      Molecular Tumor Board. If the patients received the matched therapy, they are designated as
      in Arm A. Otherwise, if the patients received the unmatched therapy (i.e., treating
      physician's choice of traditional systemic chemotherapy), they are designated as in Arm B.
      The study feasibility will be measured by the ability to enroll patients, the acceptable
      turnaround time and the actionable information obtained from the genomic profiling, and the
      viability of identifying and delivering the matched therapy. The treatment efficacy will be
      determined among the patients groups and treatment arms. The safety profile of the treatment
      will also be assessed.
