      the BIOMONITOR in a subset of obese patients with a BMI >30 kg/m2 in order to exclude any
      concerns regarding impaired ICM sensing performance. These concerns are founded in the
      increased distance between heart and device electrodes due to fat layers that may attenuate
      signal detection and therefore sensing performances of the ICM.
