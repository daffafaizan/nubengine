      to prevent oral squamous cell carcinoma onset. However, there is still no consensus on the
      most effective approach for the patients affected by such oral potentially malignant
      disorders. Surgery is often performed, but there is no randomized clinical trial which
      demonstrates its real effectiveness in preventing oral cancer onset.

      A recent RCT compared surgical treatment with "wait and see approach" care in patients with
      nondysplastic OL, assuming that regular clinical follow-up could be considered a reliable
      standard of care among patients with nondysplastic oral leukoplakias.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of surgical excision in treating OL
      and or prolonging the onset of potential oral squamous cell carcinoma. This study will be the
      first RCT comparing the effectiveness of surgery to "wait and see approach" in the management
      of both dysplastic and nondysplastic oral leukoplakias.
