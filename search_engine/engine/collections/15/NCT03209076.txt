    
      Prospective randomized trial comparing robotic versus laparoscopic Low anterior resection for
      rectal cancer.

      The Aim of the study is to compare two surgical approaches (robotic versus laparoscopic) for
      rectal cancer treatment regarding functional outcomes (sexual and urinary dysfunctions),
      quality of life, post operative outcomes and oncologic outcomes.

      Patients with the diagnosis of T3 mid and low rectal cancer will be randomized to robotic or
      laparoscopic procedure after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Quality of life questionnaires and
      Urodynamic test will be applied before and after the surgical procedures.
