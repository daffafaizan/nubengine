      strongly associated with mortality in these patients. Activation of Ghrelin receptors have
      been demonstrated to stimulate appetite. RC-1291 HCl, by virtue of its ghrelin like activity
      and Growth Hormone releasing effects may have a dual role in the reversal of cancer induced
      anorexia and cachexia. This placebo controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      RC-1291 HCl in cancer patients with anorexia and cachexia.
