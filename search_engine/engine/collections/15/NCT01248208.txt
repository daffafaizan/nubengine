      live-attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (LAIV) contains the lowest amount of egg
      protein of all available influenza vaccines on the market, those who are eligible to receive
      the intranasal formulation (LAIV group) (ie age 2-49y, not asthmatic) will receive FluMist;
      others will receive the intramuscular injection in a single dose without skin testing (TIV
      group). All subjects will be monitored for 30 minutes post-vaccine for any signs/symptoms of
      an immediate allergic reaction. Subjects will also be followed-up by phone 24-48 hours after
      administration to assess for any delayed allergic reaction. Data will be collected for one
      entire Influenza season (2010-2011).
