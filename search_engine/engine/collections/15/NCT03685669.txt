      biomarkers that are highly prevalent in lung cancer. It is the first time to perform
      screening assay on healthy, lung nodule, and lung cancer tissues to identify preliminary set
      of highly prevalent methylation markers, and then refined these markers by removing regions
      were unstable in matched plasma samples. Next, investigators interrogated significant
      methylation marker regions enriched in lung nodules of training sample set to buildup a
      non-invasive biomarker classification model to discriminate cancerous nodules from benign
      lesions. Eventually, the model in patient lung nodule samples were validated.
