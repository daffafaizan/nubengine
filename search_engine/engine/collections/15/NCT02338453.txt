      clinic will be randomized into two groups (ABMT+CBGT; placebo control+CBGT). One group will
      undergo an Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) aimed at diverting attention away
      from socially-threatening stimuli. The second group will receive a placebo-control not
      designed to affect attention. Both groups will also undergo a standard Cognitive-Behavioral
      Group Treatment (CBGT) comprising 18 weekly sessions of 1.5-hr duration (along the lines of
      Heimberg, Juster, Hope & Mattia 1995 and Clark & Wells 1995). Symptoms and attention bias
      measures will be taken at three time points: Pre-treatment, Post-treatment,and at 3-month
      follow-up.

      The study includes the following steps: a) initial assessment of participants'
      psychopathology and symptom levels; b) attention bias measurement; c) 8 sessions of
      ABMT/placebo control delivered as part of the CBGT sessions; d) two booster ABMT/Placebo
      treatments will be delivered at sessions 13 and 16 of the CBGT protocol. e) post-treatment
      assessment will include symptom and attention bias assessments. Finally, f) a three-month
      follow up assessment.

      The goal of the study is to to test the effectiveness of ABMT as an add-on to established
      CBGT protocol for social anxiety disorder.
