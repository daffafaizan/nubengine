      reflecting the range in specific problems associated with feeding and nutrition in CP.

      The trunk plays an important role in the organization of postural control and balance
      reactions because it holds the centre of all body mass and holds therefore, the centre of
      gravity. The trunk also provides stable attachment points to those muscles that control the
      head and neck regions. "Neck and trunk stabilization exercises" were the basis of static and
      dynamic balance abilities, and that increased neck and trunk stability might have had a
      positive effect thereon.

      To achieve the alignment of the head with the trunk, the pelvis must be stabilized. This has
      important consequences for the entire process of swallowing. If the head is not stable, then
      the fine movements of the jaw and tongue needed for feeding will be impaired. With feeding
      and oral motor interventions and structured neck and trunk stabilization exercises, these
      parameters are positively affected.
