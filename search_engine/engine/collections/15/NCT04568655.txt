      patients.The severe Corona Virus Disease-19(COVID-19) patients are incline to respiratory
      failure.The NIV may reduce the intubtion rate.This research was taken to investigate the
      factor to the success of the noninvasive ventilation to the COVID-19 patients with
      respiratory failure.We wish to raise the success rate to COVID-19 patients with respiratory
      failure.More critically ill COVID-19 patients could avoid the intubtion.
