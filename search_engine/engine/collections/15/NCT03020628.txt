      To assess the immunogenicity, antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination
      inhibition(HI) assay from sera obtained at pre-vaccination and 28 days post-vaccination. To
      assess the safety, solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited
      adverse events for 28 days post-vaccination are assessed and reported. The serious adverse
      events are collected during 6 months post-vaccination.
