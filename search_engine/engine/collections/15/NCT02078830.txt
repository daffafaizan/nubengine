    
      Randomised, parallel group, single-centre Phase IV trial comparing the change in the quantity
      of microorganisms (CFU/cm2) after a time period of 5 days (primary endpoint) as surrogate
      marker for EVD-associated infections [1, 2], in patients undergoing EVD with dressing at the
      entry site with 3M™ Tegaderm™ CHG I.V. Securement Dressing (study arm) versus 3M™ Tegaderm™
      I.V. Advanced Dressing (standard arm). Secondary objectives are the comparison of regrowth
      (CFU/cm2) every 5th day before routine change of the device, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      cultures every 2nd day and sonication of the catheter tip after explantation (secondary
      endpoints).

      We hypothesize that bacterial contamination (CFU/cm2) of the EVD entry-site after 5 days
      compared to baseline (bacterial regrowth since baseline) in subjects treated with the 3M™
      Tegaderm™ CHG I.V. Securement Dressing is significantly lower compared to subjects treated
      with 3M™ Tegaderm™ I.V. Advanced Dressing. Quantitative microbiology of the catheter tip
      (sonication) might be reduced by this external intervention, as well as CSF cultures.

      We will use an internal pilot study design [3]. The three step procedure includes:

        -  initial sample size calculation

        -  sample size review

        -  final analysis.
