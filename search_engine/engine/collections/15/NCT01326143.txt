    
      OSAH is a common condition which occurs in between 1 and 4% of the adult population.
      Respiratory obstruction may be complete (apnea) or incomplete (hypopnea). This disorder
      disturbs the architecture and quality of sleep, and is a known risk factor in the development
      of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. CPAP is the standard treatment, however in some
      cases patients are unable to use it (rejection, intolerance, etc.). In such circumstances,
      treatment using a MRD may result in an improvement of symptoms.

      Very few long-term clinical data are available on treatment of OSAH by MRD. This study should
      allow to have a precise and representative vision of 5 years results of ORM Narval MRD
      treatment in conditions of good practices (titration, controls of efficacy).
