      at Healthpartners Regions Hospital. Potential participants were identified during routine
      obstetrical care of singleton pregnancies at Regions Hospital, at the time that cesarean
      section was decided as the route of delivery by patient and provider. Patients were excluded
      if the cesarean section was performed emergently. Randomization occurred in the operating
      room during preparation for cesarean section; nursing staff drew a computer generated
      allocation card from a stack placed within an envelope in the room. Patients assigned to the
      control group underwent cesarean section with standard surgical technique at the discretion
      of the attending surgeon. Patients assigned to the glove change group underwent cesarean
      section in which the surgical team - surgeon, assistant, and scrub nurse - replaced their
      outer surgical gloves with a new sterile pair of gloves prior to abdominal closure. Abdominal
      closure was considered to begin with closure of the peritoneum, if performed, otherwise with
      closure of the abdominal fascia.
