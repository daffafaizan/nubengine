      are without well matched donors. This type of therapy has been associated with poor outcomes
      in the past due to complications such as infection. The Jefferson 2 Step approach was
      designed to allow the infusion of an exact dose of tolerized lymphocytes in haploidentical
      transplant in order to allow for immune reconstitution post transplant to avoid infectious
      complications while still having acceptable rates of GVHD. In this approach, patients with
      high-risk hematological malignancies undergo 8 fractions of TBI (12 Gy) followed by an exact
      dose of donor lymphocytes. The phase I portion of the study determined the optimal dose of
      lymphocytes. Two days after receiving the donor lymphocytes, the patients receive 2 daily
      doses of cyclophosphamide. One day after receiving cyclophosphamide, the patients receive
      stem cell from their donor. Tacrolimus and mycophenylate mofetil are used as GVHD
      prophylaxis.
