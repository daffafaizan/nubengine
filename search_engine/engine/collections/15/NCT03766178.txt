      ranks sixth in the world. At present, the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer
      is mainly based on the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the
      failure of first-line treatment, there is no standard second-line treatment. The
      investigators designed a single-arm, open phase II clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody
      SHR-1210 combined with nimotuzumab as second-line therapy in patients with advanced cancerous
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
