      marrow cells of clonogenic chronic myelogenous leukemia tumor cells and repopulate the bone
      marrow with normal stem cells in patients treated with high-dose busulfan and
      cyclophosphamide followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation using marrow treated with
      c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. II. Determine the response rate, degree of
      hematopoietic reconstitution, overall survival, and relapse-free survival of patients treated
      with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo bone marrow harvest. The bone marrow is treated with c-myb
      antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and cryopreserved. A portion of the marrow is cryopreserved
      untreated in case of engraftment failure. Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on
      days -7 to -4 for a total of 16 doses. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
      days -3 and -2. Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients
      are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
