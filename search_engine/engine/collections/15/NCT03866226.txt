      of Medicine, will be recruited for EMBED enrollment. Participants will be asked to provide
      basic background information and to fill out the STOP-BANG evaluation form. Anxiety,
      depression, insomnia, sleep questionnaire and pain assessment scale for cuff inflation are
      used to assess characteristics of participants and their sleep quality. Before ABPM starts,
      office blood pressure of participants will be measured. Participants will undergo ABPM under
      standardized guidance. At the end of ABPM, participants will be asked to fill in sleep
      questionnaire and pain assessment scale for cuff inflation again. EMBED proposes to study
      whether ABPM affects sleep, as well as the relationship and influencing factors of sleep and
      ABPM results, and screening for people who are susceptible to ABPM testing. A better
      understanding of interaction between ABPM and sleep will help us further evaluate the
      accuracy of ABPM and more precisely control diurnal hypertension in the future.
