      without impairment of cognitive and psychomotor skills or prolonging recovery. Some studies
      demonstrated that melatonin decreases the amount of propofol required to produce an adequate
      depth of hypnosis at induction time

      The effects of the oral administration of melatonin on the dose of propofol sedation in
      participants undergoing loco-regional chronic subdural hematoma evacuation have not been
      documented before.

      The present study will be conducted to detect the efficacy of oral administration of
      melatonin on the reduction of the sedative dose of propofol in participants undergoing
      loco-regional chronic subdural hematoma evacuation.
