      syncope. This is because patients with vasovagal syncope often experience bradycardia at the
      time of their syncope. Unfortunately, pacemakers are often ineffective in preventing syncope.

      Classical cardiovascular hemodynamics would suggest that increasing the heart rate (HR; via
      pacemaker) should increase the cardiac output (CO). This is because:

      CO = HR x Stroke volume (SV).

      The assumption is that the SV is fixed during manipulation of the HR. However, this might not
      be the case. As the number of beats per minute (HR) increases, the cardiac cycle length (R-R
      interval [RRI]) shortens, as a function of simple math. This means that the time in cardiac
      systole shortens, and the time in cardiac diastole shortens. Since cardiac diastole is when
      the heart fills up with blood, faster HR can be associated with decreased cardiac filling
      times. This, in turn, could compromise the SV. However, there is a paucity of data as to what
      happens to SV and CO at different HR. Further, it is possible that these effects will be
      different when a person is lying down supine versus when a patient is upright (when stroke
      volume will be lower).

      The investigators will seek to determine the effects of different HR on both SV & CO. In
      order to safely manipulate the HR, they will study patients with permanent pacemakers in whom
      HR manipulation can be done in a safe and non-invasive manner.
