      persistent HPV infections and precancerous lesions compared to the healthy population. The
      HPV vaccine Gardasil has been found to be safe and efficacious in females aged 9 to 26 years.
      There are no data on the immunogenicity and safety of Gardasil in females with SLE. Immune
      dysfunction related to SLE itself and the immunosuppression secondary to treatment of SLE
      might prevent patients with SLE from developing an adequate immune response to the vaccine.
      Also, theoretically, the vaccine might induce a disease exacerbation or production of new
      autoantibodies.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of Gardasil and its
      effects on autoantibody profile in female SLE patients aged 9-26 years
