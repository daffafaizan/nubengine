      on social functioning and independent living. To reduce the incidence of cognitive deficits
      in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), treatments that prevent or delay dementia are needed. The
      main objective of STRENGTH Project, is the assessment of the effects of a comprehensive
      intervention in 300 subjects with MCI, finalized to improve functional, biochemical,
      cognitive outcomes and psycho-social aspects. The study uses a multidisciplinary approach,
      has a 3-year duration, and includes 3 follow-up phases. Participants will be assigned to: a)
      Experimental group, which will undergo a multimodal intervention for improving cognitive
      outcomes, functional status and mobility. Treatment will include sessions of Adapted tango,
      music therapy, engagement in social activities, comprehensive cognitive intervention and
      psycho-education for 6 months; or b) Control group, which will receive psycho-education and
      advice on healthy life-style for 6 months. Cognitive and psycho-social outcomes, functional,
      cardiovascular status, life-style characteristics, biochemical determination, will be
      evaluated at baseline and longitudinally. Our hypothesis is based on expectation that the
      proposed could improve cognitive, functional outcomes and quality of life, with a positive
      impact on prevention of onset of dementia and cognitive decline in MCI subjects.
