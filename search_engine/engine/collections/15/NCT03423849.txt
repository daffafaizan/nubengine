      with effective first-line salvage therapy. After inorelbine and gemcitabine (NG) or
      vinorelbine and platinum (NP) regiments for 6 cycles, patients will be assess the effect of
      treatment. As for the patients with complete response (CR), partly response (PR) and stable
      disease(SD), the investigators will randomly assign them to receive 3 cycles of original
      regiment, or 6 cycles of vinorelbine, or 6 cycles of capecitabine. Trasuzumab will be used to
      patients if HER-2 positive. Endocrine therapy will be used if the hormone receptors positive
      after the chemotherapy. The effectiveness of therapy will be estimated after the maintain
      therapy. The first two years the patient was prescribed every 3 months to review the disease,
      then review the disease every six months. The primary endpoint is to assess disease-free
      survival (DFS), the secondary endpoint is to assess the overall survival (OS).
