      lung transplant patients has been shown to have significant side effects, for which
      alternatives are being sought to reduce their use. The monitoring of cell immunity against
      CMV could be an alternative as it has shown to be useful in identifying transplant patients
      at low risk of infection, who could benefit from shorter prophylaxis. The aim of the CYTOCOR
      study is to demonstrate that the combination of a reduced prophylaxis strategy with
      subsequent CMV-specific immunological monitoring would allow CMV infection to be controlled
      in lung transplant patients as effectively as the usual strategy (prophylaxis followed by
      pre-emptive therapy), while reducing the side effects of antivirals due to the shorter
      duration of prophylaxis.
