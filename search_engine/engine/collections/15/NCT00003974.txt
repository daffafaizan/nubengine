      activity associated with skin testing and vaccination with autologous lung tumor associated
      antigen and detoxPC in patients with curatively resected stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) or stage I or II mesothelioma. II. Evaluate any responses associated with
      an enhanced antitumor immune status in this patient population with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo delayed type hypersensitivity skin testing with autologous tumor
      associated antigen (TAA) and memory antigens (i.e., Monilia, PPD, and Trichophyton)
      intradermally at 1-4 weeks following surgical tumor resection. At week 4-9, patients receive
      low dose cyclophosphamide IV once. At 3 days following chemotherapy, patients receive
      autologous TAA with DetoxPC intradermally for up to 3 doses over 4 weeks. At 2-3 weeks
      following vaccination, patients undergo repeat skin testing. At week 6-12, patients with a
      positive skin test undergo biopsy of the skin test/vaccination site followed by leukapheresis
      at week 12-20 if T cells exhibit active antitumor reactivity. Patients with stable or
      regressive disease receive additional vaccination courses at week 20 and thereafter. Patients
      are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
