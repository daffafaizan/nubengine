      multimodal general anesthesia using target specific sedative and analgesics could result in
      enhanced recovery after anesthesia and surgery, decrease in postoperative delirium, and
      decrease in long term postoperative cognitive dysfunction up to 6 months following cardiac
      surgery.

      Specific Aim 1: The feasibility of implementing multimodal general anesthesia strategy in the
      Operating Rooms (OR) Specific Aim 2: The feasibility of implementing EEG guided sedation
      until extubation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Specific Aim 3: The enhancement of recovery
      after surgery (shorter ventilation time, ICU stay, hospital length of stay) Specific Aim 4:
      To estimate the effect size of decrease in postoperative day (POD) and postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) to power future large randomized trials
