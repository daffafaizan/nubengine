    
      This is a multicenter, double blinded, randomized controlled trial, comparing Elevate® System
      with Interpro® Lite™, Anterior and Apical Prolapse Repair System (American Medical Systems)
      and Anterior Colporrhaphy (anterior suture repair) in women with symptomatic pelvic organ
      prolapse, who have opted to have surgical repair.

      The goals of the study are to compare both efficacy and safety of the two procedures and to
      compare the surgical impact of mesh and suture repairs on vaginal function.

      The principal investigator is from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Mayo Clinic will
      serve as the data gathering and coordination site for this multicenter trial.
