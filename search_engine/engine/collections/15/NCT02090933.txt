      I. Quantify changes in the erythema response in human subjects exposed to a range of
      erythemic doses of solar-simulated ultraviolet light before and after celecoxib treatment.

      II. Collect blood for genetic analysis of markers likely to modulate erythema response. This
      includes cyclooxygenase (COX), prostaglandin receptor, P53 and excision-repair polymorphisms.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation to the right buttock at baseline, receive
      celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 10 days, and then undergo UV-irradiation to the
      left buttock. Chromameter readings are obtained 24 hours post UV-irradiation.
