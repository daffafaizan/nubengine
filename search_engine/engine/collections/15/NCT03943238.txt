      and recipient immune cells can lead to tolerance to the graft in absence of graft versus host
      disease (GVHD). The goal of this pilot study is to determine if recipients of living donor
      kidney transplant can be successfully withdraw from immunosuppressive drugs. The patients
      will receive a preparatory regimen consisting of TLI and ATG following their kidney
      transplantation. Two weeks later, they will receive purified hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+)
      and Tcells that have been collected 6 weeks prior from their kidney donor. Regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) that have been collected from the recipient prior to the transplantation and expanded
      in vitro will be infuse the following day to enhance the chance of engraftment of the donor
      bone marrow cells. If chimerism develops and persists, the immunosuppressive drug will be
      tapered and stop. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will be stopped 12 months after transplantation
      and if the chimerism remains stable, tacrolimus will be stopped 6 months later. The dose of
      Tregs will be escalated if the % of donor chimerism is not at least 25% during the first 60
      days.
