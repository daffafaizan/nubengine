    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the expression of immunoregulatory proteins including CD4, FOXP3 and CD276
           in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

        -  To correlate the expression of these proteins with the levels of anaplastic lymphoma
           kinase (ALK) autoantibodies in patient of ANHL0131.

      OUTLINE: Archived tissue microarray samples are analyzed by mass spectrometry and validated
      by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and IHC.
