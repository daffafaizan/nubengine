    
      This is a protocol for a multi-center quasi-randomized controlled trial to compare an
      intervention group receiving a prenatal care app, to a control group receiving usual care.
      The trial is being conducted at two diverse outpatient obstetric practices that are part of a
      single academic department of obstetrics in Washington, DC. Women who are between 18 and 40,
      who are visiting their OB for a first trimester routine visit, who have a confirmed desired
      pregnancy, who are not considered "high-risk," and who have an IOS, Android or Windows-based
      smart phone that they use regularly will be eligible for enrollment. The Investigators will
      measure the effect of a mobile app for prenatal care on:

        1. the number of in-person OB visits during pregnancy;

        2. patient satisfaction with prenatal care;

        3. gestational weight gain;

        4. maternal and fetal outcomes; and

        5. clinician satisfaction.

      To capture these outcomes, the investigators will administer patient surveys via telephone
      every 4 weeks during gestation and the immediate post-partum period, review the electronic
      medical record, and conduct in-depth interviews with a representative subset of patients
      after delivery.
