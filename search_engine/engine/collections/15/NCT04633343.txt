      cardiac output in patients with Fontan circulation the information can be used to learn from
      this study to optimize the tidal volume ventilation, and therefore pulmonary blood flow and
      cardiac output when Fontan patients come for general anesthesia. This is important because
      the population of patients with Fontan circulation is increasing and an increasing number
      will present for cardiac and non cardiac surgery when positive pressure ventilation will be
      required. They may also spend time on the cardiac intensive care unit on a ventilator and
      improving our knowledge on how best to ventilate them may help improve their overall hospital
      outcomes.
