      determine facilitators and barriers to fidelity, assess feasibility of data acquisition,
      determine preliminary efficacy, and refine the IPFAC model through a small-scale
      implementation study and Plan-Do-Study-Act methods (Phase II), and, 3) Evaluate the revised
      IPFAC model in a small-scale study using state-of-the-art single-case study design
      methods/analyses to test "treatment mechanisms" in a sample of newly diagnosed youth with
      ADHD (Phase III) and finalize the IPFAC procedural manual.
