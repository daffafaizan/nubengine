    
      The 450 patients meeting the entry criteria are divided into 6 groups, the clinical trial
      procedure is divided into 3 parts, according to the following steps:

      Part1 (0-12W):

        1. The research objects will be grouped according to the principle of a multicenter,
           randomized, open, parallel controlled clinical trial, 300 cases of cell therapy groups
           (100 cases with PEG-IFN treatment, LdT treatment for 100 cases, ETV treatment for 100
           cases), 150 cases of control groups (PEG-IFN therapy in 50 cases, LdT therapy for 50
           cases, ETV treatment for 50 cases).

           Part2 (12-36W):

        2. Cell therapy groups: enter the HBsAg sensitized dendritic cells activated T cells (HBsAg
           Pulse DCs-T, HPDCs-T) immune therapy combined with interferon (IFN) or nucleoside
           analogues treatment (NAs), infusion of HPDC-T every 2 weeks for 1 time, total 12 times.

        3. Control groups: antiviral therapy used only (IFN or NAs).

           Part3 (36-72W):

        4. The observation stage: discontinuation of interferon in the treatment of 48 weeks; NAs
           cases will continue on treatment with NAs.

      HPDCs-T produced procedure:

      The first step: 1-7 days Monocytes will be isolated from peripheral blood of patients. The
      monocytes obtained will be then incubated in fresh serum-free AIM-V medium (Gibco) containing
      800U/ml of GM-CSF and 400U/ml of IL-4 (Peprotech) for 5 days. After 5 days of culture in
      vitro, The DCs induced will be cultured with a commercially available hepatitis B vaccine
      containing 10 ug of HBsAg (GSK) for 2 days.

      The second step: 8-14 days The hepatitis B vaccine sensitized DCs (HPDCs) (from the first
      step) will be sub-cultured with patient's own PBMCs for 7 days: HBsAg can be efficiently
      presented to PBMCs by DCs, with producing HBV specific CTLs and HTLs (HPDCs-T).

      The third step: 15 days The PBMCs (the second step) containing enough HPDCs-T will be
      transfused back into the patient.
