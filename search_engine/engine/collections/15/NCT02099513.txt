      surveys, and biological variables including blood pressure, weight, and blood glucose from
      electronic medical records. Over a period of 1 month, participants will be asked to track and
      collect daily data on weight using the iHealth wireless scale. Participants will also collect
      blood pressure (BP), pO2, and pulse using the iHealth blood pressure device. Physical
      activity and sleep activity will be measured using the fitbit device. Participants will
      receive evidence-based daily nutrition and exercise weight loss messages via text messages.

      Following the one-month observation participants will be asked to complete a follow-up survey
      on acceptance and use of technology and to undergo a post-formative semi-structure telephone
      interview to discuss their perception of the usefulness and attitudes toward the platform,
      technical difficulties and barriers, and recommendations for future development.
