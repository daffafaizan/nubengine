      data collection study with the N-Tidal C Data Collector Device in patients with COPD.

      Patients will be identified from the Cambridge COPD Centre. This unit sees patients following
      emergency admissions, GP referrals and has a regional referral base for complex COPD.
      Patients' medical records will be reviewed and classified according to GOLD criteria. Those
      patients who are classified as COPD with appropriate inclusion criteria (below) will be
      invited to participate. Patients who give informed consent will be screened for the study.

      The N-Tidal C Data Collector Device will be explained to the patients and they will be
      trained how to use it. All patients will complete a short daily diary record.

      Patients will undergo a clinical assessment of COPD during screening at Addenbrooke's
      Hospital. All patients will be assessed five times: at the start, 2 weeks, 10 weeks, 18 weeks
      and at the end of the 26 week study period. A brief follow-up telephone review will be
      conducted approximately 2 weeks after the end of the monitoring period. At each assessment,
      capnometry measurements will be taken in addition to vital signs and pulse oximetry. The
      study will not interfere with routine management of the patient's condition.
