    
      Patients 18-75 years old, ASA (physical status classification system) I-III, scheduled for
      elective posterior spinal fusion surgery were enrolled in this prospective study. After
      induction in anesthesia, it was applied SSEP monitoring and a baseline test was performed
      after 15min (in order to wash out the propofol used for induction). Infusion of
      Dexmedetomidine was started at a bolus dose of 1mcg/Kg following by 0.7mcg/Kg. Bispectral
      Index (BIS) monitored the depth of anesthesia and an adequate level (40-50) of anesthesia was
      maintained by sevoflurane. SSEP were recorded intraoperatively from the tibial nerve (P37)
      and data were analyzed over that period.
