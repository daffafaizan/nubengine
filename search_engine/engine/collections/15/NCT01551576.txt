      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess PAI-performance in a clinical setting
      to understand limitations of our current PAI instrumentation and to help improve the
      next-generation design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

      To do preliminary evaluations of oxygen saturation in lesions based on PAI-measurements in
      order to distinguish malignant from benign prostatic tissue as a basis for future studies.
