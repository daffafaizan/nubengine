      Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes(Z-CTLs) in patients with relapsed or refractory NSCLC.
      Z-CTLs therapy is a novel immunotherapy under investigation in which patients have their
      T-cells (a type of white blood cell) collected and modified in the laboratory, before they
      are given back to the patient. The T-cells are modified to transform the intracellular signal
      domain of PD-1 and CTLA-4 to immune activation stimulus signal and transform T cells to a new
      kind of cancer-killer cells: zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Z-CTls).
