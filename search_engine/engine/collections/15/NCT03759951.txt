    
      This controlled, randomized, four-group, repeated-measures clinical trial will be consisted
      of the following stages:

        1. Initial testing: body weight and height, RMR, daily physical activity (PA), daily
           nutritional intake.

        2. a 4-week adaptive period: based on a dietary analysis, participants will be given a
           dietary plan (considering the RMR and total daily physical activity related energy
           expenditure), providing an isocaloric diet over the initial 4-week adaptive period.
           During this adaptive period, volunteers will also be familiarized with exercises
           techniques and overload patterns that will be used throughout the study through 4
           preparatory sessions.

        3. At the end of the adaptation period, participants will participate in assessment
           procedures (baseline testing) at University facilities.

        4. After the adaptive period all participants will be randomly assigned to four groups
           (control, 1 session/week, 2 sessions/week, 3 sessions/week). The exercise protocols that
           will be used throughout the 1-year intervention will be consisted of 8-12 neuromotor
           exercises in circuit fashion applying prescribed time (15-45 sec) of effort and passive
           recovery intervals.

        5. After 12 months of exercise intervention all participants will participate in assessment
           procedures (post-training testing) at University facilities within 5 days after the
           completion of the last training session.

      All participants will be randomly assigned to the following four groups:

        1. Control group (no training)

        2. DoIT-1 (1 session/week)

        3. DoIT-2 (2 sessions/week)

        4. DoIT-3 (3 sessions/week)
