      nerve activity (MSNA), which is important for blood pressure regulation. The measurement of
      MSNA is safely performed in humans using the microneurographic technique that involves
      recording sympathetic nerve activity projecting to skeletal muscle using a small
      microelectrode at the peroneal nerve near the knee.

      The health of your blood vessels will be tested in this study, in addition to the activity of
      the nerves that control the blood vessels. The function of the nerves and blood vessels can
      be diminished by high blood glucose and lipids, and we will test the ability of a well-known
      antioxidant, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), to restore the function of the nerves and blood
      vessels.
