      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical response of ST266 treated subjects
      with persistent corneal epithelial defects during 28 days of therapy. The secondary endpoint
      is the response rate within 14 days of treatment. Failures are subjects that do not
      completely heal during 28 days of therapy. The epithelial defect can be of any size as long
      as it is measurable by slit lamp. The longest measurement and the measurement perpendicular
      to that will be determined and the area calculated. The change in area and perimeter of
      epithelial defect from baseline through Day 15 (14 days of treatment) and Day 29 (28 days of
      treatment) will be calculated for each subject. The time to complete re-epithelialization is
      defined as the time from the start of therapy (Baseline Visit/Day 1) to the Day when no
      defect is observed. The number and percent of responders and failures will be summarized at
      each visit. Graphical representation of percent of responders and failures will be provided.
      The change in area and perimeter of epithelial defect from baseline through Day 15 (14 days
      of treatment) and Day 29 (28 days of treatment) will be summarized. Visualization of mean
      (Standard Deviation) of the change in area and perimeter will be provided at each time point.
      The time to complete re-epithelialization will be summarized and listed.

      Safety:

      Subject demographics, baseline characteristics and relevant medical history will be
      summarized and listed. Data for ST266 administration and concomitant therapies will be
      listed.

      The number and percent of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events and ST266 related
      adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred terms.
