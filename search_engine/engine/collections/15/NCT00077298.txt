      I. Evaluate time to tumor progression in patients with irinotecan-refractory metastatic
      colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab and cetuximab with or without irinotecan.

      II. Evaluate objective response rate in patients treated with these regimens. III. Evaluate
      overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. IV. Evaluate safety, tolerability,
      and adverse event profiles of these regimens in these patients.

      V. Correlate a panel of molecular markers (e.g., those involved in the epidermal growth
      factor receptor signaling pathway, angiogenic pathway, and irinotecan metabolism) with
      clinical outcome in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), and albumin (> 3.0 g/dL vs â‰¤ 3.0
      g/dL). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36;
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1*, 15, and 29 OR on days 1 and 22; and irinotecan
      IV over 30-90 minutes (at the same dose and schedule that the patient previously received)
      beginning on day 1.

      ARM B: Patients receive cetuximab as in Arm A and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days
      1*, 15, and 29.

      NOTE: *Bevacizumab is given on day 2 (instead of day 1) of course 1, and is given on day 1 of
      subsequent courses.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 3 years.
