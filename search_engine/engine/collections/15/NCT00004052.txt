        -  Determine the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent tumor-specific breakpoint
           peptide vaccine in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine the antileukemic effects of vaccination with these peptides in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bcr/abl breakpoint peptide vaccine in QS21 adjuvant subcutaneously
      at rotated sites every 1-3 weeks (on or about days 0, 7, 21, 35, and 56) over 8 weeks.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      demonstrating a response by week 10 may receive 3 additional monthly vaccinations initiated
      within 8 weeks of the fifth dose. Patients demonstrating a response by vaccination 8 may
      receive 3 additional vaccinations administered at two-month intervals.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
