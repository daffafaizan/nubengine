      induced dermabrasion wounds. To qualify for this study, subjects must meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria within the protocol-specified parameters at both the screening
      and baseline visits. Once a subject is qualified, five dermabrasion wounds will be created on
      each subject's back by a licensed physician. Four of the wounds will be covered with four
      different commercially-available bandages and one wound will be left open to the air to serve
      as a no treatment control. Treatments and control will be randomized to application site.
      During this 14-day clinical study, subjects will return to the site for daily evaluations;
      study bandages will also be replaced daily by study personnel. Adverse events will be
      observed and collected by querying each subject at each visit, and during any follow-up
      period.
