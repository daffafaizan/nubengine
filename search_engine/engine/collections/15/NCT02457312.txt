      recruited for this study. They will be randomized to receive either placebo tablets or
      letrozole 10 mg daily for 7 days before suction evacuation. Suction evacuates which include
      the placenta and some decidua collected by the procedure in these 20 subjects will be used
      for the laboratory studies.
