      radiographically node negative) will receive sorafenib alone in escalating doses for at least
      1 week prior to the start of conventional treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy
      (RT-CT). High risk patients (tumor > 5 cm or node positive) will receive sorafenib alone in
      escalating dose for at least 1 week prior to the start of RT-CT, as well as concurrently with
      RT-CT. Cohorts of 3 patients per dose level are planned. If 1/3 patients encounters a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If >2/3 of
      patients encounter a DLT, then that dose level will be declared as the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). An additional 3 patients will be entered into the dose level one below the MTD. The
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is defined as the dose level with < 1/6 patients with DLT.

      For the phase II component, all patients will receive sorafenib at the RPTD for at least 1
      week prior to, and concurrent with, RT-CT.
