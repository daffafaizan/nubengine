      administrated intrathecally because they have direct access to spinal cord opioid receptors.
      Drug administered epidurally or caudally are required in much higher doses because they must
      first diffuse into the CSF before they reach spinal opioid receptors. As a result, the
      duration of action of intrathecal morphine is greater than that of single shot peridural
      techniques.

      To investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal morphine in post operative pain relief
      in pediatric patients undergoing major abdominal cancer surgeries using different doses of
      intrathecal morphine (2 μg/kg , 5 μg/kg ,10μg/kg).
