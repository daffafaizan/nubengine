      I. To develop and evaluate quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI analysis
      techniques that minimize patient- and scanner-specific variabilities in the calculation of
      quantitative parameters.

      II. To develop and evaluate diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) methods that reduce prostate
      geometric distortion due to patient- and scanner-specific susceptibility and eddy current
      effects.

      III. To develop and evaluate multi-class deep learning models that systematically integrate
      quantitative multi-parametric (mp)-MRI features for accurate detection and classification of
      clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).

      OUTLINE:

      RETROSPECTIVE: Patients' medical records are reviewed.

      PROSPECTIVE: Patients undergo additional 3 Tesla (T) MRI imaging over 30 minutes before,
      during, or after their standard of care 3T MRI for a total of 1.5 hours.
