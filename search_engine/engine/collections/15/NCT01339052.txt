    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Cohort 1

      Primary Objectives

        -  Evaluate PI3K pathway modulation due to BKM120 in tumor tissue

        -  Evaluate BKM120 concentration in tumor tissue, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Evaluate effects of BKM120 on tumor cell proliferation and tumor cell death

        -  Investigate the safety profile of BKM120 in this population

        -  Investigate pharmacokinetics of BKM120 in this population

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  Correlate FDG-PET and FLT-PET with pharmacodynamic effects and 6-month progressive-free
           survival (PFS6)

        -  Determine the effects of BKM120 on primary GBM cell lines derived from participants and
           correlate with participant benefit from BKM120 treatment

      Cohort 2

      Primary Objective

        -  Investigate the treatment efficacy as measured by 6-month progressive-free survival
           (PFS6)

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Investigate the radiographic response, progression free survival, overall survival

        -  Investigate the safety profile efficacy of BKM120 in this population

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  Correlate benefit from BKM120 treatment with molecular genotype of tumor (using
           immunohistochemistry, mutation analysis and RNA expression profiling), and whole blood
           proteomics

        -  Correlate benefit from BKM120 treatment with circulating angiogenic biomarkers

        -  Utilize advance MRI (perfusion, permeability, diffusion imaging) to determine the
           effects of BKM120 on tumor vasculature and to correlate with benefit from BKM120
           treatment

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      Cohort 1

      The primary endpoint for Cohort 1 is modulation of PI3 kinase pathway based on change in
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring for pAKT. Modulation in scoring as measured by reduction
      of staining intensity score of one degree or more was reported as a positive response to
      drug. This portion of the trial would be considered a success if 9 or more participants of 15
      participants showed a response. There was a 94% chance of this occurring if the true response
      rate was 75% and only a 10% chance of this occurring if the true response rate was 40%.

      Cohort 2

      The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is the proportion of participants progression free at 6
      months (PFS6). Historical comparison data suggest that ineffective therapies in recurrent GBM
      have a PFS6 rate of approximately 9-16% (Wong 1999; Lamborn 2008). This trial was sized to
      differentiate between a 15% versus a 32% PFS6. With a total sample size of 50 participants,
      this design yields at least 90% power with a one sided alpha < 0.1 to detect a true PFS6 rate
      of at least 32%. If the number of successes was â‰¥ 12, the therapy would be considered worthy
      of further study.
