      and what changes are unique to ALS and are different from those found in healthy volunteers
      and volunteers with neurological diseases other than ALS. These changes are called
      biomarkers. Biomarkers for ALS have been found in blood collected in earlier phases of this
      study. Biomarkers are non-genetic elements in your blood that may help to make diagnosing ALS
      easier. In the next phase, comparison of these changes in the blood of volunteers with ALS
      and without ALS will be used to confirm these biomarkers and to develop a tool to diagnose
      and monitor progression of ALS.
