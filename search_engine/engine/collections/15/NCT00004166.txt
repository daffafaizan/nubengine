      have significantly fewer neurologic events when treated with amifostine. II. Compare
      amifostine vs no chemoprotection in terms of overall incidence of neuropathy, incidence of
      neutropenia, infection, and other myelosuppressive events (e.g., leukopenia, anemia, and
      thrombocytopenia), length of hospital stay due to infections, and quality of life in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel, controlled, double blind study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive amifostine IV over 10
      minutes, 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Arm II: Patients receive a placebo IV over 10
      minutes, 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 8 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed
      prior to courses 1, 4, and 8, and then every 3 months for 1 year. Patients are followed
      monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
