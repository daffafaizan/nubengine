      nerve reflex which is defined as a sudden, violent adductor muscle spasm when the obturator
      nerve is stimulated directly by the electronic resector during transurethral resection of the
      tumor on the lateral bladder wall. Studies showed Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to local
      anesthetic prolongs peripheral nerve block duration without any nerve toxicity. In the
      following randomized, non-crossover study, the investigators test if Dexmedetomidine as an
      adjuvant can decrease the median effective concentration(EC50) of lidocaine for obturator
      nerve block during transurethral resection of bladder tumor.
