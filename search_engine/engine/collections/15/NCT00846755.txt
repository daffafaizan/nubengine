      miscarriage, preterm delivery, postpartum thyroiditis and decreased IQ in the offspring.
      Whether or not all women should be screened for thyroid disease during pregnancy (Universal
      Screening), screening should be confined to women at high risk for thyroid disease (Case
      Finding), or no screening should occur is controversial. For this purpose, pregnant women in
      the first trimester are randomly assigned to the Screening group or Case finding group. All
      women in the Screening group and high-risk women in the Case Finding group are immediately
      tested for FT4, TSH and TPO antibodies. Low-risk women in the Case Finding group have their
      sera tested postpartum. levothyroxine or PTU are given in hypothyroid and hyperthyroid women
      respectively. Outcome Measure: total number of adverse events occurring during pregnancy and
      in the neonatal period controlling for clustering of outcomes within women.
