      with BFR and physical therapy without BFR on the ACL graft maturation following
      reconstruction surgery. BFR therapy will begin as early as 2 weeks after surgery. The initial
      2 weeks after surgery, or prior to initiation of BFR, will consist of the physical therapy
      following the surgeon's postoperative protocol.

      To be considered for participation in this study, patients must be 18 years and older
      undergoing primary ACL reconstruction. In addition, patients must meet several
      inclusion/exclusion criteria to be randomized and included in this study.
