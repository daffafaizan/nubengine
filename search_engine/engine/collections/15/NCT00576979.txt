      IMRT, using helical tomotherapy when given in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide
      and VP-16 as a preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or unrelated donor in patients
      with ALL or AML with induction failure or in relapse. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicity
      at each dose level standard. (Phase I) III. To collect data on the radiation dose to normal
      organs and bone marrow using tomotherapy targeted total-body irradiation (TBI). (Phase I) IV.
      To estimate the overall survival probability, disease free survival probability and relapse
      rate associated with this regimen. (Phase II) V. To characterize the treatment related
      mortality and toxicity profile (early/late) associated with this regimen. (Phase II) VI. To
      descriptively compare the outcomes of patients treated on this protocol to a comparable
      patient population conditioned with whole body radiation. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) followed by a phase II study.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients undergo IMRT using helical tomotherapy once or twice daily on
      days -10 to -6 or -10 to -7. Patients also receive etoposide intravenously (IV) on day -6 or
      -5 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -4 or -3.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow
      transplantation on day -1 or day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
