      smartphone application ( camera of the smartphone will be obstructed by the patient's right
      index) and the values measured by reference method used (the oscillometric brachial cuff).

      All patients admitted to the emergency department at Erasme Hospital Brussels, Belgium during
      5 consecutive weeks will be recruited and their pressure will be measured with both
      mesurement methods. (novel smartphone application versus upper arm cuff oscillometry).

      The OptiBP Application is a mobile application installed on a smartphone which is a
      non-invasive data-logger intended to acquire physiological data from patients. By applying
      the patient's finger on a smartphone's camera, a movie is generated and transformed into
      values of diastolic, mean and systolic blood pressure (+ heart rate), as well as patient's
      heart rate.

      After having compared that the blood pressure in both arms are similar ( maximum of 10 mmHg
      of blood pressure difference between both arms), three measures will be taken (spaced by one
      minute) with both methods after a period of 3 minutes of rest (supine position).

      The patient's blood pressure will be measured in parallel with the mobile application and
      with the reference equipment (the oscillometric brachial cuff).

      Then, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm the reliability of
      the data obtained with the novel mobile application.

      The goal is therefore to compare blood pressure values as obtained by the analysis of the
      data recorded by the OptiBP Mobile Application, against simultaneous measurements provided by
      the oscillometric brachial cuff
