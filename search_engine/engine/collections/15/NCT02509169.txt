      stage, concomitant intra- and extra-liver diseases, and resistance to both chemo- and
      radio-therapy. Trans-catheter embolization (TAE) is a safe locoregional treatment for
      advanced HCC and p53 gene has multiple anticancer functions, and both methods do not have
      immune-inhibitory effects as chemo- or radio-therapy. The objectives of this study are to
      investigate clinical efficacy and immunoreaction usingTAE plus recombinant adenoviral human
      p53 gene (rAd-p53) in treatment of advanced HCC.
