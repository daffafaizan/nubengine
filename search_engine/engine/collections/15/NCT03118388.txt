      interventions, this study compares the efficacy and short-term outcomes of two interventions
      that combine employment and clinical services with homeless youth experiencing mental
      illness. The Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) is a research-supported intervention using
      a group approach that engages homeless youth in paid employment as well as case-management
      and mental health services through involvement in an agency-run social enterprise. The
      Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment is an individually
      focused, evidence-based intervention , which provides individuals with severe mental illness
      with customized, long-term, and integrated vocational, case-management, and clinical services
      to help them gain and maintain competitive employment.

      A randomized comparative efficacy trial of the short-term, nonvocational outcomes
      (depression, self-esteem, social support, housing stability) of the SEI and IPS was conducted
      over 20 months with 72 homeless youth at a homeless youth drop-in center in Los Angeles. This
      study answered two research questions: 1) Do homeless youth with mental illness participating
      in an employment intervention integrated with clinical services (SEI or IPS) experience
      improvements in their a) mental health status (self-esteem and depression); b) housing
      stability, and c) social support; and 2) What are the differences between the SEI and IPS
      groups on mental health, housing stability, and social support outcomes between baseline and
      follow-up?
