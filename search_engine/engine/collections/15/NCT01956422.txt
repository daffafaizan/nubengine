      the general anesthesia, the need for pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position may have
      detrimental effects on both pulmonary volumes and mechanics, and they may increase the risk
      of postoperative respiratory failure (PORF). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      improves oxygenation and reduces the rate of re-intubation in the presence of PORF.

      The aim of our study is to investigate postoperative respiratory function and the likely
      benefits of the use of CPAP, compared with Venturi mask in terms of prevention of
      post-operative hypoxaemia and worsening of lung spirometry.

      CPAP is delivered with "CASTAR" Helmet by StarMed.
