      interventions in 4 hours intervals, and a 30 min wash out period to change the breathing
      support and stabilization at the beginning of both interventions. Initially positive end
      expiratory pressure are set to 5 cm H2O and can be adjusted up to 7 cm H2O if needed decided
      by the medical team for both interventions. The neurally adjusted level will be set to obtain
      average Edi peak < 15 microvolt. Back-up setting and apnea time in the ventilator assist
      intervention (NIV NAVA) will be individualized according to clinical parameters in each
      preterm infant.
