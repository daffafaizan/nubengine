      lifestyle and overly rich nutrition are predominant in Western societies and result in
      obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to the WHO an escalating
      global epidemic of overweight and obesity is sweeping the globe and the prevalence of type 2
      diabetes mellitus rises in parallel at the same alarming rate. It is likely that inherited
      insulin resistance relates to subtle mutations in many metabolic genes. It is still unclear
      whether such abnormalities lead to different proteomic patterns in target tissues (muscle and
      fat) and how intracellular hormone signaling is affected. Some patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus have severe insulin resistance with insulin requirements of more than 100 units/day
      and are still not optimally controlled. Our aim of this study is to examine the mechanisms
      behind severe insulin resistance and to elucidate how intracellular hormone signaling is
      affected, especially in relation to proteomics. Moreover we wish to determine the dose
      response to insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with severe insulin resistance
      in order to see if there is a measurable effect on blood glucose at high insulin doses.
