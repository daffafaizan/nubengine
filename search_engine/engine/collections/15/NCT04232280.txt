    
      mRNA-1647-P202 is a 2-part study. Part 1 of the study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity
      of low, medium, and high dose levels of mRNA-1647 vaccine or placebo, administered on a 0, 2,
      6-month schedule in healthy CMV-seronegative and CMV-seropositive males and females, 18 to 40
      years of age. A planned interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity through Month 3 (1
      month after the second dose) of Part 1 of the study informed the selection of the middle dose
      level for further development. Part 2 of the study is designed to further evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of the middle dose level of mRNA-1647 vaccine or placebo on a 0, 2,
      6-month schedule in approximately 200 healthy participants 18 to 40 years of age, comprised
      of CMV-seronegative and CMV-seropositive female population, which includes the target
      population for the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial.
