      the neurophysiological biomarkers of epilepsy and developmental disability in children and
      young adults with Dravet Syndrome.

      Mechanistically, the features of the DS phenotype are attributable to a loss of cortical
      inhibition. TMS is a non-invasive form of focal cortical stimulation in which an external
      powerful magnet induces an electrical field intracranially over the stimulated region that is
      used to interrogate or modulate states of cortical excitation or inhibition.

      Accordingly, the investigators propose to test whether metrics of cortical excitability and
      inhibition can be obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and EEG in patients
      with DS.
