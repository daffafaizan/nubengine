      lifestyle modifying education will reduce mortality, morbidity and improve quality of life in
      patients following myocardial infarction, angioplasty or, coronary artery bypass. However,
      less than 20% of eligible patients participate in CR programs. This study will look at a
      method of potentially improving enrollment and adherence to a CR program. It is expected that
      patients who receive the MD-endorsed referral will be more likely to attend the initial
      Orientation appointment and more closely adhere to the 6-month comprehensive CR program, as
      compared to the patients who receive a standard CR referral alone.
