      bone marrow toxicity is a frequent adverse effect. Also, HIV resistance to AZT sometimes
      occurs in patients who initially respond to treatment, but later have progression of the
      disease. Thus, new drug treatments are needed. Studies of ddI in adults and children indicate
      some effectiveness of the drug. A direct comparison of AZT and ddI treatment in children has
      not been made. Combination antiviral treatment (AZT plus ddI) may give added therapeutic
      benefit to children.

      Patients are placed by random selection into one of three groups to receive either AZT alone,
      ddI alone, or AZT and ddI. This is a double-blind study: neither patient nor treating
      physician knows which group patient is in. If patients are receiving either AZT or ddI alone
      and they develop drug toxicity (after dose reduction), or if HIV disease progresses, the
      alternative single drug is offered. If patients receiving both drugs develop drug toxicity
      (despite dose reduction) or if HIV disease progresses, they discontinue study drug and are
      offered the best alternative therapy. PER AMENDMENT 6/26/95: Initial monotherapy AZT arm is
      unblinded and no further crossover therapy for any arm is permitted. Patients who reach
      crossover criteria on initial blinded ddI or AZT+ddI will be unblinded and permanently
      discontinued from study drugs.
