      To evaluate changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) in patients with androgen independent
      prostate cancer who are treated with Sandostatin LAR.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the effects of Sandostatin LAR on circulating levels of Insulin Growth Factor-1
      and Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 1.

      To evaluate the safety of Sandostatin LAR in this patient population. To evaluate the pre
      versus post treatment mitogenic effects of serum derived from subjects with prostate cancer
      compared to pretreatment serum.

      Patients with androgen independent prostate cancer who do not have bone or visceral
      metastases are selected for this trial because they are a patient population that is likely
      to have no symptoms from the disease or rapid progression that would suggest the need for
      chemotherapy. Additionally, given the preclinical data suggesting that IGF-1 expression and
      signaling occurs concomitantly with the onset of androgen independent growth, it is felt that
      testing in the "early" androgen independent state is warranted. This trial is consistent with
      overall goal to develop IGF-1 targeted therapies in patients with disease progression and a
      lower disease burden.
