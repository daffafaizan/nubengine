      with catheter ablation versus optimal AAD treatment with flecainide/verapamil or sotalol. Due
      to the use of different AAD (with and without beta-blocking abilities) the investigators will
      be able to explore the secondary objectives. Finally, this study will assess safety of
      ablation of non-RVOT VPBs and long-term treatment with two different AAD.
