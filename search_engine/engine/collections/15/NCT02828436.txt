      subjects (30 men and 30 post-menopausal women). Subjects will be a assigned to one of the two
      study arms, (Dynamic Exercise or Spinal Cord Stimulation) and then crossover to the other arm
      after the initial assignment is complete. However is the screening MRI determines the subject
      is not a candidate for spinal cord stimulation, then they will be assigned to the Dynamic
      Exercise arm only.
