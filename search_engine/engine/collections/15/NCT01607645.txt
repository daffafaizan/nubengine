    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the morphologic complete remission (CR) rates using a decitabine
      (DAC)-priming followed by idarubicin (IDA) and cytarabine (ARAC) in patients with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine CR without minimal residual disease (CRMRD-), CR with incomplete blood count
      recovery (CRi), CR with minimal residual disease (CRMRD+), and CR with incomplete blood count
      recovery and with minimal residual disease (CRiMRD+) rates.

      II. To estimate the frequency and severity of regimen-related toxicities.

      III. To identify biomarkers (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] methylation and expression
      changes including interferon regulatory factor [IRF]8) associated with clinical responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -4 to 0, cytarabine
      IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-7, and idarubicin IV over 10-15 minutes on days 1-3.

      ARM II: Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days -9 to -5 and cytarabine and
      idarubicin as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
