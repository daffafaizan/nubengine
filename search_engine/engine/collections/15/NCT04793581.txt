      directional atherectomy catheter, Pantheris SV. Patients presenting with reduced blood flow
      in the lower extremity arteries will under directional atherectomy, followed by adjunctive
      therapy as deemed necessary by the physician, and then adverse events and symptom resolution
      will be documented at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year after the procedure. Primary safety
      endpoints are related to adverse events and will be assessed at the time of the procedure and
      at 30 days after the procedure. Effectiveness endpoints center on restoration of blood flow.
