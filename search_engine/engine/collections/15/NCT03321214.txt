      quality of life in teenagers and adults with celiac disease. The aim of the proposed pilot is
      to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a novel intervention - a portable gluten
      sensor device. The sample for this pilot will be 30 teenagers and adults with biopsy
      confirmed celiac disease recruited from the Celiac Center at Columbia University in New York
      City. Thirty participants will pilot test a portable gluten sensor device with its associated
      iPhone app for 3 months. At baseline and three-month follow-up, participants will complete
      measures of gluten free diet adherence, quality of life,symptoms, anxiety, and depression. At
      post-only, the investigators will collect in-depth data related to the feasibility and
      acceptability of the gluten sensor, as well as facilitators and barriers related to how,
      where, and when it was used. At the completion of the proposed pilot study, the investigators
      hope to have preliminary data to inform development of gluten sensor interventions that the
      investigators hope to test in a larger NIH-funded randomized controlled trial. These
      findings, in combination with a larger trial, have the potential for the development of a new
      standard of care in the management of patients with celiac disease.
