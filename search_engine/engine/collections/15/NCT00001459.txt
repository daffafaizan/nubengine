      a tomographic technique at rest and during stress in patients with myocardial ischemia
      (coronary artery disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and microvascular angina). Gender
      differences in response to exercise and pharmacologic stress will also be evaluated. Normal
      subjects will be studied in order to establish a control database. Current methods of gated
      blood pool studies use planar imaging, with its attendant limitations; poor resolution and
      inadequate separation of the myocardial segments, only one view assessed during exercise and
      superimposition of overlying structures. Tomographic imaging has the advantages of
      reconstructing 3-dimensional data of the entire heart with the ability to improve segmental
      resolution and separate overlapping structures, potentially resulting in increased
      sensitivity and specificity for detection of disease.

      The role of pharmacologic stress will be assessed by comparison with exercise stress, in
      order to validate its use in subjects unable to exercise and identify gender related
      differences. Quantitative measures of regional wall motion obtained from tomography will be
      compared to regions of prior myocardial infarction (if present), and with other modalities
      for evaluating cardiac structure and function. The diagnostic and prognostic value of
      tomographic wall motion analysis will be studied in patients with myocardial ischemia, with
      special emphasis on correlation between physiologic variables of coronary blood flow and
      metabolic function.
