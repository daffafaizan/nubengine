      which there is currently no effective treatment. The disease is caused by mutations in the
      gene for dystrophin. A subset of these mutations includes nonsense mutations, i.e., premature
      stop codons. Previous studies have shown that aminoglycosides are effective in allowing
      translation through stop codons. Recently, gentamicin was shown to restore functional
      dystrophin in a mouse model of DMD. The objective of this protocol is to determine if
      gentamicin is also an effective treatment in patients with DMD caused by nonsense mutations.
      This will be a preliminary, non-blinded study in which levels of intravenous gentamicin
      previously established to be safe, will be administered to identified patients meeting
      inclusion criteria over a two-week period. These patients will have CLIA approved laboratory
      documented stop codon mutations in the dystrophin gene. Quantitative dystrophin expression
      will be the primary outcome. Strength measurements will also be assessed before and
      immediately after the two-week treatment period. Follow-up evaluations will be made at one
      month. For this subset of patients with DMD it is anticipated that there will be a transient
      increase in dystrophin expression with a possible corresponding transient improvement in
      strength. Subsequent blinded studies to evaluate the most effective dose and dosing intervals
      would then be pursued.
