    
      In this randomized controlled pilot study of resistance exercise training in patients with
      HFpEF, the investigators will recruit 24 HFpEF patients who will be randomized to resistance
      exercise training (RT - n=12) or no resistance exercise training (standard care control group
      [CTL] - n=12). The investigators will have baseline and follow-up measures of clinical
      characteristics, leg muscle strength, quality of life, lean muscle mass (body composition via
      DXA including segmental lean mass), maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (peak VO2, peak
      work, ventilatory efficiency), constant-load submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test with
      speckle tracking echocardiography (exertional dyspnea and fatigue at matched workloads,
      cardiac output, diastolic function, left ventricular strain, ventilation, gas exchange, and
      locomotor muscle neural feedback).

      Participants will be asked to make 4 separate study visits. Those randomized to undergo
      Resistance Training will be expected to make those visits as well.
