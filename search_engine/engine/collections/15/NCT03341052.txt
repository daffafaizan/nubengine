    
      This is a single center study involving diet intervention, including healthy obese and
      healthy normal weight participants. Participants will maintain their normal diet for 1 week,
      eat a high fat and high calorie diet for 1 week, return to their normal diet for 1 week, and
      eat a low fat and low calorie diet for 1 week, to study the effect of diet on the bile acid
      pathway in normal weight and obesity. During their first normal diet week, the high calorie
      week, and the low calorie week, blood samples will be collected at defined times to measure
      cholesterol, glycemia, Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 (FGF-19), Bile Acid (BA), C4, and
      incretins (GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY 3-36)) fasting
      levels and responses to the meal. Stool samples will be collected for 48 hour BA excretion.
