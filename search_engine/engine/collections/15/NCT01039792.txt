      impairments in communication, social interaction, and repetitive behavior. Due to the lack of
      known treatments for autism, many parents seek complementary and alternative medical (CAM)
      therapies hoping to help their affected child. Methylcobalamin (methyl B12) is a commonly
      used CAM treatment that has anecdotal reports of remarkable clinical improvements with few
      side effects. Prior studies have found that children with autism have deficiencies in key
      metabolites and antioxidants which can be caused by methyl B12 deficiency; additional studies
      have shown that methyl B12 normalizes deficiencies in these metabolites and antioxidants.
      Based on these reports, a pilot study was conducted at UC Davis on the effect of methyl B12
      on the behavioral and metabolic measures in children with autism. The preliminary results of
      29 subjects revealed a subgroup of 9 responders to clinical behavior assessments. These
      responders also demonstrated significant improvement on the plasma measures of antioxidant
      capacity, suggesting methyl B12 improves symptoms in a subgroup of children with autism by
      increasing key antioxidants. The current study will have an 8 week double blind design with
      50 subjects, designed to evaluate improvements from methyl B12 by using behavioral
      assessments and analysis of specific metabolites in the subjects' blood. This study will
      determine whether methyl B12 will lead to benefits in any of the core features of autism, and
      will examine metabolic changes with the hope of potentially identifying a biomarker for
      treatment response in a subgroup of subjects.
