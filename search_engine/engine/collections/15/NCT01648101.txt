    
      This is a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and health
      outcomes of 2 doses of retigabine immediate release (IR) (GW582892) compared with placebo in
      adult Asian subjects with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS) who are already taking
      1, 2, or 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study will compare retigabine IR at doses of 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day taken
      in equally divided doses three times a day with placebo.

      The study design includes an 8-week Screening/Baseline Phase, a 16-week Treatment Phase
      (4-week Titration Phase and 12-week Maintenance Phase), and a 4-week Transition or
      Taper/Follow-up Phase. Approximately 500 subjects will be screened and enrolled with
      approximately 354 subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1:1
      (retigabine 900 mg/day, retigabine 600 mg/day, or placebo). The total duration of the study
      for each subject will be approximately 28 weeks. At the end of the Maintenance Phase,
      eligible subjects will be given the opportunity to enrol in an open-label extension study.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects with
      >/=50% reduction in 28 day total POS frequency, from the Baseline Phase to the Maintenance
      Phase, in subjects randomly assigned to retigabine 900 mg/day compared with placebo. The key
      secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects with >/=50%
      reduction in 28 day total POS frequency, from the Baseline Phase to the Maintenance Phase, in
      subjects randomly assigned to retigabine 600 mg/day compared with placebo.

      The safety and tolerability endpoints are incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs);
      proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation; change from Baseline in vital
      sign measurements and weight; change from Baseline in electrocardiogram parameters; change
      from Baseline in haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters; changes from Baseline in
      American Urological Association Symptom Index and post-void residual bladder ultrasound
      volumes; and summary of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.
