      unit. The severity of this inflammation increases with higher pregravid Body Mass Index
      (BMI). This is reflected by an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the maternal
      circulation and in the placenta. It has been proposed that the pro-inflammatory maternal and
      fetal environment plays a role in mediating pregnancy outcomes.

      In non-pregnant individuals regular physical activity is associated with a reduced
      inflammatory state. The overall objective of the study is to investigate the interaction of
      maternal physical activity and pregnancy induced low-grade inflammation in the mother and
      feto-placental unit, and to assess th resulting effects on prenatal and postnatal
      development.

      Specific research objective will be to study effects of maternal physical activity on:

        1. low grade Inflammation in the mother an feto-placental unit;

        2. maternal and fetal lipid profiles, including High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) proteome;

        3. fetal growth and infant body composition;

        4. transcriptomic and epigenetic profile in the placenta;

        5. biomarkers of nutritive status;

        6. psychological assessment: cardiac awareness; assessment of arterial stiffness;
           stress-coping questionaire
