      effect operation times, pain response and possibly recovery time. The objectives of this
      study were to establish if any differences concerning these aspects could be detected after
      three principally different techniques for primary inguinal hernia repair.

      472 men between 30 and 75 years with primary inguinal hernias were included in a prospective
      controlled study and randomised to Lichtenstein mesh (L), PerFix Plug® (P) or the Prolene®
      Hernia System (PHS) procedure. All patients were seen and data were collected after 2 weeks,
      3 months, 1 year, and 3 years.
