      assessing baseline measures (end-of-grade test scores, absenteeism, Pediatric Quality of
      Life, physical fitness, GEMS Activity Rating Scale, Dennison's measure of sedentary screen
      time, Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale, BMI%ile, (with a small subset assayed for fasting
      lipids and glucose, with a smaller subset wearing ActiGraphs for objective measures of
      activity) we randomized to the intervention or control group.

      In our intervention, youth play a dance game at school called "In the Groove", with the goal
      of 40 additional minutes each week of physical activity during the school hours.

      We will obtain change scores and compare the groups to find an effect size for future
      studies, this this proves acceptable and feasible in Maine schools.
