      the influence of alcohol (DUI) remains a major cause of mortality and loss of years of
      productive life. A brief motivational interview (BI) is a non-confrontational,
      patient-centered discussion during which the individual's motivation and confidence to change
      health-related behaviors are explored. Previous studies of BIs in health care settings
      suggest that BIs administered after hospitalization for alcohol-related injury reduce the
      likelihood of repeat injury hospitalization and arrest for DUI.
