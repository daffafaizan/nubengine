    
      This is a single center, phase I, open label dose escalation study designed to determine the
      safety and tolerability of autologous, bone marrow-derived MSCs (EPIC2016-MSC003) in patients
      with SCD undergoing haploidentical HCT.

      Study participants are assigned to one of three MSC dose levels: four infusions of MSCs given
      once per week, four infusions given twice per week, or six infusions given twice per week.
      Bone marrow (1-2 ml/kg, max 60 ml) will be collected from study participants for autologous
      MSC expansion a minimum of 28 days prior to first planned MSC infusion. MSCs will be expanded
      ex vivo in human platelet lysate to the specified dose level. All MSC infusions will be dosed
      at 2 x 10^6 MSCs/kg recipient weight, with first infusion given on day 0 (day of
      haploidentical HCT) or day +1. This phase I trial will enroll 12-18 patients with severe SCD
      undergoing haploidentical HCT, with subjects followed for 1 year following HCT (and MSC
      infusions).

      Prior to MSC infusions, study participants will undergo transplant conditioning and GVHD
      prophylaxis as follows:

      Day -100 to -10: Hydroxyurea 30 mg/kg PO Qday

      Day -9: Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 0.5 mg/kg IV

      Day -8: Rabbit ATG 2 mg/kg IV

      Day -7: Rabbit ATG 2 mg/kg IV; Thiotepa 10 mg/kg IV

      Day -6: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV; Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV

      Day -5: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV; Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV

      Day -4: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV

      Day -3: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV

      Day -2: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV

      Day -1: Total body irradiation (TBI) 200 centigray (cGy)

      Day 0: Haploidentical bone marrow stem cell infusion

      Day +3: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV

      Day +4: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV

      Day +5: Sirolimus (through day +365); mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 15 mg/kg/dose three times
      per day (TID) (through day +35)
