      have progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy (maximum number of prior distinct
      regimens = 2) and are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative/epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) wild-type (WT) will receive a combination of ceritinib and docetaxel.

      Study rationale is that targeting ALK- and EGFR-negative lung tumors with ceritinib and
      microtubule inhibitors results in synergistic antitumor effects. Therefore, treatment with
      ceritinib and docetaxel is a rational combination.
