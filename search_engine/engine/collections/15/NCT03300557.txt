    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if there is a decrease in proliferation index, measured by Ki-67 expression,
      in complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH)/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) or low
      grade (grade 1 and grade 2) endometrial cancer cells from baseline to post-exemestane
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Circulating serum estradiol and progesterone. II. Pathological response (regression of
      CAH/EIN or low grade [grade 1 and grade 2] endometrial carcinoma).

      III. Tissue biomarkers. IV. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutational analysis through next
      generation sequencing and methylation status of endometrial tumor.

      V. Protein markers via tampon recovery before and after treatment. VI. DNA markers via tampon
      recovery. VII. Safety and adverse effects of treatment. VIII. Comparison of Ki-67 expression
      changes between study subjects and a historical cohort.

      IX. Evaluation of the levels of exemestane in the plasma samples pre and post treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) over 21-42 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Patients undergo standard of care surgery between
      days 22-43.

      After completion of study treatment, patients with unresolved adverse events on day of
      surgery are followed up periodically.
