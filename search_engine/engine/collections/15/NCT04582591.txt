      cancer treatment. The development of CIPN can lead to omission or even discontinuation of
      antineoplastic drugs, possibly affecting efficacy of cancer treatment. There is a lack of
      knowledge about the natural course of CIPN and to this date, there are no available methods
      for the early detection of CIPN. With no effective prevention or treatment options, the
      condition has severe impact on patient quality of life and healthcare expenditure.
