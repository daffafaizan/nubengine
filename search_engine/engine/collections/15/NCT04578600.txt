      To assess the safety and toxicity of oral azacitidine (CC-486) in combination with
      lenalidomide and obinutuzumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of CC-486 in combination with lenalidomide and obinutuzumab in
      subjects with relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma as assessed by:

      Ia. Overall response rate: complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) per 2016 Lugano
      criteria and Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) criteria.

      Ib. Duration of response (DOR): will be calculated from time of initial response assessment
      demonstrating at least PR until disease response assessment that demonstrates progressive
      disease.

      Ic. Time to response (TTR): calculated as time from registration to first disease response
      assessment that demonstrates at least PR.

      Id. Progression-free survival (PFS): Patients are considered a failure for this endpoint if
      they die or if they relapse/progress or receive additional anti-lymphoma therapy.

      Ie. Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
