      Malaysian foods with three phases, i.e. screening, training and tasting sessions.

      The study will be held in the sensory tasting rooms at Wageningen University, The Netherlands
      and Taylor's University, Malaysia, respectively.

      After the recruitment and prior to the training and tasting sessions, there will be a 2-hour
      screening session (Phase I) during which the investigators will select respective Dutch and
      Malaysian participants based on their performance in a sensory test.

      During the training session (Phase II), the participants need to commit and involve in 2
      1½-hour sessions a week for approximately four- six months (until sufficiently trained).

      At the tasting sessions (Phase III), trained Dutch and Malaysian panellist also need to
      involve in 2-3 sessions a week for a consecutive three years. Each session will take
      approximately 1½ hour. During this session, series of food will be rated for their taste, fat
      and texture. In addition, food texture will be measured by eating rate and quantifying the
      size of the bites which it is eaten.

      The usual performance of the panellist also are discussed with the panellists and monitored
      throughout the training phase and regularly (each month) during the tasting phase.
