      Bra), which is approved for breast reconstruction in Europe. The surgical approach is
      identical in comparison to ADM reconstruction and has been described previously. This
      titanium coated lightweight mesh consists of a monofilament structure and was initially
      invented for hernia repair which has a good biocompatibility. Observed cellular reactions
      like proliferation and apoptosis were at the lowest level when using this lightweight TCPM
      compared to not titanium-coated meshes (pure polypropylene (PP), pure lightweight PP mesh or
      PP mesh incorporating resorbable polyglactic acid). Histopathological analysis of an
      intraoperative sample of a TCPM after expander/implant BR demonstrated a well incorporated
      mesh with only weak inflammatory reactions. Preliminary data of in-vitro investigations at
      the investigators institute confirms the good biocompatibility of this TCPM in distinctive
      breast tissues (fibroblasts, fat cells, muscle cells) Although meshes are used in a large
      scale there are no sufficient clinical data regarding safety and outcome. In this multicenter
      study the investigators are able to investigate a large cohort of patients undergoing implant
      based breast reconstruction using a TCPM.
