      the development of low solubility volatile agents such as sevoflurane and desflurane, and
      modern anesthesia devices. Reducing the flow of fresh gas as much as possible will reduce the
      amount of volatile agent used, thus preventing air pollution, providing lower costs, and also
      preserving heat and moisture in the respiratory tract by using rebreathing systems.
      Laparoscopic surgery is superior to open surgical techniques due to its minimally invasive
      nature, less postoperative pain, less incidence of wound infections, shortening the
      hospitalization, and allowing patients to return to their normal lives sooner after the
      operation.

      Our aim is to investigate the effect of minimal flow anesthesia with sevoflurane on
      hemodynamics and arterial blood gas parameters in laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations.

      Material and Method: Seventy patients with ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class
      I-II between the ages of 18-65 undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included
      in the study. After the patients were randomly selected by computer, they were divided into
      two equal groups as Group M (minimal flow anesthesia group) with fresh gas flow 0,5 L.min-1
      and Group C (high flow anesthesia/ control group) with fresh gas flow 4 L.min-1. In both
      groups. Demographic data, duration of anesthesia, operation times, recovery times,
      hemodynamic parameters and arterial blood gas parameters of all patients were recorded. The
      patient data collected in both groups were compared statistically.
