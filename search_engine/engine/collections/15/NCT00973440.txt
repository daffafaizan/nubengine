           via the web (if they have internet access) or in the clinic at their next visit prior to
           seeing the doctor.

        -  All individuals will have a unique way to sign on to the computer program that protects
           the information so that only the participant and the research team will be able to view
           it. Individuals who require assistance to answer the questions will have help provided
           by a research assistant.

        -  We will ask participants to complete the geriatric assessment a second time at 4 months
           after they have enrolled on the study or 1 month after completing their chemotherapy
           treatment, whichever occurs first.
