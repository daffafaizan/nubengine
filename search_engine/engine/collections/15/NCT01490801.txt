        -  Evaluate germline DNA from patients with Epstein-Barr virus positive (EBV+) and Hodgkin
           lymphoma (HL) for inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) mutations.

        -  Examine the effects of ITK mutations on expression of the ITK protein.

        -  Determine whether ITK mutations correlate with specific clinical or histopathological
           features of HL.

      OUTLINE: Archived blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for germline DNA expression and
      inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) mutations by PCR, IHC, flow cytometry, and western blotting,
      and EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) using in situ hybridization. Each patient's data, such as date,
      sex, age, tumor stage and histology at diagnosis, treatment received, response to treatment,
      development of recurrent disease, date of last follow-up, and outcomes are also collected.
