      Primary

        -  To demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) haplotypes that are
           associated with an increased VEGFA expression will predict superior outcome for patients
           with metastatic breast cancer receiving bevacizumab in ECOG-E2100 (but not for the
           control arm).

        -  To demonstrate that candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will further
           improve the predictive capacity of outcome (efficacy and toxicity) in patients enrolled
           in ECOG-E2100.

        -  To demonstrate that tumor VEGFA amplification or borderline amplification (estimated 14%
           frequency) will predict superior outcome for patients with metastatic breast cancer
           receiving bevacizumab on ECOG-E2100 whereas those with VEGFA deletion (estimated 11%
           frequency) will predict inferior outcome.

        -  To demonstrate that VEGFA amplification/deletion will not predict outcome in the control
           arm of ECOG-E2100.

      Secondary

        -  To demonstrate that tumor VEGFA amplification will predict increased protein expression
           as ascertained by IHC.

        -  To demonstrate that a combined algorithm calculated from tumor-specific variability
           (VEGFA amplification/deletion) and host-specific variability (SNPs) will optimally
           predict outcome (efficacy) with bevacizumab in patients enrolled on ECOG-E2100.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected tumor-derived DNA is analyzed for VEGFA amplification/deletion and
      haplotype as biomarkers for outcome after bevacizumab treatment. Gene expression,
      polymorphism, protein expression analysis, and IHC are performed on the samples.
