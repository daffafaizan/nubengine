      destruction of beta cells in the islet, including Type 1 diabetes and Latent Autoimmune
      Diabetes in Adults (LADA). Insulin has been used as a routine therapy for AIDM to alleviate
      the hyperglycemic status, yet cannot effectively prevent the progressing destruction of beta
      cells or preserve its function. Regulatory T cells expanded from umbilical cord blood
      (UCB-Treg) ex-vivo have shown strong capacity to control immune responses in autoimmune
      diseases, offering a hopeful therapeutic way for AIDM. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analog
      Liraglutide has been tested in large-scale clinical trial to prove its various benefits for
      beta cells and glucolipid metabolism in Type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. However, its
      clinical application in AIDM is not well-defined so far. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the potential use of Liraglutide with UCB-Treg infusion in AIDM and examine the
      safety and efficacy of this new therapy.
