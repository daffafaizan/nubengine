    
      The main aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of switching from Efavirenz (taken
      in combination with Kivexa®or as part of the combination pill, Atripla®) in patients with
      Central Nervous System (CNS) side effects (such as difficulty with sleeping, bad dreams etc).
      The study aims to investigate the effect of switching Efavirenz to Dolutegravir while
      continuing Truvada (tenofovir plus emtricitabine, two constituents of Atripla) or Kivexa.
      Dolutegravir will be the only new component of the combination.

      In addition to the aims stated above, the study also aims:

      To investigate whether switching to dolutegravir based combination Antiretroviral Therapy
      (cART) is associated with resolution of CNS toxicity (determined by CNS questionnaire) at 12
      weeks post switch To investigate continued virological suppression at levels of <400 and <50
      copies/ml in individuals switching to dolutegravircontaining cART at 4 and 12 weeks post
      switch To investigate changes in cluster of differentiation 4+ (CD4+) cell count in
      individuals switching to dolutegravircontaining cART over 12 weeks post switch To investigate
      the safety (laboratory and non CNS adverse events) of switching to dolutegravir based cART
      over 12 weeks post switch To investigate changes in quality of life in individuals switching
      to dolutegravir based cART as assessed by Quality of life (EuroQOL) questionnaires over 12
      weeks post switch To investigate the impact of switching to dolutegravir based CART on
      anxiety and depression (as determined by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) over 12
      weeks post switch To investigate changes in quality of sleep in individuals switching to
      dolutegravir based cART as per standardized sleep questionnaire at 4 and 12 weeks post switch
      To assess the impact of switching to dolutegravir based cART on adherence by standard
      questionnaire over 12 weeks post switch To investigate changes in neuropsychiatric function
      in individuals switching to dolutegravir based cART by CogState battery and Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Life (IADL) questionnaire over 12 weeks post switch To investigate
      changes in fasting cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals switching to dolutegravir
      based cART over 12 weekspost switch To investigate Efavirenz (EFV) plasma decay and its
      impact on Dolutegravir (DTG) concentrations following the switch (Maximum Concentration
      (Cmax), Minimum Concentration (Cmin), Area Under the concentration-time Curve (AUC) at weeks
      1, 2 and 3 post switch) To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug
      disposition genes and drug exposure To assess changes in the levels of tryptophan,
      kynurenine, kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, neopterin, tumour necrosis factorα and interferonγ
      in plasma following treatment switch from efavirenz to dolutegravir.

      To investigate the relationship between the immune activation biomarkers and the
      kynurenine/tryptophan ratio at baseline and post switch.

      To investigate the relationship between the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and measures of CNS
      toxicity and neurocognitive impairment at baseline and postswitch.
