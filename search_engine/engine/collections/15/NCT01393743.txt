    
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      adjunctive-therapy study with an open-label Extension Phase. The Core Study consists of 2
      phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase consisted of 2
      periods: Screening (up to 4 weeks) and Baseline (4 or 8 weeks, depending on the accuracy of
      diary-documented seizures during Screening), during which participants will be assessed for
      eligibility to participate in the study. The Randomization Phase consisted of 3 periods:
      Titration (4 weeks), Maintenance (13 weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks; only for those
      participants not entering into the Extension Phase). At the start of the Randomization Phase,
      eligible participants will be randomized to the perampanel or placebo treatment groups in a
      1:1 ratio. The extension phase consists of 142 weeks.
