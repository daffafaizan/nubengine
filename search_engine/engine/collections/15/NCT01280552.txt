      efficacy of ICT-107 in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following
      resection and chemoradiation. The phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated safety and promising
      efficacy in a small, open-label study. The purpose of this study is to provide information
      from a larger, controlled clinical trial. Patients must be newly diagnosed with GBM and not
      yet received chemoradiation. Patients will have had tumor resection, magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and tumor assessment prior to enrollment into the study. Post surgical
      treatment consists of 6 weeks of chemotherapy (TMZ) and radiation followed by a washout
      period. After Screening and informed consent, patients will undergo apheresis at the study
      site for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Apheresis product will be
      sent to a central site where monocytes will be purified and cultured into dendritic cells
      (DC). DC will be pulsed with synthetic peptides that correspond to immunogenic epitopes of
      tumor antigens. The pulsed dendritic cells will then be aliquoted and frozen before shipping
      back to the site. Patients will have the autologous DCs reinfused intradermally. A control
      group will receive unpulsed autologous DC. Patients will be randomized by age in a 2:1 ratio
      to ICT-107 or control.Patients will receive at least four intradermal injections of the
      ICT-107 vaccine and additional vaccine during a maintenance phase. The primary objective is
      to compare overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in patients when treated
      with ICT-107 versus Control.
