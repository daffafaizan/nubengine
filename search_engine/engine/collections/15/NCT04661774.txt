      refractory to drug therapy. This encourage investigators to explore new non-drug therapeutic
      paths, such as plantar reflexology (RP). This change is essential and will broaden relevant
      solutions to health.

      Despite the very positive benefits of RP highlighted, the methodological quality of trials
      are often poor and there are gaps notably on the description of the intervention, the blind,
      the drop-out rate ... which prevents the meta-analyzes to conclude. Promoting rigorous
      research will play an essential role in the transition to personalized and integrative
      medicine. With the intention of specifying the methods of application and the indications of
      the PR, it is necessary to correctly evaluate and be able to cross-check the different
      information It therefore seems relevant to combine research on the objective physiological
      effects in correlation with the patient's subjective feelings to initiate the scientific
      validation of RP and thus non-drug interventions as recommended by the High Authority for
      Health (HAS). The hypothesis is that through a comparison of the evolution of different
      parameters, quantitative and qualitative, this study will allow to identify biomarkers and
      highlight the specific effect of RP on the diaphragm function, compared to placebo.
