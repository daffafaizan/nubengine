      MetroGel® 1% once daily during phase 1 (baseline to week 12) of the study. Subjects will be
      eligible to enter phase 2 of the study based upon improvements in the Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA) score. During phase 2, subjects will receive either Oracea® or placebo once
      daily for up to an additional 40 weeks. Subjects who relapse during phase 2 will be
      discontinued from the study.
