      the international normalized ration (INR) within a narrow therapeutic range to achieve
      maximum benefits. A low proportion of time spent within the therapeutic INR range, (TTR) is
      associated with reduced warfarin efficacy and potentially harmful results. To optimize TTR,
      international guidelines recommend the use of systematic evidence-based dosing methods
      (anticoagulation clinic, computerized systems, manual algorithm and patient self-management).
      A survey in the Hamilton area revealed that half of family physicians manage warfarin dosing
      without assistance from an evidence-based method. The simple manual dosing algorithm is a
      simple tool that helped increase the TTR at the Hamilton General Hospital's anticoagulant
      clinic to an excellent 73% among patients with target INR range 2-3. We will test whether the
      simple dosing algorithm can help to improve warfarin dosing of family physicians who are not
      assisted by evidence-based methods. We will randomize family practices to either use the
      simple dosing algorithm or to manage warfarin dosing as usual, to test whether the simple
      dosing algorithm achieves a superior TTR.
