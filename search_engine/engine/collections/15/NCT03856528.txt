    
      The specific aims of the study include:

        1. To assess the incidence, the diagnostic workup, and the treatment characteristics of
           patients with suspected and confirmed ME.

        2. To examine clinical differences between patients with initially suspected and confirmed
           infectious Meningitis (ME) versus those with suspected but not confirmed infectious ME.

        3. To evaluate potentially prognostic factors for pathological CT findings (especially
           expanding cerebral mass lesions) in patients with suspected infectious ME.

        4. To identify a specific group of patients that benefit from cranial CT prior to LP.

        5. To examine possible complications (e.g., hematoma, postpuncture headache, cerebral
           herniation, â€¦) of lumbal punction (LP) and their correlations to pathologic signs on
           cranial CT.

        6. To compare the outcome between patients with suspected infectious ME and cranial CT
           prior to LP versus patients without prior cranial CT.
