      hundred and four participants with CLBP (18 and 55 years) both genders. Interventions:
      Individuals included will be randomized into two possible treatment arms: PNE+SMT or SMT
      alone. Each treatment will last for 8 sessions. The group submitted to PNE+SMT will received
      in the first two initial sessions an individual face-to-face PNE program of 40 minutes.Main
      outcome measures: Pain intensity and low back pain-related disability will be adopted as
      primary outcomes and as secondary outcomes we will assess fear-avoidance, pain self-efficacy
      and global perceived effect of improvement. The outcomes will be assessed on three occasions:
      pre-intervention, immediately after 8 sessions of intervention and after one-month follow-up
      period. All statistical analysis will be conducted following the principles of intention to
      treat, and the effects of treatment will be calculated using linear mixed models. Discussion:
      This study will help to better understand if PNE -a psychosocial cognitive intervention- will
      add significant effect (immediate and at follow-up) to a movement therapy protocol based on
      manual therapy.
