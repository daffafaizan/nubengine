      satisfactory drug treatment. The neural mechanisms underlying ET remain unknown. One of the
      prevalent hypotheses is that ET is a result of a defective mechanism that normally dampens
      the natural oscillations of inferior olive (IO) neurons whose intrinsic oscillatory activity
      is attributed to the presence of low threshold calcium channels (LTCC). 1-Octanol is known to
      inhibit LTCC of olivary neurons and was found to reduce the tremor induced in rats with
      harmaline, an alkaloid known to hyperpolarize IO neurons increasing their tendency to fire
      rhythmically at rest. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of 1-octanol on ET in
      humans. This study is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose trial in
      untreated patients with ET. Electromyography (EMG) and acclerometry are used to assess tremor
      before and after 1-octanol administration. The accepted daily intake (ADI) of 1-octanol (1
      mg/kg/d) as a food additive will be given as a single dose. Toxicity from octanol will be
      monitored clinically and by liver function and electrolyte measurements.
