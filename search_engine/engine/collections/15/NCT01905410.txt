      form in a transparent glass vial that contains VVZ-149 dissolved by water for injection. When
      administered, the drug will be diluted by normal saline and will be given by intravenous
      infusion for 4 hours.

      SAD study is planned that maximal 7 cohorts of healthy male subjects are administrated single
      dose of VVZ-149 injection or placebo. The planned groups for dose escalations were 0.25, 0.5,
      1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg groups. As a pilot study for safety in this first-in-human study,
      only 3 subjects received active drug are allocated to first two groups each, without subjects
      for placebo. For the following groups, 6 subjects for active drug and 2 for placebos are
      allocated after randomized.

      MAD study is planned that 2 cohorts of 10 healthy male subjects each were administered
      multiple doses of VVZ-149 injection or placebo. The final doses of VVZ-149 injection will be
      determined later based on the results of SAD study. In each group, 7 subjects for active drug
      and 3 for placebos are allocated after randomized
