    
      This study is a prospective, open-label, blinded event, pilot study that will randomize
      patients with a history of venous thrombosis and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) already
      receiving anticoagulation to either warfarin or apixaban. The study will assess the safety
      and efficacy of apixaban compared with adjusted dose warfarin for the prevention of recurrent
      thrombosis (defined as the aggregate of arterial or venous thrombosis) and vascular death.
      The primary efficacy outcome will be confirmed upon adjudication by a panel blinded to the
      treatment arm. The primary safety outcome will be major bleeding and clinically relevant
      non-major bleeding events. Patients who consent to study participation will be randomized to
      anticoagulation with adjusted dose warfarin sodium or apixaban 5 mg by mouth twice daily.
      This pilot study will also provide information and experience identifying, recruiting,
      enrolling and randomizing patients with APS and a history of venous thrombosis to
      anticoagulation with apixaban or warfarin for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis.
