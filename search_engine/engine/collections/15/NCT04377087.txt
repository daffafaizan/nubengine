      denoted by rising CA125, to start a PARP inhibitor will lead to an improved time to next
      therapy with improved quality of life and at a lower financial toxicity.

      PARP-I have shown efficacy as both monotherapy and as maintenance therapy. This trial will
      explore whether patients with recurrent ovarian cancer could derive the same efficacy benefit
      from a delayed start of a PARP-I compared to immediate maintenance therapy. Delayed start
      would have the benefit of sparing the physical, psychological, and financial toxicity
      associated with prolonged treatment. This approach would be particularly relevant in a
      population of platinum-sensitive patients who can have prolonged treatment-free intervals.

      With widespread use of PARP-I, regardless of timing, understanding, and overcoming PARP-I
      resistance is becoming a major clinical need.

      Enrollment will start within 8 weeks of completion of platinum-based treatment. Monitored
      with CA 125 levels every 28 days. Olaparib will be started when CA 125 rises by two-fold of
      their nadir value. Olaparib will be dosed at 300 mg orally twice a day, 28 days of treatment
      will be a cycle. Follow-up will consist of CA125 drawn every 28 days and CT scans obtained at
      doubling of CA- 125 and then every 12 weeks* to assess for recurrence or progression.
      Clinician- and patient-reported adverse events recorded every 28 days. Cancer-related worry
      and distress assessed every 28 days. Measures of quality of life and physical function, and
      financial toxicity assessed every 12 weeks.
