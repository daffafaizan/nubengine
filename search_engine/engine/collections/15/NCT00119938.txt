    
      Patient portals are online programs that can provide a number of functions for patients,
      among them:

        -  Ability to request appointments, referrals, and medication refills;

        -  Ability to send secure electronic messages to medical staff, and to receive replies;

        -  Access to the medical record;

        -  Disease management

      We are comparing two patient portals with different sets of features to determine if
      personalized information and guidance can improve self-care and measures of diabetes-related
      health. Self-care measures will be assessed using standardized questionnaires at baseline, 3,
      and 6 months. Chart review will be used to assess measures of diabetes-related health.
