      Hospital in the period from December 2016 to July 2019. The hospital Institutional Review
      Board approved the study protocol. Thirty-six old, co-morbid and short life expectancy
      patients were included in the sample. They were evaluated for PSP. Informed consent was
      signed by all patients or first-degree relatives after full discussion of the advantage and
      disadvantage of the operation. Preoperative bimanual examination was done for rectal prolapse
      to rule out enterocele or cystocele and this was confirmed by MRI. The routine preoperative
      evaluation was done for all patients (physical examination, complete blood tests, ECG and
      chest x-ray). Bowel preparation was done for all patients.

      Regarding bowel function, all patients were evaluated for fecal incontinence by Wexner score
      and for constipation by Rome II criteria. Prophylactic intravenous cephalosporin and
      metronidazole was given one hour before operation. The operation was done under spinal
      anesthesia in the lithotomy position with slight Trendeleburg to prevent trapping of
      abdominal organs between walls of rectum. All operations were done by the same surgical
      members of the unit. Hospital stay, Intraoperative and postoperative complications were
      recorded. All patients started oral fluids in the second day. Follow up was done for patients
      every 1,3,6,9 and 12 months in the outpatient clinic.
