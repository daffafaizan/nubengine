      graft in conjunction with bone substitutes didn't produce the desired effect on ridge
      preservation compared with bone substitutes alone. A clinical trial showed that achieving
      primary closure didn't present additional beneficial effect on preserving ridge width,
      however, the mucosa was significantly thicker and more coronally positioned.

      Also soft tissue graft has its limitations on covering graft material and socket preservation
      due to the higher morbidity given that the soft tissue graft has to be harvested from a donor
      site of the patient.

      Another options for socket seal are coronal advancement of buccal flap or rotating grafts
      from tissue adjacent to cover the defect but they have limitations such as altering the
      mucogingival line and creating a shallow vestibule.

      Lekovic et al. investigated the use of a non-resorbable polytetrafluroethylene membrane but
      it was found also to have its limitations as 30% of the membranes became exposed and as a
      result loss of bone height and width occurred.

      Also studies have found that using bone substitutes together with collagen membrane with
      primary closure of the socket has shown clear effects on preserving alveolar ridge height as
      well as ridge width, however, its limitation are flap dehiscence and subsequent membrane
      exposure and the increased cost.
