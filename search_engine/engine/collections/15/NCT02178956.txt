    
      The goal of this study is to determine if paclitaxel given together with BBI608 as second
      line therapy will prolong overall survival compared to paclitaxel alone.

      Approximately 700 patients will be randomized with histologically or cytologically confirmed
      metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      Patients must have failed first line therapy with any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet.

      BBI608/placebo will be administered daily, paclitaxel will be administered i.v. on days 1, 8
      and 15 of a 4 weekly cycle.
