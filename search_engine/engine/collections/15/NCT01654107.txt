      develop a theory-based smoking cessation intervention (called Persistence-targeted smoking
      cessation; PTSC). PTSC includes 8 weekly individual counseling sessions and use of nicotine
      lozenge for 12 weeks. We will test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the
      intervention (i.e., cigarettes per day and prolonged abstinence). We hope to develop a
      feasible psychosocial treatment for use in a later randomized controlled trial.
