      root resorption in order to find out if the magnitude and direction of retraction is
      appropriate for the retraction of maxillary incisors following the mini-screw anchorage.

      Therefore, the study will compare and contrast the efficacy and results of the volumetric
      measurement by CBCT.

      Patients

      Males or females whose diagnoses require implant anchorage treatment will be included in the
      study. Inclusion criteria for the study are as followings:

      Orthodontic indication for skeletal anchorage Adequate bone quantity for a palatal implant in
      the CBCT Good oral hygiene and normal wound healing capacity
