      associated with significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. These
      findings underscore the promise of yoga practice for improving mental health in women prone
      to stress.

      This study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an eight-week
      Hatha Yoga intervention for improving stress and mental health. To this end, the
      investigators will recruit 40 women high in stress to receive an 8-week hatha yoga
      intervention consisting of two weekly 90-minute sessions. At baseline and at
      post-intervention, participants will undergo several cognitive, emotional, and behavioral
      assessments, followed by a relaxation time. Primary feasibility outcomes will be the time
      required to recruit 40 participants, the number of screen failures, participant retention and
      participant adherence to the study protocol. Acceptability will be evaluated with
      questionnaires and an interview during the final visit. Primary efficacy outcomes will be
      group differences in pre- to post-intervention change in perceived stress and various mental
      health parameters.
