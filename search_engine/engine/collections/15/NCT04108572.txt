      feasibility study of an infant feeding intervention and implementation strategy, with
      embedded process evaluation and economic evaluation.

      The CHErIsH feasibility study will address the following research questions:

        1. Are the intervention content, delivery and implementation procedures acceptable to
           parents who will receive the intervention, and HCPs who will deliver the intervention?

        2. Are the data collection processes, including mode and duration of data collection and
           outcome measures used, acceptable to parents and HCPs?

        3. Is the intervention feasible to deliver in primary care practice, in terms fidelity of
           delivery and receipt of the intervention?

        4. Is the study feasible in terms of recruitment and retention procedures and data
           collection?

        5. What are the costs associated with the intervention and its implementation strategy?
