      outcomes:

      Primary outcomes Is there a difference in pain scores reported by the patient at 24 hours
      following LA-TAP versus no TAP block? Is there a clinically significant difference in
      cumulative postoperative opioid consumption, expressed as milligram morphine equivalents
      (MMEs) at 24 hours following LA-TAP blocks versus no TAP block? Secondary outcomes Is there a
      difference between study groups in pain scores at 48 & 72 hours? Is there a difference
      between study groups in total opioid consumption (MMEs) by 48 & 72 hours? Is there a
      difference between the study groups for reported post-operative nausea and vomiting? Is there
      a difference between the study groups in operating time? Is there a difference between the
      study groups in the length of Hospital stay? Is there a difference between the study groups
      in patient's satisfaction?

      Patients will be randomized in two arms , LA-TAP , NO-TAP block . Each patient would fill out
      the pain score sheet and number of narcotic medications she used in first 24h, 48h and 72 h
      post operatively .
