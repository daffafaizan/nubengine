    
      Phase 0 / I:

      At level 1 it includes three patients. If any patient suffers dose limiting toxicity (DLT),
      it proceeds to the increase in dose to the next level. If 2/3 patients experience DLT, he
      will close the increased dose and extended / investigate the previous dose level with 3
      additional patients.

      If the level 2, but less than 1/3 the minimum of 6 patients experience TLD is reached, the
      phase I be suspended because not expected another rise above Level 2.

      Dose levels:

        -  Level 1: Nintedanib 150 mg twice daily + oral letrozole 2.5 mg / day orally, in a cycle
           of 28 days.

        -  Level 2: Nintedanib 200 mg twice daily via oral + letrozole 2.5 mg / day orally, in a
           cycle of 28 days.

        -  At least the first cycle will be administered during Phase I. A total of six four-week
           cycles were administered at the discretion of the investigator.
