      Primary

        -  Determine the overall (complete and partial) response rate in patients with recurrent or
           progressive metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with capecitabine and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with the
           chemotherapy combination.

        -  Determine the duration of response (complete or partial) among patients who attain a
           response.

        -  Determine the frequency of patients having > 50% fall of CA19-9 from an initial level of
           > 100 U/mL in association with treatment with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity associated with the administration of the combination in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
