      morbidity and mortality. Sirtuins are anti-aging enzymes that play a diverse role in cellular
      energy metabolism and gene regulation. Mice deficient in SIRT1 are more susceptible to
      developing AKI and sirtuin activation is a potential treatment for AKI.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stepwise study of escalating doses of
      Basis (NR/pterostilbene) in patients with AKI. The study will potentially comprise up to four
      Steps. The purpose of the stepwise approach is to identify the dose of Basis that achieves at
      least a 50% and up to 100% increase in white blood cell (WBC) content of nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD+) without side-effects.

      During each Step, Basis (5 patients) or placebo (1 patient) will be given twice a day for 2
      days. Patients will have frequent blood sampling performed for a 24 hour period following
      dosing on Day 1 and then at 48 hr. The measurements in blood will include NR/pterostilbene
      blood concentrations and NAD+ and NAAD (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide) concentrations
      in WBCs.
