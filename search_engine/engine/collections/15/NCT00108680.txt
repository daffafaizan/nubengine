    
      Objective:

      It has been proposed that individuals with stroke may benefit to a greater degree by training
      with both arms simultaneously than by training with the paretic arm alone. The purpose of
      this protocol is to identify the extent and the mechanisms of paretic arm performance
      improvement after a single session of bilateral arm training compared to a single session of
      unilateral paretic arm training in individuals with moderate-severity chronic stroke.

      Study population:

      The study population will consist of individuals with chronic stroke.

      Design:

      A single-blinded, counterbalanced, crossover design will be used.

      Outcome measures:

      Endpoint measures will include paretic arm peak acceleration and disinhibition of the
      stroke-affected cortical hemisphere as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in
      the context of a reaching task. These measures will be compared after a unilateral vs. a
      bilateral arm training session in individuals with chronic stroke.
