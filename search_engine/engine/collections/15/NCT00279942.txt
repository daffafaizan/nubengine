    
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic, generalized pain syndrome that affects the
      musculoskeletal system (1). This syndrome is typically diagnosed in patients who experience
      generalized musculoskeletal pain and have excessive tenderness in at least 11 of 18 specific
      points (2). Although the primary cause of fibromyalgia syndrome is unclear, a growing body of
      evidence indicates that the widespread pain associated with this syndrome is due to
      abnormalities in the central nervous system. Therefore, drug therapy for fibromyalgia
      syndrome is most often aimed at the central nervous system and includes tricyclic
      antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, dual serotonin and norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibitors, analgesics, and anticonvulsants (1).

      In addition to medical therapies, complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been
      used to treat fibromyalgia syndrome symptoms (3). Soy is a widely used dietary supplement
      that has not been previously tested for treating fibromyalgia syndrome.
