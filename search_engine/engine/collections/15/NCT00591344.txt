      the United States. While medication and surgery are the most effective treatments for PD,
      physicians and people with PD often delay using these treatments because of their
      considerable adverse side effects. Until a cure for PD is discovered, there is a compelling
      need to develop interventions that provide relief of symptoms without causing negative side
      effects.

      Recent research suggests that exercise may provide symptom relief in some characteristics of
      PD. While various exercise interventions appear to effectively improve motor, functional, and
      quality-of-life issues, the research is mixed regarding the nature, extent and duration of
      these improvements. Understanding how multiple characteristics of PD change and whether they
      can be modified by different exercise programs is essential to determining if an exercise
      program is clinically effective for PD.

      This study is designed to compare the initial (six months), and then long-term (2 years)
      effect that 2 different exercise programs (progressive resistance program or flexibility
      program) have on neuro-physiological, motor, functional, and quality-of-life issues in
      individuals with Parkinson's disease. The goal is to determine which program is most
      beneficial. Results from this study will be used to determine which exercise program produces
      the most beneficial effects on neuro-physiological, motor, functional and quality-of-life
      measures.

      NOTE: Recruitment for Parkinson's disease participants is now closed.
