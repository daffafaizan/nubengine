      (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) for DOC (Disorders of Consciousness) patients.
      Seventy-five DOC patients will be randomised into three groups: DBS group, TMS group and
      Control group. These patients will be recorded the conscious level, fMRI (functional magnetic
      resonance imaging) and EEG evaluation before treatment of research, and three months later
      the prognosis was also recorded. Finally, the variation of consciousness, prognosis, fMRI and
      EEG index for three groups will be analyzed and compared. Hopefully, there will be a
      conclusion for these treatments to DOC patients.
