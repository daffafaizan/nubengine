      dissections are typically treated with surgery or endoluminal therapy when complications such
      as uncontrollable pain, organ ischemia, or aortic rupture are present. However, the treatment
      of patients with uncomplicated, acute type B dissections is controversial. Best medical
      therapy (BMT) is the standard of care in these cases since surgical repair offers no
      additional survival advantage. However, Endoluminal stent graft therapy with the GORE TAG
      Thoracic Endoprosthesis (GORE TAG device) may offer distinct advantages as an adjunct to
      medical therapy for uncomplicated acute type B dissection. The goal of endoluminal stent
      grafting is to cover the primary entry tear of the dissection to isolate the false lumen from
      blood flow and induce aortic remodeling.
