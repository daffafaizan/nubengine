      infection is to estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic carrier status and breakthrough
      infection of previously vaccinated individuals in different periods. Up to now, no
      international standard suggests that hepatitis B vaccine should be used as a routine
      immunization program. However, it is an important issue to discuss the immune protection of
      healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody and the duration of this
      protection in the future. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the existence of immune
      protection of healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody, find a method to
      evaluate the immune protection induced by hepatitis B vaccine.

      The main content of the study: To recruit healthy children. Children lacking HBsAb were
      selected for immune memory test and receive a Hep B booster. The results of Antibody positive
      group and antibody negative group were compared and analyzed. To find out the most suitable
      method for evaluating immune protection.
