      will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) azithro 1-11: biannual oral azithromycin to
      children 1-11 months old with biannual oral placebo to children 12-59 months old, 2) azithro
      1-59: biannual oral azithromycin to children 1-59 months old, or 3) placebo: biannual oral
      placebo to children 1-59 months old. Interventions will be delivered biannually through a
      door-to-door census. Mortality will also be monitored through biannual census data
      collection, which will be used to adaptively allocation treatment assignments after the first
      year. Communities will retain an allocation for 4 distributions before being re-randomized.

      Antimicrobial resistance will be monitored using cluster sampling of treated and untreated
      children and adults in the Dosso region.
