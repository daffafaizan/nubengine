    
      Patients considered for this study will have previously undergone surgery for their spinal
      condition according to the standard of care of the practitioner. All patients at a given site
      who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to participate in the study. Once
      enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan at 12 months
      postoperative or later to evaluate their fusion status. If the patient already had a
      postoperative CT scan at 12 months or greater, this will be used in this study and an
      additional CT scan should not be performed for this study. Available progress notes, medical
      records, patient-reported outcomes, radiographs (plain film and CT scans, if available), and
      complications will be obtained from the medical records of all enrolled subjects.

      The safety and performance of the Modulus XLIF interbody implant will be assessed using the
      following:

        1. Complications attributable to the use of the Modulus XLIF interbody implant as noted in
           surgical summaries, progress notes, and hospital records

        2. Radiographic outcome (fusion) and description of device status from plain film
           radiographs and CT scan(s)

        3. Neurologic status, symptoms, and/or subject self-reported clinical outcomes (e.g., pain
           and disability), as available
