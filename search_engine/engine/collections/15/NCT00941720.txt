      Primary

        -  To compare relapse-free survival and overall survival of patients with multiple myeloma
           treated with IV busulfan vs historical control patients treated with oral busulfan when
           administered with cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen prior to autologous
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  To compare pulmonary toxicity rates of IV busulfan vs oral busulfan when administered
           with cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen prior to autologous hematopoietic stem
           cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose busulfan IV every 6 hours on days -8 to -4 and high-dose
      cyclophosphamide IV over 4 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
