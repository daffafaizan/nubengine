      If a mutation is discovered, it changes the potential approach to managing the nevus. In the
      presence of a known genomic change associated with aggressive disease, closer follow up and
      more aggressive treatment could preserve the patient's vision and prevent micrometastatic
      spread. This new screening technique will be able to extend the length and quality of life of
      patients with more frequent targeted cancer screens.
