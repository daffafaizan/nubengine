      more-than-thirty-years-old women. On the clinical aspect, patients present a primary or
      secondary amenorrhea depending on when the disease occurs in their lives. Infertility is most
      of the time definitive and the yet only available therapy is auto implantation of
      cryopreserved oocytes. Initiation of a substitutive hormonal treatment is also necessary to
      prevent the consequences of estrogenic hardship (i.e leading to osteoporosis).

      POF has numerous possible origins, and can be linked to auto-immune diseases, metabolic
      disorders (i.e. galactosemia) or even genetic abnormalities. According to her origin, POF is
      characterized by (a) a depletion of primary follicles, (b) increased or accelerated follicle
      atresia (c) an alteration of the recruitment of dominant follicle and (d) stopped follicular
      maturation.

      The purpose of our work is to organize a clinical and fundamental research network focussed
      on premature ovarian failure (POF). It will aim to collect clinical, biological, radiological
      and histological information on patients, and according to their phenotypes, to decide for
      searching possible genetic abnormalities leading to POF. And in the same time, the
      constitution of a broad tissue collection allows the study of ovarian transcripts, using POF
      as a pathologic model to describe ovaries and follicle development-involved genes.
