    
      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Age-related cataract

        -  Shallow Anterior Chamber (<2.5mm)

      Exclusion Criteria:

      The investigators will be evaluating the following parameters:

        1. Primary outcome measure Corneal thickness on day 1, week 1 and 1 month (Change in
           corneal thickness of 15% from preop. will be considered significant).

        2. Secondary outcome measures

             -  Corneal clarity -on day 1, week 1 and 1 month postoperatively

             -  Anterior chamber cells and flare (Hogan's criteria)

             -  Percentage change in endothelial cell density from preoperatively to 3 months
                postoperatively

             -  Unaided visual acuity (distance) on day 1 and 1 month.

             -  Best corrected distance visual acuity 1 month postoperatively

        3. Other Observations :

      1) Cumulative Dissipated Energy (CDE) 2) Surgical time 3) Fluid used 4) Descemets membrane
      detachment during surgery 5) Incidence of iris trauma 6) Any other intra-operative
      complications
