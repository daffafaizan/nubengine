      and fluorouracil in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer. II. Evaluate
      the feasibility and possible therapeutic anticancer efficacy of this therapy in these
      patients. III. Determine the duration of response, survival, and improvement of quality of
      life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by gemcitabine
      IV over 30 minutes on days 29, 36, 43, and 50. Interferon alfa is administered subcutaneously
      3 times weekly beginning on day 1. Beginning on day 2, interleukin-2 is administered
      subcutaneously 3 times weekly for the first 4 weeks of the treatment course. Treatment is
      repeated every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects and
      disease progression. Following chemobiotherapy, maintenance therapy is administered to
      patients with stable or responding disease. Patients receive subcutaneous interferon alfa 3
      times weekly at the maximum tolerated dose until disease progression or for a maximum of 1
      year. A quality of life assessment is completed weekly. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
