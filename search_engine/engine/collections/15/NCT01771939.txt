      population. Vitrectomy with membrane peeling is nowadays considered the gold standard in the
      management of such pathology, with very good results either at short-time or at long-time
      follow up. In case of mild visual impairment due to epiretinal membrane and associated
      cataract, it is reasonable to treat only the lens pathology (with phacoemulsification and
      intra-ocular lens (IOL) implantation). In case of symptoms or ophthalmoscopic finding
      worsening it is always possible to submit patients who only underwent cataract surgery to
      vitrectomy with membrane peeling. There are, by now, no comparative studies between these two
      different approaches in medical literature.
