      arm for patients with weakness due to stroke. The randomized trial will compare conventional
      care, planar robot intervention and an intervention of planar and vertical robot training
      among patients with chronic, stable deficits. We will evaluate motor outcomes, effectiveness,
      cost, patient satisfaction and quality of life. The study will determine the efficacy of
      upper extremity robot therapy compared to supervised self-administered exercise therapy in
      patients with deficits due to stroke.
