    
      Ninety-three consecutive patients undergoing bilateral wavefront-guided laser refractive
      surgery in the Department of Ophthalmology of the National Taiwan University Hospital between
      September 2004 and December 2007 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Before laser
      refractive surgery, all patients were seated in front of the Zyoptix 100 system platform
      (Bausch & Lomb, salt lake city, UT, USA) and received Zywave aberrometer measurement on both
      eyes. When patients were in the supine position for refractive surgery, an infrared camera
      mounted on the laser system (Technolas 217z100 excimer laser system, Bausch & Lomb)obtained
      iris images on undilated pupils before laser ablation. Overall cyclorotation was detected by
      a comparison between iris images of undilated pupils in the supine position and dilated
      pupils in the seated position before laser treatment. The degree and direction of
      position-induced cyclorotation were assessed.
