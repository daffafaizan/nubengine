      postoperative analgesia regimens, especially in the field of plastic and reconstructive
      surgery where patients exhibit a significant risk of persistent opioid use afterward.

      As such, the contemporary facial plastics literature has noticed a surge in publications that
      implement various multi-modal analgesia (MMA) regimens to mitigate narcotic use
      postoperatively, the results of which seem promising.

      Among the opioid-sparing medications utilized in MMA regimens, the selective COX-2 inhibitors
      (e.g., celecoxib, parecoxib) are of interest given their similar analgesic efficacy and
      decreased risk profile (less nausea, constipation, and dependence) compared to opioids.
      Furthermore, selective COX-2 inhibitors avoid adverse gastrointestinal and renal events, as
      well as the antiplatelet effects associated with conventional NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen and
      naproxen). For these reasons, selective COX-2 inhibitors make for the ideal analgesic to use
      after facial plastic surgery procedures, where increased bleeding can delay wound healing
      (e.g., increased bruising and swelling) and cause potentially devastating complications
      (e.g., hematoma after a facelift, or epistaxis after septorhinoplasty). Nonetheless, studies
      evaluating the role of selective COX-2 inhibitors as safe and effective alternatives to
      opioids in plastic surgery are scant.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether celecoxib is equivalent to a routinely
      prescribed analgesia, acetaminophen-codeine-caffeine (trade name TYLENOL#3) for the
      management of pain after primary cosmetic open septorhinoplasty with osteotomies. Secondary
      objectives include comparison of adverse effects that occur post-operatively, with attention
      to medication side effects, as well as bleeding events and bruising.

      We hypothesize that both interventions will exhibit no difference in pain control or
      postoperative bleeding or bruising, but that participants taking acetaminophen/codeine will
      experience more adverse effects.
