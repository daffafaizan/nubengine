    
      In the first part of the study the patient's' peripheral blood collected from and CIK cell
      expansion and storage at the Regina Margherita Children's Hospital Cell Factory.

      Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled in part 1 (range: 30 - 50 patients). The second
      part of the study will be a 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the MTD/RP2D.

      A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be appointed to make dose escalation decisions.

      Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in this part (range: 6 - 36 patients).

      Only one infusion of autologous CIK cells will be carried out at each cycle, every 21 days at
      the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose levels and every 15 days at the 4th, 5th 6th dose levels.

      A maximum of 6 cycles will be performed (patient with complete disease remission patients who
      benefit from treatment might also receive more cycles at the Investigator's discretion)
