      was applied to a consistent number of office workers, a significant reduction of frequency of
      pain in the head and neck areas and of analgesic drug consumption was obtained. The results
      were stable at a 12 month follow up. More recently a controlled, cluster randomised,
      interventional trial was conducted on 1930 local government employees of the Municipality of
      Turin. The data obtained confirm those of the previous studies.

      The present study was designed to confirm the data in a much more extensive population , that
      is, residents of the Italian Region Piemonte (Piedmont) who will apply to participate.

      Primary objective is to confirm the effectiveness of the cognitive and physical programme
      (Intervention), in reducing the frequency of pain involving the head and neck area in a large
      population of a territory.

      Secondary objective is to confirm the effectiveness of the Intervention, in reducing
      analgesic drugs consumption after the Intervention in the same population.
