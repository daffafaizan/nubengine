      stroke outcome. Unfortunately, however, as of now, clinical research and clinical practice
      have not adequately addressed this growing challenge. A good case in point is posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD). Previous trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms may
      increase the risk of cardiovascular events (Sumner et al., 2015). Moreover, unbeknownst to
      most clinical neurologists, a significant portion (approximately 25%) of their stroke
      patients develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within the first year
      post-event. PTSD-related symptoms after an acute coronary syndrome increase the risk of
      recurrent cardiac events and mortality (Edmondson et al., 2012). Similarly, stroke-induced
      PTSD has been linked with worse long term stroke outcome, in particular, recurrent stroke,
      greater disability, non-adherence to medications, and comorbidities (Goldfinger et al., 2014;
      Kronish et al., 2012).

      For a period of 22 months, all stroke patients treated at the Charit√© Medical Center will be
      screened retrospectively 9-13 months after a first-ever ischemic stroke (~2000). All eligible
      patients will be contacted by mail 9-13 months after their hospital stay with the request
      that they complete the questionnaires. The mailing will also include an information
      statement, the consent form, as well as a stamped return envelope.
