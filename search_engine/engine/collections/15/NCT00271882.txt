      all the interviews. The interview will be conducted in one or two sessions and will be up to
      two hours in duration per session.

      The study will initially be conducted at three ATN clinical sites with approximately 20
      females recruited per site for a total of 60 participants. Other ATN clinical sites may be
      allowed to participate in the future if the study is slow to accrue.

      The participants consist of English speaking women, ages 18-24 years, who acquired HIV
      through heterosexual intercourse or injection drug use after the age of 9 years, reported a
      history of sexual and/or physical abuse prior to age 18, and engaged in vaginal or anal
      intercourse in the 4 months prior to screening.

      Approximately half of the participants will report a recent history of substance use as
      defined by study criteria and approximately half of the participants will report no such
      history.

      Eligible patients will be identified and screened by the ATN research staff at the
      participating sites. The Protocol Chair and trained Research Assistant will conduct the
      open-ended qualitative interviews using an open-ended script. The interview will be
      audio-taped and transcribed. Prior to the open-ended script interview, participants will be
      asked about Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, abuse history, substance use, sexual
      behavior, and demographics. Responses to these questions will not be audio-taped and will be
      entered into the ATN 053 database by the ATN site staff.
