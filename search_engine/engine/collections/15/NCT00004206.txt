      terms of response rate, time to tumor progression, and overall survival in patients with
      recurrent ovarian cancer. II. Evaluate the safety profile of this combination regimen in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours once every
      2 weeks and fluorouracil IV and leucovorin calcium IV once weekly. Treatment repeats every 2
      weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with stable or responding disease are followed at 1 month and at 3 months, then every 3
      months for disease relapse and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
