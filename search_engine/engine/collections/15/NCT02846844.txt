      polyneuropathy. In a phase-III study patients with chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (NCI
      CTC grade 2/3) are randomized for an integrated program (IP) including massage, mobilization
      in posture and transport layers, physical exercises (standard) or with whole-body vibration
      (WBV) platform training (experimental). 15 training sessions in a time period of 12 to 15
      weeks were intended. Evaluation included locomotor and neurological tests and
      self-assessment-tools. The primary objective of the study was the physical fitness and
      coordination assessed by the chair-rising test (CRT).
