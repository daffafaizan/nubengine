      Techniques," CVT) are known to be associated with significant trauma to the patient's nares
      and the endotracheal tube itself. The investigators propose an alternative technique
      (Nasotracheal intubation over a bougie placed via a subsequently removed nasal trumpet, or
      NIB) which involves using Seldinger technique over a bougie placed via a nasal trumpet which
      promises to not only be less traumatic to the patient and the endotracheal tube, but also to
      take less time to perform and have a higher first-attempt success rate than conventional
      methods. The investigators propose a randomized prospective interventional study comparing
      this new technique with conventional technique to see if a significant difference exists.
