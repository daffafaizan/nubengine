      More than half of the adults with asthma in the US are female. Prevalence of asthma in women
      appears to be increasing, and morbidity and mortality rates for this group are significantly
      higher than rates for men. Recent studies point to unique features in women's management of
      asthma potentially attributable to gender. These include, for example, factors associated
      with hormonal cycles, (e.g. menses, pregnancy, menopause) and social roles (e.g. household
      tasks exposing one to environmental triggers, caregiving to children and relatives
      interfering with asthma management etc.) To date, no rigorously evaluated intervention
      expressly designed for women with asthma has been reported in the literature.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This study is to assess the effectiveness of a gender-specific telephone counseling,
      self-regulation intervention for women with asthma. To test our hypothesis we employed a
      randomized controlled design utilizing an intervention group and a control group. The primary
      outcomes are gender-related asthma management problems, health care utilization, days having
      symptoms, self-regulation level, management skill, and quality of life. We measure at three
      time points: baseline before randomization; follow-up I, one year subsequent to
      randomization; and follow-up II, one year subsequent to follow-up.
