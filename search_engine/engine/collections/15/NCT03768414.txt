      I. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with untreated, advanced biliary cancers
      treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) and cisplatin (GC) versus those treated
      with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-Paclitaxel (GCN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with GC versus GCN.

      II. To compare overall response rate (ORR), complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed,
      in the subset of patients with measurable disease treated with GC versus GCN.

      III. To compare disease control rate (confirmed and unconfirmed; complete response + partial
      response + stable disease) (DCR) in patients treated with GC versus GCN.

      IV. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with GC and GCN in the
      patient population.

      V. To explore the correlation between change in cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels from
      baseline to post-treatment (after 3 cycles) and overall response rate, in each treatment arm
      separately and in the total cohort.

      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To bank tissue and blood for future translational medicine studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, cisplatin IV over
      60 minutes, and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then at the end of year 3.
