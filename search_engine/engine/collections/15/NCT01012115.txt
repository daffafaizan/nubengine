      Presbyterian hospital) will be screened for enrollment in the study. Patients who have the
      diagnosis of sepsis will be asked to volunteer. We will match sepsis patients with other ICU
      patients without the diagnosis of sepsis. The latter will also be asked to volunteer.

      Patients will be stratified into three groups:

        -  Sepsis

        -  SIRS of non-septic origin

        -  Other ICU patients

      Routine laboratory data and clinical data (see flow sheet) will be collected. The plasma or
      serum will be frozen separately until the target number of patients is met. Measurements of
      inflammatory mediators and other cytokines/injury markers will be carried out at that point.
