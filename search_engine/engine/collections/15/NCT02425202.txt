      or obstructive sleep apnea AND are to be admitted into a monitored setting will be recruited
      for this study. They will be randomized into two groups:1) Control group receiving continuous
      infusion of saline (placebo) and 2) Study group receiving continuous infusion of low-dose
      ketamine at 0.1 mg/kg/hr. Both patients will receive scheduled oral acetaminophen and rescue
      intravenous morphine as required. The infusions will be stopped at 0600 the next morning.
      Morphine requirements, pain scores at selected times, central nervous system side effects,
      and adverse cardiorespiratory events will be recorded.
