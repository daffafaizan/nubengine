      dose and dosing schedule for G17DT in patients with Stage I-III gastric cancer. The highest
      dose tested in the GC2 study was 250µg. This dose was well tolerated but was not considered
      sufficiently immunogenic. Since tolerability had not constrained dosing up to 250µg, the GC5
      study was designed to investigate a 500µg dose administered as a regimen of 0, 2, and 6
      weeks.
