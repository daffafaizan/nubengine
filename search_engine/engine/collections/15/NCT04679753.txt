      treatment of Major Depressive Disorder using the iTBS stimulation protocol, by comparing it
      to clinical data collected in the Brainsway randomized, controlled Multicenter study
      (CTP-001-00), using the HF DTMS stimulation protocol used in support of the Brainsway DTMS
      device 510(k) K122288.

      In the post-marketing study, patients will be treated with an intermittent theta burst (iTBS)
      protocol, using the same Brainsway DTMS device with the same H1-Coil. Furthermore, the
      treatment paradigm is the same, consisting of TMS sessions performed daily for 5 weeks (20
      DTMS sessions). The iTBS stimulation protocol consists of bursts of 3 pulses at 50 Hz, 5 Hz
      bursts frequency, 2s on and 8s off, 600 pulses per session. The HF stimulation protocol was
      delivered at 18 Hz, 120% stimulation intensity of the resting MT, 55 trains of 2s duration,
      inter-train interval (ITI) of 20s, for 1980 pulses per session.

      The clinical study design includes multiple measurements of safety and effectiveness
      parameters.

      The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in HDRS-21 scores at the 5 week visit
      (after 20 treatment sessions). The success criteria of the study is a non-inferiority margin
      of 3.0 points.

      The secondary efficacy endpoints of the study include evaluation of the response and
      remission rates, based on HDRS-21 scores, at the 5 week visit, change in CGI-S score from
      baseline to 6 weeks and response and remission rates based on CGI-S scores at the 6 week
      visit.

      Safety will be assessed at each treatment visit. Patients will be asked to report any adverse
      event since their previous visit.
