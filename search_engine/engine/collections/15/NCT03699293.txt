      disease (CVD) or at higher CVD risk, has generated considerable concern among both patients
      and physicians because of knowledge gaps in the evidence relative to comparative safety and
      pharmacodynamic interactions between aspirin and NSAIDs. In the recently reported PRECISION
      trial, a moderate dose of celecoxib was found to be noninferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with
      respect to cardiovascular safety in patients with arthritis at increased CVD risk. At this
      time, no comparative prior data are available analyzing the effects of NSAIDs vs. Coxibs in
      the presence of aspirin on platelet function, biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial
      function.

      Thirty patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk or with
      established CV disease will be enrolled in the study. Patients taking anticoagulant therapy
      or any other antiplatelet agent other than aspirin will be excluded.

      Patients will be treated with immediate release 81mg aspirin for 4 weeks in the run-in period
      followed by randomization to celecoxib (200 mg bid) vs. naproxen sodium (550 mg bid) for 4
      weeks and then cross over to the other drug for another 4 weeks. Blood and urine samples will
      be collected at baseline before the aspirin run in period, 24±4 hr after the last dose of
      aspirin in the run in period, 24±4 hr after the last dose of the first period study drug and
      24±4 hr after the last dose of the second period study drug. Assays for platelet function,
      biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial function will be performed at these time points.
