      of them will be considered as study group and will wear a lycra suit, with shoulder, trunk
      and pelvis coverage, for more than 4 hours per day for 6 months. The other 5 will be
      considered as control group, matched for age and sex to the study group, and will not wear
      the lycra suit. The evaluation of static balance and the gross motor function measure will be
      used as outcome measure. The children of both groups will be assessed twice, at baseline and
      6 months after, each child acting as his/her own control.

      The motor function assessments will be performed without the Lycra suit, whereas the static
      balance assessments were performed with and without the suit.
