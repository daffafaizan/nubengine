      intervention program for frail older patients admitted to hospital. The specific aims are:

        -  To develop a model of integrated hospital care, according to the principle of the
           Chronic Care Model, focusing both on optimizing care and wellbeing. Feasibility of such
           a model of care was first evaluated in a pilot study.

        -  To conduct a before-after study to evaluate the outcomes associated with the proposed
           model of hospital care in frail older inpatients. Information on outcome indicators,
           including autonomy, quality of life, physical and cognitive functioning, and service
           utilization will be collected and compared before and after implementation of the
           proposed model of hospital care.

      We expect that older patients who participate in the intervention program after one year of
      implementation, compared to patients who were admitted to hospital before implementation of
      the intervention program, will:

        -  have less functional decline during admission and after three months follow-up compared
           to two weeks before admission;

        -  have a lower incidence, severity and duration of delirium during admission;

        -  have less cognitive decline during admission;

        -  are more likely to be discharged directly to their own homes;

        -  have less weight loss between admission and discharge;

        -  experience less falls during admission;

        -  experience less readmissions within one month after discharge;

        -  have a shorter length of stay;

        -  have a significant different pattern of use of health care services after three months
           follow-up;

        -  experience more autonomy during hospital admission and better quality of life after
           three months follow-up.

      Additionally, we expect that the knowledge and attitudes toward care for older patients among
      nurses and physicians will change positively during implementation of the intervention
      program.
