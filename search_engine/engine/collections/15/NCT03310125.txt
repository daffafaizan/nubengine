      thoracic surgery and is the most common perioperative cardiac arrhythmia. The incidence of
      perioperative AF in patients undergoing major thoracic surgery ranges from 10% in low-risk
      patients to as high as 20% in high-risk patients. The course of patients with perioperative
      AF is frequently complicated by hemodynamic instability, problems with managing
      anticoagulation in the early postoperative period, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital
      stays, and increased costs. Patients who develop perioperative AF (POAF) also have a
      significantly increased risk of death and stroke.

      Colchicine is an inexpensive drug and a highly effective anti-inflammatory agent that holds
      great potential for preventing POAF in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Data from
      cardiac surgery patients suggest that prevention of POAF using colchicine is feasible, but
      whether this concept is also applicable to patients undergoing thoracic surgery, where the
      risk of POAF is lower and underlying mechanisms may be different, is currently unclear. The
      'Colchicine for the prevention of perioperative AF' (COP-AF) trial has been designed as a
      large randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to determine whether colchicine, a
      potent, safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory drug, lowers the risk of perioperative AF and
      other inflammatory complications in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. The primary
      objective of this trial is to determine whether a 10-day course of colchicine 0.5mg twice
      daily reduces the incidence of perioperative AF within 14 days after thoracic surgery.
