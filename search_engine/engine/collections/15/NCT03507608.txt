    
      This is a prospective, single-center, two-phase study to assess the efficacy of single
      pulsed-dose flutamide in creating DSBs (double strand breaks) in prostate cancer within
      patients receiving central androgen suppression and brachytherapy. The initial phase is a
      6-patient single-arm run-in phase to test feasibility and rule out futility of the
      intervention. All patients within the run-in phase will receive 50mg flutamide prior to
      brachytherapy and prostatic biopsy. If futility is ruled out (>1 patients with DSBs on
      biopsy), then accrual will continue in the randomized, double-blind phase. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio (12:6 patients), for an all-trial total of 18 patients receiving
      flutamide vs 6 patients receiving placebo.
