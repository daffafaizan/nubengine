      receive sequential chemoradiotherapy (induction chemotherapy + intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy + adjuvant chemotherapy) or induction chemotherapy plus concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is given as 2.2 Gy per fraction
      with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks to a total dose of 66 or 70.4 Gy to the
      primary tumor. The induction or adjuvant chemotherapy is given gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1,8)
      and cisplatin (25mg/m² d1-3) every 3 weeks for two cycles. The concurrent chemotherapy is
      given cisplatin 30 mg/m² every week concurrently with IMRT. Our primary endpoint is
      failure-free survival(FFS) and grade III mucositis during radiation. Secondary end points
      include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), distant
      failure-free survival (D-FFS) rates and toxic effects. All efficacy analyses are conducted in
      the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who
      receive their randomly assigned treatment.
