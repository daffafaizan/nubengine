      I. To determine the rate of partial nephrectomy in patients with primary renal tumors
      otherwise requiring radical nephrectomy after neoadjuvant pazopanib treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tumor diameter/volume change, conversion of hilar to non-hilar
      tumors and surgical morbidity of neoadjuvant pazopanib for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily for up to 18 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo either partial or radical
      nephrectomy at least 7 days after completion of pazopanib hydrochloride.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
