      using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in our previous
      studies. The investigators have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived
      from DEPDC1, DEPDC1-9-294, and MPHOSPH1, MPHOSPH1-9-278. These epitopes showed strong IFN-g
      production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressed the appropriate protein and
      HLA-A*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after
      the vaccination. Therefore we focused on the prevention of the recurrence of the bladder
      cancer after surgery using these peptides.
