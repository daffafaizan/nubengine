      annually are suffering an acute exacerbation of a primary headache disorder. Of these acute
      primary headaches, migraine is the most frequently encountered disease entity in the ED,
      accounting for 60% of primary headaches, followed by tension-type headaches, which represent
      10% of all primary headaches seen in the ED. About Â¼ of all acute primary headaches seen in
      the ED cannot readily be given a specific diagnosis3. Multiple parenteral treatments are used
      to treat acute primary headaches1, but to date, regardless of specific headache diagnosis, no
      medication eliminates the frequent recurrence of headache after ED discharge. To date, it is
      unknown which medication patients should be given when discharged from an ED after treatment
      for a primary headache. This study will compare two oral headache treatments to determine
      which one relives pain more effectively.

      Specific aims:

      1) To determine which of two oral medications is more efficacious for all acute primary
      headache patients who are discharged from an ED.

      Primary hypotheses:

      In the 48 hour period following ED treatment for a primary headache, sumatriptan 100mg will
      relieve pain better than naproxen 500mg, as measured by an 11-point numerical rating scale
      for pain.
