      the intervention or control group. Eligible participants were recruited by a simple
      randomization method, proportional to the total number of teachers at each school. Those in
      the intervention group (n=75 teachers) were compared to the control group (n=75 teachers) at
      baseline, as well as at 6 weeks and 3 months post-intervention.
