      indwelling catheter that allows measurement of central venous oxygen saturation. Measurements
      of central venous oxygen saturation using blood oximetry will be compared with measures of
      tissue oxygenation at the buccal mucosa using a Raman spectroscopy tissue oximeter.
      Investigators will also measure the status of the sublingual microcirculation utilizing
      sidestream dark field microscopy. Basic demographic and clinical variables such as ongoing
      vasoactive infusions, mechanical ventilation, and laboratory data will also be collected.
