      level and function, including subsequent stimulation of T cell responses, in various human
      subjects with demonstrated myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) and T cell deficiency.

      Single center nonrandomized trial with an interrupted time series design involving measures
      on blood samples from three separate populations before and after administration of
      sargramostim.

      The objective is to determine the safety and dose response of sargramostim administration in
      healthy participants and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney
      transplants.

      Additionally to determine whether reversal of mDC/T cell deficiency by sargramostim results
      in augmented T cell responses in these three groups.
