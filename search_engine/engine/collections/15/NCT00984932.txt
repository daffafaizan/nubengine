      of systemic sclerosis (SSc); difficult to manage with a poor prognosis.

      Although the aetiology of SSc-PAH remains elusive, vascular dysfunction seems to be the
      initial event.

      Statins, through their pleotropic effects might be of value in the treatment armamentarium of
      PAH related to SSc.

      Objectives: The aim was to assess the efficacy of rosuvastatin in ameliorating vascular
      dysfunction and in the management of SSc-related PAH.

      Methods: Forty SSc patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for the classification of SSc
      diagnosis and having PAH were recruited.

      All SSc patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography and the six minute walk test
      (SMWT).

      Patients were randomized into 2 groups; the first group (n = 23) were assigned to receive
      40mg of rosuvastatin and the second group (n = 23) received placebo for 6 months.

      The levels of endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory markers were assayed at baseline and
      after 6 months of therapy. Outcome measures assessed included exercise capacity (SMWT), MPAP,
      WHO functional class change, tolerability and safety.
