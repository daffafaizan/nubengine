      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate, in terms of change in measurable disease or
           prostate-specific antigen levels, in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic
           prostate cancer treated with isotretinoin, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, docetaxel,
           and estramustine phosphate sodium.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on bcl-2 family proteins in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cell samples obtained from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral isotretinoin once daily on days 1-4, recombinant interferon
      alfa-2b subcutaneously once daily on days 1-4, oral estramustine phosphate sodium three times
      daily on days 1-5, and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are acquired via blood draw at baseline and on days 2, 3,
      or 4 and analyzed for bcl-2 protein by IHC and electrophoresis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
