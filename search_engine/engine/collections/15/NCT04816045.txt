    
      This is a phase 2 randomized controlled trial. The study is blinded. The aim of this study is
      to establish the safety and efficacy of treating patients with early colorectal cancer with
      electrochemotherapy, compared with electroporation alone, as a down staging and
      immune-response enhancing treatment prior to intended curative surgery. The study involves
      recruitment of patients with histologically verified rectal and sigmoid colon cancer with no
      indication for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (experimental or standard care based) prior to
      intended curative surgery. In total the study will involve 24 patients, of these, 12 patients
      are treated with electrochemotherapy (bleomycin) and 12 patients with electroporation alone
      (placebo)

      In relation to the intervention, clinical examination, blood samples, biopsies and
      questionnaires will be collected to evaluate safety, tumor respons and immunologic response
      to the treatment.

      Patients will be followed for one month after the elective surgery.
