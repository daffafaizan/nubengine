      for physicians, cardiologists, internists (not specialized sleep experts) would fill this
      need. It allows for a reliable first screening for their patients in parallel with a routine
      cardiological examination. Imposing a minimal human and material, the ECG Holter recorder
      "VistaO2 FLUX" (NOVACOR, Rueil-Malmaison, France) is a device designed to meet these
      requirements. This device fits into the daily management of patients with cardiac arrhythmias
      or sinus/atrioventricular conduction disorders, and of patients suffering myocardial
      infarction (arrhythmic risk stratification, detection of silent myocardial ischemia).

      Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has already shown interest in screening SAHS. We
      therefore wish to evaluate the performance of the analysis of data from the screening tool
      VistaO2 FLUX face what the gold standard synchronized polysomnography.
