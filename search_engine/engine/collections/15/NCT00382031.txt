    
      This is an open parallel group trial. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 manner to receive
      either treatment with zalutumumab in combination with Best Supportive Care (BSC) or BSC.

      Patients randomized to treatment with zalutumumab in combination with BSC will receive weekly
      infusions with zalutumumab starting with a loading dose (8mg/kg) followed by weekly
      maintenance doses until disease progression, intercurrent illness preventing further
      administration, unacceptable toxicity or patient decision. After Visit 2 the patient should
      be evaluated for presence of skin rash prior to each infusion to allow dose titration.

      Individual dose titration until the patient develops grade 2 skin rash will be applied. The
      maximum dose used in study will be 16 mg/kg.
