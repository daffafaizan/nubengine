      intravenously every 3 weeks (week 1, week 4, week 7 and week 10).

      After 12 weeks of treatment, breast surgery will be performed (either a lumpectomy or a
      mastectomy).

      Once patients have recovered from the surgery, they will receive adriamycin and cytoxan every
      3 weeks for 4 cycles (12 weeks total).

      After Herceptin and Taxol therapy, tumor assessment will be performed along with an
      echocardiogram and mammogram.

      At the time of surgery, re-assessment of the tumor will be done.

      Blood work will be performed on day one of each chemotherapy cycle.
