      laboratory studies. Then, each patient receives treatment with one of two doses of
      3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) or placebo for six months.

      Primary hypothesis: DITPA will improve cardiovascular function and clinical status in
      patients with moderately severe heart failure and be similar to placebo on safety measures.

      Secondary hypothesis:

      Primary Outcomes: 1. Composite endpoint composed of cardiovascular mortality/morbidity,
      change in NYHA class and change in global assessment, and 2. safety.

      Study Abstract: Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects 4-5 million Americans, and its
      prevalence is predicted to increase over the next few decades. Thyroid hormone has unique
      actions which make it a novel and potentially useful agent for treatment of CHF. Due to
      possible adverse effects of thyroid hormone, there is interest in developing analogs with
      fewer undesirable side effects. DITPA has been shown to improve diastolic function in both
      animal models and a recently completed double-blind placebo controlled trial in 19 humans.

      The goal of the proposed Phase II study is to define the dose of DITPA needed to achieve
      hemodynamic improvement in patients with CHF. This study is a prerequisite for a larger Phase
      III trial which would determine whether mortality is improved with DITPA. To better define
      the appropriate doses, prior to the Phase II study we will conduct an initial pharmacokinetic
      study.
