      predicted spirometric normal values in Bolivia, 500 healthy men and women, non-smokers will
      be recruited to perfom spirometry using following the actual ATS/ERS 2005 guidelines.

      The spirometer is a Bodybox 5500 (Medisoft, Belgium). The tests will be performed by a
      highly-trained pneumologist, Dr A. Ajata.

      Anthropometric variables recorded: age, sex, weight, standing and sitting height.

      Spirometric variables recorded: FEV1, FVC, PEF, FEV6, FEF25,50,75 and MEF Statistical anaysis
      will be done using R and SPSS softwares. Predicted equations will be compared with existing
      ones, especially the new GLI-2012 predicted equations.
