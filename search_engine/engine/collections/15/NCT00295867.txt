      Primary

        -  Determine the response of bone marrow micrometastases, as measured by
           immunocytochemistry/flow cytometry (IC/FC), during and after 2 years of treatment with
           zoledronate in women with stage I-III breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the effects of zoledronate on the bone osteoclast activation marker,
           n-telopeptide, in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the incidence of distant recurrences in high-risk women with early-stage breast
           cancer and bone marrow micrometastases who receive adjuvant zoledronate.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes once a month for 2 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
