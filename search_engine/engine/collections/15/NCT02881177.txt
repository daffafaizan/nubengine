      leads to significant health disparities, including increased risk for HIV sero-conversion.
      Reducing methamphetamine use mitigates HIV risk. Currently no psychopharmacological agent
      exists for the treatment of AUD; innovative interventions are desperately needed. Oxytocin, a
      social neuropeptide, has well-studied anti-addiction effects in animal models of substance
      dependence. The use of intranasal oxytocin for a variety of human substance use disorders is
      under early investigation, although no one has studied oxytocin's effects in AUD. In other
      populations, oxytocin's effects are known to vary depending on social context. Psychosocial
      treatment alone has been shown to reduce methamphetamine and HIV risk in MSM at a
      community-based clinic in San Francisco, The Stonewall Project. The investigators propose a
      randomized, double-blind pilot study of psychopharmacological-psychosocial combination
      therapy, administration of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo prior to six Motivational
      Interviewing Group Therapy (MIGT) sessions, in 28 mixed HIV sero-status MSM initiating
      treatment for AUD. The investigators aim to assess: 1) tolerability, 2) feasibility for
      larger randomized controlled trials, and 3) exploratory measures of efficacy, including: a)
      urine levels of methamphetamine and metabolites, b) methamphetamine craving, c) engagement in
      MIGT through third-party coding of videotaped group sessions and self-reported measures of
      group connectedness, d) psychophysiological stress responses to group engagement, and e)
      sexual risk taking.
