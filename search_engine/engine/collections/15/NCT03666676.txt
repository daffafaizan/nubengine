      loss. Tests will first focus on sensitivity to changes in fast changes in amplitude
      (loudness) or frequency (pitch) in sounds. Then the investigators will test the
      intelligibility of synthetic vowels and syllables in which these "chirps" are manipulated.
      Finally, the investigators will test intelligibility of words in noise while manipulating
      sounds in an effort to improve clarity.
