      complete cessation of breathing due to pharyngeal obstruction. Untreated, it has been
      strongly associated with daytime sleepiness, hypertension, depression, coronary artery
      disease, stroke, and even death. It is estimated that up to 25% of men and 9% of women may
      suffer from this condition. One proposed mechanism of pharyngeal obstruction is that the
      posterior tongue is susceptible to collapse when supine during sleep, which causes further
      collapse of the soft palate and related structures. Treatment includes continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP), mandibular advancement devices, and various surgical options. There
      are many surgical options for treating tongue base collapse, many of which are morbid with
      significant pain and discomfort involved. Silhouette Sutures (Kolster Methods, Inc.) are
      designed to hold and grip soft tissues using intermittently placed dissolvable cones spaced
      by knots. It has been used widely for years for facial cosmetic procedures with excellent
      results and safety record. This is a pilot study evaluating the practicality and efficacy of
      using Silhouette Sutures in an innovative, minimally invasive technique that obviates the
      need for more aggressive and morbid procedures for obstructive sleep apnea.
