      couples in developing countries.The emergence of assisted reproductive techniques such as in
      vitro fertilization (IVF) gives infertile couples the opportunity to have both pregnancy and
      a baby. Couples are affected emotionally during IVF treatment and women experience more
      problems than men. The majority of women experience emotional problems such as anxiety and
      depression because of infertility, invasive treatment procedures, physiological effects of
      gonadotropin stimulation and positive outcome expectation.Considering the effect of anxiety
      and depression on infertile women, it is important to examine the effectiveness of
      progressive muscle relaxation exercises and laughter therapy as complementary therapy in
      psychosocial care.
