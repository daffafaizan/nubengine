      industrialized countries during the past two decades, representing a substantial disease
      burden of individuals and health service cost. Early life nutritional exposures could modify
      the gene expression and susceptibility of allergic diseases (AD), yet the effects of early
      life polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ruminant trans fatty acids (R-TFA) on AD remain
      unclear.Therefore,the investigators performed the meta-analysis and systematic review to
      evaluate whether early life natural exposure to PUFA and R-TFA affects the AD risk.
