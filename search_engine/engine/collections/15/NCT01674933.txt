      plus treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only in preventing any further dental decay.

      Thus the study is a clinical trial of treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU plus fluoride
      varnish in the nursery school setting. TAU is the core Childsmile Nursery intervention
      (supervised daily toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste, free dental packs of fluoride
      toothpaste, toothbrushes and advice).

      Children will be screened by asking parents whether or not the child has previously been
      hospitalised with asthma or diagnosed with any allergies. Provided that a child has no
      contraindications to fluoride varnish then the child can proceed to study inclusion. On the
      day of the planned application, the dental nurse will carry out a risk assessment to reduce
      the possibility of children with oral/facial infections being included. After excluding
      non-eligible children, a baseline dental examination will take place, followed by
      randomisation into treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus fluoride varnish. This
      second group will receive up to four fluoride varnish applications at 6 month intervals.
      After two years, all study children will be offered a final dental examination.
