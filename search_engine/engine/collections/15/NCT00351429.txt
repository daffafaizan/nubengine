      polyglycolic acid suture is the synthetic absorbable suture used in wound closure in
      ophthalmology, cardiology, neurology and plastic & reconstructive surgeries. In
      ophthalmology, PGA sutures are used in Trabeculectomy (Glaucoma), Orbit and Oculoplasty, Lid
      and Socket Reconstruction, Squint, ptosis and retinal detachment surgeries.

      Glaucoma patients who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. Uniform
      surgery and suturing technique was performed in all patients (Trabeculectomy with IOL
      implantation). Surgeon assessed suture characteristics during surgery and wound integrity at
      the end of surgery.

      Patients were followed up during 1 day, 1 month and 3 months post operatively. Visual acuity,
      Intraocular Pressure (IOP), suture characteristics, wound integrity, inflammation and
      conjunctival status were examined during each follow up visit.
