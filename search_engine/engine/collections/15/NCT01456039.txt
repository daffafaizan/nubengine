    
      This is a Phase 1/2, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm trial with two phases. The first
      phase is a 3 + 3 dose escalation phase to determine a recommended dose for treating patients
      with Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) or Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) based on the
      assessment of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).The second phase will assess efficacy at the
      recommended dose by measuring objective response [Complete Response (CR), Unconfirmed
      Complete Response (CR(u)) or Partial Response (PR)] and determining best overall response of
      each patient. Phase 1 will enroll a maximum of 12 patients and Phase 2 will enroll up to
      approximately 40 patients
