      Eligible patients will attend the study site on the day prior to infusion (Day -1) for a
      baseline visit. On Day 0, FLT190 will be administered as a single dose, slow intravenous
      infusion. Following FLT190 treatment the patient will be discharged from the investigational
      site and will continue to be monitored at outpatient visits for a period of 9 months;
      following which, the patient will enter a period of long-term follow-up conducted under a
      separate protocol.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts;

      Part 1: Enrolment of previously treated patients (Dose escalation)

      Part 2: Enrolment of previously untreated patients (Dose expansion).
