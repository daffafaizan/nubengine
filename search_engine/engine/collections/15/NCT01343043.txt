        -  Patients will undergo apheresis at the enrolling institution. PBMC will be shipped to a
           central manufacturer for gene transduction, activation and expansion, then cryopreserved
           and shipped back to the enrolling institution.

        -  The trial seeks to enroll up to 65 patients, that is, up to 20 patients in Cohort 1 and
           up to 15 patients in Cohorts 2-4. Depending on the cohort patients are enrolled in,
           patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide with or without fludarabine.

             -  Cohort 1: Complete

             -  Cohort 2: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 10 evaluable
                patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with
                cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine on Days -3 and -2, and without fludarabine on
                Days -5 and -4.

             -  Cohort 3: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 10 evaluable
                patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with
                cyclophosphamide only on Days -3 and -2. (Cohort Complete)

             -  Cohort 4: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 5 evaluable
                patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with
                cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine on Days -7 to -5.

      On Day 0, patients ≥40 kg will receive the minimum cell dose of at least 1x10⁹ transduced
      NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells with a maximum of 6x10⁹ transduced cells. The target dose for this
      protocol is 5x10⁹ transduced NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells. Patients <40 kg will be dosed per body
      weight with a minimum 0.025x10⁹ transduced cells/kg, with a target dose of 0.125 x10⁹
      transduced cells/kg.

        -  Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and immune endpoints.

        -  Patients who have a confirmed response, or have stable disease for >3 months then
           progress may receive a 2nd T cell infusion, provided eligibility criteria are met. The
           2nd treatment cell infusion will be administered in the same manner as the first.
           Patients who meet the eligibility criteria may receive a 2nd infusion of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T
           no sooner than 60 days and no later than 2 years following completion of the first
           treatment.
