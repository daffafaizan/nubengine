      mechanisms of this injury have not been clearly defined. A recent study by the Principle
      Investigator identified differences in leg alignment when a single leg landing during a
      sports activity resulted in a torn ACL and when it did not (provocative versus control
      alignment, respectively).

      The purpose of the study is to quantify the tibiofemoral alignment in the lateral compartment
      of the knee in the provocative landing position and the control landing position. in order to
      elucidate possible mechanisms of ACL injury Material and Methods: 25 normal controls will be
      recruited from the greater Washington DC population. Magnetic resonance images in the
      sagittal plane will be acquired for a single leg of each subject. These images will cover the
      lateral compartment of the knee and will be acquired with the leg in three positions, one
      that emulates the injury position, one that exagerrates the injury position, and one that
      emulates the control landing position. Statistical analysis of the measurements between the
      provocative, exagerrated provocative, and control positions will then be performed.

      These insights could then be applied to improving training focused on reducing the incidences
      of ACL rupture; improving bracing designs to help athletes most at risk of ACL rupture or
      those recovering from ACL injury/surgery; and improving ACL replacement surgeries.
