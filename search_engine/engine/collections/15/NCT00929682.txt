      emerged to lower risk / efficacy ratio, by using low-concentrated and/or less toxic local
      anaesthetics. Levobupicaine emerges as a safer alternative than its racemic parent . It is
      available on the French market in pre-filled bags with two different concentrations (0.625
      and 1.25 mg.mL-1), both indicated for analgesia in postoperative context and in labour,
      without more precision. Presentation in bags allows preparing once at the initiation of
      epidural analgesia a solution usable throughout labour, leading the anaesthetist to a
      univocal choice, mostly following his/her personal beliefs. Our aim is to compare the effects
      of epidural analgesia under these two presentations. Sufentanil will be added to
      levobupicaine whatever the concentration used. This trial is conducted in primiparous, in
      which pain during labour is commonly more resistant to relief.
