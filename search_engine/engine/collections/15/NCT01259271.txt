    
      Single center, single blind, randomized, crossover design, sham controlled pilot study using
      Selective Nerve Stimulation (SNS) signal for nerve modulation with three amplitudes
      (supra-threshold,sub-threshold and sham)

      The primary objective of this proof of concept study is to:

      â€¢ Evaluate median nerve modulation with selective nerve stimulation amplitudes
      (supra-threshold, sub-threshold, and sham) by means of objective quantitative sensory tests
      (QST) and Sensory Nerve Conduction Threshold Tests (sNCTs) in healthy subjects.

      The secondary objectives to be evaluated in this study are to:

        -  Establish device safety profile

        -  Evaluate patient reported sensory descriptions and perception during modulation
