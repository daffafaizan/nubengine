      150 mg/day is more effective than placebo treatment in reducing fatigue in patients receiving
      taxane chemotherapy alone or in combination with other agents by comparing the change from
      Screening cycle to treatment cycle (cycle 2) in the patient's average daily rating of their
      worst fatigue severity during the past 24 hours. In addition, the change in the percentage of
      days with severe fatigue and the mean Brief Fatigue Inventory scores were to be recorded.
