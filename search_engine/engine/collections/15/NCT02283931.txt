      uterus can compress the inferior vena cava, impeding venous return and thereby reducing
      stroke volume and cardiac output.

      The 2014 Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology consensus statement on the
      management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy, and the 2010 American Heart Association guideline
      on maternal cardiac arrest recommend relieving aortocaval compression during chest
      compressions by performing uterine displacement There is currently little information
      regarding the hemodynamic differences amongst the recommended uterine displacement
      techniques. Previous studies examining the hemodynamic effects of uterine displacement
      maneuvers have focused on incidence of hypotension and use of ephedrine.

      Noninvasive cardiac output monitoring (NICOM) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are
      becoming popular techniques in anesthesiology because they can provide noninvasive, valid,
      and precise hemodynamic data.There has been no study specifically examining the hemodynamic
      differences between the uterine displacement techniques using NICOM or TTE. While all three
      uterine displacement techniques are recommended, whether one technique may maximize maternal
      cardiac output is currently unknown.
