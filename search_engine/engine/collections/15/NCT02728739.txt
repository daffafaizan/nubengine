      palpitations and irregular heart beats) will be assessed by the Research Team. The level of
      BNP will be checked using a small device (i-STAT BNP) at the bedside. If results of the test
      suggest HF they will undergo special procedure called transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).
      TTE is an ultrasound scan of the heart which will enable the investigators' to grade severity
      of Mitral Regurgitation (MR) as well as strength of the heart muscle. The investigators will
      use bi-plane Simpton's method to calculate left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF).
      Colour Doppler and PISA method will be used to quantify severity of MR or valve leak.
      Simultaneously there will be recording of heart sounds to find out if auscultation is
      reliable in identifying leaky valves.
