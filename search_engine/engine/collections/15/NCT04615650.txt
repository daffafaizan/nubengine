    
      Suprasyndesmotic fractures (Weber type C) are historically treated operatively because of the
      assumption that the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis is ruptured, leading to joint instability
      (Lauge-Hansen 1950, Boden 1989).

      However, the medial deltoid ligament may function as the main stabiliser of the ankle joint
      by preventing external rotation of the talus and therefore maintains the dynamic congruity
      (Michelson 2007). Due to the stabilising effect of the deltoid ligament, an increasing number
      of transsyndesmotic fractures (Weber type B) are treated non-operatively with excellent
      results and without the burden of complications that accompany surgery (Gougoulias 2017,
      Mittal 2017, Bauer 1985).

      The aims of the present study are to test the stability of suprasyndesmotic ankle fractures
      on weight-bearing radiographs and to evaluate the effect of non-operative versus operative
      treatment of stable suprasyndesmotic fractures.

      The patients will have a weight-bearing (at least 50% of body weight) standing radiograph for
      the evaluation of the stability of the fracture. Patients with a congruent ankle mortise
      (i.e., stable fracture) on weight-bearing radiographs will be randomised to either operative
      (ORIF, reference treatment) or non-operative treatment (cast). Patients in both groups are
      allowed full weight-bearing.

      Patients with an incongruent ankle mortise (i.e., unstable fracture) will be treated
      operatively according to current clinical practice and included in a parallel observational
      cohort study. Patients who are unwilling to participate in the intervention study are also
      invited to participate in the observational cohort study.
