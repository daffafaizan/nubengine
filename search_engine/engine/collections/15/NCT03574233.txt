      and ventilator-associated lung injury, longer intensive care unit and hospital days,
      increased mortality, and higher medical costs. However, some patients are difficult to wean
      from invasive mechanical ventilation. Typically, the difficulty in transitioning patients to
      spontaneous breathing may be categorized as simple transition, difficult transition, and
      prolonged transition.

      There are a lot of predictors for weaning failure such as cardiac dysfunction, increased
      respiratory rate, diaphragm dysfunction, rapid shallow breathing index and so on. However,
      weaning failure involves complicated mechanisms that are not solved by one cause. Recently,
      P. Mayo published a review paper on ultrasonography evaluation during the weaning process.
      The investigators need to pay attention to this paper. While lots of previous predictors
      cannot explain the reason, ultrasound evaluation is a process of finding the cause as well as
      prediction for weaning failure. However, The investigators need a more practical and
      standardized ultrasound protocols for how to wean invasive mechanical ventilation.
      "Ultrasonographic mechanical weaning protocol" should not comprise just one indicator, but
      include various indicators such as upper airway stenosis, heart function, the status of the
      lung and pleura, diaphragmatic function, Etc. This integrated ultrasound protocol will help
      in successful weaning of invasive mechanical ventilation.
