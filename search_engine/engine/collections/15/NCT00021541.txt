      isoprenylation of ras and other farnesylated proteins. The ras proteins are integral in cell
      signaling pathways, and farnesylation is essential for the function of both mutant and
      non-mutant ras proteins. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk
      of developing tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, and there are no standard
      treatment options, other than surgery, available for these tumors. Neurofibromin, which is
      the product of the NF1 gene, contains a domain with significant homology to ras
      GTPase-activating proteins (GAP). Although NF1 patients lack germline ras mutations, the
      decreased levels of neurofibromin have been shown to be associated with a constitutively
      activated ras-GTP status. Thus, upstream inhibition of ras farnesylation may inhibit growth
      of tumors in NF1 patients. A randomized, cross-over, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
      pediatric phase II trial of oral R115777 will be performed in children and young adults with
      NF1, who have progressive, plexiform neurofibroma(s) to determine the effect of this novel
      anticancer drug on the rate of growth of neurofibromas. The endpoint of the trial is time to
      progression. R115777 will be administered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m(2) twice daily for
      cycles of 21 days followed by a 7 day rest period based on the results of our prior pediatric
      phase I trial.
