      Allocation: Randomised Endpoint Classification: Safety / Efficacy Study Intervention Model:
      Parallel Assignment Masking: Double blind (Subject / CHF team). The interventional operator,
      will have no role in care of the patient following randomisation.

      Primary Purpose: Treatment

      Chronic Systolic Heart Failure

      Device: Renal denervation (Symplicity Catheter System) Symplicity Catheter System

      -Intervention: Device: Renal denervation (Symplicity Catheter System)

      Patients are randomised in the cath lab to receive either renal denervation or sham
      procedure.

      Experimental arm: Renal Denervation Control arm: No renal denervation (sham procedure)

      In both arms, aftercare is provided by clinicians who are blinded to the randomised
      allocation arm. Subjects will have been recruited on stable heart failure therapy, and the
      intention is to maintain this therapy steady during followup.
