      PDR. Different types of laser such as xenon, krypton, argon, red diode and green diode can be
      used for this treatment. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) showed the
      benefit of early treatment of PDR and of macular edema with laser photocoagulation.

      However, several studies have reported loss of visual field after laser photocoagulation of
      the bilateral full-scatter type (PRP) due to the expansion of the thermal injury, possibly
      even compromising the ability to drive automotive vehicles according to the standards of the
      transit authorities of some countries. Thus, this implies a greater impact on the quality of
      life of the patient, especially if he is a young diabetic.6

      The objective of new laser photocoagulation technologies is to provide a treatment that will
      permit the development of a regenerative response of photoreceptors and of the retinal
      pigment epithelium (RPE) with the minimum loss of photoreceptors and the minimum cicatricial
      expansion of the thermal injury on the targeted RPE.7

      The PASCAL photocoagulator (OptiMedica, Santa Clara, California) (a standard scanning laser)
      was introduced in 2005 for retinal photocoagulation. The device functions as if it partially
      automated the procedure by means of a shorter laser pulse (short pulse strategy) combined
      with multiple simultaneous firings in a pattern, performing the procedure within a shorter
      period of time and with less damage to the outer retina or the RPE, in addition to providing
      better patient comfort.8

      Regarding combined therapy, the combination of intravitreous injection of ranibizumab with
      PRP (ETDRS) proved to be more promising in terms of improved visual acuity, stability of
      macular thickness and a greater regression rate of neovessel areas than the use of PRP alone
      (ETDRS) in patients with high risk PDR.1

      Thus, in the present study we would like to determine which would be the best therapeutic
      combination of laser and an anti-VEGF drug for our patients, or whether treatment with an
      anti-VEGF drug alone would be better in terms of the anatomical and functional parameters
      proposed.
