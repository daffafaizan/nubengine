      response. The magnitude of the resulting inflammatory response is proportional to the
      severity of the tissue trauma. Abdominal or laparoscopic technique is widely used for the
      purpose of hysterectomy surgery. It is crucial for many aspects to compare these two
      techniques of hysterectomy in terms of the surgery-induced trauma.

      In this study, the severity of the inflammatory response resulting from the tissue trauma due
      to the techniques of TLH+BSO and TAH+BSO applied in our department were compared based on the
      PTX-3 molecule.
