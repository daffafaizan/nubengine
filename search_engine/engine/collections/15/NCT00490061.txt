      predictors for prognosis in HNSCC. EGFR blockade with a monoclonal antibody in conjunction
      with radiotherapy has been shown to improve survival over radiotherapy alone in patients with
      locally advanced HNSCC. Dual inhibition of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases results in greater
      inhibitory effect of the downstream signaling pathways in cancer cells than inhibition of
      either receptor alone. Phase I studies in HNSCC suggested that the drug is well tolerated
      when delivered either alone or concurrently with cisplatin based chemoradiotherapy in HNSCC.

      We propose to combine lapatinib with RT alone in patients with locally advanced HNSCC who
      cannot tolerate chemotherapy. The main objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of
      combining concurrent radiation and lapatinib in terms of time-to-progression (TTP) in this
      group of patients. In addition, we will determine the 2-year locoregional control rate (LRC),
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in these patients. We will also
      evaluate the profile and frequency of late toxicity, specifically mucosal and dermatologic
      toxicity, of the combination of lapatinib and RT in patients with locally advanced HNSCC.
