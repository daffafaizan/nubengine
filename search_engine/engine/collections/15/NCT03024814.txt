      neonates with a gestational age of less than or equal 32 weeks and a birth weight of less
      than or equal 1500 g, and will randomly assigned to two treatment groups (see below).

      Infants will be randomized to equal-sized groups using block randomization with blocks of
      four. Stratified randomization for gender and gestational age will be included in the
      randomized blocks. Gestational age will be divided into two categories: 23 weeks +0 day to 27
      weeks +6 days, and from 28 weeks +0 day to 32 weeks +6 days. Gender (2) Ã— gestational age (2)
      will give 6 strata, requiring 6 separate random number lists to achieve randomization.
