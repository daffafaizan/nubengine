    
      All patients who receive a TASH procedure in the Medical Clinic I routinely receive routinely
      implementation of arterial pressure catheter for invasive blood pressure monitoring (usually
      Arteria radialis) as well as a central venous catheter. Directly after the procedure, the
      blood is taken through the central venous catheter. The operation is then terminated as
      planned.

      The postoperative treatment is performed according to the Standard Operating Procedures
      (SOPs) of the Medical clinic I -regular blood sampling is performed to monitor the patient's
      cardiac, renal and hepatic lab values. The patient is released on the 3-5th post-operative
      day.

      As part of a routine outpatient visit to the Medical Clinic I 1 week and 1 month after the
      TASH procedure, an anamnestic record as well as a blood analysis is made. One month after the
      TASH procedure, an echocardiographic follow-up of the HOCM is routinely performed.

      Adverse events or serious adverse events are documented, assessed and reported in accordance
      with GCP (good clinical practice).
