      for pushing the dose rapidly while monitoring closely to ensure tolerability; and infusions
      integrated into the treatment in such a way as to potentially ameliorate spontaneous and
      precipitated withdrawal. The first part of the treatment trial involves receiving inpatient
      treatment for up to 5 days. Following week 1, participants will meet with staff twice weekly
      and receive 12 weeks of mindfulness based relapse prevention and motivational interviewing
      sessions.
