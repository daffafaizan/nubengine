      This study will attempt to assess the impact of cryotherapy on post-surgical inflammation and
      narcotic use. End-points for the study will be patient use of narcotics and pain level,
      regularly measured by nursing staff.

      Patient Selection:

      This study will accept all consecutive consenting patients who visit the Grady Hospital and
      Emory University urology clinics who require abdominal surgery.The study will require 55
      patients, based on prior power calculations.

      Registration/Randomization:

      Because this study will enroll all consenting patients, no registration is required. Patients
      will be enrolled by their urologist during a standard visit. With consent, the urologist will
      direct the patient to the researcher. Patients will be randomized to either cryotherapy or no
      adjunctive therapy following abdominal surgery.

      Therapy:

      Patients in the cryotherapy study group will have ice packs placed on their abdominal wound
      for 24 hours following surgery.After 24 hours, patients had the option of using ice packs for
      as long as they wished.

      Patient Assessment:

      Patients will be assessed by the nursing staff as they would otherwise be assessed
      postsurgically.

      Data Collection:

      During recovery time in the hospital, nurses will monitor both groups of patients as they do
      all patients. As with all patients, nurses will ask about pain levels and check the amount of
      narcotics you require for pain control. This study will not require any additional effort on
      patients' part. Once they are discharged, patient participation in the study will be
      complete.
