      354 young females who were in pubertal Stage II at the start of the study. The average age of
      study participants at entry was 11 years; at the end of the study participants were 18 years
      old.

      The study looks at skeletal development under the influence of heredity, nutrition (calcium),
      and physical exercise. We gave calcium to participants in one arm of this clinical trial
      calcium. Participants in the other arm of the trial were given a placebo. The main outcome
      variable is the bone mass measured at different skeletal regions.

      The study will also provide data about the efficacy of calcium supplementation with regard to
      hypertension prevention and obesity. The results of this research will be important in
      preventing osteoporosis.
