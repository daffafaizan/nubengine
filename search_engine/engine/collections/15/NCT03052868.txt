      chemotherapy treatment. At the study visit, informed consent will be obtained and
      neurocognitive attention testing will be performed. The assessments chosen were carefully
      selected based on breadth, psychometric properties, standardized broad clinical use, good
      external validity and time efficiency. The testing time for the battery of neuropsychological
      tests is approximately 45-60 minutes. Participants will also be asked to complete a packet of
      several questionnaires including several self-rated measures of mood and quality of life, in
      addition to a brief questionnaire to obtain information about exercise, sleep, and education
      and employment backgrounds. It is estimated that questionnaire completion will require no
      more than 30 minutes. Participants will be seen on only one occasion, and may receive, upon
      request, written feedback about the results of the evaluation.
