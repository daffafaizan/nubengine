      Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) criteria: BP > 140/90 on two occasions in previous
      normotensive mother after 20 weeks of gestation and one of the following; proteinuria in
      urine > 0.3 gram/kg/day or acute kidney or liver dysfunction or signs of uterine dysfunction.
      The onset of preeclampsia can be early before 34 weeks of pregnancy (Early-onset
      preeclampsia) or late after 34 weeks of pregnancy (Late-onset preeclampsia). Early-onset
      preeclampsia, especially between 28-32 weeks gestation, is characterized by a high prevalence
      of microvascular changes in the placenta that makes mothers and their infants are more liable
      to complication. The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is unclear.

      Preeclampsia affects hematopoiesis and the fetal myeloid lineage leading to thrombocytopenia,
      neutropenia, decrease phagocytic function, decrease T regulatory cells, and an increase in
      cytotoxic natural killer cells in neonates. Innate and adaptive immunity are regulated by
      myeloid cells and the immune changes in infants of preeclampsia mothers could lead to
      increased incidence of neonatal sepsis and the development of chronic inflammatory
      conditions.
