      determine if there are detectable lipid-lowering effects of oyster mushrooms in patients with
      HIV and hyperlipidemia who are taking Kaletra (a ritonavir-containing HAART regimen). The
      study will also assess whether the concurrent administration of oyster mushrooms and such
      regimens is safe, and investigate the mechanism of action whereby oyster mushrooms may exert
      their antihyperlipidemic effect.
