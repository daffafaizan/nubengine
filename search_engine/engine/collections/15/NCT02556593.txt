      whole-brain radiotherapy for EGFR wild type non-small cell lung cancer with 4-10 brain
      metastases.

      All patients recruited will be randomly assigned into two groups. Patients in experimental
      group will receive daily IMRT at 45 Gy in 15 fractions to brain metastases, combined with
      daily erlotinib of 150mg for three weeks. Patients in control group will receive daily
      whole-brain radiotherapy at 30 Gy in 10 fractions.
