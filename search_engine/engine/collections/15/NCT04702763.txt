      broadly on subclinical abnormalities of oculomotricity in multiple sclerosis (MS). However,
      the difficulty of accessing video-oculography platforms (or eye-tracking devices) is probably
      one of the main limitations to performing this type of assessment.

      To respond this problem, the "Resources and Skills Center-Multiple Sclerosis" (CRC SEP) team
      at the Nice University Hospital Center (France) has developed a mobile application (named
      e-VOG), usable on mobile phones or tablets, to measure eye movements. e-VOG reproduces the
      classic paradigms of video-oculography to collect data similar to standard video-oculography
      recording (saccade latency and speed, anti-saccade error rate, presence of fixation
      abnormalities).

      e-VOG will not replace standard video-oculography platforms, because its technical
      characteristics are not as high. But investigators hypothesize that this application could
      constitute a screening tool for subclinical oculomotor abnormalities, usable by neurologists
      in consultation, directly on their mobile, which would make it possible to select a smaller
      population of patients in whom a further exploration by standard video-oculography would be
      indicated.

      Memory Center of the Rainier III Gerontologic Center (Princess Grace Hospital - Monaco) is
      equipped with a standard video-oculography device, also named eye-tracking device
      (Eye-TrackerÂ®T2), which records eye movements at a high frequency and measures saccades
      parameters (latency, speed, amplitudes etc...).

      This study is a collaborative study between the Center Rainier III team and the CRC SEP team
      in Nice. Its objective will be to compare measurements obtained through the e-VOG application
      with measurements from the standard video-oculography device.
