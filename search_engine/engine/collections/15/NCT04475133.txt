      is accessible to the intervention. The theoretical basis of the technique is to produce
      specific controlled changes in the somatosensory system using synaptic plasticity, to
      ultimate affect the perception of pain through reduction of nociception afference.
      Subsequently, the protocols are based on synaptic physiology and the circuitry of the
      somatosensory system.

      The protocols are the following:

        1. - low-frequency and high-intensity of stimulation: 2hz during 16 min at an slightly
           annoying intensity, to induce synaptic depression on the c-fibers circuit, presumably
           carrying nociception.

        2. - high-frequency and low-intensity of stimulation: 100 hz in 5 second trains, separated
           by 1 min of no current with a perceptible but mild intensity, to induce potentiation of
           a-beta fibers, presumably englobing mechanoreceptors which inhibit nociception through
           gate control in the spinal cord.

        3. - placebo group has got the same intervention, but without current.

      The study design is an experimental clinical trial, with randomized order of intervention
      with repeated measurements. This means each subject is having the three protocols at
      randomized order, with a gap of at least two weeks between them. The study is triple-blinded.

      Somatomotor system variables, as sensory and pain pressure thresholds, grip strength, surface
      electromyographic activity and blood flow are evaluated on the hand of the subject. The arm
      to treat was also randomized for each subject The measurements are pre-intervention,
      post-intervention and 24 hours after the intervention for each protocol. Blood flow are
      measured only pre-intervention and post-intervention.
