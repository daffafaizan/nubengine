      infusion compared to multiple dose insulin injections in T1DM adult patients in routine
      clinical practice.

      All clinical variables are gathered from four EMR softwares (Mambrino XXI, Carelink Pro®,
      Emminens eConecta® and FreeStyle Libre®).

      Data analysis is conducted using SPSS (Chicago, IL) statistics software. Results are
      presented as mean ± SD values or percentages. A paired Student's t-test or a Wilcoxon
      signed-rank test were used for the analysis of differences. Comparisons between proportions
      were analyzed using a chi-squared test. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically
      significant.

      The protocol was approved by the reference Castilla-La Mancha Public Health Institute Ethic
      Committee. All participants provided written informed consent.
