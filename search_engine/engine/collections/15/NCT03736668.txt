      in a prospective cohort of 200 patients with type 2 diabetes and without known cardiac
      dysfunction and to search for possible differences in clinical profile depending on the
      presence and type of cardiac function's impairment.

      Patients will be classified into four categories according to the left ventricular function:

        -  Normal heart function

        -  Altered ejection fraction (<40%)

        -  Ejection fraction preserved (> 50%) with structural abnormality (left ventricular
           hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation) or diastolic dysfunction

        -  Moderately impaired ejection fraction "mid range" (40 to 49%)
