    
      To clinically evaluate the treatment of mandibular class II furcation defects with enamel
      matrix derivative (EMD) and/or a bone substitute graft make of beta tricalcium
      phosphate/hydroxyapatite (βTCP/HA). Forty-one patients, presenting a mandibular class II
      buccal furcation defect, probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 4 mm and bleeding on probing, will be
      included. They will be randomly assigned to the groups: 1- EMD (n = 13); 2- βTCP/HA (n = 14);
      3- EMD + βTCP/HA (n = 14). Relative gingival margin position (RGMP), relative vertical and
      horizontal attachment level (RVCAL and RHCAL) and PPD will be evaluated at baseline and 12
      months. The mean horizontal clinical attachment level gain will be considered the primary
      outcome variable.
