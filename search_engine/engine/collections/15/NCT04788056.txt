      Randomization will be achieved using a computer-generated randomization scheme. The surgeon,
      nurse, anesthetist and patient will be blinded. The investigational drug service will prepare
      blinded solutions (bupivacaine 0.2% or saline syringes) for performance of the block. They
      will also prepare bags (either bupivacaine 0.125% or saline) to be infused through the
      catheter.

      Following skin closure, but before removal of the surgical drapes, regional anesthesiologists
      will scrub in, gown and perform the placement of PSPB catheters under strict surgical aseptic
      technique. Real-time ultrasound (US) imaging will be used to visualize the pectoralis major
      muscle and its corresponding rib cartilages, and a needle/introducer sheath will be guided
      parasternally into the fascial plane. The needle will be advanced in the plane,
      hydro-dissecting with 30 mL of bupivacaine 0.2% in the study group or 30 mL of saline in the
      control group per side. Following hydro-dissection, a 5 in. multiport catheter will be
      inserted via the sheath, and the catheter will be secured following US confirmation of
      appropriate catheter position. This procedure will then be repeated on the other side. After
      completion of bilateral PSPB catheters, patients will remain intubated and be transferred to
      the CSICU on a sedation regimen at the discretion of the intraoperative anesthesia team. Upon
      dropping off to the ICU, each catheter will be attached to a programmable pump infusing plain
      bupivacaine 0.125% at 10 mL/hr or saline infusing at 10 mL/hr. Once again, the solution to be
      infused postoperatively will be prepared by pharmacy and blinded from the patient, nurse, and
      postoperative pain service providers.
