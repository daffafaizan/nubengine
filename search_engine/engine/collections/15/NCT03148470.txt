      Clinical observations and neuroimaging studies seem to confirm the role of executive
      functions and frontal structures in language processing in bilingual subjects.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, such as for example theta burst stimulation
      (TBS), is increasingly being used as a valuable tool for neuroscientists investigating the
      underlying mechanisms of cognitive functions. Case studies have shown a change in language
      switching after bilingual patients received repetitive magnetic stimulation to the left
      DLPFC. However, there is no study investigating the effect of TBS applied to the DLPFC on
      language switching in healthy participants.

      Procedure:

      A planned total of 40 unbalanced bilingual participants will be included. Half of the
      participants will receive inhibitory theta burst stimulation (continuous TBS), the other half
      excitatory theta burst stimulation (intermittent TBS). After TBS, different language and
      nonverbal tasks will be performed while an EEG is measured. Before being stimulated, each
      subject will conduct the same tasks with a sham-TBS as a baseline measure.
