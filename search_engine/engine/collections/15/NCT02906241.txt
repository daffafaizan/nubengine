    
      This research utilizes two distinct research designs to evaluate two separate behavioral
      interventions.

      The first is a between-subject randomized controlled trial to evaluate a patient-focused
      intervention. The intervention consists of a booklet designed to encourage patients to view
      themselves as part of the patient-physician team and to participate actively in clinical
      interactions by asking questions and stating concerns.

      The second is a within-subject interrupted time series design to evaluate a physician-focused
      intervention. The intervention is an educational module and email reminders designed to
      encourage physicians to discuss trials with all eligible patients using patient-centered
      communication.In the patient-focused intervention, patients are randomized to an intervention
      or usual care group, and comparison of outcomes is made between groups.
