      groups. Patients in group A will be intubated by videolaryngoscopy (GlideScope), patients in
      group B by direct laryngoscopy, in both groups will be rigid stylet used. Intubation will be
      done under propofol anesthesia, targeted entropy 40 to 50, and deep relaxation (neuromuscular
      transmission target level 0). Sufentanil will be used to block tracheal reflexes. In both
      groups the depth of insertion of tracheal tube will be measured in the mouth corner
      immediately after intubation. Next day, the unpleasant sensations and complications will be
      recorded (sore throat, stridor, hoarseness, cough and nausea and vomiting) during control
      visit of patients.
