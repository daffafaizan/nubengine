      pathophysiology of heart failure, including development of left ventricular hypertrophy and
      myocardial fibrosis. Preclinical data demonstrate the importance of HDAC inhibition in
      attenuating these pathological processes and maintaining the integrity of the myocardium.
      However, the role of HDACs in the human heart, and the utility of HDAC inhibition remains
      unknown. Therefore, a noninvasive method to detect HDAC activity in the human heart in
      healthy individuals and patients with heart disease may be of major medical and public health
      value to help determine prognosis, direct therapy, and guide the development of novel
      therapies for heart failure. The investigators have recently developed a novel radiotracer,
      11C-Martinostat, which binds with high affinity to class I HDACs. The objective of this
      protocol is to assess the utility of 11C-Martinostat PET-MR to detect HDAC expression in the
      hearts of healthy individuals and patients with severe aortic stenosis or diabetes.
