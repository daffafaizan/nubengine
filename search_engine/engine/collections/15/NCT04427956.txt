      the so-called "Dresden protocol". The Dresden protocol states 30 minutes of UVA-radiation
      (3mW/cm2) but a 10 minute irradiation protocol (9mW/cm2) is frequently used. Both of the
      protocols involve mechanical removal of the epithelium over the central 8 mm of the corneal
      surface. The first days after treatment therefore involves some degree of pain, often
      intense, and the presence of a healing epithelial defect may be associated with development
      of infiltrates in the cornea. A number of approaches have been evaluated in order to promote
      riboflavin penetration through the intact epithelium, of which iontophoresis appears most
      promising. Keratoconic corneas are thin at the cone location and sometimes it is difficult to
      maintain the safety margin of 400 microns during corneal crosslinking. Instead of using
      isotonic standard riboflavin, a swelling effect of the cornea can be obtained by using
      hypotonic riboflavin. However, the latter has been indicated as less effective in the process
      of inducing cross links.

      Ninety eyes of 90 patients of various degrees of keratoconus will be randomised to one of the
      following groups: 1) CXL (UVA 9mW/cm2) using isotonic riboflavin, or 2) CXL (UVA 9mW/cm2)
      using hypotonic riboflavin or 3) Iontophoresis with Ricrolin with following CXL (UVA
      9mW/cm2).

      Hypothesis:

      i) CXL with hypotonic riboflavin or CXL with Ricrolin administered by iontophoresis or CXL
      with isotonic riboflavin is non-inferior compared to standard CXL with isotonic riboflavin.

      ii) The morphological structure post-CXL in the three different groups will be similar
      without any significant differences.
