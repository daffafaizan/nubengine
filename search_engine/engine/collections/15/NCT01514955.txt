      enrolled. After diagnosis and written informed consent, patients will undergo investigations
      prior to treatment planning, including CT imaging as per standard of care. In addition,
      patients will have an MRI of the pelvis + PET scan + EUA and gold seeds insertion to verify
      pelvic organs movement and EB-IMRT with daily cone beam CT. Brachytherapy treatment planning
      will be based on MRI imaging with the applicator in situ.
