      diseases. Up to now, the major treatment strategies include: anti-VEGF therapy, laser therapy
      and surgery. Clinical treatment have revealed that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF can
      effectively restrain neovascularization. Nevertheless, it requires repeated injections, may
      result in various complications, and may be ineffective in some patients. Therefore, it is
      necessary to find out other targets which causes retinal neovascularization, in order to find
      more effective treatments for patients who fail to respond to anti-VEGF therapy. Previous
      researches have shown that herb monomer (ACM-1) was effective in inhibiting leakage of
      retinal vessels and neovascularization. So in this study, patients with ophthalmological
      neovascular diseases will be treated with intravitreal injection of ACM-1, in order to
      investigate the role of intravitreal injection of ACM-1 therapy in prevention and control of
      ophthalmological neovascular diseases.
