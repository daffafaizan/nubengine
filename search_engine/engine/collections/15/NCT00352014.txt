      inhibitors-have become cornerstones in the treatment of ischemic heart disease for patients
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)1,2. However, several studies have
      demonstrated with the use of platelet function assays that subgroups of patients receiving
      either aspirin, clopidogrel, or both fail to produce the anticipated antiplatelet effect3-5.
      Consequently, terms like "aspirin-resistance" and "clopidogrel resistance" have been
      introduced in literature.

      Light transmittance platelet aggregometry is generally considered to be the gold standard for
      determining platelet function, but its relevance to in vivo platelet function is questionable
      and the logistically demands of the method make it impossible to use in daily practice. In
      addition, aggregation is just one of several important platelet functions. The introduction
      of several point-of-care assays may be the key to the widespread clinical use of platelet
      function testing to identify so called anti-platelet therapy low-responders. However, whether
      these point-of-care platelet function tests provide predictive value (i.e. correlate with
      clinical outcomes) and the allocation of the "best" or most suitable point-of-care Platelet
      function assay to determine the level of inhibition of platelet function remains to be
      established.
