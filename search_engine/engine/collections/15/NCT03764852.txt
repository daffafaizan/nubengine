      laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with or without robotic assistance in screened patients. With
      this aim in mind, the investigators will conduct a national multicenter prospective study
      including 80 female patients. Successful outpatient treatment is defined by the absence of
      conventional inpatient admission with 24H after surgery, the indications for admission being
      a CHUNG Score < 9, one perioperative complication, postoperative urinary retention requiring
      reinsertion of a urinary catheter. The outpatient success rate for other surgical techniques
      such as cholecystectomy or laparoscopic hysterectomy is above 90% in the literature.
      Envisaging an equivalent rate after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, our population size would
      make it possible to obtain precision +/- 5.3% for estimation of this proportion. The patients
      are followed up for 1 month with a postoperative visit at 30 days, during which the efficacy
      of the technique is evaluated using conventional indicators (POP-Q; ICIQ, USP, PFDI-20,
      PISQ-12, PFIQ-7, etc.). Once completed, this preliminary investigation will make it possible
      to define a reference value for successful outpatient sacrocolpopexy, which has not yet been
      published, which may be used as a basis for a larger scale randomized study that would aim to
      compare the efficacy of outpatient treatment, with conventional inpatient treatment, for
      efficient patient management
