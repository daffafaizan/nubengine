      Center (Beilinson Campus), Petach Tikva, Israel, a tertiary university hospital. The
      Institutional Review Board has approved this study.

      Two hundred women undergoing cesarean sections will be enrolled after filling out an informed
      consent form. Women will be recruited half an hour preoperatively in the women's surgery
      waiting room when they aren't experiencing any pain, and aren't under any sedatives.

      Following obtaining an informed consent maternal cardiac output will be monitored.

      The monitoring will be carried out using non invasive NICaS cardiac impedance by the use of
      two electrodes stickers which are pasted on the wrists for about 6 minutes.

      Monitoring will be done with women lying down or sitting up half an hour preoperatively (in
      the woman's surgery waiting room) intraoperatively, and postoperatively in the post
      anesthesia care unit (PACU).

      Preoperative data will be compared to intraoperative and postoperative data, and will be
      analyzed in order to evaluate the dynamic cardiac output changes in women undergoing cesarean
      sections.

      Recorded data will include:

        -  Demographic and obstetric - age, weight, height, current hemoglobin, co-morbidities,
           regular medication and other obstetric data.

        -  Cardiovascular risk factors - a family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, BMI

        -  Obstetric history - obstetric background (history of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,
           intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), stillbirths or placental abruption).

        -  Threshold of pain according to VAS It should be emphasized that the conduct of the study
           will not interfere in with cesarean delivery protocol in any way.
