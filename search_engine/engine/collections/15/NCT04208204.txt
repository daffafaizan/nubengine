      women. It represents the most common cause of pain during sexual intercourse. Existing
      treatment approaches are predominantly based on clinical experience, observational studies,
      or reports of expert committees. Although, physiotherapy is one of the most commonly
      recommended treatments, high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess its
      effectiveness.

      This is a phase I, feasibility study with the purpose of testing R&D activities for a planned
      full size RCT. Additionally, patients experiences with the somatocognitive therapy
      intervention, assessment measures and condition itself will be collected using qualitative
      interviews. The results will be applied to adjust time-line of the treatment, outcome
      measures and therapeutic approach before commencing full scale RCT.
