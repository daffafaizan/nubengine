      can be quantified in urine specimens following a digital rectal examination. Studies have
      shown that because PCA3 is highly specific for prostate cancer, it predicts the results of
      repeat biopsies more accurately than traditional prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.
      Gen-Probe's PROGENSA(R) PCA3 assay is the first urine-based molecular diagnostic assay for
      prostate cancer.
