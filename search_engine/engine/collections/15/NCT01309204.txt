      screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and a
      treatment phase, which included 4 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, Month 3, and
      Month 6 (or early exit). Following washout of any IOP-lowering medication, subjects who met
      all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits and who had IOP measurements
      within the specified range during this period were randomized to 1 of 2 study drug groups:
      Brinz/Brim or Brinz+Brim.
