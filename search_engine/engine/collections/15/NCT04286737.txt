      size of the study has been determined by the power analysis, in line with the results
      obtained from the studies which have been conducted using a similar research method.
      According to the analysis results, it has been calculated as 27 for each group and 54 in
      total. Considering the possible case losses, 20% of the sample was increased. The sample
      consisted of 64 babies, 32 intervention and 32 control. Mothers of the infants meeting the
      study inclusion criteria will be informed both in written and verbally. Written consent will
      be obtained. The infants will be divided into two groups according to stratified block
      randomization in the computer environment. The infants will be stratified by gender and age.
      After the randomization, therapeutic touch will be applied to the intervention group. No
      method will be applied to the control group by the researcher. In obtaining research data, 4
      tools will be used: "Mother-infant Information Form", "Infantile Colic Scale", Crying Time
      Registration Form and Sleep Time Registration Form.
