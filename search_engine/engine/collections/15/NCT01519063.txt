      week period and then participate in a laboratory session. During this session, participants
      are given an initial drink of alcohol followed by the choice to drink up to 12 more drinks
      over a three-hour period. These medications are hypothesized to reduce craving and number of
      drinks consumed prior to and after exposure to the initial drink of alcohol and during the
      three hour drinking period.
