      antibiotics used for primary open shoulder surgery. The participants are volunteer patients
      scheduled for a primary open elective or trauma shoulder surgery. Patients with positive MRSA
      screening test will be excluded from the randomised study as they will receive vancomycin for
      prophylaxis. If they accept to participate, they will be included in the observational MRSA+
      arm. The investigators will take from the participants the same data as the randomised
      patients and the investigators will take biopsies.

      4 equals group will be form: Female-elective: 22 envelops, 11 cefazolin, 11 ceftriaxone in a
      randomly order Female-trauma: 22 envelops, 11 cefazolin, 11 ceftriaxone in a randomly order
      Male-elective: 22 envelops, 11 cefazolin, 11 ceftriaxone in a randomly order Male-trauma: 22
      envelops, 11 cefazolin, 11 ceftriaxone in a randomly order The surgeons, anesthesiologist,
      patients and laboratory technician, microbiologist will be blinded to the antibiotics
