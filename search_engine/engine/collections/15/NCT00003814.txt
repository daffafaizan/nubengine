      recurrence of tumor after transurethral resection in patients with low grade, superficial
      transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. II. Determine the incidence and severity of
      toxicities associated with the long-term use of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease status (newly diagnosed vs recurrent), clinical stage (Ta vs T1), grade
      (G1 vs G2), and focus (multifocal vs unifocal). Patients receive either oral eflornithine or
      placebo once daily. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months during the first 2 years, every 6
      months for the third year, and then annually for the fourth year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients (225 per arm) will be accrued to this study within
      1.5 years.
