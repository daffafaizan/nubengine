      validated in hospitals in adults to detect the risk of malnutrition and guide nutritional
      management. SEFI速 combines a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a visual assessment of the
      portions consumed (www.sefi-nutrition.com). It comes in the form of a ruler equipped with a
      cursor and allows a visual assessment, by the patient himself, of his food intake, using an
      analog scale, or a choice of portions. consumed (see appendix). A score <7/10 is associated
      with malnutrition or the risk of malnutrition.

      The investigators hypothesize that, in pediatric services for children 10 years of age or
      older, SEFI速 would be a feasible and reliable tool for screening for the risk of
      malnutrition.
