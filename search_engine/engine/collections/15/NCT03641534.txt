      sepsis or severe malaria. It is planned that this initial observational study will inform a
      follow-up intervention study, based on the observational study findings (Lung Ultrasound and
      Passive Leg Raising- guided Vasopressors and Fluid Management in Patients with Sepsis and
      Severe Malaria). The follow-up study will propose testing of a clinical algorithm to
      individualize titration of vasopressors, diuretics and fluids based on the simple tools
      evaluated during the observational study.

      The expected duration of study patient participation is 30 days. Patients will be assessed
      every 6 hours until fever clearance, parasite clearance (in malaria patients) and GCS
      normalization (score of 15) on two consecutive assessments. Thereafter, patients will be
      assessed daily until discharge or death with one follow-up visit at 14 days and a follow-up
      call at day 30. The prospective, observational recruitment phase of the study is expected to
      last 15 months.
