        -  Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute
           lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia treated with docetaxel.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
