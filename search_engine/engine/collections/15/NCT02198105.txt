    
      The registry includes consecutive patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to
      femoro-popliteal stenosis or occlusion treated with cutting ballon- and subsequent
      drug-coated-ballon-percutaneous-transluminal-angioplasty (PTA).

      Interventional procedure:

        1. PTA with Cutting-Balloon (60-120 seconds).

        2. PTA with Drug-Coated-Balloon (60 seconds).

      Technical success is defined as

        1. no recoil >30%

        2. no dissection >Type B

        3. no stenting >30% of lesion length.

      Follow-up of patients after 6 months and 12 months (ABI, Rutherford-classification, MACE,
      TLR, TVR, Binary Restenosis).
