      related to their disease process. While many biologic and non-biologic therapies are
      available to target the inflammatory component of IBD, youth with IBD could benefit from a
      more holistic therapy that addresses psychological wellness, which has been shown, in turn,
      to reduce disease burden. It is known that stress (multiple varieties) leads to IBD flares.
      It is also known that mind-body intervention reduces stress. The mind-gut connection is
      widely discussed in medical circles, however, current therapies have not capitalized on it.
      The investigators would like to know if an easily accessible mind-body intervention (yoga)
      can improve wellness, lower stress levels, and reduce intestinal inflammation in youth with
      IBD.

      The study will be an 8-week feasibility pilot. Participants will be asked to participate in
      online yoga videos and in-studio yoga sessions. Participants will be asked to complete
      multiple surveys throughout the intervention and continue receiving standard care from their
      primary gastroenterology team.
