      CPM testing procedure consisting of test stimulus (TS) administered before and after a
      conditioning stimulus (CS). For the standardized protocol, the TS will consisted of a noxius
      heat stimulus generated by a thermode (hot plate), applied for two minutes on the
      non-dominant anterior forearm. The CS will consisted of a cold pressor test (CT), wherein
      participants immersed their dominant forearm in a cold water bath for two minutes. For the
      TENS protocol, the TS will consisted of a noxius electrical stimulus generated by TENS,
      applied for 5 seconds on the non-dominant knee at a frequency of 1 Hz and 5 Hz. The CS will
      consisted of a noxius electrical stimulus generated by TENS' applied for 120 seconds on the
      non dominant knee and ankle at a frequency of 2 Hz.
