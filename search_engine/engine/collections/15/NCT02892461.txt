      improve placental transfusion for newborns born vaginally based on a series of randomized
      controlled studies. However, no similar recommendations are available for cesarean-delivered
      infants. Investigators found that cesarean-delivered infants were more vulnerable to iron
      deficiency and anemia compared with those born vaginally, suggesting that it is urgently
      needed to find a similar anemia prevention strategy for infants born by cesarean sections.

      In this study, investigators aim to test whether umbilical cord milking (UCM), a potentially
      promising strategy for cesarean delivery, can improve iron related health outcomes for
      cesarean-delivered infants. A total of 450 term pregnant women who are planning to give
      births by cesarean sections will be enrolled from two hospitals in Hunan province and
      randomly assigned to either UCM group or control group. Infants will be followed up at 1, 6,
      12, 18 months for the evaluation of the impact of UCM on iron deficiency, anemia, as well as
      growth and the developmental status of language and mental/behavioral outcomes.
