    
      This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase I/II study in patients
      with previously untreated CD20-positive CLL. Phase I of the study will evaluate the maximal
      tolerated lenalidomide dose level in combination with fludarabine/rituximab
      chemoimmunotherapy in 10 patients. Phase II will determine efficacy using the combination in
      the previously defined maximal tolerated dose. Both phases will be followed by a maintenance
      phase evaluating the tolerability and possibility to further improve response quality.
