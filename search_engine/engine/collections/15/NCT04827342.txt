    
      This is an observational i.e. non-interventional, prospective feasibility study, which
      assesses, through observation, the potential, functionality and diagnostic performance of the
      Ada DDSS prototype in evaluating patients presenting with dyspnea as primary predominant
      complaint to the ED.

      Once the consent form is signed, the Investigator documents patients' data, medical history,
      symptoms and findings with the Ada DDSS prototype. During the entire patient journey through
      the hospital (presentation at the ED through to admission in the ward of Internal Medicine)
      relevant information are collected and documented in the Ada DDSS prototype simultaneously to
      standard documentation by the medical staff.

      Examination and treatment are carried out by the attending physician without being influenced
      or affected by the entry of data in the Ada DDSS prototype.

      There is no intervention/change made to the usual care, and therefore neither an intervention
      patient group nor a control patient group. The "usual care" that each patient receives is the
      control comparison point for the performance of the Ada DDSS. The diagnoses proposed by the
      tool at different times (after triage in the emergency centre, when transferred to the ward
      and when discharged from the hospital) are then compared with those of the attending
      physician.
