      patients are on Clopidogrel (plavix). Their is some evidence that clopidogrel is not
      effective in hemodialysis as it is effective in patient without kidney problem.

      VerifyNow plavix is a machine that measure the ability of the blood to clot after giving
      plavix.

      We will collect blood from hemodialysis patients on plavix and check the ability of their
      blood to clot and thus indirectly measuring the efficacy of Plavix.
