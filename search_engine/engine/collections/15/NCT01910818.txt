      changes. Each patient will receive fractional treatment (FLT) using the Lumenis Ultrapulse
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2) laser as well as control (no treatment) randomized to site. Patient age,
      type of cancer, method/dosage of radiation, latency between radiation treatment and start of
      study, and characteristics of skin changes will be recorded, including fibrosis surface area,
      depth, color, and compliance. Assessments will be conducted before each treatment, after each
      treatment, and 3-12 months after the last treatment.
