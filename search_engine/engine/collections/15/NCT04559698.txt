    
      The purpose of the proposed study is to train mental health providers (MHPs) at LGBTQ
      community centers across the United States in evidence-based, LGBTQ-affirmative
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the LGBTQ-affirmative CBT
      training increases LGBTQ and CBT knowledge, clinical skills, and cultural humility among a
      sample of MHPs from LGBTQ community centers in the U.S. The proposed prospective study will
      follow a 2-arm waitlist randomized-controlled trial design where one group of MHPs will be
      randomized to receive the intervention training (i.e., the immediate training group) in
      LGBTQ-affirmative CBT, and the second group of MHPs will be randomized to a waitlist control
      group.

      The proposed mixed-methods study will consist of predominantly quantitative self-report
      measures, as well as a qualitative self-assessment of participants' LGBTQ-affirmative CBT
      clinical skills. All study measures will be administered online at three time points via the
      secure Yale Qualtrics survey software.
