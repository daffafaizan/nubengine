    
      Premenopausal women with endometriosis-related CPP scheduled for laparoscopic surgery to our
      Academic Department of Gynecology will be consecutively enrolled. Subjects with
      hystologically confirmed endometriosis at laparoscopy (stage I-IV of the American Society
      Reproductive Medicine), a subjective severity of pelvic pain by using a visual analogue scale
      (VAS 1-100) of at least 70, and without immediate desire of pregnancy will be enrolled.

      Briefly, all patients will undergo conservative laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.
      Thereafter, a low-dose monophasic OC containing 2.0 mg clormadinone acetate plus 0.03 mg
      ethinil-estradiol (BelaraÂ®, Grunenthal, Milan, Italy) will be administered. Patients from the
      experimental group will be treated with a continuous regimen, while patients from the control
      group will receive the OC with a cyclic regimen consisting of 21 days of active pills with 7
      days of placebo. The drug and the placebo will be similar and will be labelled according to
      the subject number. For the overall study-period, operators and patients will be blind to the
      treatment allocation.
