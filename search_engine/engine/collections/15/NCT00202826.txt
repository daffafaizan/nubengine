      that this pilot study will provide the basis for further randomized prospective studies. The
      expected benefit is that the current treatment and outcome of pediatric parapneumonic
      effusions will be determined. Insights into the therapy that results in the least morbidity,
      hospital days, (and therefore cost) will be elucidated. If our hypothesis is valid, then a
      more aggressive surgical approach to the treatment of a parapneumonic effusion may be
      warranted. If the hypothesis is not valid, then the appropriate treatment for a parapneumonic
      effusion, irrespective of institution and personal opinion, should become more apparent.
