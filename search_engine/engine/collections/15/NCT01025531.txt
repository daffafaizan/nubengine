      Diseases (CLD) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) who are scheduled to
      undergo a liver biopsy as part of their routine clinical care. The liver biopsies will be
      read concurrently by a single study pathologist who is blinded to the subjects' clinical
      status. At the time of liver biopsy, blood will be drawn to perform CB-CAP assays. The CB-CAP
      levels will be correlated with the liver biopsy result to assess their ability to predict
      degree of liver injury. The investigators will retrieve labs done for routine clinical care
      closest to the time of liver biopsy, including complete blood count, serum aminotransferase
      levels, and a biochemical profile.

      A total of 250 subjects will be recruited for this study. Data gathered would include
      demographic and clinical information, risk factors for HCV, information about drug and
      alcohol use and anthropometric measurements (height, weight, abdominal circumference, etc.).

      For the subset of subjects who are then initiated on treatment for HCV by their healthcare
      providers, we will gather treatment information (start date, stop date, treatment regimen and
      dosage, etc.) and blood will be drawn at treatment weeks 4, 12, 24 and 72 (+/- 2 week window
      allowed at each time point) to determine whether CB-CAPs levels predict virologic response in
      treated subjects. Routine laboratory data will also be collected at these time points. The
      +/- 2 week time window is allowed so that the blood draw can be done at a routine clinical
      visit.
