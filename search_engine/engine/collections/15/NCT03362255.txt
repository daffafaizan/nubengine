      hospital stay with unwanted complications. Therefore, active and proper management using
      continuous thoracic epidural catheterization is suggested good option to prevent such
      potential complication.

      According to previous study, injection of different volume of local anesthetics (1.0 ml/kg
      vs. 1.5 ml/kg) during caudal anesthesia, high volume of local anesthetics resulted in
      significant increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Increase of ICP can reduce regional
      cerebral flow and oxygen saturation causing the safety of patients. In addition, increase of
      ICP can result in headache, syncope, and transient loss of visual acuity.

      Although it is very invasive method, ICP can be measured directly at the brain parenchyme.
      Among methods to measure the ICP indirectly, measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter using
      ultrasound is known to reflect the degree of ICP. It is reported that optic nerve sheath
      diameter increases when higher volume of medication is injected during epidural anesthesia.

      This study is designed to compare the optic nerve sheath diameter using 10cc of nomal saline
      of different speed (3cc/sec vs. 1cc/sec).
