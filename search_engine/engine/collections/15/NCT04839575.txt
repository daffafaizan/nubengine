      with randomized withdrawal study in Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease subjects attempting a
      GFD for at least one year prior to screening. Seropositive subjects (blood test confirmed at
      Visit 0) will be scheduled for a Screening Visit (Visit 1) whereas seronegative subjects will
      be discontinued from study participation (screen failures). Subjects who meet Visit 1
      protocol enrollment criteria will be enrolled.
