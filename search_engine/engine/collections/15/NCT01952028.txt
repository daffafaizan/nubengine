      alpha 2 gene. LAMA2-MD may present clinically as an early onset, severe phenotype or a late
      onset limb girdle phenotype. The early onset form is most commonly associated with a complete
      absence of merosin on muscle biopsy with profound neonatal hypotonia, possible respiratory
      distress and feeding difficulties while the late onset form presents with proximal muscle
      weakness, contractures and is able to achieve walking. In both early and late onset forms,
      brain white matter abnormalities have been described on brain MRI and approximately 8-30%
      develop a seizure disorder. On magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, white matter changes are
      shown to be due to increased water content rather than areas of demyelination. Both,
      non-ambulant and ambulant patients may develop respiratory insufficiency requiring
      non-invasive ventilation and scoliosis.

      Although several studies have evaluated the correlation between brain MRI white matter
      changes and cognition, no studies to date have provided a systematic evaluation of brain
      imaging, electrophysiologic testing and seizures in patients identified by molecular or
      immunohistochemical testing to have LAMA2-MD.
