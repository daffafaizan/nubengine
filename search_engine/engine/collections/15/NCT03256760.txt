      and depression responses (primary outcome) in older adults as a function of insomnia. Older
      adults with insomnia show chronic inflammation; sleep disturbance also activates inflammatory
      signaling; chronic inflammation primes acute inflammatory responses; chronic inflammation, as
      well as acute inflammatory reactivity, predict depression over the following year; and
      finally, endotoxin induces acute inflammation along with depressive symptoms, with
      preliminary evidence that "two-hits" (i.e., sleep disturbance and inflammatory challenge) are
      associated with exaggerated increases in depression, especially in women. In this
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of low dose endotoxin in older adults
      (60-80 y; stratified by sex) with insomnia (n=80) vs. comparisons without insomnia (n=80),
      the investigators hypothesize that older adults with insomnia will show heightened
      inflammatory- and affective responding to inflammatory challenge as compared to those without
      insomnia. The investigation aims to: 1) examine differences in depressive symptoms and
      measures of negative affect responding as a function of insomnia and inflammatory challenge;
      2) examine differences in measures of positive affect responding as a function of insomnia
      and inflammatory challenge; and 3) examine differences in experimentally-induced inflammation
      in relation to depressive symptoms and measures of negative- and positive affect responding
      as a function of insomnia.
