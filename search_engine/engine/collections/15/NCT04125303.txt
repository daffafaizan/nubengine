      the nursing intervention, influence these patients' motivation to change. This was a
      two-staged study undertaken in entertainment-sector workers in Spain: the first part was
      transversal and observational, and the second was semi-experimental. First part undertook in
      284 entertainmentsector workers, selected by non-probabilistic sampling, while second part
      undertook in 50 entertainment-business workers, selected by consecutive sampling from those
      who consumed substances. A short group-based motivational intervention session was
      implemented by nursing staff, and a before and after evaluation was completed. The EuroQol-5D
      and Test for the Evaluation of the Quality of Life in Addicts to Psychoactive Substances
      (TECVASP) were used. The patients' motivation to change was evaluated through the Stages of
      Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale.
