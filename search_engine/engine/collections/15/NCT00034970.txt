      associated with significant improvements in health status, quality of life and coping
      behaviors, in patients with cancer. The purpose of the proposed pilot research study is to
      investigate a newly developed group therapy for cancer patients, MBAT. This proposed,
      randomized, controlled study follows a successful preliminary investigation of MBAT conducted
      at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. MBAT integrates known benefits of art therapy, group
      therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Each of these fundamentally different
      modalities has documented usefulness in the treatment of cancer patients. The multi-modal
      approach is designed to enhance both the supportive and expressive aspects of the group
      experience. The study will be done with 96 patients who have a variety of cancer types.
      Participants will be matched for age and assigned randomly to either the MBAT experimental
      group or a non-intervention control group. Both groups will continue to receive their usual
      oncologic/medical care. The MBAT program consists of eight weekly meetings of two and one
      half-hours in length. At the end of the eight weeks, participants in the control group will
      be crossed over to the experimental intervention arm for an additional eight weeks.
      Participants will be assessed pre- and post-intervention on measures of health-related
      quality of life, psychological distress, and coping, using standardized outcome instruments
      (SF-36, SCL-90-R and COPE). Our long-term goal is to collect sufficient data to determine the
      overall efficacy of this promising intervention and to identify which patients are
      particularly likely to benefit from MBAT.
