      therapies often having modest efficacy and poor tolerability. Calcitonin gene-related peptide
      (CGRP) has an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Erenumab-aooe is a fully
      human monoclonal antibody that targets the CGRP receptor, and interrupts its downstream
      effects. Erenumab has been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. The
      present study is a Phase IV trial that will assess the effect of erenumab on disability and
      work productivity in employed subjects with episodic migraine (EM) who have previously failed
      1 or more migraine preventive treatments.
