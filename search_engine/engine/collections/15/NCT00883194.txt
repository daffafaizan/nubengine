    
      This is a clinical study testing PRF-108 and PRF-110 (a new extended release 4% gel
      formulations of ropivacaine) in an experimentally induced pain model in healthy volunteers.
      PRF-108 and PRF-110 are designed to deliver slow release of ropivacaine over 72 hours.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety (side effects if any occurs)
      associated with the single administration of PRF-108 or PRF-110 and evaluate their analgesic
      effect in an experimentally induced pain model compared with ropivacaine Solution 0.5% and
      Vehicle Gel.
