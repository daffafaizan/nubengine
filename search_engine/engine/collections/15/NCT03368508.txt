      with honours physiotherapy degree, participated in a 2-hour blended learning session. Three
      manual assessment techniques were presented - cervical compression, distraction and
      flexion-rotation tests. The techniques were demonstrated through two sets of learning
      materials with either real-object rotatable 3D images using Close-range Photogrammetry
      (experimental group) or traditional 2D computer images (control group). Students were
      examined after the training using an objective structured clinical evaluation (OSCE)
      procedure. The OSCE required the participants to demonstrate the three techniques learnt with
      the assessment criteria as therapist's position and skills, patient's position and overall
      management of the physical examination. The score of the standardized 9 item-practical
      performance test, with a maximum score of 54, was used as the primary outcome measure for
      analyses.
