      drugs for MDA against onchocerciasis could shorten the number of years needed to interrupt
      onchocerciasis transmission and eliminate this infectious disease in areas that previously
      had high disease rates. Improved treatments should also make it feasible to extend MDA into
      areas that are currently not being helped. These changes have the potential to completely
      change the game to make global elimination of onchocerciasis a feasible goal.

      Participants will be randomized into 5 treatment arms with 75 subjects in each arm for a
      total of 375 and followed for 36 months after the initial treatment. The primary endpoint
      will be the percent fertile adult female worms in nodules removed 36 months after the
      initiation of treatment.
