      to further evaluate whether ladarixin is effective in preserving beta-cell function and
      slowing-down the progression of T1D) in patients with a more severe disease presentation.

      The study is planned to be performed at about 40 study centers in EU, US and in other
      countries, if appropriated. At each study center, the Principal Investigator (PI) will be
      responsible for ensuring that the investigation is conducted according to the signed
      Investigator agreement, the protocol, GCP guidelines, and local regulations.

      The study is planned to involve -327 patients with new-onset T1D, to include about 200
      adolescents (14-17 years). Patients will be randomly (2:1) assigned to receive either
      ladarixin treatment (400 mg b.i.d. for 13 cycles of 14 days on/14 days off - treatment group)
      or matched placebo (control group). The two groups will be balanced within centers.
