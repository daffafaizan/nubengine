      BK test produced by LD Bio Diagnostic to detect Toxoplasma gondii in clinical settings. The
      result of testing from Toxoplasma ICT IgG-IgM BK test will be compared with the standard
      predicate test. These results will be provided to FDA for consideration for clearance of this
      test.
