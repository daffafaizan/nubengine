      focusing on a measured level of activity in rectus abdominus with established scientific
      stress markers across the SAM axis and biochemical immunity markers; and directly showing
      effects of breath-based yoga-meditative practice on stress management and markers of aging.
      It intends to highlight context of the behavioral practice through, one, set up, content and
      duration of practice, and two, by identifying a quantitative number for the degree of
      participation by the subject in the practice. The study couples emic perspectives from the
      traditional yoga knowledge base, both textual and practice, with empirical measures from
      science as an opportunity to bridge these worlds as a first known study of hatha yoga to be
      tackled by the means and methods of biocultural anthropology.
