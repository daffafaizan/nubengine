      series to measure structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal
      nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is
      conducted in normal Japanese volunteers. The main goal of the study is to provide the range
      of these structural parameters in normal eyes. The study will include at least 224
      (enrollment target: 249) normal volunteers; each study site will recruit 32 to 40 subjects
      with an age range of 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males.
      All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination,
      disc photography and visual field testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on
      the subjects are non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for
      marketing in Europe and in the U.S.
