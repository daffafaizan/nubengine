      defective endothelial function and 2) episodes of repeated hypoglycemia will result in
      greater impairments of endothelial function and an increased prothrombotic tendency.
      Preliminary data in healthy men demonstrates that hypoglycemia can dramatically increase
      PAI-1 levels and the PAI-1 to tPA ratio, thereby creating a prothrombotic state. Whether this
      also occurs in type 2 DM patients is unknown. Furthermore, the effects of hypoglycemia on
      endothelial function in T2DM are also unknown.
