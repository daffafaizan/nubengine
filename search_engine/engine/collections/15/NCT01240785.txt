      worldwide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and also in a few studies on patients with
      gestational diabetes. The investigators aim is to compare insulin and metformin in the
      treatment of gestational diabetes. The investigators hypothesis is that there is no
      difference between insulin and metformin treated mothers in the main outcome criteria (birth
      weight, neonatal complications). The study was performed as a randomized controlled trial in
      one center, Turku University hospital using the non-inferiority design in June 2006 -
      December 2010. The final study population consisted of altogether 217 women, of whom 110
      received metformin and 107 insulin.
