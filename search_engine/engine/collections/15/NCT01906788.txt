      are currently advocated for use in the interventions that aim to interrupt malaria
      transmission and hence elimination. Mature gametocytes are responsible for malaria
      transmission. Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs) has limited effect on the young
      gametocytes. Primaquine is able to clear mature gametocytes that remain after treatment with
      ACTs. Complete clearance of mature gametocytes will depend on the ideal time primaquine is
      given after ACT. It is important therefore that is administered at optimal time in order to
      have significant impact on clearing gametocytes to interrupt malaria transmission. An
      additional consideration is operational administration of Primaquine and compliance both of
      which are likely to be enhanced if the drug is administered on the day of diagnosis.

      In this study, the investigators aim to determine optimal timing of primaquine administration
      in addition to ACT by comparing administration on day 0 with administration on day 2.

      The investigators' primary end points are gametocyte prevalence and density by microscopy and
      Quantitative Nucleic Acid Based Amplification (QT-NASBA) on day 14, which will be compared
      between the two primaquine treatment arms.
