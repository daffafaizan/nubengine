      and is estimated to occur in 26% of all cardiac surgery patients. It can lead to increase
      morbidity, mainly due to hemodynamic instability and thromboembolic complications, and to
      increased hospital stay with its associated higher health care cost.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that increased inflammation may precede AF and, therefore,
      interventions that reduce the inflammatory process may help reduce the incidence of AF.
      Colchicine has potent anti-inflammatory properties and may therefore be capable of reducing
      the incidence of AF.

      This study aims to determine whether the administration of colchicine starting the day before
      cardiac surgery and continuing until discharge may lead to reduction in post-operative AF.
