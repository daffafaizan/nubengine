      All individuals were vaccinated between October and November 2009 and received 2 doses of
      Pandemrix. Serum samples were collected at baseline before vaccination and 1 month after the
      first and second vaccination. Individual hemagglutination-inhibiting serum antibody titers
      were measured.Frequency of > 4 -fold increase in antibody titers and seroconversion from
      non-protective prevaccination titers to protective postvaccination titers were recorded.
      Adverse events were reported.
