      the research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular
      cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research
      study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have
      to be repeated. Screening tests include the following: medical history, performance status,
      assessment of pancreatic cyst by CT, MRI or EUS, blood tests and a pregnancy test.

      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will
      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria you will not be able
      to participate in this research study.

      As part of your medical care you will be undergoing an endoscopic procedure EUS-FNA
      (Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration) in order to evaluate and evacuate the cyst
      fluid. During the EUS-FNA and just after the cyst fluid aspiration, albumin bound paclitaxel
      will be injected into the cyst cavity.

      The study procedure (injection of drug into cyst cavity) takes place over 5 minutes during
      the EUS-FNA. 2 days after the procedure you will receive a phone call from the research
      coordinator to check on how you are feeling. 3 months after study procedure participants will
      undergo a follow up CT to see what happened to the cyst. You will continue to have routine
      follow up for your medical problems.
