      toxicity. HDR brachytherapy offers a promising definitive treatment option in the setting of
      Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer after prior definitive radiation, based on the limited data
      described above, with achievement of biochemical disease control in a large percentage of
      patients with relatively low toxicity. With focal HDR brachytherapy, the investigators can
      treat the isolated areas of disease, while avoiding normal prostate tissue, with the goal of
      further improving toxicity rates. The investigators hypothesize that using single fraction,
      focal HDR brachytherapy performed with one single implant for the treatment of LRPC is
      feasible and without excess toxicity, and can be safely delivered. This should allow for
      better patient convenience and cost and improved treatment dosimetry and planning, as it will
      decrease the risk of catheter displacement between fractions, which will hopefully correlate
      to less GU and non-GU acute toxicity. The primary objective is to determine the acute and
      late GU and GI toxicity of single fraction focal HDR salvage brachytherapy (primary
      endpoint).
