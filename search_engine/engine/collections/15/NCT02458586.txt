      (PUFA) rather than mono-unsatured fatty acids (MUFA) are associated with lower hepatic lipid
      content (HCL) and may facilitate a decrease of HCL in case of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD). A typical source for PUFAs are fish and certain plant oils, a source of
      almost pure MUFAs is olive oil.

      The investigators therefore conduct an interventional trial in subjects with normal glucose
      metabolism, but increased HCL, fulfilling criteria for NAFLD. The investigation focusses on
      male participants to avoid sex-related differences in the results.

      The study will compare two isocaloric dietary interventions in parallel design, one
      containing mainly PUFA (canola oil), one containing only MUFA (olive oil). The intervention
      of 8 weeks is accomodated by dietary counseling (4 sessions). Metabolic outcome variables
      will be assessed with MR spectroscopy (liver fat), anthropometry (to check for stable weight
      and body composition) and euglycemic hepatic clamp (glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity).
