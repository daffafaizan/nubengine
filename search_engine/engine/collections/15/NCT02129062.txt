      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as measured by objective response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the global safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      B-ALL.

      II. To assess response duration. III. To assess Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) target
      inhibition, biomarkers, and gene expression profiles in B-ALL patient samples before and
      during treatment with ibrutinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
