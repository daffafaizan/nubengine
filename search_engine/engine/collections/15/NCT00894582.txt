      patients with large ventral hernias were selected due to their large hernia size from a pool
      of 130 patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction from January 2007 to December 2008.
      No patients were excluded based on co-morbid conditions. One patient of the 21 selected was
      excluded because his preoperative CT scan that was performed at an outside institution was
      stored in an incompatible format for analysis. Another patient was excluded because it was
      decided intra-operatively that she could be repaired in a tension-free manner without
      components separation and was closed with mesh alone. Standard abdominal and pelvic CT scans
      and pulmonary function tests were performed immediately before hernia repair, and 3 months
      after repair. Pulmonary function tests were interpreted by blinded members of the Department
      of Pulmonology. Intra-operative peak airway pressure, bladder pressure, postoperative oxygen
      requirement, diagnosis of pneumonia, and any other cardio-respiratory complications were
      recorded on the remaining 19 patients. Routine patient demographics, clinical
      characteristics, postoperative course and incidence of recurrence were prospectively
      collected on all patients. Statistical analysis was performed in an intention-to-treat
      manner, using paired student's t-test where applicable.
