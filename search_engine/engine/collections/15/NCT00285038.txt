      been shown that there is a high prevalence of VTE in gynecological malignancies. Early
      detection of VTE can identify patients who may benefit from anticoagulant therapy and prevent
      morbidity and mortality.

      NO clear guidelines are available for anticoagulant prophylaxis in a selected group of
      ambulatory gynecological cancer patients. It has been shown, in other selected groups of
      patients that Ultrasound Doppler can be used in order to diagnose asymptomatic DVT (deep vein
      thrombosis).
