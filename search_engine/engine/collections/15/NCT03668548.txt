      leading to altered patterns of growth and development. Those with CP may encounter early
      symptoms of paresis and spasticity, leading to progressive secondary musculoskeletal
      complications, including increased muscle atrophy and abnormal growth of contractile and
      non-contractile tissue. This causes significant weakness of the muscle and compromises daily
      motor function, leading to substantial declines in activities of daily living and
      independence. As such, interventions aimed at increasing muscle mass or preventing muscle
      atrophy for those with CP must be established. It is well established that dietary protein
      ingestion stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits proteolytic pathways, resulting in a
      positive protein balance and net muscle mass gain. In particular, leucine (a branched chain
      amino acid; BCAA), has been used to facilitate protein synthesis and muscle growth. Leucine
      also has anti-inflammatory roles, some of which are central in origin and have been shown to
      effect mood and features of wellbeing. However, there has been no investigation of the
      effects of leucine supplementation on any of these parameters in CP. Therefore, the purpose
      of this study is to assess the effects of 10-weeks leucine supplementation on muscle growth,
      metabolism, body composition, inflammation and wellbeing in adolescents and young adults with
      CP.
