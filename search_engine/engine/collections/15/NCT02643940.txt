      with recanalization of Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) on clinical grounds alone.

      This study will be recording pressure wire readings from both blocked and narrowed arteries,
      to better guide treatment option. To date there is no data available on instantaneous wave
      free ratio (iFR) measurement (a pressure derived assessment of flow limitation) in patients
      with blocked arteries.
