      sub-Saharan Africa, nutrition plays a critical role in HIV disease. Nutrition affects the
      health of HIV-infected women and children, and may influence the risk of mother to infant
      transmission of HIV through breast milk. Nutrition influences the risk of tuberculosis (TB)
      and TB disease severity. Existing research has focused on the role of micronutrients in HIV
      disease outcomes but has not addressed the role of protein calorie supplementation (PCS) in
      subpopulations of patients with HIV disease at high risk, specifically, HIV-infected women
      who are either breast feeding or have active TB. Our hypotheses are that administration of a
      culturally acceptable PCS is a practical, sustainable and effective strategy to: 1) decrease
      HIV viral load in plasma and breast milk of breast feeding women, enhance passively
      transferred immune mediators in breast milk, and improve HIV outcomes in women and their
      breast-fed infants and, 2) decrease HIV viral load, enhance TB-specific T cell immunity, and
      improve outcomes in women with HIV and active TB.
