      doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel in combination with sorafenib in
      patients with early stage node positive or otherwise high-risk breast cancer.

      Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives are to assess activity in the form of
      recurrence-free-interval, distant recurrence-free interval,and overall survival in this pilot
      study of doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel in combination with sorafenib
      in patients with early stage node positive or otherwise high-risk breast cancer.
