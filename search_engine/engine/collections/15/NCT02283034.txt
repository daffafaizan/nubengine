      paramount importance for survival and good neurological outcome. Unfortunately, even health
      professionals have difficulty performing effective CPR. Chest compression (CC) is often too
      shallow, compression ratio is inadequate, and hands-off time is too long. CPR feedback
      devices might be an option for rescuers to in order to increase CC efficiency.
