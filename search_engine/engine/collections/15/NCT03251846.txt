      device use in the pediatric diabetes population. Patients will be recruited at the Children's
      Minnesota McNeely Diabetes Clinic and satellite clinics during routine office visits over a
      6-month period until recruitment goals are met. Enrolled subjects will be given a POPS!
      Device (meter, lancet/test strips, and software app) to use for 6 months with periodic
      check-ins and follow-ups. Primary outcome, HbA1c, will be measured at baseline and 6-month
      follow-up. Secondary aims include assessment of blood glucose testing frequency and quality
      of life scores following 6-months of device and app use. The investigators will also describe
      sustained use over the study period, average blood glucose and variability, and frequency of
      hypoglycemic events (blood glucose <70). Historical data for each patient will also be
      recorded from medical records, with each patient serving as their own comparative control.
