      elderly. Despite major research efforts in the last decades the etiology of AMD remains
      largely undefined and therefore treatment options are only very limited. However, there is
      evidence that nutrition and inflammation play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD . The latter
      is also corroborated by the finding that single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding
      complement factor H is associated with AMD . In addition to CHF other genes such as ARMS2,
      C3, PLEKHA1, HTRA-1, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGFR and APOE have been associated with development of
      AMD. Recent findings have implicated the gut microbiota as a contributor of metabolic
      diseases through the modulation of host metabolism and inflammation . Gut bacteria use mostly
      fermentation to generate energy, converting sugars, in part, to short-chain fatty acid, that
      are used by the host as energy source. Beyond short-chain fatty acids gut bacteria can
      provide some amino acids and contribute certain vitamins such as biotin to the host . The
      investigators propose to investigate whether compositional and functional alterations of the
      gut microbiota are a risk factor for developing AMD.
