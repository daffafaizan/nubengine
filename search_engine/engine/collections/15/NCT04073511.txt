      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects who will participate in the study will be
      divided into three groups, 'Eungyosan' group(EGS), 'Samsoeum' group(SSE) and placebo group
      according to the randomization number. Each group of subjects will take the drugs(EGS or SSE
      or placebo) 3 times a day up to 8 days.

      The severity of illness will be assessed by Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21
      Korean version (WURSS-21-K) and the VAS(visual analog scale) every 8days. Also, the duration
      of the common cold will be checked to evaluate the effectiveness.
