      removal. Patients are randomized to receive either EC-wP/T or EC-wP/TCb adjuvant
      chemotherapy. For triple-negative breast cancer, a subgroup of triple-negative breast cancer
      has DNA repairement deficiency and adding carboplatin to paclitaxel may improve DFS on the
      basis of weekly paclitaxel adjuvant chemotherapy.
