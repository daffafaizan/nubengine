      topotecan, and paclitaxel, to mention a few. Doxorubicin was studied in ovarian cancer
      participants that were refractory to paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy agents.
      Inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising approach to the treatment of cancer.
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important regulator of angiogenesis and is
      likely an important therapeutic target in persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. VEGF is overexpressed in ovarian tissue and
      may be the most important single tumor angiogenic factor. Phase 1 studies currently nearing
      completion with ramucirumab have demonstrated safety and tolerability at clinically relevant
      doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in ovarian cancer participants.
      Therefore, ImClone Systems plans to conduct a Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy
      of ramucirumab in participants with platinum-refractory persistent or recurrent epithelial
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.
