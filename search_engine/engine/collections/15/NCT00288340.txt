      related to schizophrenia. We will use advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to
      measure the degree and distribution of neuronal activity during specific cognitive tasks,
      alterations in neuronal connectivity, and how these are related to disease symptoms and
      treatment. We will focus on changes in brain structure and function associated with frequent
      auditory hallucinations, one of the most disabling manifestations of schizophrenia, and with
      neuroleptic treatment. In order to address these aims, we will study four groups of subjects:

        1. patients who have frequent auditory hallucinations,

        2. patients who are beginning a regimen of anti-psychotic medication,

        3. patients who do not have frequent hallucinations and are not changing medication
           strategies, and

        4. age-matched normal controls. Each group will contain 15 subjects for a total of 60.
