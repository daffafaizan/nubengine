        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of celecoxib for regression of Barrett's dysplasia in
           patients with low or high-grade dysplasia of the esophagus.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified according to center and grade of dysplasia at baseline (low vs high).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 48-96 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Treatment continues in both arms in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
           or cancer at other sites.

      Patients are followed at 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
