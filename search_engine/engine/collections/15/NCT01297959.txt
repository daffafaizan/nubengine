      safety of topical E-101 Solution after direct application into the principal surgical
      incision in the prevention of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infections (SSI)
      within 30 days after elective colorectal surgery. The study is intended to support a target
      indication statement of: "E-101 Solution is indicated for the prophylaxis of incisional
      surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery". E-101 Solution is comprised
      of the active ingredients of glucose oxidase (GO) and porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO) that
      produce coupled reactions after the addition of glucose substrate. The hypothesis is that
      E-101 Solution topically applied directly into the principal incision is safe and
      significantly reduces the incidence of incisional SSI compared to placebo topical
      application. (The principal surgical incision is â‰¥ 5cm and < 35 cm used as a hand port,
      colorectal specimen extraction port, or extracorporeal manipulation port depending on the
      specific colorectal surgical approach.)
