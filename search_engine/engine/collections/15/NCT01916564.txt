      should be relatively small in volume and well-tolerated by patients with minimal adverse
      gastrointestinal symptoms. At our centre, reduced-volume 2-litre PEG-ELS plus bisacodyl and
      low fiber diet is used for bowel preparation for patients undergoing colonoscopy. Patients
      undergoing morning outpatient colonoscopy would normally ingest the PEG-ELS and bisacodyl the
      day before. This regime has been shown to be better tolerated by patients without
      compromising the quality of bowel preparation when compared with conventional 4-liter
      PEG-ELS. However, previous study on patient satisfaction found that nearly half of the
      patients attending the outpatient colonoscopy service at our centre were dissatisfied with
      the bowel preparation regime used. Of the seven items considered in the evaluation of patient
      satisfaction, comfort level during bowel preparation was the main cause of unfavorable
      responses. Moreover, a separate study using the same bowel preparation regime at our centre
      found a high percentage of poor quality bowel preparation, which was associated with
      increased technical difficulty and patient discomfort during colonoscopy. There was clearly a
      need for a better bowel preparation regime. Current literature suggests that either taking
      reduced-volume PEG-ELS on the same morning instead of the previous evening, or splitting the
      bowel preparation, would be better. However, whether the former or the latter is better, is
      unknown. The aim of our study was to compare the use of same-morning whole-dose
      reduced-volume PEG-ELS and split-dose reduced-volume PEG-ELS for bowel preparation for
      patients undergoing morning outpatient colonoscopy.
