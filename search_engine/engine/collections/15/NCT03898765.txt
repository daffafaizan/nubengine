      year of age. The diagnosis of BA remains a clinical challenge because affected neonates have
      signs, symptoms, and serum liver biochemistry that are also seen in those with other causes
      of neonatal cholestasis.

      The success of the Kasai procedure is varied, but a good outcome is correlated with an early
      diagnosis. Unfortunately, most BA are usually identified later and the average age at surgery
      is about 60 days. To address this problem, some research groups screen infants for the pale
      stools or measure bilirubin level in the serum. However, these screening programs have not
      yet to be implemented because of several reasons. Recently, the relative abundance of serum
      MMP-7 was suggested to have discriminatory features for infants with BA. Nevertheless,
      whether the level of MMP-7 elevates in newborn dry blood spot of BA is still undefined. In
      this study, we will explore a screening strategy based on DB, γ-GT or MMP-7 measurement in
      newborn screening blood spot, and identify whether DB , γ-GT or MMP-7 measurement in the
      newborn period could be sensitive and specific for BA.
