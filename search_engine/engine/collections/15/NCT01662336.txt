      has been offered to patients treated with lopinavir / ritonavir (LPV/r; KaletraÂ®). KASA
      offers individual counseling with an HIV experienced nurse who assists patients with various
      aspects of their therapy including life-style changes, emotional stress, and adverse events.
      Patients enrolled in KASA may also have access to various healthcare professionals
      (dietician, social worker, psychologist, etc.) or may be offered other types of support
      (transportation, exercise, etc.), which may help improve their quality of life as well as
      adherence or compliance while taking LPV/r.

      This was a 12-month, multi-center, Canadian Post Marketing Observational Study utilizing a
      prospective single cohort design. All treatments including participation in the KASA program
      were according to the decision of the treating physician and the patients and were not
      affected in any way by their decision to participate in the study. Follow-up was for 12
      months at an interval of every six months.
