      million new cases, and 0.52 million deaths, annually. Meanwhile the incidence of breast
      cancer continues to increase. Early diagnosis and access to optimum treatment are crucial to
      reduce mortality associated with breast cancer. Currently, mammography and breast
      ultrasonography are essential for the detection and diagnosis of disease, and breast magnetic
      resonance imaging is the choice to estimate the extent of disease and guide appropriate
      treatment. However, there is no robust biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer.

      Semaphorin4C (SEMA4C) has been previously identified as a highly expressed protein by breast
      cancer-associated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) using in situ laser capture
      microdissection of lymphatic vessels, followed by cDNA microarray analysis. Moreover,
      membrane-bound SEMA4C is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) to release a soluble form
      of this protein. Therefore, this prospective project aims to assess the early diagnostic
      value of SEMA4C as a biomarker for breast cancer.
