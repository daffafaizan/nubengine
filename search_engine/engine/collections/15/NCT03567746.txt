      in which a submucosal cushion formation is not necessary. This technique was described in
      2012 by Kenneth Binmoeller based on the physical floating effect of colonic mucous membrane
      by filling the colonic lumen using water instead of air. This "floating effect" conditions
      the natural separation of the colonic wall layers, allowing the distension of the submucosal
      space without the need to inject substances into it. On the other hand, performing resection
      in liquid medium conditions could drive the benefit of heat dissipation caused by the
      current, which would reduces thermal damage caused to the tissues.
