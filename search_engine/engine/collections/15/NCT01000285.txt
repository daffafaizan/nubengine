    
      Primary Endpoint:

      - To determine the tolerability and efficacy (response rate) of dose adjusted
      bortezomib-EPOCH (DA B-EPOCH) chemotherapy combined with Raltegravir in patients with HTLV-1
      associated leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  To evaluate the effects of DA B-EPOCH chemotherapy combined with Raltegravir on HTLV-1
           DNA and RNA load, HTLV-1 integrase gene sequence, and HTLV-1 integration sites. To
           determine if relapsed or progressive disease is a result of renewed virus replication.

        -  To evaluate the relation of NFÎºB gene expression profile on response to DA B-EPOCH
           chemotherapy combined with Raltegravir.
