      Primary

        -  Compare the response rate in patients with "good risk" genotype (TSER*2/*2 or TSER*2/*3
           genotype [low TS expression]) to historical control response rates in non-genotype
           selected patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and
      fluorouracil IV over 5 minutes and then continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses
      repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Available tumor tissue samples are assessed for expression of TS at the mRNA and protein
      levels. The results are correlated with germline and tumor TSER genotypes as well as response
      to the study treatment regimen. Polymorphisms in other genes associated with treatment
      outcome or toxicity are also assessed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 years.
