    
      -  Patients will have several visits to the Pediatric Oncology outpatient clinic. Each
           visit will consist of a physical examination and laboratory evaluation. Each laboratory
           evaluation will consist of taking approximately 10 to 15 milliliters of blood (or
           approximately three teaspoons). These clinic visits may actually coincide with clinic
           visits that were previously scheduled according to the patient's treatment protocol.

        -  At the first study visit, patients will have a physical examination and laboratory
           evaluation. At that visit, patients will be asked to stop taking 6-MP and methotrexate.

        -  At the second study visit, which is one week later, patients will again have a physical
           examination and laboratory evaluation. The investigators will prescribe allopurinol and
           restart 6-MP and methotrexate at half of the patient's previous doses.

        -  Clinic visits for physical examination and laboratory evaluation will be scheduled every
           1-2 weeks for a total of 5 more visits. Doses of allopurinol, 6-MP, and methotrexate may
           be adjusted at these visits based on laboratory values or clinical symptoms.
