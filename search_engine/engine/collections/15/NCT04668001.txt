      brain as assessed by EEG, and on language, attention and memory as assessed by
      neuropsychological testing. Participants will be randomized to either tPBM with near-infrared
      light (tPBM-NIR) or tPBM-Sham and will undergo 18 treatments (3 treatments per week for 6
      weeks) in addition to baseline, short-term and long- term follow up visits.
