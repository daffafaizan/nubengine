      increased pain and central sensitization as evaluated by increase in pain at later time
      points. Hence our main hypothesis to be evaluated and statistically tested for our primary
      endpoint (Aim 1) is:

      HO: There is no difference in mean levels of biochemical mediators of inflammation between
      groups.

      HA: The bupivacaine group has higher levels of biochemical mediators following surgery.
