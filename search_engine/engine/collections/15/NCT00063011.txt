      osteoporotic skeleton. Therefore, prevention of osteoporosis is crucial. If skeletal
      development can be maximized during growth, young people will begin adulthood with optimal
      bone mass and will be less likely to develop osteoporosis in later years. This study will
      determine the effects of weight-bearing physical activity and a high-calcium diet on bone
      mass in adolescent girls.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to one of three study arms. Girls in Arm 1 will
      consume their usual diets and will participate in a weight-bearing exercise program that
      meets 3 times per week. Girls in Arm 2 will also participate in a weight-bearing exercise
      program that meets 3 times per week and will be given high calcium foods to supply 1500 mg of
      calcium per day. Girls in Arm 3 will consume their usual diet and maintain their customary
      activity level. Study visits occur every 6 months; participants will be followed for 4 Â½
      years. Assessments will include a medical and social history and measurements of spine, hip,
      radius, and total body bone mineral content (BMC); calcaneal speed of sound (SOS); height;
      weight; and Tanner stage.
