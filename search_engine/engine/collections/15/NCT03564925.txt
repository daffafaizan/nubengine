      reductions in quality of life and overall survival. Previous studies have shown that
      cryoballoon ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency ablation with respect to efficacy for
      the treatment of patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the
      pulmonary vein isolation for radiofrequency catheter ablation in previous studies was done
      around each pulmonary-vein antrum, and it's not wide area circumferential ablation. Moreover,
      the induction of atrial fibrillation by isoproterenol or programmed stimulation and burst
      pacing was not performed in most of previous studies. We hypothesize that wide area
      circumferential ablation with contact force catheter and combined catheter ablation the
      potential atrial triggers and/or other atrial arrhythmias induced by aggressive induction is
      more effective than cryoballoon ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
