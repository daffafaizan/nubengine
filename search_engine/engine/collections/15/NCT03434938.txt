      geriatric rehabilitation to motivate and empower stroke patients to participate in their own
      rehabilitation plan and thus, to increase their physical activity and engagement in self-care
      and other activities. The main aim is to finally improve patients' physical and global
      function and, in turn, to reduce dependency. As mentioned, there is evidence-base around MI
      in rehabilitation, which covers functional, clinical and efficiency aspects. It is expected
      that IMAGINE project will add a relevant contribution for the implementation of this
      intervention in older adults with post-stroke residual disability and dependency needing
      rehabilitation. Accordingly, this study should inform practice and policy on how to move
      forward towards shared decision making and shared responsibilities in a vulnerable population
      such as older adults with a recent stroke.
