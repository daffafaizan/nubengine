      parameters to assess the depth of anaesthesia during general anaesthesia. In addition to the
      bispectral (BIS) index displayed as an index, the raw frontal EEG can be displayed as a curve
      on these monitors. After a short training, anaesthetists might be more accurate and faster in
      assessing depth of anaesthesia by recognizing the pattern of the EEG curve than by using the
      BIS index. This may further enhance the positive effects that could be demonstrated for the
      use of BIS monitors.

      Therefore, the aim of the investigator's study is to investigate the clinical relevance of
      interpreting the raw frontal EEG in addition to only using the BIS index for titrating
      intravenous anaesthetics.
