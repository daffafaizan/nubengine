      incision and dissection of muscles; it delays early ambulation and breastfeeding. This can
      lead to postoperative complications such as thromboembolic disorders. So, providing an
      effective and safe postoperative analgesic method seems to be mandatory. Opioid analgesia
      remains the most effective means of relieving pain in a wide variety of conditions; however,
      it may cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, and
      respiratory depression. As the analgesia and the side effects of opioids are dose-dependent,
      a multimodal approach may enhance analgesia, which in turn would decrease the side effects .

      Mc Donnell and colleagues have reported that a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block can
      decrease the postoperative pain following abdominal surgery. The landmarks of this block were
      first described in 2001 by Rafi. The TAP block has been performed for postoperative analgesic
      control in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, hysterectomy, cesarean delivery under
      spinal anesthesia, and laparoscopic surgery.
