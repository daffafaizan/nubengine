      modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in Balance (mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects
      will be required to stand on a hard or compliant surface (a 4" tall foam cushion of known
      mechanical properties) in a comfortable posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or
      closed, head straight and arms to the side and free to move, gazing forward, and breathing
      normally. These will constitute the baseline information. Subjects will be divided into two
      groups: a isometric group (performing the isometric exercises) and an eccentric group
      (performing the eccentric exercises). At the end of Day 1, the isometric group will perform
      the isometric exercises while the eccentric group will act as control (no exercise). On Day
      2, subjects will complete the mental speed test and will undergo the CDP testing a second
      time. These will constitute the first follow-up information. At the end of Day 2, the
      eccentric group will perform the eccentric exercises while the isometric group will act as
      control (no exercise). Throughout Day 3, subjects will complete the mental speed test and
      undergo the CDP testing a third time. This will constitute the second and last follow-up
      information.
