      a new biomarker for metabolic diseases. However, data on this issue is still sparse and
      especially interventional data is not available up to now. We intend to clarify, if the human
      lipidome is correlating with metabolic state and if changes in this state reflect on the
      lipidome. Using high-throughput shot-gun technique, we will be able to measure several
      hundreds of lipid species in one blood sample.

      The "GesundLeben" trial will provide data on 100 human subjects with metabolic syndrome,
      undergoing distinct types of lifestyle intervention for 6 weeks. The cohort will be designed
      to include participants from both sexes, but be restricted on subjects without impaired
      glucose tolerance.

      Standardized metabolic assessment will be covered with routine laboratory parameters (e.g.
      transaminases, HbA1c) and oral glucose tolerance test as well as non-radiologic
      anthropometric measurements (BMI, WHR, BIA).
