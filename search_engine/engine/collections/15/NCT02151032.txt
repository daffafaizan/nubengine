      to 1 of 3 study groups. Neither you nor the study staff will be able to choose which group
      you will be in:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will read a booklet about colorectal cancer screening tests.
           While reading the booklet, you will also listen to an audio CD that will narrate the
           booklet.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will watch a video with non-moving images about colorectal
           cancer screening tests on an iPad.

        -  If you are in Group 3, you will watch a video with animated images about colorectal
           cancer screening tests on an iPad.

      You will complete questionnaires before and after viewing the program that will contain
      questions about:

        -  Your age and what language you speak

        -  Your math and reading comprehension

        -  Your knowledge of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening

        -  Your thoughts about colorectal cancer screening

        -  Your opinions about this study, and

        -  How well you understand the booklet/video you view as part of this study

      It will take about 1 hour to complete all the questionnaires. In total, the study will take
      about 1 Â½ to 2 hours to complete. After you have completed the questionnaires, your
      participation in the study will be over.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 201 people will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 67 will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson.
