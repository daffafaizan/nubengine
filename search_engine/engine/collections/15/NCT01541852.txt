      patients complete the study. Study patients will have a 50% chance of receiving either
      Losmapimod or Placebo. Patients will be expected to attend for up to 12 visits, over a 24
      week period. The visits consist of an initial screening visit, and 2 pre-dose imaging visits
      to include a PET-CT scan and an optional MRI scan. The next 7 visits (at 2-4 weekly
      intervals) involve blood tests and safety evaluations. A number of procedures including heart
      tracings (ECGs), non-invasive vascular measurements and lung function tests at the start and
      at the end of the study. Repeat imaging with PET-CT and MRI will be performed at the end of
      the study and a follow-up visit.

      The purpose of the study is to see if the study medication has a beneficial effect on
      vascular function and structure. It is envisaged that this trial will help define more
      evolutionary biomarkers to focus on to help COPD patients in the future.
