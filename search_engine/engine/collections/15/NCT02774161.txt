      I. To investigate the use of quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy to detect early
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an inexpensive and widely available quantitative (i.e.
      robust) method to confirm disease in developing countries.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo B-mode ultrasound imaging of the liver over 15 minutes.
