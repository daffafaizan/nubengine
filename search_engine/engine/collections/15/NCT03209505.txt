      induced in subjects after contact lens fitting that do not have LWE at study enrollment.
      Subjects in the trial will be fit in 2 contact lenses with different coefficients of friction
      (CoF). One eye will be fit in a contact lens with a low coefficient of friction (Acuvue
      Oasys®, Johnson & Johnson Vision, Jacksonville FL) while the contralateral eye will be fit in
      a contact lens with a high CoF (Air Optix® Night & Day® Aqua, Ft. Worth, TX), as reported in
      the scientific literature. The eye receiving each lens will be assigned randomly. The
      presence of LWE will be assessed at 2 different time points, approximately 2 hours after
      contact lens fitting and approximately after 7 days of contact lens wear.
