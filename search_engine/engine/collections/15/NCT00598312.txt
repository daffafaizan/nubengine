      receive one (1) of three (3) lots of Oakwood Laboratories' Leuprolide Acetate for Injectable
      Suspension 22.5 mg for two cycles. A subset of patients (minimum of 12) will be assigned to
      each lot (A, B or C) and will have additional blood sampling to characterize leuprolide
      release kinetics for each dose administered.
