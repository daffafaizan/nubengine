    
      Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a genetic disease that affects about 1 in 500 people
      worldwide. It can lead to kidney failure which can lead to death. PKD causes the development
      of kidney cysts (fluid-filled balloons), which cause worsening kidney function. It is common
      for people with PKD to also have blood in the urine, kidney pain, high blood pressure, kidney
      stones, kidney infections, and cysts in the brain or other parts of the body.

      There is currently no treatment known to stop cyst growth or a cure for the disease.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: niacinamide or
      placebo. Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either of the groups. For
      people that qualify and decide to participate in this study, they will be asked to make five
      visits to the study clinic and complete two study related phone calls over the course of 12
      months.
