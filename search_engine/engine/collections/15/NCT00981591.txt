      hypertension. Despite widespread use of nitric oxide to treat critically ill
      mechanically-ventilated pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension, response to therapy
      is not universal. Nitric oxide fails to improve oxygenation in approximately 30% of these
      patients. Nonresponders to nitric oxide have few treatment options. Iloprost is the only
      other medication approved for inhalational delivery in the treatment of pulmonary
      hypertension. Inhalation therapy for pulmonary vasodilatation in critically ill children is
      inherently more attractive than oral or intravenous therapies due to the ability to deliver
      medication directly to the lung and to decrease systemic effects. The use of inhaled iloprost
      has been reported to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance in many pediatric pathologic
      settings, including combination therapy with nitric oxide.
