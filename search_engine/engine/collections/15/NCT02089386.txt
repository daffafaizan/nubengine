      metaplasia as measured by changes in Barrett's esophagus appearance by endoscopy and
      histology. Tamoxifen treatment may induce SOX2 expression, decrease CDX2 and promote
      esophageal stem cell activity, leading to regression of Barrett's metaplasia. To test this
      hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective, pilot study where patients with BE, without high
      grade dysplasia, are treated with tamoxifen and assessed for changes in the appearance of
      their BE by endoscopy and histology as well as changes in the SOX2/CDX2 ratio indicative of
      an improvement in BE metaplasia
