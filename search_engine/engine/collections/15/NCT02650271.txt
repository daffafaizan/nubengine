      increased dramatically in many countries. Hepatectomy is a radical therapy for early-stage
      HCC. However, even after radical resection, the prognosis for HCC patients remains
      discouraging because of the high recurrence rate and frequent incidence of intrahepatic
      metastasis. Therefore, preventing HCC recurrence is very important.

      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major risk factor for HCC development in China. Some
      retrospective studies have shown that tenofovir or entecavir treatment for HBV-related HCC
      patients can effectively reduce the HCC recurrence rate and increase the survival rate after
      hepatectomy. However, which drug has more efficacy has not been addressed.
