    
      Primary Objectives:

      This is a pilot study to evaluate how midurethral sling (MUS) placement for the treatment of
      stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects the bladder microenvironment, specifically the
      local microbial community or "microbiome" of the bladder and the cytokine expression profile.
      The investigators also aim to correlate any changes in the microbiome or cytokine expression
      profile with patient-reported urinary symptoms preoperatively and postoperatively.

      Specific Aim 1: Assess the change in the urinary and vaginal microbiome (preoperatively to
      postoperatively) in women undergoing MUS placement for the treatment of SUI. The
      investigators hypothesize that the bladder environment will be disturbed by surgery involving
      the lower urinary tract and will show demonstrable changes in the urinary and vaginal
      microbiota.

      Specific Aim 2: Characterize the cytokine profile of the bladder (preoperatively to
      postoperatively) in women undergoing MUS placement for the treatment of SUI. The
      investigators hypothesize that MUS treatment will change the cytokine profile of the bladder
      and lead to alterations in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
