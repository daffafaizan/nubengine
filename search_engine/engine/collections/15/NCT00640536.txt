      for cardiovascular diseases. This fact makes it more difficult to establish a causal
      relationship between OSA and cardiovascular diseases. The relationship between OSA and right
      ventricular (RV) function is controversial. RV dysfunction may be a result of chronic
      intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia during apneic episodes. It may also occur secondary to
      left ventricular dysfunction as a result of increased afterload and sympathetic activity
      which causes secondary hypertension. As systemic hypertension is one of the most accompanying
      and contributing factors in OSA along with obesity, we tried to compare the effects of newly
      diagnosed OSA on RV function with an age and body mass index- matched control group.
