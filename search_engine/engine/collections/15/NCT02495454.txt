      course of R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone), and
      that using a less intense R-miniCHOP (an attenuated version of the standard R-CHOP:
      Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone) combination an acceptable
      cure rate can be achieved this study is designed to try to improve the cure rate in unfit
      patients with DLBCL (Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma) by adopting the R-miniCHOP scheme
      substituting Rituximab with the more active GA101 monoclonal antibody. The study hypothesis
      is that a higher activity of the treatment can be achieved without modifying the cytotoxic
      part of the treatment but using a more active immunotherapy. Differently from the previous
      experience with R-miniCHOP eligible patient are not only identified using anagraphic criteria
      but adopting CGA (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment) as part of initial assessment and
      considering as eligible unfit patients.
