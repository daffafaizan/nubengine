      and Kolop mud-pack therapy on pain, function and quality of life in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.

      Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, follow-up study 60 patients with knee
      osteoarthritis were treated with either Tiszasüly hot mud-pack (Group 1), or with Kolop hot
      mud-pack (Group 2) on 10 occasions for 2 weeks (10 working days). 100 mm Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) for knee pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC),
      Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lequesne Index for physical function and
      EuroQoL-5D for quality-of-life measure were recorded at baseline, at the end of treatment
      (Week 2) and 3 months later (Week 12).
