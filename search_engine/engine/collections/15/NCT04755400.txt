      subjects and hypertensive patients.

      This effect is thought to be caused through bioconversion to nitric oxide. Thus improving
      risk factors of cardiovascular decease by increasing vasodilatation, salt regulation and
      vasoactive hormones.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of inorganic
      nitrate on kidney function, hormones and circulation, which is still unknown.

      The effect of 4 days treatment with 24 mmol potassium nitrate capsules on heart rate, blood
      pressure, vasoactive hormones and urinary excretion of sodium and water will be measured in a
      randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded, crossover study in 20 healthy subjects. Each
      subject attends 2x2 examination days at least 4 weeks apart. The examination days are divided
      into 8 clearance periods of 30 min. each. The first 3 are baseline periods and in period 4 1
      Liter of saline is administered to detect any difference in renal parameters after NaCl load.

      If inorganic nitrate supplementation is found to lower blood pressure in addition to
      favorable renal effects, it could lead to changes in the general treatment of high blood
      pressure and cardiovascular disease.
