      of women across England in the final stages of pregnancy and the first 9 months post birth,
      how much and in what ways music is used by these women, and whether there are any
      associations between music and mental health. The study aims to recruit between 1,000 and
      5,000 women to take the anonymous questionnaire. However, women who complete the
      questionnaire while still pregnant will be invited to complete three further questionnaires
      shortly post-birth and 3 months later to gather longitudinal data to analyse change across
      pregnancy into post-birth (aiming for 500 of the 1,000 undertaking this repeated
      measurement).

      Phase A of the study will be open to NHS sites around England to take part.
