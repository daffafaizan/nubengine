      high clinical activity. Histopathological complete remission after preoperative chemotherapy
      has a direct correlation with the disease-free and overall survival. The aim of combining a
      chemotherapy regime with sorafenib in the neoadjuvant setting is to increase the locoregional
      and systemic outcome of these patients
