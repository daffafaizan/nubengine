      chronic pain patients in the U.S. alone [1]. While numerous treatments exist, none completely
      addresses this issue. In particular, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has become an established
      technique for treating patients with chronic neuropathic pain [2]. The conventional paradigm
      for SCS treatment is to attempt to mask the pain by substituting the pain sensation with
      paresthesias [3]; however, newer studies have shown that it is possible to gain excellent
      pain relief without concomitant paresthesias ("sub-threshold stimulation") using different
      stimulation parameters [4] [5]. Because these paresthesia-free programming paradigms are
      still new, the best to place the stimulation and the best programming parameters to use is
      still unclear, making it difficult to place the leads during surgical implantation and to
      program the patient afterwards. Additionally, sub-threshold stimulation does not provide
      immediate pain relief, but may take several hours or even days to feel relief, making a
      simple programming session of a few hours insufficient to determine the optimal stimulation
      placement. While these differences from conventional SCS make programming more difficult
      initially, studying this new stimulation paradigm, especially differences in optimal
      stimulation location and the time course of pain relief, may also provide insight into the
      mechanism of action of sub-threshold stimulation. This protocol aims to study the optimal
      stimulation parameters and locations with SCS using sub-threshold stimulation.
