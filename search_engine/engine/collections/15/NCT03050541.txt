      positive, negative, social, and neutral memories. The study will use a between subjects
      design with three groups (N = 20 per group). Two of the groups will be randomly assigned to
      receive MDMA before one of the two stages of memory: Encoding (ENC) or Retrieval (RET). The
      third group will receive placebo only (PLC). All three groups will receive capsules before
      viewing the study materials, and at retrieval two days later, but they will receive MDMA only
      in the capsule appropriate to their condition, and other capsules will contain placebo.

      Participants will participate in two sessions: a viewing session during which they will view
      emotional and neutral stimuli, followed 48 hours later by a retrieval session, during which
      there will be a surprise memory test with two components (verbally cued recollection and
      picture recognition). On all sessions subjects will also complete mood questionnaires.
