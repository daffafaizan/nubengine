    
      Design: prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel, non-inferiority. A total of 280
      patients will be randomized for management on the basis of DNP (primary) or PSG (specialist),
      thereby giving rise to 4 groups: two treated and two not treated with CPAP. The former will
      undergo a home auto-titration. The follow-up will last 6 months and include 4 evaluations.
