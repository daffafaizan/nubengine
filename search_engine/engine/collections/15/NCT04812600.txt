      post-exercise measurement) on the first day of cardiac rehab, and following 1 and 4 weeks of
      cardiac rehabilitation.

      Subjects will have their arterial pulse measured at the radial (wrist), carotid (neck) and
      temple (side of the head) arteries. The sensor will remain in place for 2-3 minutes while the
      recordings are made. Light pressure will be applied during this time. Blood pressure will
      also be obtained in the opposite arm.

      The subject will then exercise on the modalities, intensity and duration designated by the
      staff in the Sentara Heart Hospital Cardiac Rehabilitation. It's important to note, that the
      normal standard of care will not change by the individual participating in this research
      study. The participants will follow standard physician ordered cardiac rehabilitation. The
      order of the modalities performed will be completed in the same order on the day of research
      testing in weeks 1 and 4.

      After finishing the exercise, the subject will sit down for 1hr. The participant's pulse
      signals will be measured at 0-5min, 10min, 20 min, 30min and 1hr after exercise. Blood
      pressure will also be obtained from the opposite arm at the same time intervals.

      The investigators will be collecting cardiac rehab data from each research day. This data
      will be entered into Redcap by the Sentara researchers.

      The investigators will record from the most recent values/visits prior to start of cardiac
      rehab therapy, and this information will be entered into Redcap by the Sentara researchers.

      The investigators will document at 1, 2 and 3 years from start of cardiac rehab, as to
      patient survival status.
