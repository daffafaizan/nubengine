      patients (20 women and 17 men) with uncontrolled T2DM and chronic periodontitis who were
      selected from among those admitting to Dentistry Faculty of Inonu University and Turgut Ozal
      Medical Center completed this study. The patients were divided into two groups. The
      individuals in the control group underwent placebo laser treatment in addition to scaling and
      root planing (SRP). The individuals in the study group underwent DL (1 W power) in addition
      to SRP. Clinical index measurements were performed before treatment (T0), 3 months after
      treatment (T1), and 6 months after treatment (T2). Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),
      bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), and probing depth (PD) were
      measured to determine periodontal status. HbA1c and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also
      analyzed using blood samples.
