    
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-randomized study enrolling up to
      234 subjects with lifestyle-limiting claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to
      lesion(s) (stenosed, occluded, restenosed, or re-occluded) in the infra-inguinal segment
      (Superficial femoral artery [SFA] and/or proximal popliteal artery) that are amenable to
      treatment by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting. All subjects enrolled
      in the study will receive PTA and stenting.
