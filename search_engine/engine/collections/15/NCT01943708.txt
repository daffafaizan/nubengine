      differ from machine to machine. This single-blind randomised crossover trial aims to compare
      the efficacy of SPAP (a novel Auto-CPAP algorithm) to conventional CPAP.

      Up to 50 patients will be recruited from an OSA population, aged over 18. Participants will
      consist of male and female patients diagnosed with moderate-severe OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index
      (AHI) greater than or equal to 15 per hour. Eligible participants, according to the protocol
      approved by the Northern X Region Ethics Committee, providing written informed consent will
      be enrolled into the study. Patients will be enrolled sequentially according to the
      randomisation list. Patients will be randomised to CPAP or SPAP.

      The therapeutic pressure will be based on the most recent titration night of each patient.
      Comparisons between data will be made using a one-tailed t-test for non-inferiority of the
      SPAP algorithm compared with conventional CPAP therapy.
