      careful selection will be treated with TDD, followed by a standardized rehabilitation
      program. After the diagnosis Lumboradicular syndrome the patient will first receive an
      transforaminal epidural injection at the site and level of the herniated disc, proven on MRI.
      Two weeks after the epidural injection the patient is evaluated. When the response is
      negative (a decrease less than 2.5 points on the 10 points VAS scale) TDD can be performed.
      Patient outcome will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the study
      intervention. End point of this study is 3 months after TDD treatment. A positive response is
      defined as a minimal decrease of 2.5 points on the 10 points VAS scale compared to the VAS
      score at baseline.

      A positive response in at least seven patients and acceptable side-effects and complications
      will lead to the start of a RCT.

      If the response is positive < 7 out of 20 patients, the decision to proceed with a RCT
      following the prospective CS is made after evaluation of the CS by a team of experts. The
      results from this prospective study will be published.
