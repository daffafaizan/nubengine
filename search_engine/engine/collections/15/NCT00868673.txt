      worldwide. This epidemic has been attributed to dietary fructose consumption. Although
      experimental models have demonstrated a role of fructose in the development of obesity,
      metabolic syndrome and kidney disease, data in human models is lacking. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if a low fructose intake could have an impact on the components of the
      metabolic syndrome. The primary endpoint will be to determine the impact of low fructose on
      weight loss. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the impact of low fructose diet on blood
      pressure and cardiovascular biochemical profile.

      If fructose is a causal pathway to obesity and metabolic syndrome, it may represent an
      important target to mitigate this important health problem.
