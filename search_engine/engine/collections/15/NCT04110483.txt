      technique showed promising results in terms of safety and tumor staging. Development of laser
      surgery and emergence of the holmium (Ho:YAG) and later thulium (Tm:YAG) lasers in the 1990s
      enabled laser ERBT with subsequent studies demonstrating high efficacy and safety of the new
      techniques. Ho:YAG and Tm:YAG ERBT have distinct advantages over conventional TURBT such as
      the complete absence of the obturator nerve reflex and hence, lower risks of perforation or
      bleeding as well as a higher quality specimens for pathologic examination, due to lack of the
      cautery effect. Recently, a new type of thulium laser was developed - that allows to decrease
      the penetration depth less than 0.15 mm, which is two times less than that of Tm:YAG. Another
      advantage is the decreased carbonization compared to Tm:YAG due to better water absorption of
      laser energy. All these aspects make Tm:YAG a precise tool that may improve the resection
      quality resulting in better management. Data on laser ERBT of NMIBC with Tm:YAG is limited
      and that on Tm-fiber laser ERBT is absent altogether. The investigators hypothesized that
      Tm-fiber laser ERBT would result in a lower probability of adverse events and better
      recurrence-free survival compared to conventional TURBT.
