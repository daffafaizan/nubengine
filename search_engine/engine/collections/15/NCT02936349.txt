      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) population. PAVMs are abnormal connections
      between the veins and arteries and result in right-to-left shunting of blood within the
      lungs. Successful embolization results in PAVM resolution and decreases the complications
      associated with right-to-left shunting. Current guidelines recommend follow-up with interval
      chest CT scan to determine treatment success and detect new or recurrent PAVMs after
      embolization. This results in significant radiation exposure to the relatively young HHT
      population. An alternative to chest CT is graded transthoracic contrast echocardiography
      (TTCE), which measures the amount of right-to-left shunting within the lung and assigns a
      grade based on this amount. TTCE has the advantage of being radiation free compared to chest
      CT. To date, graded TTCE has only been studied as a screening tool for PAVMs. These studies
      have shown that graded TTCE is highly sensitive in detecting PAVMs and is comparable to chest
      CT when screening for PAVMs. Results indicate that TTCE grade can accurately predict PAVM
      size on chest CT and predict whether PAVMs are amenable to embolization. However, no studies
      have compared graded TTCE and chest CT in patients who are post-embolization and it is
      therefore unknown whether graded TTCE can be used in patients who have undergone PAVM
      embolization. The current study seeks to correlate post-embolization TTCE grade with chest CT
      findings to determine whether TTCE can accurately predict PAVM size and amenability to
      treatment in the post-embolization population.
