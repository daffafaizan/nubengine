      I. Determine the radiographic response rate in patients with solid tumor brain metastases
      treated with bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months. II. Determine the time to
      progression based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans.

      III. Determine the time to response based on radiographic imaging. IV. Determine the duration
      of response based on radiographic imaging. V. Determine overall survival. VI. Collect
      additional safety data. VII. Assess changes in quality of life using the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) while on treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks.
