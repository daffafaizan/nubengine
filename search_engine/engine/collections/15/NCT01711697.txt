      To test the safety and tolerability of an alternative fractionation regimen in locally
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), consisting of 44 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy
      followed by a stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) boost to remaining parenchymal and
      nodal disease. The maximum tolerated dose of the SBRT boost will be determined.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess local control.

        2. To assess distant metastasis and patterns of failure.

        3. To assess overall survival at 1 and 2 years.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of radiation therapy and SBRT.

      Patients undergo radiation therapy daily and receive carboplatin and paclitaxel weekly for
      4.5 weeks. Patients then undergo 2 boost SBRT treatments 2-3 days apart.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
