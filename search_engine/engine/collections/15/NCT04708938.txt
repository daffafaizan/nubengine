    
      28 individuals who meet the TMER / Research Diagnostic Criteria classification will be
      randomly divided into 2 groups. Exercise with high voltage electrical stimulation (YVES) will
      be applied to the 1st group and only exercise will be applied to the 2nd group. The second
      group will be the control group of the study. Both groups will be informed about the disease
      before starting the study before the treatment and patient education will be given about the
      situations that need attention. Again, 2 groups will be given an exercise program from the
      day they start the treatment, 3 times a week for 4 weeks during the treatment. As
      sociodemographic information of the individuals, age, gender, height, weight, body mass
      index, marital and educational status, occupation, smoking and alcohol use, patient history,
      family history and complaint sides will be recorded. Before starting treatment, individuals
      will be evaluated for pain, temporomandibular joint mobility, cervical mobility, tender
      points, and joint sounds:

        1. Pain with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),

        2. TMJ mobility with a ruler,

        3. Cervical mobility with C-ROM (Cervical Range of Motion) inclinometer,

        4. Head position with universal goniometer and ImageJ software,

        5. Sensitive points with algometer,

        6. Joint sounds will be evaluated as present / absent as a result of the evaluation of
           movements in all directions (maximum mouth opening, right / left lateral excursions,
           protrusion and retrusion).

      After 4 weeks of treatment, the measurements will be repeated.
