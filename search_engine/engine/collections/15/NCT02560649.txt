      current study is to investigate whether the HBsAg clearance rate can be improved if applying
      RGT strategy in HBeAg positive CHB patients treated by NUC achieved HBVDNA<1000copies/ml，and
      HBsAg<5000IU/ml; &HBeAg<100PEIU/ml (or470s/co), combined with PEG-IFN a-2a for 24 weeks. Then
      the subjects will be divided into three groups according to qHBsAg levels of week 24 (RGT).
      For the subjects who qHBsAg<200IU/ml of week 24, they are defined in Group A; the subjects in
      Group A will continue to be treated by NUC combined with PEG-IFN a-2a 180μg for another 24
      weeks(total will be 48 weeks). If the qHBsAg at week 24 did not achieve minor 200IU/ml, the
      subjects will be randomized to 2 groups: Group B: the subjects will continue to be treated by
      NUC combined with PEG-IFN a-2a 180μg for another 24 weeks (total will be 48 weeks); Group C:
      the subjects will be treated by NUC until 48 weeks.
