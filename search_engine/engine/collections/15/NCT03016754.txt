      used to observe the rate of recovery of ventricular function (EF>35%) between 90 and 180 days
      in newly diagnosed HF patients who were prescribed the WCD ≤ 10 days post-discharge after
      hospitalization for a primary reason of new onset HF (≤30 days since first HF
      hospitalization), with ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and have already used a WCD
      for 90 ± 14 days. For the first 90 days of WCD use, patients will be enrolled in a pre-study
      registry. The FDA-approved WCD will be prescribed for up to 6 months of use after hospital
      discharge, with the option for longer use under physician discretion. Approximately 870
      subjects will enroll into the pre-study registry and 750 subjects into the study.
