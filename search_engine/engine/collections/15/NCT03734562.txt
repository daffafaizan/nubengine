      mortality in patients surviving a myocardial infarction. ICDÂ´s have been proven to reduce
      mortality in this patients population, nonetheless, recurrent arrhythmia and ICD shocks are
      known to negatively impact ventricular function and are associated with worsening heart
      failure and mortality. We devised a controlled, randomized, parallel, single blind, phase IV
      clinical trial with the aim of comparing the efficacy and safety of substrate-based
      radiofrequency catheter ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with ischemic
      cardiomyopathy and scar-related sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, implanted with
      an ICD.
