      either a linear or a macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) on change from
      baseline to Year 5 in composite measure of motor and cognitive function among neurologically
      normal adults in comparison to a matched non-GBCA- exposed control group.

      The secondary objectives comprise the assessment of the following endpoints in GBCA-exposed
      participants as compared to controls a) changes from baseline in composite measure of motor
      and cognitive function post-baseline on yearly basis (Years 1 to 4); b) changes from baseline
      in each individual test of motor and cognitive function on yearly basis (Years 1 to 5). Total
      Gd concentrations in blood and urine samples on yearly basis (Years 1 to 5) and adverse
      events will be collected as secondary objectives.

      Of note : The study is considered interventional because of the addition of UE-MRI scans for
      all participants, as well as blood sampling and the administration of the motor and cognitive
      tests. The GBCA administered as part of the contrast-enhanced MR imaging in the experimental
      arms is not the intervention in this study. Neither the protocol nor the investigators assign
      patients to a specific GBCA as part of the study, making this part of the study observational
      rather than interventional. The participants were already scheduled, prior to study
      screening, to undergo CE-MRI as part of their clinical care. The choice of GBCA for the
      CE-MRI will be based on medical need and institutional usage of GBCA, independent of study
      participation.
