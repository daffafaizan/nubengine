      surgery patients in Glasgow dental hospital and school.

      The CBCT scans of class III patients who undergone maxillary advancement with minimal or
      without impaction and mandibular setback will be identified.

      The preoperative and 6 months postoperative CBCT images will be anonymised The surgical
      planning and soft tissue prediction will be performed on the preoperative images using
      Dolphin3d software.

      The resultant soft tissue 3D model will be superimposed on the actual postoperative soft
      tissue model.

      Analysis of the difference between the prediction and the actual postoperative will be
      performed to quantify the difference between them in order to assess the accuracy of the
      software prediction.

      The sample will be collected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pre and post
      operation CBCT voxel based super imposition using ONDEMAND 3d. The surgical movement will be
      quantified using direct slice land-marking . Using the pre-operattion CBCT to do the surgical
      mock up and the soft tissue simulation on dolphin 3D.

      Segment the soft tissue of the prediction. Soft tissue surface models of the simulation and
      the actual postoperative images were generated and exported as STLs.

      Generic meshes conformation dense correspondence analysis. Superimposition of the predicted
      and the post operative STLs. Using VR mesh software, the mesh will be segmented into
      pre-identified anatomical regions.

      The distance between the corresponding vertices will be displayed as a colour scale in
      milli-meter and will be analysed in the individual dimension of space (x, y and z) using
      in-house software and each dimension will be displayed as a colour coded distance map.
