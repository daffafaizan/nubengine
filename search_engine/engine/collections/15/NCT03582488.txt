      (MCR) and 30 from Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MCJ). Additionally, 45 controls will be enrolled,
      30 from MCR and 15 from MCJ. We will obtain up to six assessments in each subject over the 5
      years of the study, baseline, six month and annually thereafter. We will follow these cohorts
      with clinical and biospecimen data collection annually and once at six months, and CSF
      collection annually within the guidelines of the Parkinson's Disease Biomarker's Program
      (PDBP). Clinical neuroimaging will be performed annually and include: a) dopamine transporter
      imaging with Ioflupane (123I) SPECT (DaTscan) as the biomarker of LBD-related loss of
      dopaminergic activity, b) structural MRI AD- signature atrophy as the biomarker of AD-related
      neurodegeneration, c) β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition on PET as the biomarker of Aβ pathology. In
      patients from the MCR site, we will investigate AV-1451 PET. Since the specificity of AV-1451
      PET is not established for tau deposition in DLB, we will investigate this biomarker in a
      subset of DLB patients to determine the pattern of AV-1451 uptake compared to clinically
      normal controls, and its association with atrophy, Aβ load and clinical disease progression
      in DLB.
