      muscle and bone metabolism function, and biochemical evidence of improvement of DNA damage
      repair in healthy elderly female patients with and without exercise.

      Secondary Objective: To assess the effect of NR in metabolic functions of glucose and lipid
      profile as well as to determine the safety of long term administration of NR in healthy
      elderly female patients with and without exercise.
