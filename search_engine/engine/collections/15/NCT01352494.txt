      and this method of treatment has been extended to patients with earlier disease without
      affecting the treatment outcome. This single arm, multicenter phase II study was designed to
      evaluate the response rate, toxicity, progression free survival and tumor control rate of
      docetaxel and gemcitabine in the neoadjuvant setting with locally advanced breast cancer.
