      decreases in cardiovascular disease and other chronic disease states. This is related to the
      long chain omega-3 fatty acid (n-3) content of fish and fish oil, specifically
      eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Although the consumption of high n-3 fish is
      recommended in the 2005 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans, no specific consumption levels
      are made for the fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or the fatty acid docosahexaenoic
      acid (DHA) or total fish intake.

      Consumption of high n-3 fish or dietary supplementation of fish oil will lead to increased
      levels of these fatty acids in plasma lipoproteins, cell and tissue lipid. This change in
      membrane lipid is thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of n-3. Because
      highly unsaturated fatty acid are subject to peroxidation, the level of fish intake that is
      sufficient to modify membrane n-3 content and the exact level that enhances peroxidation is
      unknown.

      We will perform a dose-response feeling study in which varied levels of fish (salmon) will be
      provided in random order separated by 4 or more week washout periods. We will assess the
      level of cell membrane enrichment with n-3 and the effect on lipid peroxidation outcomes.
