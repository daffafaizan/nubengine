      strategies are uncommonly used, despite a plethora of evidence for physical, pharmacological
      and psychological techniques. Parents commonly report pain as a harm-related concern for
      childhood immunizations and are dissatisfied with current practices. Unmitigated pain causes
      long-term adverse sequelae, including; anticipatory fear and hypersensitivity to pain at
      future procedures in children, and parental non-compliance with immunization schedules.
      Health providers and parents report the major barrier to routine use of pain management is
      parental lack of knowledge about effective strategies. Lack of time is reported as a
      secondary barrier. An educational tool about immunization pain management targeted to parents
      that can be practically implemented in the clinical setting within usual time constraints is
      needed.
