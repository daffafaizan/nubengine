      clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with subcutaneous injectable
      methotrexate. Adherence to MTX will be assessed by the Compliance Questionnaire Rheumatology
      (CQR). Measurement of this adherence could optimize MTX treatment prior to the use of
      biotherapy which is costly with a lower infectious tolerance.

      Correlation between its concentration and compliance assessed by CQR questionnaire will be
      tested.
