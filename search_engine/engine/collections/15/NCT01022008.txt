      extremely low incidence of these conditions, it is foreseen to include twelve patients per
      year, during two years, which represent 24 patients in total with a minimum follow-up of one
      year.

      Evaluation criteria. The main evaluation criteria are the polysomnography variables (sleep
      apnea index, characterization of obstructive versus central respiratory events, the
      oxygenation pattern through the night), which will be performed before and after surgery (6
      and 12 months post-op). The secondary criteria are the exorbitism correction analysed with
      the globe protrusion index and the rate of infections. A multidisciplinary task force group
      has already been structured in Necker Hospital.

      Expected results. We expect to analyze and correct all the sleep apnea syndromes. Many
      modifications could be made on the distractors, including removal of the activation rods,
      bioresorbable parts, as well as the modification of the surgical techniques.
