      sedation and ventilator weaning were based on attending physicians clinical judgement, which
      greatly varies among individual. Previous study on the use of these protocols showed a
      favorable outcome. We aim to assess the safety and effectiveness of this protocol in our
      PICU.

      Subjects were recruited consecutively and randomized into intervention and control group.

        -  Intervention group: sedation and ventilator weaning protocol

        -  Control group: no protocol

      Primary outcomes:

        -  FLACC score

        -  COMFORT score

        -  Ventilator days

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Self extubation

        -  Reintubation

        -  PICU Length of stay

        -  Frequency of asynchrony
