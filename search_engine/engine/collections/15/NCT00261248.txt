      States. Since antibiotic prophylaxis is not always effective, alternate treatments need to be
      developed. One such treatment would be immunization with a vaccine containing bacteria known
      to cause these infections. The objective of the study is to immunize susceptible women with
      inactivated bacteria contained in a vaginal suppository and to monitor the rates of
      reinfection compared to a group of women treated with placebo suppositories. Each group of
      patients will receive a total of six suppositories in the first four-months of the six-month
      study during which all UTIs and side effects will be recorded. The infection rates between
      vaccine- and placebo-treated women will be statistically analyzed to determine vaccine
      efficacy.
