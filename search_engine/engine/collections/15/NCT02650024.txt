      Aim 1. Impact of HCV Cure on CNS Outcomes. Determine how curing HCV without IFN alters CNS
      outcomes in substance users with chronic HCV disease.

      Aim 2. Correlates of CNS Outcomes. Determine the viral and host correlates of Aim 1's
      neurocognitive outcomes.

      Aim 3. Impact of HIV Co-infection. Explore how HIV alters the relationships observed in Aims
      1 and 2. Hypothesis 3: Compared with HCV mono-infected adults, SVR will be less likely to
      result in improved CNS outcomes in HCV/HIV co-infected adults.
