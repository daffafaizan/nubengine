      performed annually, with projections of 3.5 million performed annually by 2030. The
      increasing incidence of TKA comes with an immediate need for establishing optimal
      rehabilitation guidelines to remediate common post-TKA physical impairments and improve
      functional outcomes. Over the past decade, a primary focus of the investigators' TKA
      rehabilitation research has been on progressive strengthening, which improves muscle strength
      and physical function, and is now the contemporary approach to TKA rehabilitation. However, a
      major issue remaining for patients rehabilitating from unilateral TKA is the persistence of
      atypical movement patterns. These atypical movement patterns, observed during walking and
      other functional tasks, are characterized by disuse of the surgical limb, resulting in
      smaller knee extension moments on the surgical limb compared to the non-surgical limb. As a
      result, atypical movement patterns following unilateral TKA are associated with persistent
      quadriceps weakness and poor physical function.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 150 participants undergoing
      unilateral TKA to determine if the addition of a novel movement pattern training program
      (MOVE) to contemporary, progressive rehabilitation improves movement pattern quality more
      than contemporary progressive rehabilitation alone (CONTROL). The secondary goal is to
      determine if movement pattern training improves long-term physical function. Testing will
      occur pre-operatively and after TKA at 10 weeks (end of intervention), 6 months (primary
      endpoint), and 24 months.
