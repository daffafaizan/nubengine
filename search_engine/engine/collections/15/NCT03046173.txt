      overcoming the shortage of bone mass deficiency in atrophic maxillary posterior region. Bone
      transplantation is considered to be a prerequisite for the success of maxillary sinus floor
      elevation. Platelet-rich plasma and platelet-rich fibrin have been used to accelerate bone
      formation, regeneration, and repair. However, few in-depth studies are reported on the
      effects of concentrated growth factors on new bone formation.
