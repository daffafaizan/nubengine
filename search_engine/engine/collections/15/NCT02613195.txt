      a solution, transplantation center is working on the application of marginal grafted liver or
      renal, especially the aging grafts. The most common inducement of organ dysfunction during
      the perioperation is liver/renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, caused by the generation
      of cytotoxic oxygen radicals. Hydrogen gas is a kind of reducing gas, which has been reported
      to display antioxidant properties and protective effects against organ dysfunction induced by
      various I/R injuries. Investigators will investigate whether hydrogen-rich Celsior solution
      improve the quality of aging grafts in liver/ kidney transplantation.
