    
      Patients were assigned to one of two groups by chance (like a coin toss):

        -  GROUP 1 - Received 500mg of vancomycin into the tibia (shin) bone of the leg being
           operated on.

        -  GROUP 2 - Received 1g of vancomycin, which is the amount normally given to patients.

      For both groups, the revision knee replacement will then be carried out as normal.

      OTHER ANTIBIOTICS All patients received cefazolin IV (an antibiotic used to prevent
      infection) prior to the beginning of surgery to ensure effective preventive antibiotics. The
      patient will also received 3 postoperative doses of cefazolin over a 24-hour period (4 doses
      in total). This is standard of care for all total knee replacement surgeries.

      TISSUE SAMPLES

        -  Ten (10) tissue samples were taken during the surgery, consisting of both bone and fat
           beneath the skin. Each sample were very small, around the size of a pinhead.

        -  In addition, a drain sample was taken from the knee joint drain fluid to measure
           vancomycin concentration the morning following surgery.

        -  These samples were frozen and sent to a lab for analysis.
