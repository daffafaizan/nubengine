      perioperative bleeding. This hematic loss results in a high rate of blood transfusion after
      total knee replacement (TKR) with an incidence from 10% to 58%.Methods to prevent the need
      for allogenic blood transfusion after TKR include hemodilution, perioperative blood salvage
      and reinfusion, hypotensive anesthesia, preoperative autologous blood donation and
      intravenous administration of tranexamic acid.

      In the last decade, the topical use of fibrin sealant has become a logical surgical stratagem
      for reducing blood loss in total knee arthroplasty.Fibrin sealants mimic the final step of
      the coagulation cascade reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements.

      A novel hemostatic agent derived from banked allogenic human plasma (EVICEL, Johnson &
      Johnson Wound Management, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) is recently available on the market for a
      variety of surgical specialty.

      A randomized controlled study is conducted to test if the post-operative reduction in
      hemoglobin level would be lower in the fibrin sealant group compared to a control group.
