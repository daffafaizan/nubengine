      quantitative variables, where each variable is related linearly to cardiovascular risk. Even
      consensual definitions differ between international authorities and continue to change.
      Moreover, such cutoff s should be gender and ethic difference. Cluster analysis is a
      statistical method base on algorithms, which seek to minimize within-group variation and
      maximize between-group variation for the clustering variables. This technique is suitable for
      defining groups, reflecting the natural structure of data without relying on inappropriate
      arbitrary cutoffs. We conduct this retrospective study to review the medical records of
      female patients who visited our Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic from Jan. 1, 2009 to Dec.
      31, 2012. Cluster analysis was performed in our studied cases to evaluate the correlation
      between clinical/biochemical characteristic and risk of metabolic risk in women with
      reproductive age.
