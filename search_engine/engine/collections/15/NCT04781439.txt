      from the last decade. This randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of early
      switching from IV to PO antibiotics on the outcome of surgical patients at a public hospital.

      Methods: Patients admitted for a therapeutic antibiotic to orthopedic and general surgery
      conditions were randomly assigned to three groups: control (non-switching), early switching
      (within 48-72 hours), and late switching (after 72 hours). The rate of effectiveness of each
      arm, length of hospital stay, length of IV antibiotics, and cost were recorded prospectively.
