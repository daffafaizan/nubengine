      previous interventions have produced statistically significant effects on ART adherence that
      do not persist after the intervention ends. A notable feature of our study is that after the
      incentives for ART adherence and provider visits were removed, participants who had been
      offered a commitment contract for ART adherence were more likely to achieve virologic
      suppression relative to individuals who had been assigned a conditional cash transfer for
      provider visits and relative to individuals who had been assigned the standard of care,
      although the difference was only statistically significant in the latter comparison. There
      were differences in the prevalence of missing outcomes across groups, but these differences
      were not statistically significant for the unanticipated post-incentive visit and therefore
      were unlikely to be the explanation for the results. Thus, financial rewards coupled with
      individual choice can increase engagement in healthy behaviors after incentives are removed.
