      continues to improve with older individuals representing a rapidly growing proportion of
      those infected. However, despite improved life expectancy, substantial residual morbidity
      remains in treated HIV including increased rates of neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and
      cardiovascular disease. As these conditions also increase with normal aging, HIV is often
      thought to be a risk factor for "early" or "accelerated" aging. Prior studies have generally
      focused on HIV-specific factors and risk for neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and
      cardiovascular disease, while few have examined extensively risk factors found to be
      significant for these conditions in the general population.

      The investigators hypothesize that the effects of age and HIV will be synergistic on the
      rates of non-AIDS morbidity. While the correlates and risk factors for non-AIDS morbidity in
      younger individuals may largely be related to HIV, in older individuals with sustained
      virologic control, traditional risk factors for neurocognitive disease, frailty, and
      cardiovascular disease will contribute more significantly to disease than HIV-specific risk
      factors. Our primary objectives are to:

        1. Define the prevalence and incidence of neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and
           cardiovascular disease in a well-defined cohort of aging virologically suppressed
           HIV-infected individuals.

        2. Identify correlates and risk factors for prevalent and incident neurocognitive
           dysfunction, frailty, and cardiovascular disease.

        3. Compare and contrast the identified correlates and risk factors for the co-morbidities
           of interest in older (>50 years old) and younger HIV-infected individuals.
