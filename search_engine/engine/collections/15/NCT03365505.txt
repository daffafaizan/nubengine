    
      elderly patients admitted to Meir hospital with acute coronary syndrome will be assessed for
      frailty twice: the first frailty assessment will be a subjective eye ball testing made by the
      cardiologist, the second assessment will be an objective one based on Fried frailty score and
      Edmonton frail scale.

      The cardiologist will not be aware of the objective frailty assessment result.

      The eye ball testing will be compared to the objective frailty assessment (Fried score and
      Edmonton frailty scale).
