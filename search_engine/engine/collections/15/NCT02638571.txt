      the diet is less than 4.9% for women and less than 3.3% for children.Young children are at
      risk of developing malnutrition because of dietary inadequacy. Educational interventions can
      improve feeding practices and growth of young children. The overall purpose of the study is
      to evaluate nutrition education interventions to promote pulse incorporated complementary
      food to the wider rural community through the government system to improve maternal
      knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) and nutritional status of young children (6 to 24
      months). The hypothesis is that nutrition education improves mothers knowledge, attitude and
      practice of pulse incorporated complementary food and improves dietary intake of iron and
      zinc and nutritional status of young children. Before, at midline and end of the intervention
      we will assess the KAP of mothers, dietary intake of iron and zinc and nutritional status of
      young children. The nutrition education intervention will be given for 9 months. Serum
      ferritin, serum zinc, C-Reactive protein and hemoglobin and dietary intake of iron and zinc
      of young children will be measured at the beginning and ending of the intervention.
