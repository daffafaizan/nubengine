    
      This is a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study to assess the pharmacokinetics of IK-1001 in healthy
      volunteers as well as subjects with varying degrees of impaired renal function following a
      single intravenous infusion.

      A total of 28 subjects will be enrolled into the study, including 6 normal subjects
      (Creatinine Clearance (CrCL) > 80 mL/min), 9 subjects with mild impairment (CrCL ≥ 50 to < 80
      mL/min), 6 subjects with intermediate impairment (≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min) and 7 subjects with
      severe impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min).

      Mild, moderate and normal healthy subjects will receive IK-1001 as a single IV infusion for 3
      hours at 1.5 mg/kg/hr. Blood, plasma, urine and exhaled air will be collected from each
      subject over 48 hours and at follow-up visit (Day 7), to evaluate pharmacokinetics of
      Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) (exhaled air), IK-1001 (blood) and thiosulfate in plasma and urine.
      Severe subjects will receive IK-1001 as a single IV infusion for 3 hours at 1.0 mg/kg/hr.

      For each dosing cohort, the study will consist of a screening visit (Days -28 to -1), a
      treatment visit (Day 0 (check-in) to Day 3), and a follow-up (exit) visit day 7 (+/- 2 days).

      Study subjects will be enrolled to one of 4 cohorts and all will receive investigational
      product at the given dose level. The subjects will be considered to be enrolled in the study
      at randomization.

      IK-1001 will be administered by a healthcare professional intravenously over 3 hours using an
      infusion pump. Dosage of IK-1001 will be administered on actual body weight basis, according
      to cohort assignment and using the subject's body weight determined on Day -1. After the end
      of the initial 3-hour study period, subjects will be observed for an additional 45 hour
      period before discharge from the unit.
