      positive-controlled, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that
      the participant receives), single-dose and multiple-dose, 4-way crossover (method used to
      switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical trial) study. A placebo
      control will be used to evaluate the effect of domperidone on QTc intervals in comparison
      with placebo. QTc is a measure of time in the heart electrical cycle. Placebo is an inactive
      substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a
      clinical trial. Moxifloxacin, which is known to prolong QTc intervals, will be used as
      positive control to establish assay sensitivity. The participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 4 treatment sequence groups (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, and DCAB) based on a
      computer-generated randomization schedule and will receive the following 4 treatments in the
      order specified by the randomization: Treatment A (10 mg domperidone); Treatment B (20 mg
      domperidone); Treatment C (placebo); Treatment D (moxifloxacin). The study has 3 phases: a
      screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase (that corresponds to 4 treatment periods),
      and an assessment period. Each treatment period will last 4 days and will be separated with a
      washout period (ie, period when receiving no treatment) of 4 to 9 days. The participants will
      be confined to the clinical testing facility for approximately 5 days in each period. All
      treatments (A, B, C and D) will be given orally with water. The maximum study duration for a
      participant will be 74 days.
