    
      Case-control study, nested in two French multicenter cohorts, on pharmacognenetic, biological
      and clinical susceptibility factors associated with the occurrence of hepatic veno-occlusive
      disease during the anticancer treatment for nephroblastoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
      with centralized genetic analysis.

      After obtaining consent (patient or parents for minor patients), a blood sample is collected
      during the routine follow-up consultation and tubes are sent directly to Paris for the
      pharmacogenetic analysis at the end of the study.
