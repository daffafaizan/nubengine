      agent against epithelial ovarian cancer (including primary fallopian tube and peritoneal
      adenocarcinoma) in combination with other drugs. Farletuzumab works by a different mechanism
      from other cancer therapeutics and has been shown to be well tolerated. This study allows the
      opportunity to determine if the combination therapy of farletuzumab, carboplatin, and PLD

        1. is safe, or

        2. to assess the potential drug-drug interaction, and

        3. to prolong response to chemotherapy.
