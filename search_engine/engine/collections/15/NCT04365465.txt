    
      This study is a randomized control trial with the following arms: 1) active device; 2)
      placebo device; 3) non-intervention (active control). The devices will be placed while women
      are still feeling pain relief from labor epidural analgesia (after delivering vaginally) or
      from spinal or epidural anesthesia (after delivering by cesarean). By applying the devices
      while women are still relatively pain-free, a preventative/pre-emptive approach to pain
      management in women at risk for severe postpartum pain is taken. The study will enroll women
      with and without OUD and follow them for five days postpartum.
