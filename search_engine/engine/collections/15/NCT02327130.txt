      challenge for intensivists. Sepsis has unpredictable onset and progression, and is a leading
      cause of death in ICUs with a mortality rate of 30-50%. Annually in the US, 1.4M cases
      involve hospitalization, 750,000 cases of severe sepsis or septic shock, and ~260,000 cases
      of sepsis related death have been reported in recent years. Current experience of UF Health
      investigators in surgical ICUs is 1 -2 sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock patients per
      day, of which ~10% are trauma patients. Of trauma patients, ~8% develop sepsis during their
      ICU stay.

      Breath delta value is hypothesized to be a biomarker of infection. Breath delta value is not
      a defined clinical outcome related to human health, because this study is seeking to
      establish breath delta value as a biomarker of infection. This study is measuring the
      feasibility of the Isomark Canaryâ„¢ device. If the Canary does not detect a significant
      decrease in breath delta value in those subjects who subsequently get an infection, it will
      not be feasible to use it for this purpose.

      Breath delta value will be collected to determine its relationship to infection, no health
      outcomes are being measured.

      This study is designed to determine if the BDV of adult ICU patients is an early indicator of
      the onset of infection that may lead to sepsis.

      The objectives of this study are: (1) to measure variation of BDV with time in adult ICU
      patients who agree to participate as research subjects; (2) to determine the magnitude of
      change of BDV in subjects who are subsequently diagnosed with severe infection and sepsis;
      (3) to define variation of BDV in adult trauma subjects who do not develop severe infection.
