      consisted of a 4-week screening period, during which participants' galactosidase (GLA)
      genotype was assessed for α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in response to migalastat.
      Participants were required to have α-Gal A activity responsive to migalastat. The study
      consisted of a 12-week treatment period, followed by an optional 36-week extension period.
      Participants received migalastat once every other day (QOD) for 12 weeks during the treatment
      period and the optional 36-week extension period for a total treatment duration of up to 48
      weeks. Participants were stratified by α-Gal A enzyme activity (high >40%, and low ≤40%) then
      randomly assigned to receive migalastat at 1 of 3 specified dose levels (50, 150, or 250
      milligrams [mg]).
