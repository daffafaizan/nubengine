      and pharmacokinetics of HT-2157 administered for 7-days in healthy normal volunteers

      Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending-dose evaluation
      of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of HT-2157 administered for 21-days in patients
      with major depressive disorder. The primary objective of Part 2 is to assess the CNS
      penetration of HT-2157 in cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, the potential activity of HT-2157
      in this patient population may be assessed using exploratory biologic and pharmacodynamic
      markers of potential efficacy
