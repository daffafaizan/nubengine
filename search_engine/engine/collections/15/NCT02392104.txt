    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of
      implementing an extended interval of INR follow-up in Veterans on a stable dose of warfarin
      in the Anticoagulation Clinic at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital.

      All participants will be provided usual care from the anticoagulation clinic, except for the
      interval between INRs. If the participant continues to be on a stable dose of warfarin and
      the INRs are within the goal range of 2-3 (including lab variation), follow-up visits will be
      scheduled following an extended interval protocol, from 5-6 weeks, to 7-8 weeks, to 11-12
      weeks and then continued with 11-12 week visits if INRs continue to remain in goal range and
      appropriate for the patient. Patient satisfaction will be evaluated at baseline, 6-, 12-, and
      24-months. Additionally provider satisfaction, confidence, and knowledge of the extended
      interval protocol will be analyzed. Bleeding and thromboembolic events will be evaluated to
      ensure the safety of an extended follow-up interval.
