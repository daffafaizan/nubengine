      dismal prognosis and unmet medical need. Additional therapeutic approaches are urgently
      needed. Blinatumomab is a bispecific single-chain antibody construct designed to link B cells
      and T cells resulting in T cell activation and a cytotoxic T cell response against CD19
      expressing cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of different doses of the bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab in adult
      patients with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. Patrticipants will receive up to five
      4-week cycles of intravenous blinatumomab treatment.
