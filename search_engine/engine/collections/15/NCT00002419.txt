      amprenavir for 24 weeks. During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline
      in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and lymphocyte subsets and for development of adverse events and
      toxicities. Patients who experience virologic failure are discontinued from the study. After
      Week 24, patients with documented virologic response are eligible to continue receiving the
      study treatment and to attend scheduled follow-up visits.
