    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose Phase 1/2a multicenter
      study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, viral shedding, immunogenicity, and
      genotypic and phenotypic stability of MEDI-560 in infants 1 to < 12 months of age. Three
      doses of MEDI-560 at a dosage level of 10^5 TCID50 were administered 0, 2, and 4 months after
      enrollment to a 30-participant cohort of 6 to < 12 month-old HPIV3 seronegative children
      randomized 2:1 to MEDI-560 vs placebo. A second 160-participant cohort of 1 to < 3 month-old
      infants not screened for baseline serostatus was planned but was not opened to enrollment for
      reasons other than safety. Participants were followed for safety through 180 days post last
      dose. Nasal wash specimens were collected at screening and Days 7, 12, and 28 following each
      dose and during unscheduled illness visits to assess vaccine virus shedding and genotypic and
      phenotypic stability of any shed vaccine virus. Blood was collected at screening to determine
      eligibility and prior to Dose 1 for baseline serostatus. Blood for assessment of antibodies
      to HPIV3 was collected approximately 7 to 12 days after Dose 1 and Dose 3 and 1 month after
      each dose for antibodies to PIV3.
