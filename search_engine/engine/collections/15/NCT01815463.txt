      high-risk for colorectal neoplasia and directly compare it to that of the FOBT and
      secondarily, identify the source of the Adnab-9 antigen to determine influences of diet and
      environment on its expression. The design is a prospective cross sectional (Part 1) and a
      case-control longitudinal follow-up study (Part 2) using a brief questionnaire to assess risk
      for cancer in a total of 2800 Part I patients will be enrolled designed to achieve a database
      of high risk individuals and measure fecal Adnab-9 levels before a clinically indicated
      colonoscopy is performed. The patients submit 4 FOBT cards in a routine manner by mail, 3 are
      used for the FOBT and stool is extracted from the last card for the Adnab-9 ELISA which is
      reported as OD/5ug protein/well. 100 Part 2 enrollees are then selected on the basis of
      positive fecal Adnab-9 test candidates matched with a like number of patients with negative
      stool results who have had their initial colonoscopy and who will have a 5-year follow-up
      colonoscopy. Detailed Adnab-9 testing (immunohistochemical Adnab-9 binding; blood biomarker
      estimations and Adnab-9 Western blotting) will be performed on various bodily fluids to
      perfect the method of testing and completion of the detailed questionnaire to check for
      reproducibility and interim lifestyle changes in these participants.
