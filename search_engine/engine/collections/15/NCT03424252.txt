      to 2 parts; the decision to proceed to the optional second part will be made following review
      of Part 1 data. Part 1 and optional Part 2 have randomized, 2 period crossover designs.
      Subjects will randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences in order to receive 2 single doses of
      FDL169 on separate occasions, one as a sublingual administration and one as an oral
      administration. There will be a minimum washout period of 10 days between FDL169
      administrations. The duration of each part is approximately 7 weeks from screening to follow
      up.
