    
      Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is a form of neurally-mediated reflex syncope, which is marked by a
      sudden fall in blood pressure with an associated fall in heart rate often resulting in
      syncope, head-up tilt (HUT) testing is commonly used to bring information about VVS using ECG
      and blood pressure monitoring with medical observation.

      We developed an algorithm, called Tilt Test Analyzer, to predict VVS during HUT based on the
      simultaneous analysis of heart rate (RR interval), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and an
      indicator of autonomic modulation represented by heart rate and blood pressure variability
      (HRV and BPV).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the VVS prediction algorithm in a
      prospective cohort of patients in the tilt laboratory The primary endpoint is the VVS
      prediction algorithm performance by means of measuring the sensitivity and specificity
      values.

      The study is designed to test if the prospective analysis of tilt-test patients can reproduce
      the results previously obtained in the published retrospective analysis on 1155 patients with
      a similar clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity.
