      strength in each of the four clinical stages of Sleep Apnea; and, by regression analysis, to
      explore the possibility of an inverse relationship between decreasing genioglossus strength
      and progression of the clinical stages of OSAS.

      1.3. To test the hypothesis that a "subpopulation of subject" exists within the clinical
      spectrum of OSAS, in whom decreasing strength of the genioglossus muscle may represent a
      common element in spite of differing possible pathophysiologic pathways leading to
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea in man. 1.4. The major hypothesis of this proposal is thus that
      "Genioglossal Strength is inversely correlated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Pathology."
