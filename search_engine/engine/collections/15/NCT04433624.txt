    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Erector Spinae Plane Block using
      bupivacaine versus bupivacaine/magnesium sulphate in Patients Undergoing Lumbar Spine surgery

      Inclusion criteria:

      orthopedic and neurological patients undergoing posterior lumbar spine fusion [American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 or 2.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        1. -Contraindications for regional blocks (eg. Patient refusal Infection at the injection
           site, coagulopathy)

        2. allergic reaction to drugs.

        3. Patients with a history of liver, renal, heart and vascular failure, cardiac conduction
           disturbance.

        4. opium addiction, any drug or substance abuse and chronic treatment with opium,
           non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers (CCB).

      The patients will be blinded to the study drugs and will be randomly assigned into two equal
      groups by opaque sealed envelope as follows:

      Group (B) (n=15): will receive The bilateral ESP blocks were performed by injecting 40 mL of
      0.25% bupivacaine (20 mL into each side) into the fascial plane between the deep surface of
      the erector spinae muscle and the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae

      Group B MG (n=15): will receive bilateral ESP blocks performed by each side) and and 500 mg
      magnesium sulphate into the fascial plane between the deep surface of the erector spinae
      muscle and the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae for pain management after lumbar
      spinal surgery injecting 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine(20 mL into each side)
