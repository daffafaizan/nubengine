      infection. Studies have shown that the dideoxynucleosides ddI and ddC may be effective
      antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals. However, ddI and ddC have
      yet to be compared on the basis of patient survival, drug tolerance, immunologic and
      virologic effectiveness, and the incidence of opportunistic infection or opportunistic
      malignancy. Results of this study will yield information regarding the relative therapeutic
      benefits and toxicities of each drug while providing alternative treatment to patients who
      are unable to tolerate or have had progression of disease while on AZT.

      After baseline screening, patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms (ddI or ddC).
      Subjects are evaluated biweekly for the first 4 weeks of study, at 2 months, and every other
      month thereafter. Three dose levels of ddI (based on patient's weight at study entry) are
      compared with two dose levels of ddC (also based on patient weight). Patients who reach a new
      progression-of-disease primary endpoint after at least 12 weeks of treatment or a drug
      intolerance endpoint have the option of switching over to the alternate study drug; however,
      participants are encouraged to remain on their original drug assignment whenever possible.
      For any switchover, patients must be off the originally assigned drug for at least 72 hours
      before switching. Only one switchover is allowed.
