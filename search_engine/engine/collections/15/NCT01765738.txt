      the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study will be discussed with those who do and informed
      consent will be obtained from those wishing to participate. The patient will then be
      randomized to one of two types of PICC lines. All lines will be placed by identical
      technique. This will include sterile technique, placement via a vein of the upper arm using
      ultrasound guidance, and positioning of the catheter tip under fluoroscopic guidance. A
      database of all catheters placed will be kept. Records will be reviewed at 1 week, 30 days,
      and 60 days by the Interventional Radiology Fellow.Review will include length of time
      catheter was in place, whether treatment was completed, whether catheter was removed
      prematurely, the clinical reason for removal, results of other imaging tests, and results of
      cultures on any catheters removed for suspicion of infection. Any non-infectious
      complications related to the catheter will also be noted. The reviewer will be blinded to
      which catheter was used during the procedure.
