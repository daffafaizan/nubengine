    
      This randomized, single dose, three-way crossover study will evaluate the bioequivalence of
      two formulations of colchicine, the test product (colchicine 0.6mg Mutual) and a marketed
      combination product (colchicine 0.5mg with probenecid 500mg), administered under fasting
      conditions. It will also determine the bioavailability of the test product following a
      standard high-fat meal and evaluate the safety and tolerability of the test product.
      Twenty-eight healthy, non-smoking, non-obese (BMI 81-30 kg/m2 and BW â‰¥110 lbs), 18-45 year
      old, male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive
      one of three dosing regimens in sequence with washout periods of at least 14 days between
      dosing periods. After a fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either, one tablet
      of colchicine 0.6 mg, one tablet of colchicine 0.6 mg after a standardized
      high-fat,high-calorie breakfast or 0.5mg/500mg colchicine/probenecid. All doses will be given
      with 240mL of room temperature water. Patients will be confined for at least 15 hours before
      and 24 hours after each dose with daily outpatient visits over the following 3 days. Blood
      will be drawn at times sufficient to adequately define the concentration time curves for each
      dosing regimen, which will be compared to assess the bioequivalence of the reference and test
      products and the effect of food on the test product. Subjects will also be monitored for
      adverse events throughout this same period.
