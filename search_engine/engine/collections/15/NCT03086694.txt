    
      Orthognathic surgery, one kind of oro-maxillofacial surgery, is a complicated surgery that
      undergoes several hours with nasotracheal intubation general anesthesia. Patients without
      premedication undergo orthognathic surgery with nasotracheal intubation general anesthesia.

      Patients without premedications Monitoring of patients with entropy for consciousness, ECG,
      with noninvasive BP and invasive blood pressure through redial artery, train-of-four monitor,
      target controlled infusion of propofol, infusion Tridil, and sevoflurane for mainly
      anesthesia maintenance. Ventilator setting as volume control (8-12ml/kg), frequency
      respiratory rate (8-12/min), I/E ratio: 1/2, positive end expiratory pressure: 4 mmHg,
      Fraction inspiratory O2: 60%.

      To maintain the MAP >60-55 mmHg, urine output 0.5-1ml/kg, and body core temperature > 36
      Celsius degree.

      Closely observation of patients postoperatively for adverse events or complications.
