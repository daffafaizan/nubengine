      specific mechanisms by which it is transmitted from one generation to the next. This
      prospective study will examine biological influences on transgenerational continuity and
      change, and how biology interacts with social factors in modulating the transmission of
      antisocial behavior. The study is unique in that it includes both mothers and fathers,
      focuses on early mechanisms, and addresses female as well as male antisocial behavior.

      This study is part of the continuing Mauritius Child Health Project. The project began by
      testing 1,795 children age 3 years old on psychophysiological, behavioral, nutritional, and
      cognitive measures. Both male and female children were tested. Their parents were also
      assessed for psychosocial influences. One hundred children then participated in a
      nutritional, exercise, and educational enrichment intervention from ages 3 to 5 years old.
      The intervention has been shown to increase physiological arousal and attention at age 11
      years and to reduce conduct disorder at age 17 years.

      These 3-year-old children are now 30-year-old adults. This study will retest these adults on
      psychophysiological, psychosocial, cognitive, behavioral, parenting, and antisocial behavior
      measures. Their previously untested spouses will also be assessed. Finally, many of these
      adults now have 3-year-old children of their own; these children will be evaluated as well.
      Measures of life stress, daily hassles, family conflict, mental illness, and criminal
      behavior will be assessed. Data from the enrichment cohort will be evaluated to determine if
      the intervention disrupted the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior from the
      second to third generations.
