      candidates. The surgeon of note will be consulted to ensure that each patient, in their
      opinion, may be a candidate. If approved by the surgeon of note, the patient will then be
      approached in the preoperative area by a member of the research team to determine if they
      will consent to enrollment in the study.

      Patients will be double blinded and randomized following low to moderate pain surgery
      (surgery in which patients do not generally require a patient controlled analgesic pump
      post-operatively, or require post operative analgesia beyond 14 days) to receive either
      tramacet 1-2 tablets orally every 4 hours prn or percocet 1-2 tablets orally every 4 prn. At
      time of discharge patients will recieve unidentifiable tablets in an unidentifying container
      of the usual dispense amount that their surgeon would standardly prescribe(range is usually
      between 30 and 60 tabs).

      At 6 weeks patients will receive a phone call to determine a) brief pain inventory score for
      the month. B) if they sought a second opioid prescription. C) if they plan to seek a second
      script. E) satisfaction of post operative pain control on a 1-10 numerical scale f) any
      adverse side effects.
