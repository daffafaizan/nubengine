    
      Primary Endpoint:

      â€¢ To evaluate the differences in QOL in the urinary domain between patients treated with
      Low-Dose Rate Brachytherapy (LDRB) and High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy (HDRB) at 3 months.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  To compare LDRB vs. HDR as related to the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite
           (EPIC) score in the bowel and sexual domain at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

        -  To evaluate differences in urinary function using the IPSS which, will be filled in by
           the patient at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the procedure.

        -  To report acute and long-term urinary, sexual and gastro-intestinal toxicity using the
           Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 at each patient's
           visit.

        -  To report the dose to the bladder neck defined as 5 mm around the Foley catheter from
           the bottom of the Foley balloon to the prostatic urethra with a volume of at least 2 cc.

        -  To assess local control by performing prostate rebiopsy after radiotherapy at 36 months
           to assess treatment outcome.

        -  The absolute Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA) nadir value will be reported as a
           secondary objective by PSA measurements every 6 months after the procedure.
