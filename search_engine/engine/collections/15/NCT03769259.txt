      the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and has remained high despite a relative decline during 2014.
      Previous research conducted with active duty Army personnel supports the superiority of BCBT
      and its components over treatment as usual for the reduction of suicide attempts. Additional
      research is needed to determine if these effects are generalizable to the U.S. Marine Corps
      and to confirm hypothesized mechanisms of action. Reference to "active duty" refers to U.S.
      military service members that have been activated and deployed as a part of Operation Iraqi
      Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) in accordance with federal orders under Title 10
      or 32, United States Code.

      Specific Aim 1:To replicate previous findings supporting the efficacy of BCBT for the
      prevention of suicide attempts among active duty Marines (regardless of Axis I or II
      diagnosis). The standard null hypothesis will involve tests conducted comparing improvement
      following BCBT to Present-Centered Therapy (PCT)

      Specific Aim 2: To identify cognitive-affective mediators of BCBT's effects on risk for
      suicide attempt.
