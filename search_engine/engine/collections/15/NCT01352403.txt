      failure, atrial fibrillation and death from cardiovascular causes. Obese patients commonly
      have left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement.

      Conservative weight loss therapy is not effective in most patients with morbid
      obesity.Bariatric surgery is the only way to decrease weight effectively and permanently.
      Only few data are published concerning cardiac effects of bariatric surgery.

      We randomize patients with morbid obesity for either gastric bypass or intensive life style
      intervention over 18 months and investigate the effects on cardiac function, weight and
      quality of life.
