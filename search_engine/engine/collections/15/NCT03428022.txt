    
      Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had treated with Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors（EGFR-TKI） and progressed slowly because of
      resistance are underwent with apatinib mesylate and continuous EGFR-TKI. The primary
      objective is the disease progression free survival of the patients. The secondary goals are
      overall survival, duration of response, objective response rates, disease control rates,
      quality of life scores and drug safety. Currently such patients are treated with EGFR-TKI
      continuously, but 3 months later, the disease will be progressed rapidly. This study will
      bring a new treatment that are more effective, less toxic and more convenient for
      NSCLC-patients with EGFR-TKI resistance.
