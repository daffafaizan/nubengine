      malaria control programme. However, malaria treatment has been facing huge challenges in
      recent years. A number of affordable antimalarial drugs have been used to cure malaria since
      the 1940s: these include chloroquine (CQ), sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; Fansidar®),
      mefloquine (MQ), amodiaquine (AQ) and quinine. The emergence and spread of resistance to
      these commonly-used drugs has been largely responsible for the worsening of the malaria
      situation observed in the past decades.

      Across the African continent, guidelines have recently been changed. The World Health
      Organization (WHO) recommends for falciparum malaria the use of combination therapies,
      preferably those containing artemisinin derivatives (ACT, artemisinin-based combination
      therapy). Artemisinin derivatives, e.g. artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin, being
      extremely potent antimalarial agents are the ideal partners in combinations with other
      antimalarials. ACTs have three demonstrable advantages over conventional therapy, they i) are
      efficacious in clearing asexual parasites, ii) substantially reduce post-treatment gametocyte
      carriage and iii) "protect" the partner drug from selecting resistant parasites.

      In Kenya, both CQ and SP have lost clinical efficacy. CQ was replaced by SP in 1998 and in
      the year 2006, SP was effectively replaced by Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL: Coartem®). The
      policy change to the artemisinin-based drug AL is in line with the WHO recommendations to
      shift to ACT as first line antimalarial treatment.The most efficacious ACT, however, needs
      local comparisons in terms of treatment efficacy and transmission-reducing activity.
