      be delayed by the time requirements of traditional culture techniques. This study will enroll
      lung transplant donor candidates and recipients undergoing assessment for lower respiratory
      tract infection by bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (or washing). The investigators will record
      bronchoscopy time and time to test result and clinical management decision based on
      traditional culture methods. The investigators will perform a semi-quantitative multiplex
      molecular assay for lower respiratory tract infection using the BioFire Pneumonia Panel and
      these results will be evaluated by clinicians not directly involved in patient care. Timing
      and outcome of clinical decision making will be recorded. The investigators will compare the
      time to result using a paired Student's t-test between traditional and molecular methods.
      Secondary endpoints include time to clinical decision, postulated changes in clinical
      decisions, and agreement between methods.
