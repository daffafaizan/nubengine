      myalgias, myositis, scleroderma-like skin fibrosis and fasciitis, occurred in 1989 in over
      1500 patients who had ingested L-tryptophan for sleep disturbances and depression. The
      identical clinical syndrome has also occurred in subjects ingesting L-5-hydroxytryptophan
      (L-5-HTP).

      Recently, a letter to Nature Medicine reported the presence of an impurity in 6 out of 6
      samples of L-5-HTP obtained randomly at health food stores. This impurity appears to be the
      same as the one identified in material ingested by a family (mother and 2 babies) who had
      developed an EMS-like syndrome after ingesting L-5-HTP.

      Although there have been no definite new cases of L-5-HTP-related EMS, the FDA is currently
      investigating unconfirmed reports of possible new cases.
