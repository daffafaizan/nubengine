      little over the past 40 years. Response to current therapy for GVHD is far from perfect; only
      about 50% of patients respond to therapy and many of those responses are not durable.

      The current study is a phase I study dose de-escalation study where up to 6 patients will be
      enrolled into each dose level (2 levels), followed by an expansion cohort at the MTD. The
      goal of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of itacitinib
      and tocilizumab. Once the MTD is determined, the investigator will enroll 10 additional
      patients as an expansion cohort to further define the safety profile of the combination and
      estimate its response rate.
