      presents with a triad of clinical findings: sensory abnormalities, perfusion abnormalities
      and alterations in motor function. Since some of these findings are seen in the other disease
      states, the diagnosis is often not clear. A response to a sympathetic ganglion block
      (stellate or lumbar) is also suggestive of the disorder. However, there is no definitive
      diagnostic test for CRPS. Experience has shown that early aggressive treatment improves the
      prognosis. Therefore, tests that facilitate the early diagnosis would have important clinical
      implications.

      Advances in laboratory techniques allow analysis of clinical samples to identify protein or
      patterns of protein changes associated with a disease state. Patients suffering with CRPS who
      are currently seen in a pain clinic will be asked to participate in this study. The subjects
      will complete a brief symptom survey, be examined by a co-investigator to document sensory,
      temperature and trophic changes, and have a blood sample collected for protein and gene
      expression (RNA) analysis. Blood samples from age-matched controls will be collected from
      non-CRPS patients. Fifty patient samples collected from each group will be analyzed and used
      to teach the diagnostic software and an additional 20 samples (10 controls, 10 CRPS patients)
      will be used to validate diagnostic accuracy.
