      its mobilization effects when given with G-CSF for stem cell mobilization in multiple myeloma
      patients. We hypothesize that bortezomib, in addition to increasing the number of mobilized
      stem cells, will optimize final apheresis product by decreasing myeloma cell contamination.
      Therefore, all multiple myeloma patients rather than multiple myeloma patients with G-CSF
      mobilization failure will be the target of this study.
