    
      This is a Phase IIb/III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-Week, Repeat, Oral
      Dose Ranging, study to determine the safety and efficacy of plecanatide in patients with
      chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Subjects diagnosed with CIC via modified Rome III
      criteria will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study and
      enter a 2 Week pre treatment screening. During this phase patients will be required to call
      in their bowel movements (BM diary) as they occur, and call at least once daily to complete a
      patient diary of questions on their symptoms (Symptom Diary) associated with CC, as they will
      throughout the trial. Patients who complete at least 5 days of dosing per week, 6 of each 7
      day period of BM diary calls, and continue to have less than 3 complete spontaneous movements
      per week (as well as meeting other inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be enrolled and
      randomized to one of three plecanatide doses 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, and 3.0 mg or placebo. 880
      patients will be randomized with the intent of having 200 patients per treatment group (each
      group the same size) included in efficacy analyses. All subjects receiving at least one dose
      of plecanatide or matching placebo will be included in the safety analyses.
