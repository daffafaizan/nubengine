      antitumor activity in a variety of solid tumors, including prostate, soft tissue sarcomas ,
      ovarian, endometrial, kidney, and breast cancer. They also exert an antiangiogenic effect and
      are almost devoid of bone marrow toxicity as single agents which makes them suitable for
      combination with cytotoxic drugs.

      Anthracyclines are among the most used and effective cytotoxic agents, and in solid tumors
      their indications include, among others, breast, ovary, endometrial, prostate cancer.
      Liposomal Doxorubicin (CaelyxTM) could be an adequate replacement of doxorubicin to avoid
      potential side effects such as cardiotoxicity, alopecia, GI toxicity.

      Testing a combination regimen including mTOR inhibitors and anthracyclines in those tumors
      which are known to be sensitive to both compounds is of high clinical interest and
      worthwhile.
