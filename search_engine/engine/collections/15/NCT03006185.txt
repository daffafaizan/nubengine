    
      For each study participant, two test areas (A and B) are demarcated in the same anatomical
      region, with each area containing no less than 5 actinic keratoses (AKs). Test areas are
      randomized to receive skin pretreatment of EITHER ablative fractional laser OR
      microdermabrasion prior to photodynamic therapy using methyl aminolevulinate.

      Efficacy, local skin reactions and safety of both test areas are evaluated over a 12-15 week
      follow up period.
