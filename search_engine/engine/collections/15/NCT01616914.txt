      has been associated with longer length of stay in ICU and hospital, longer duration of
      mechanical ventilation and higher mortality rate. however, its subclinical form has not been
      investigated. The subclinical syndrome is defined by CAM-ICU, in which several features of
      delirium are fulfilled but the diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled. The investigators aimed
      to establish the association of subclinical delirium with outcome.
