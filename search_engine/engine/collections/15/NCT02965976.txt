      I. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin type A (botulinum toxin) injection (Botox)
      during a minimally invasive esophagectomy decreases postoperative occurrence of delayed
      gastric emptying.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive
      esophagectomy reduces the number of repeat procedures for delayed gastric emptying within 90
      days.

      II. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive
      esophagectomy decreases time to oral intake meeting 100% of nutritional requirements.

      III. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive
      esophagectomy reduces the incidence of pulmonary complications directly related to delayed
      gastric emptying.

      IV. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive
      esophagectomy reduces hospital length of stay related to delayed gastric emptying.

      V. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive
      esophagectomy increases patient quality of life.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive botulinum toxin type A injection intramuscularly (IM) while
      undergoing standard minimally invasive esophagectomy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard minimally invasive esophagectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 3-4, and 6-8 weeks, and
      at 90 days.
