    
      'Enjoy Your Bump (EYB)' is an online life skills course based on Cognitive Behavioural
      Therapy (CBT) principles which has been designed to specifically support women in the
      antenatal period. A survey of women and health professionals has demonstrated that this is a
      resource that both groups find acceptable. The aim of this quasi-experimental feasibility
      study is to evaluate the user experience and efficacy of this online programme as a
      non-pharmacological, low intensity intervention for women experiencing mild-moderate
      depressive symptoms in pregnancy. This will be achieved by measuring depression and anxiety
      as well as measures of attachment to the developing baby, pre and post intervention. It is
      hoped the results from this study will help inform whether this is a resource that should be
      made more widely available to women in the National Health Service (NHS). It is hypothesised
      that the 'Enjoy Your Bump' will be an acceptable and effective intervention for women
      experiencing mild to moderate depressive symptoms in the antenatal period.
