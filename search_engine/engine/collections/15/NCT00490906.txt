      will be split into two groups: a Copaxone group and an Interferon (Avonex, Rebif, or
      Betaseron) group. Each group will be composed of 30 women matched for menopausal status. Each
      subject will be given a questionnaire assessing risk factors for low bone density. All
      patients will have a determination of an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), height and
      weight, medical history, and fracture history. All patients will undergo hip and spine dual
      x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and will have labs drawn to determine serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D,
      parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, estradiol, bone-specific acetyl phosphatase,
      osteocalcin, and C-peptides.
