      by providing rapid anti-HCV testing for people who inject drugs (PWID) at HRS. However,
      access to HCV confirmatory viremia testing remains limited as PWID must be referred to
      treatment centers for testing.

      Two novel approaches to improve access to HCV viremia testing will be evaluated.

      In the first approach, participants with a positive anti-HCV test will have blood drawn and
      HCV RNA test performed at the HRS. Test results will be provided the same day (or the
      following day if the participant is unable to wait for results) at the HRS.

      In the second approach participants with a positive anti-HCV test will have blood drawn at
      the HRS. The blood will be processed on site and a plasma sample shipped to a central
      laboratory for viremia testing. Test results will be communicated to the participants by HRS
      staff at a follow-up visit as soon as the results are available.

      In both groups, participants who test positive will be referred to a treatment centre for
      further assessments and subsequent treatment initiation.
