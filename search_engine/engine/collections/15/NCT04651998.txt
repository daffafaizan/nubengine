      are brought to this study. Global cognitive function and evoked cerebral blood oxygenation
      are evaluated before and after stent, followed up at 6 months later. Mini-Mental State
      Examination(MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are used for the global cognitive
      test. Evoked cerebral blood oxygenation is evaluated using functional near-infrared
      spectroscopy(fNIRS) through performing mental task( N-back task, Go/no go task, and verbal
      fluency task ). All the patients from different centers are conducted the test at the only
      main center by one doctor. The parameter of fNIRS and score of cognitive test of each patient
      are compared before and after stent.
