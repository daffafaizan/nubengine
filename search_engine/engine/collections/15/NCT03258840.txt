      supplementation on serum activities of Paraoxonase-1 and Homocystein thiolactonase and
      several indicators of vascular inflammation and the gene expression of PON2 in the peripheral
      blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) in the patients with type II diabetes mellitus. In this
      randomized, double-blind clinical trial, placebo-controlled, single-center, 36 men and women
      aged 35-50 years with type 2 diabetes are enrolled in the study from the Iranian Diabetes
      Association. After signing informed consent, all individuals complete a general information
      form. a 24-hour food recall for 3 days will be taken from the participants at the beginning
      and the end of the study,. Selected samples are randomly classified into 2 blocks of groups
      receiving supplement and placebo. Two groups will be classified (blocked) based on sex. The
      supplement group, will receive 2 g/day EPA for 8 weeks and the placebo group will also
      receive placebo (containing 2 g of edible paraffin) (similar in terms of color, shape and
      size). Patients are recommended to sustain their diets and medication dose (s) during the
      study and also advised to maintain a constant level of physical activity. Blood samples will
      be collected after 8-12 hours fasting and anthropocentric variables, biochemical parameters,
      target gene expression and physical activity before and after the trial will be measured.
