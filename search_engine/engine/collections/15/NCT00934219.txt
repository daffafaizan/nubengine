      fatty acids stimulate blood circulation, increases the breakdown of fibrin, and additionally
      has been shown to reduce blood pressure, cardiac events and mortality from congestive heart
      failure. There is strong scientific evidence that omega 3 fatty acids significantly reduce
      blood triglyceride levels while elevating high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels.
      Fasting and non fasting hypertriglyceridemia have been associated with atherosclerosis, and
      coronary heart disease events, even in the absence of hypercholesterolemia. Severe
      hypertriglyceridemia (>2000 mg/dl) can also lead to acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

      Currently, patients having very High TG are treated with Fibric acids (gemfibrozil, Tricor,
      Antara), and if hyperinsulinemic, with Glucophage. Lovaza (4g/day) has been shown to be
      effective and safe in lowering TG levels. There is no published data which indicates that
      Lovaza 8 or 12 g per day would have therapeutic effectiveness in further normalizing
      triglycerides in subjects on maximized triglyceride lowering and Lovaza 4 g per day. We
      hypothesize, based on our clinical experience that increasing Lovaza to 8 and then (if
      necessary) to 12 g/day would safely optimize triglycerides in subjects with primary
      hypertriglyceridemia who failed to normalize their triglycerides on optimal therapy including
      Lovaza 4 g/day.
