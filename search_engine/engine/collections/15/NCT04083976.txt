      activity in participants with metastatic urothelial cancer and cholangiocarcinoma identified
      to have alterations in the FGFR pathway. This study targets the underlying altered biology of
      FGFR-driven tumors irrespective of solid tumor histology subtype. The study consists of
      screening phase, treatment phase and the post treatment follow-up phase (from the end of
      treatment visit until the participants has died, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up, or
      the end of study, whichever comes first). End of study is defined as 4 years from enrollment
      of last participant into study or last follow-up visit of last patient, whichever occurs
      first.
