      (TXT) in patients with recurrent or refractory disseminated germ cell cancer previously
      treated with standard-dose chemotherapy. II. Assess the probability of actual response
      warranting further evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness of TXT in the case that
      partial or complete tumor responses are achieved in this patient population. III.
      Characterize further the toxic effects of TXT in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive intravenous docetaxel over 1 hour every 3 weeks until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or at least 3 courses beyond documentation of complete
      response. Patients may receive concurrent radiotherapy provided not all indicator lesions are
      included in irradiated field. Resection of residual mature teratoma is allowed no sooner than
      8 weeks after therapy provided tumor markers are normalized for at least 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
