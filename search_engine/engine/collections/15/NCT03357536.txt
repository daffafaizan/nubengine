      monocytogenes (Lm), responsible for severe invasive infections. It occurs in the great
      majority of cases in elderly patients and / or patients with comorbidities, with a deficit of
      innate or cellular immunity. Pregnancy is also a risk factor.

      The Multicentric Observational NAtional Analysis of Listeriosis and Listeria (MONALISA) is an
      ongoing national case-control prospective study on listeriosis implemented since 2009 to
      study risk and prognosis factors for listeriosis. In this cohort, which enrolled 902 patients
      on 1 August 2014, 7% of patients with neurolisteriosis are under 40 years of age and have no
      identified risk factor. Genetic susceptibility is suspected in these patients. Genetic
      susceptibility could also explain the inconstant development of a neurolisteriosis or fetal
      infection, as well as the particular severity of some infections (death, foetal loss,
      neurological sequelae).

      The analysis of the genetically transmitted vulnerability of Lm has not yet been studied,
      because of the lack of accessibility to prospective cohorts (and their DNA) for this rare and
      severe infection.

      The aim of the study is to identify genetic susceptibility to Listeriosis that will optimize
      the patient care in terms of treatment and prevention.
