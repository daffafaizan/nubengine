      the trial was designed to determine the Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) and MTD of Ispinesib
      (SB-715992) monotherapy when administered as a one-hour infusion on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day
      cycle in female patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The Phase II
      regimen was intended to evaluate the MTD determined in Phase I in chemotherapy-na√Øve female
      patients with measurable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Phase II was intended
      to assess the overall response rate (ORR) derived from individual patient assessments of
      complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease
      (PD) based on RECIST, as determined by independent review.
