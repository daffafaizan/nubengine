      conditions such as diabetes, but also linked to altered gait, impaired balance and a greater
      likelihood of falls. Weight reduction has been shown to improve balance controle. Methods to
      increase physical activity are largely not accepted in this population and those which
      conserve the musculoskeletal system are rare. Physical activity has been shown to influence
      mood, quality of life and eating behavior. Mini-trampoline training has been shown to enhance
      stability and increase fitness.
