      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or gastric cardia adenocarcinoma from the Oct.2015. The
      patients will be divided into two groups. Group 1: Following intravenous administration of
      photofrin at dose of 2 mg/kg.b.w. as the photosensitizer, 630 nm laser irradiation (DIOMED)
      with 400 mW/cm was applied on each part of tumor for 750 seconds through cylinder diffusing
      quartz fibers localizing in the biopsy channel of a flexible endoscope at 24th. Group 2:
      Following intravenous administration of photofrin at dose of 2 mg/kg.b.w. as the
      photosensitizer, 630 nm laser irradiation (DIOMED) with 400 mW/cm was applied on each part of
      tumor for 750 seconds through cylinder diffusing quartz fibers localizing in the biopsy
      channel of a flexible endoscope at 48th.
