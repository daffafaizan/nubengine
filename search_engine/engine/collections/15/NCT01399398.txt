      receptors in the brain (Matsuda et al 1990). It is found on glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and
      gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synaptic terminals and mediates the effects of
      endocannabinoids (ECs), which suppresses the release of neurotransmitters. The CB(1) receptor
      is a target for drug therapy, including the use of a CB(1) receptor antagonist as an appetite
      suppressant. Our laboratory recently developed a promising positron emission tomography (PET)
      ligand for the CB(1) receptor: [(11)C]SD5024 (Donohue et al 2008a).

      Previous studies from our laboratory used two PET ligands to image CB(1) receptors
      (11)C-MePPEP and (18)F-FMPEP-d(2) (Yasuno et al 2008; Donohue et al 2008b) and found that the
      latter provides more accurate and precise measurement. We also found that clearance of
      (11)C-MePPEP from brain was too slow for (11)C-labeling (Terry et al 2010). Although we are
      currently using [(18)F]FMPEP-d(2) , the major disadvantage of the current radioligand is that
      it washes out slowly from the brain, and accurate quantitation requires relatively fast
      washout. If [(11)C]SD5024 is amenable to quantitation in human subjects, then it may prove to
      be a useful ligand for studying potential pathophysiological changes of this receptor.

      The purpose of this protocol is (1) to perform brain imaging using [(11)C]SD5024 in healthy
      volunteers to characterize brain uptake and distribution; (2) to perform whole body PET
      studies in healthy volunteers in order to estimate radiation absorbed doses for
      [(11)C]SD5024; and (3) to perform brain test-retest studies in healthy volunteers to further
      examine how precise measurements of receptor binding are, and to determine optimal parameters
      for future experiments using [(11)C]SD5024.

      Successful development of a PET radioligand to image CB1 receptors has the potential to
      significantly impact our understanding and clinical management of neuropsychiatric (eg,
      schizophrenia) (Eggan et al 2008) and metabolic (eg, obesity) (Gazzerro et al 2007)
      disorders. Future experiments would include studies of relevant neuropsychiatric disorders.
