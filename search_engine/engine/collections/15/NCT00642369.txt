    
      1. The objective sleep structures of quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as
           mono-therapy respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are
           measured by the change of composite variables for PSG test (sleep stages, time in bed,
           total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency) from baseline to Week 4 (LOCF).

        2. The subjective sleep qualities of quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as
           mono-therapy respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are
           measured by the change of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) and Epworth
           Sleepiness Scale(ESS) from baseline to Week 4 (LOCF).

        3. The clinical efficacy of quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as mono-therapy
           respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are measured by the
           change of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Globe Impression
           (CGI),and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) from baseline to Week 4
           (LOCF).

        4. The clinical safety and tolerance quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as
           mono-therapy respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are
           measured by Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) in day 14 and day 28.
