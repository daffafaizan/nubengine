      in breath.

      In patients with suspected Influenza infection, nasal air samples will be taken and analyzed
      by Multicapillary Ion mobility spectrometry (MCC IMS). Routinely all patients undergo
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs for Influenza.

      MCC IMS spectra will be compared between infected and non infected patients by cluster
      analysis and discrimination analysis.

      If the number of infected patients exceeds 50 an additional validation cohort will be
      investigated sequentially otherwise validation will be performed during the Influenza
      epidemic 2021.

      Due to decreasing numbers of Influenza-A- Infections study was opened to also include
      patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections.
