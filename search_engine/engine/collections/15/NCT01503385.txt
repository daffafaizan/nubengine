      celecoxib has antitumor activity, and may increase the tumor sensitivity to radiation.
      Furthermore, evidence has shown the safety and efficiency of celecoxib in some phase I/II
      studies. The purposes of this study are to examine the effects of a new combination of
      celecoxib (CelebrexÂ®) and cisplatin/etoposide (EP regimen), with concurrent thoracic
      radiotherapy on unresectable stage III NSCLC patients; and to examine biomarkers to predict
      response to the treatment. Because of poor survival of patients with unresected locally
      advanced NSCLC, the efficiency of celecoxib plus concurrent EP chemoradiotherapy need to be
      further investigated.
