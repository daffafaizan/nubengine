      patients, 30-59 years old, with diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome according with modified
      International Diabetes Federation criteria. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      Amla (500mg) or homologated placebo orally twice daily, for 90 days. Before and after the
      intervention, the components of Metabolic Syndrome will be evaluated, waist circumference,
      blood pressure, levels of fasting glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol high density
      lipoprotein (C-HDL), total insulin secretion (Insulinogenic index), first phase of insulin
      secretion (Stumvoll index) and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index).
