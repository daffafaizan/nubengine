      58 patients with treatment naive exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who receive
      intravitreal ranibizumab injection. A mean volume of 0.1 ml of aqueous humor samples will be
      taken each time an intravitreal injection is indicated and performed. Cytokeratin 8 level in
      aqueous humor will be evaluated, and associations of baseline cytokeratin 8 level and visual
      (the best corrected visual acuity change) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography
      parameters) after Ranibizumab injection will be investigated.
