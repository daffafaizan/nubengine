    
      Children aged 2 - 18 years presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with a moderate or
      severe asthma exacerbation (Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) of > 3) who fail
      to improve clinically with standard ED management with inhaled salbutamol and ipratropium
      will be randomized to receive either standard asthma management according to our local severe
      asthma guideline or management with BiPAP in addition to standard care. Both groups will
      receive a comparable dose of systemic steroid and hourly salbutamol inhalers with subsequent
      weaning according to PRAM score. Patients randomized to receive BiPAP will be admitted to the
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and those randomized to the control group will be
      admitted to the medical ward. Both groups will be monitored with 3-hourly PRAM scoring
      through the duration of their admission.
