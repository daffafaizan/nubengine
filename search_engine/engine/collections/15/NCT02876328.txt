    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two Ebola virus
      disease (EVD) vaccines, Ad26.ZEBOV (rHAd26) and rVSVÎ”G-ZEBOV-GP (rVSV), in children and
      adults. These vaccines will be studied using three different strategies: the rHAd26 vaccine
      plus a MVA-BN-Filo (MVA) boost, and the rVSV vaccine with or without boosting.

      Participants will be randomized into five groups: the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine with an MVA boost,
      the rVSV vaccine with or without boosting, or one of two placebo groups. At Day 0 (study
      entry), participants will receive the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine, the rVSV vaccine, or placebo.

      At Day 56, participants assigned to the rVSV vaccine without a boost and the two placebo
      groups will receive placebo. Those initially given the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine will receive the
      MVA boost. Those assigned to the boosted rVSV group will receive the rVSV boost.

      Additional study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, and 63, and at Months 3, 6, 12, 24, 36,
      48, and 60. Study visits may include blood collection and other assessments.

      Some participants may take part in substudies, which will include blood or saliva collection.
