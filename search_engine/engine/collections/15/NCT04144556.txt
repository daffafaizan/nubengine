      the focus of stroke rehabilitation, in particular, the work of physiotherapists, is focused
      on recovery of physical independence and functional ability during activities of daily
      living. Physiotherapy based on conventional therapy has been shown to produce good results in
      recovery progress after stroke. However, patients tend to find the movements involved in this
      treatment as difficult and monotonous over time. Virtual rehabilitation is a novel
      therapeutic intervention based on simulation exercises using virtual reality technology.

      Objective. The main objective of the present study was to assess whether a virtual
      rehabilitation program added to a conventional physical therapy intervention results in
      greater improvements in functional capability, gait, balance and daily activities compared to
      conventional physical therapy intervention on its own.

      Material and Methods Sample: men and women aged 18 to 80 years having had a first simple
      stroke Study design. Randomized clinical trial with 2 groups: Group 1. 1) Nintendo Wii and
      conventional physical therapy 2) control group which will have conventional physical therapy
      applied.

      Evaluations. Clinical interview with anthropometric data. There will be 2 evaluations: at the
      beginning of the study and at the end of the intervention (at 4 weeks).

      In addition, it includes the following evaluation instruments:

        -  Functional capability: Timed up and go test (TUG)

        -  Gait and balance performance: Tinetti performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA)
           and Berg balance scale (BBS)

        -  Motor impairment: Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA)

        -  Daily living activities: Barthel Index.

        -  Complex activities: Frenchay activity index (FAI)
