    
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of escalating multiple doses of ToleroMune Grass in subjects with
      a documented history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis on exposure to grass. The efficacy of
      ToleroMune HDM will also be explored LPSR, EPSR, CPT and levels of grass specific IgE.

      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a
      maximum of 6 weeks before randomisation.

      Period 2 (Treatment Period) will consist of 4 visits (Visits 3A-3D) four weeks apart. The
      first cohort will receive the lowest dose and successive dose groups will increasing doses of
      ToleroMune Grass, provided the first administration of the previous dose was safe and well
      tolerated.

      In Period 3, 2 Post-treatment Challenge visits will take place, the first will be 2 weeks
      after the last administration in the Treatment Period and the second will be 17 weeks after
      the first administration. Follow-up will be conducted 3-10 days after the second PTC.
