      the Heart Institute of Hospital das Clínicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo
      (InCor - HC - FMUSP). The study will be divided into two phases. The first phase ("pilot")
      will test the concept, feasibility and safety of using a "zero contrast" strategy to carry
      out the planning and procedure of TAVI through transfemoral access with the self-expanding
      bioprosthesis Evolut R / Pro in 25 consecutive patients with CKD. The second phase ("zero
      contrast") will include 50 patients with CKD who will be submitted to transfemoral TAVI with
      the Evolut R / Pro bioprosthesis using the "zero contrast" approach, seeking to evaluate the
      results of the procedure and the incidence of AKI with the new strategy.
