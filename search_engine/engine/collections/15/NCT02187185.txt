    
      Randomized controlled trial to determine clinical and inflammatory benefits of Sonicare
      Flexcare tooth brushing following experimental induction of biofilm overgrowth in various
      periodontal conditions.

      This research study has both a Diagnostic Aim and a Treatment Aim. Aim #1 is to examine the
      utility of candidate inflammatory biomarkers within saliva to discriminate between health,
      gingivitis, mild, moderate and severe periodontis; and to discriminate between active versus
      inactive states of periodontal disease to see if these basal levels can predict the clinical
      response to biofilm overgrowth among various periodontal conditions; Aim #2 is to extend the
      claim of the anti-inflammatory and anti-infective efficacy of the Sonicare/Elite-Flexcare as
      compared to manual brushing to include 4 levels of periodontal disease [BGI-G, P1, P2 and
      P3].

      The devices used in this study are subject only to Class I (general controls) and considered
      exempt from the premarket notification procedures and not subject to section 510(k), 515, or
      520(m,) of the FDC Act in order to be legally marketed. Thus, the study does not meet the
      definition of an Applicable Clinical Trial.
