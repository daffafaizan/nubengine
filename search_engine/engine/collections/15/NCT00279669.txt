    
      Retinopathy of prematurity requires the early detection of retinopathy in neonates with a
      gestational age of < 28 weeks and a birth weight <1500 g. These evaluations require pupillary
      dilation, diagnostic expertise, consume much time and expense and are not without morbidity.

      B-scan ultrasonography using a hand-held probe is part of the current ophthalmologist's
      armamentarium, providing a non-invasive view of the eye and avoiding the morbidity associated
      with mydriatic drops used for pupillary dilation.

      We will use a simple water bath enclosure for a standard 20 MHz probe currently in general
      ophthalmic use to determine whether this simple technique might supplant indirect
      ophthalmoscopy as a screening technique. We will compare, using masked observers, the
      clinical findings of indirect ophthalmoscopy of neonatal infants with ultrasonic findings to
      determine if a correlation in the stages of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) between the two
      techniques existed.
