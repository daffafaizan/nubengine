      electrocardiogram (ECG), either spontaneously or after administration of a sodium channel
      blocker. For pathofysiological understanding, the investigators will analyse echocardiography
      images before and during the administration of Ajmaline. Comparing echocardiographies before
      and during negative Ajmaline test, will allow the investigators to indentify the effect of
      Ajmaline administration on cardiac function. The comparison between images of negative and
      positive Ajmaline tests will expose differences related to the occurence of a type 1 ECG.
