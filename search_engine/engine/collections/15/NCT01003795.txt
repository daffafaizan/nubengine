      bare-metal stents (BMS) and recently with the drug-eluting stents (DES). The everolimus
      eluting stents have shown very promising results in randomized clinical trials, demonstrating
      a reduction of clinical and angiographic restenosis in comparison to BMS, and comparable
      clinically-driven target lesion revascularization rates in comparison with sirolimus-eluting
      stents. While registry data is available from outside of the United States, it will be
      important to collect "real-world" data regarding the stent usage and outcomes in the United
      States. In this study we propose to follow patients who received at least one PromusÂ® Stent
      for at least 1 year post initial stent implantation.
