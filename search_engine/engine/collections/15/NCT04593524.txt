      tuberculosis. This study aims to find out the effect of vitamin D 1000 IU and A 6000 IU
      supplementation on Tuberculosis patients with vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism, who live
      in North Sumatera, Indonesia. This study is a randomized control clinical trial, with 48
      tuberculosis patients with vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism which are TaqI and FokI
      participating, divided into two groups, each with 24 participants, which are treatment group
      (I) which receives nutritional counseling, vitamin D 1000 IU, vitamin A 6000 IU, and control
      group (C) which only receives nutritional counseling for 28 days. Patients who participated
      was found to be heterozygous with TaqI (T>C) or FokI (C>T) genotype variants. The result of
      this study showed that at the start, serum 25(OH)D levels in group I were lower compared to
      group C (19.746.59 ng/mL vs 25.21±7.57 ng/mL). Group I showed significant correlation between
      vitamin D level categories with sputum conversion (mean: standard deviation= 2.25±0.68
      weeks). Supplementation of vitamin D 1000 IU provides an accelerated sputum conversion in
      tuberculosis patients with vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism.
