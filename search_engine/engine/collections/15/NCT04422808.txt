    
      The design for this study will be an international, prospective, observational, point
      prevalence trial. The investigators plan to recruit multiple sites to participate in the
      study through the use of professional organization list serves as well as direct outreach to
      colleagues and associates of members of the investigator team. Data collection will be
      performed by site investigators on one single day for all patients currently in the ICU who
      meet inclusion criteria on the data collection day. Site investigators will have an
      approximately three-month time frame in which to choose a data collection date. All data
      collection will be performed using REDcap, a secure web-based data collection tool that meets
      the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) requirements for
      protection of patient health information. Utilization of this system will allow real-time
      input of data from the patient's bedside by site investigators. Data collected will include
      various site and patient demographic data. The investigators will also collect opioid and
      sedative doses, durations of therapy, weaning of doses, and withdrawal assessment results.
