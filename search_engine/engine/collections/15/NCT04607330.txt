      to achieve where oral food intake is compromised.Where a standard ONS or enteral tube feed
      cannot meet the needs of patients, a modular feed can be added to the regimen, a low calorie,
      low volume, ready to use, high protein liquid may help meet protein needs while preventing
      caloric overfeeding.

      40 patients will be recruited in an attempt to evaluate the acceptability (compliance,
      gastrointestinal tolerance, and palatability) to a low calorie, low volume, ready to use,
      high protein liquid in patients with elevated protein needs. After a 1-day baseline period to
      establish patients' acceptability, gastrointestinal tolerance, compliance and dietary intake
      with their currently prescribed nutritional regimen, each patient will receive the high
      protein liquid feed daily for 28 days.
