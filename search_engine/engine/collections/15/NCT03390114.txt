    
      The primary objective of this pilot trial is to compare 10-week changes in Insomnia Severity
      Index (ISI) scores in HIV-infected adults with clinically relevant insomnia severity and who
      are already receiving virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and are then
      randomized to either treatment with the SHUTi cognitive behavioral therapy program or to
      Usual Care (UC). A total of 100 persons with HIV may be screened to identify the 32
      participants to be enrolled and randomized into the pilot trial. These participants will be ≥
      18 years old, have been receiving antiretroviral therapy with an HIV viral load < 75
      copies/mL within three months of the Entry Visit, and have an ISI score ≥ 15 within three
      months of the Entry Visit. These participants will be randomized 1:1 (stratified by age <40
      vs. ≥ 40 years) to either insomnia treatment with the SHUTi cognitive behavioral therapy
      program (N=16) or usual care (N=16).
