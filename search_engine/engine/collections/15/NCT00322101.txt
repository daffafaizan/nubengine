      I. Determine whether the conditioning intensity affects outcomes after HCT in patients with
      MDS or AML who have < 5% marrow myeloblasts at the time of HCT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I (Nonmyeloablative regimen):

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2 and undergo low-dose
      total-body irradiation on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion on
      day 0.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to
      57 with taper on days 57-177 or cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to 100 with taper on
      days 101-177. Patients also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil every 12 hours on days 0-27 or
      every 8 hours on days 0-40 with taper on days 41-96.

      Arm II (Myeloablative regimen):

      CONDITIONING: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      Group A: Patients receive fludarabine IV once daily and oral busulfan four times daily or
      busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -2.

      Group B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -3 and -2 and oral
      busulfan four times daily or busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -4.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo PBSC infusion on day 0.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally
      every 12 hours on days -1 to 56 and taper on days 57-200. Patients also receive methotrexate
      IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
