      Reconstruction" will evaluate the recovery of sensation in the reconstructed as well as in
      the nonreconstructed breast. Touch, vibration, pain and temperature sensation will be
      objectively evaluated greater than 1 year following completion of reconstruction. Breast
      sensation following immediate, tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction will be compared
      with that following immediate, autogenous tissue reconstruction.

      A formal sensory examination will be performed. SemmesWeinstein monofilaments will evaluate
      touchpressure sensation in the breast. A Bioesthesiometer will determine the recovery of
      vibratory sensation. Temperature sensation will be evaluated by application of warm and cool
      stimuli. Superficial pain sensation will be evaluated by application of sharp and dull
      stimuli.

      A patient reported assessment of sensory changes in the breast will be administered to
      patients. The Breast Sensation Assessment Scale Â© is designed to measure the prevalence,
      severity, and distress of 18 different sensory symptoms following breast surgery. A "Patient
      Demographic and Treatment Information Form" and patients' medical records will be used to
      obtain demographic and treatment data. The role of confounding variables (including: patient
      age, breast volume, axillary procedures performed and adjuvant therapies received) on the
      recovery of sensation will be evaluated.

      The estimated accrual time for this study is 12 months.
