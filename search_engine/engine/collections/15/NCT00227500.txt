      some protease inhibitor medications as part of long-term antiretroviral therapy for HIV.
      There is concern that these elevations in cholesterol may negatively impact on long-term risk
      of cardiovascular disease in this patient population. Pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase
      inhibitor, is commonly used to treat hypercholesterolaemia in the general population. We aim
      to examine the effect of 12 weeks therapy with 40mg pravastatin daily in conjunction with
      dietary advice in HIV-infected patients with elevated serum cholesterol on continued protease
      inhibitor therapy.

      After 4 weeks of dietary advice, patients will be randomised to receive either pravastatin or
      placebo for 12 weeks. Assessments include fasting lipid and glycaemic parameters, measures of
      body composition and HIV disease, and surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease.

      Although previous small studies of pravastatin in this field have been performed, none has
      done so in a randomised placebo controlled trial taking into account all the relevant
      measures.
