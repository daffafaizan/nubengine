      extensive rotator cuff tears are not reparable secondary to tendon retraction with
      inelasticity, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration. Arthroscopic superior capsular
      reconstruction (SCR) utilizing allograft or autograft tissue has been shown to restore
      superior glenohumeral stability and function of the shoulder joint in patients with
      irreparable rotator cuff tears.Grafts utilized for SCR have included fascia lata, hamstring
      autograft, human acellular dermal tissue matrix (HADTM), and acellular porcine dermal
      xenograft. Due to donor morbidity associated with autografts and the graft rejection
      potential of xenograft, HADTM has become a common graft of choice for SCR. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if patients treated with SCR using AlloMend have acceptable
      clinical and anatomic outcomes. We predict there will be significant improvement in
      radiographic, clinical, and patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing SCR for
      extensive, primarily irreparable rotator cuff tears when AlloMend allograft is utilized.
