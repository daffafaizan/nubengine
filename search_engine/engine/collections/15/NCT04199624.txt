      basic drugs. This may lead to poor and unpredictable systemic exposure for poorly soluble
      drugs. For example, extent of absorption of the kinase inhibitors, dasatinib (Sprycel) and
      erlotinib (Tarceva), is reduced by up to 61% and 46% respectively in patients on
      acid-reducing agents (ARAs). This pilot study is to evaluate the use of ascorbic acid,
      vitamin C, to temporary reduce gastric pH in individuals with omeprazole induced
      hypochlorhdyria. Using pH/impedance testing, we are seeking to determine the magnitude and
      duration of pH change upon administration of 1000 mg of ascorbic acid in healthy subjects
      with proton-pump inhibitor induced hypochlorhydria. The results from this study will be used
      to evaluate the use of ascorbic acid as a drug-drug interaction mitigation strategy.
