      I. To determine the optimal dose of ICG fluorescence for visualization using the SPY scope
      with near infrared (NIR) imaging technology on the da Vinci Surgical System to detect renal
      cortical tumors and to assist in their removal.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and report peri-operative outcomes, including but not limited to the following
      observations: positive surgical margin rate, correlation of the ICG and NIR imaging
      technology with intraoperative ultrasound imaging and preoperative imaging, incidence of
      adverse events, estimated blood loss, blood transfusion rate, length of stay, time of
      operation, utility of ICG and NIR imaging technology to assist in localization of renal hilar
      structures, utility of ICG and NIR imaging technology to assist in localization of the renal
      mass, warm renal ischemia time measurements, the feasibility of selective renal arterial
      clamping with the ICG and NIR imaging technology, cost analysis retrospective comparisons to
      patients who underwent similar surgical procedures without the use of ICG and NIR imaging
      technology, the overall effect of ICG and NIR imaging technology on postoperative renal
      function, and determination of possible future technique variations using the ICG and NIR
      imaging technology to improve nephron sparing surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo NIR fluorescence imaging with ICG
      on the da Vinci Surgical System followed by standard approach robot-assisted laparoscopic
      partial nephrectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-2 weeks.
