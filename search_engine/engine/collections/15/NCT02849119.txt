      minimally invasive partial nephrectomy led to widespread utilization of laparoscopic (LPN)
      and robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN). Both LPN and RPN can be performed through
      transperitoneal (TP) or retroperitoneal (RP) approach. RP approach is less utilized than TP
      approach because of technical difficulties when using rigid laparoscopic instruments in the
      small space of retroperitoneum cavity. However, with advanced surgical skills and thoughtful
      patient selection, RP approach may be associated with shorter OT, less EBL, shorter LOS
      compared with TP approach.

      Therefore, the investigators performed randomized control trial to compare the outcomes of
      the two approaches (TP-LPN or RPN vs RP-LPN or RPN).

      The purpose of this study To compare the treatment outcomes of the transperitoneal and
      retroperitoneal approach during LPN or RPN in treatment of small renal masses.
