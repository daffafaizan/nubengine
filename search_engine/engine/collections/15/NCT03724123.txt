      elective heart valve surgery between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014 at our center.
      The investigators use random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines
      to predict the 30-days mortality from a subset of demographic and preoperative parameters.
      Exclusion criteria were re-operation of the same patient, patients that needed anterograde
      cerebral perfusion due to aortic arch surgery, and patients with grown up congenital heart
      disease.
