      is far worse in Veterans with PTSD (41%) compared to the general population with OSA (70%).
      Among the factors associated with CPAP non-adherence is the coexistence of insomnia. Complex
      insomnia defined as the coexistence of comorbid insomnia ans OSA is a frequent diagnosis in
      military personnel with combat exposure. Similar to prior reports of patients with OSA
      without PTSD, comorbid insomnia can create a barrier to CPAP therapy. Ramelteon (TAK-375),
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of insomnia with sleep onset
      abnormalities, is a neurohormone that functions as a melatonin receptor agonist targeting the
      MT1 and MT2 receptors located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus which
      regulates the circadian rhythm of the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.The goal is to test the
      hypothesis that the administration of insomnia therapy-ramelteon- significantly improves
      treatment outcomes in Veterans with PTSD and complex insomnia compared with placebo.
