      new translational assessments of reward and cognition that will produce neurophysiological
      and behavioral metrics that enable objective comparison of drug effects.

      Phase 1 (2016-2018) will seek to develop and optimize computer-based tasks to measure of
      reward learning and cognition, to be administered during an EEG examination. Each participant
      will be asked to come for a single visit to complete a brief psychological assessment
      (interview and surveys), then perform two of the computer-based tasks while EEG data are
      collected. The three tasks are the Flanker Task, the Reversal Learning Task, and the
      Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT).

      In Phase 2 (2018-2021), a new set of participants will be enrolled for four visits. At the
      first visit they will have a brief psychological assessment (interview and surveys). They
      will then be assigned to one of the tasks developed during Phase I, and they will also be
      assigned to one of the study drugs: modafinil (a cognitive enhancer) or methylphenidate (a
      dopamine enhancer). At the second, third, and fourth visit, the subject will be given their
      drug in one of the three doses: a low dose, a higher dose, and a placebo. They will then
      perform the assigned task during an EEG exam.
