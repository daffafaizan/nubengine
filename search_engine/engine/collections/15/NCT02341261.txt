      neuropathy, a progressive injury to the very longest nerves of the body. Our previous
      research has found that neuropathy can be detected early in its course and followed by
      examining nerves that reach to the skin using a small punch biopsy. These cutaneous nerves
      can be injured by high blood glucose, obesity and high triglycerides, but have the potential
      to regrow in response to treatments that improve these metabolic conditions. The proposed
      study will randomize participants with mild to moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy to
      receive either generic annual counseling or an integrated program of moderate supervised
      exercise and actigraphy based anti sedentariness counseling.
