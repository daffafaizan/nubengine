      members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of
      hospital acquired infections. In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine
      carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable
      threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents.

      Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem plus a new beta-lactamase
      inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine beta-lactamases, including KPC. This
      Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of RPX7009,
      administered alone, in healthy adult subjects.
