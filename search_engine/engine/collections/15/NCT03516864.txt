      calculate anatomical details of chronic wounds (e.g. diameter, surface area, and perimeter).
      The device can be worn from a lanyard, and clips onto a smartphone, using natural ambient
      lighting to capture images of a wound. The MIMOSA also uses up to 6 near-infrared LEDs to
      illuminate tissue with different wavelengths of light to assess tissue oxygenation.

      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously approved a near-infrared device called
      the Kent camera for the assessment of tissue oxygenation. The goal of this proposal is to
      assess tissue oxygenation in a group of healthy volunteers with both the MIMOSA near-infrared
      imaging device and the Kent Camera.

      The investigators hope to show that the MIMOSA Imager is substantially equivalent to the Kent
      Camera, and as such, the investigators are modeling the investigator's experiments on data
      previously published by the makers of the Kent Camera. The MIMOSA Imager is a contact-less
      device, and differs from the Kent Camera only in that it is smaller and more portable.
