      overactivity of a gland in the neck called the parathyroid gland. Overactivity of the
      parathyroid gland may be caused by lack of Vitamin D in the body. It has recently been
      discovered that many patients with kidney transplants have low Vitamin D levels.

      25-OH Vitamin D3 is now recommended to treat kidney transplant patients with low vitamin D
      levels but it may not be enough to treat the parathyroid problems and bone disease.
      Doxercalciferol is a form of Vitamin D that has been used to treat bone disease and
      parathyroid problems in dialysis patients but has not yet been studied in patients with
      kidney transplants. We are interested in seeing whether doxercalciferol given together with
      25-OH Vitamin D3 will be a better treatment for the overactive parathyroid gland and bone
      disease than 25-OH Vitamin D3 alone in patients with kidney transplants.
