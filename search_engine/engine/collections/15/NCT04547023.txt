      annually and is associated with significant adverse pregnancy outcomes, including increasing
      the lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      (ACOG) recommends that all pregnant women undergo GDM screening between 24-28 weeks gestation
      utilizing a 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test that was designed to be administered without
      regard to the last meal or time of day. However, studies suggest that the timing of one's
      last meal prior to the 1-hour GDM screen may have a significant impact on GDM screening
      glucose levels. In addition, providers routinely alter the timing of the 1-hour GDM screen
      based on patients' self reported oral intake prior to the exam. The investigators plan to
      conduct a prospective randomized trial comparing a 6-hour fast versus liberal oral intake
      within 2 hours prior to the glucose tolerance test in pregnancy in order to evaluate the
      effect of the fasting versus the fed state on routine GDM screening results.
