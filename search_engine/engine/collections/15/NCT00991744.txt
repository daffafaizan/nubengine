      research protocol that aims to improve the overall outcome of Nordic children and adolescents
      with ALL in comparison with the ALL-2000 protocol and previous NOPHO protocols.

      The specific and primary objectives of the randomised study is:

        1. To replace intrathecal triple (methotrexate, cytarabine and glucocorticosteroid) by
           intrathecal liposomal cytarabine and glucocorticosteroid during maintenance therapy in
           order to decrease the central nervous system relapse rate in high-risk acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia patients.

        2. To evaluate acute and long-term toxicity in both treatment arms.
