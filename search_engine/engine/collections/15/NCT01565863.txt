      and a belief that their disability precludes them from gainful employment. The Progressive
      Goal Attainment Program (PGAP) is specifically designed to target these psycho-social risk
      factors of disability. PGAP is a structured, 10-week intervention that focuses on helping
      clients develop a planned activity schedule to assist them in resuming desirable life
      activities, including employment. The PGAP for Veterans Project will test the feasibility of
      delivering PGAP to U.S. military veterans. The research will focus on the best means of
      service delivery, staffing needs and how to coordinate PGAP in a larger veteran service
      system. MDRC will also gather information on the target population, recruitment methods, the
      feasibility of scaling and replication, and employment outcomes among the sample. Two hundred
      veterans will be enrolled and randomly assigned into the study across two sites: Errera
      Community Care Center within (part of the VA Connecticut Health Care System) and the Michael
      DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Texas.
