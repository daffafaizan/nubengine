      nonobese subjects. Over an 8 week period, the test group consumed one pack (150ml) of dairy
      yogurt with 50mg probiotics and 100mg Korean citrus Hallabong peel polysaccharide (60% RG,
      20% mono- and di-saccharide, 5% polyphenol) each day, whereas the placebo group consumed the
      same product without Korean citrus Hallabong peel polysaccharide. NK cell activities (%) were
      measured based on the ratios of effector cells (E) (peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC)
      from each participant to Target cell (T) (K562 cells) as 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1 or 1.25:1.
