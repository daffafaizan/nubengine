      structure of the pediatric vocal fold matures. A Universal Modular Glottiscope will be
      utilized for adequate laryngeal exposure. An operating microscope will be used for
      magnification. This setup will allow for the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging probe
      to be introduced using a laryngoscope to provide stability. The optical imaging probe will
      then be directed, or gently applied towards, the glottal surface, and an image field of 500
      microns x 500 microns x 350 microns will be obtained. As the probe is moved along the medial
      and superior mucosal surfaces of the vocal folds, "real-time" images will be obtained and
      digitally stored for review. The digitally stored images will be assessed and analyzed for
      their optical characteristics. The optical imaging probe will then be withdrawn from the
      patient and the original operative procedure will then be performed. Images can be attained
      in both "non-contact" mode (where the probe tip remains in the space between each vocal fold)
      and "contact" mode (where the probe tip is gently placed against the glottal tissue to
      compress it). The contact mode allows for deeper imaging (much like an ultrasound), which
      would be useful in situations involving larger (thicker) vocal folds. The study will end when
      images are acquired from a range of developmental ages to be able to refine the optical
      characteristics of the optical imaging system.

      Adults have also been included in this study for comparison as OCT imaging in adults may
      confirm the number of vocal fold layers compared to children.
