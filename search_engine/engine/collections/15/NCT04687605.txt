      secondary ischemic deficits after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Hypercapnia leads
      to a reproducible increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain tissue oxygenation (StiO2)
      as shown in a previous study (Trial-Identification: NCT01799525). Furthermore, the increase
      of CBF and StiO2 sustained after normalization of ventilation and no rebound effect was
      found. So, a possible optimization of the hypercapnic period may lead to prolonged effects of
      increased CBF and StiO2. Aim of this stuy is to find the ideal duration of hypercapnia and to
      evaluate the therapeutic effect of graded hypercapnia. For this, intubated and mechanically
      ventilated patients with an aneurysmal SAH Hunt/Hess 3-5, Fisher grade 2-4 on the initial CT
      scan and supplied with an external ventricular drainage will be included within the first 96
      hours after ictus. Between day 4 and 14 they undergo a trial intervention in which the
      respiratory minute volume will be reduced in order to maintain a target PaCO2 of 50 - 55 mmHg
      for 2 hours. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) is
      performed in 15-minute intervals. Intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure
      (CPP), and cardiovascular parameters are monitored continuously, serial measurement of CBF
      and StiO2 under continous hypercapnia is performed. Primary endpoint of this trial is change
      of CBF under hypercapnia, secondary endpoints are StiO2, measures non-invasively with
      near-infrared spectroscopy, mean flow velocity of intracranial vessels in TCD, delayed
      cerebral infarction in cranial CT and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) after 6 months.
