    
      The TriathlonÂ® Cruciate Retaining (CR) Total Knee System components are for use in cemented
      total knee arthroplasty for painful, disabling joint disease of the knee resulting from
      non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease (including osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis or
      avascular necrosis) or rheumatoid arthritis (excluded from this study according to protocol).
      The components are designed to improve range of motion (ROM) and stability. This study serves
      to demonstrate that subjects have reduced pain, increased ROM and improved stability
      following implantation with the Triathlon Cruciate Retaining (CR) Total Knee System as
      compared to the historical control.
