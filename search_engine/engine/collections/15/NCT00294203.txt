      epoetin alfa versus placebo. Eligible patients will just have undergone a major abdominal
      operation for malignancy (esophagectomy, gastrectomy, partial hepatectomy, partial
      pancreatectomy, or low anterior resection of rectum) and have a post-operative hemoglobin
      greater than 8 g/dL and less than 11 g/dL on post-operative day #1. On post-operative day #1
      patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive either 40,000 units of epoetin
      alfa or placebo. On post-operative day #8, the patients will receive an additional dose of
      epoetin alfa or placebo (depending on randomization assignment and Hgb level). Hemoglobin,
      hematocrit, reticulocyte count, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and immature reticulocyte count will
      be measured on days 1, 4, 8, and once between post-operative days 20 and 30. Pre-operatively
      and between post-operative days 20 and 30 patients will complete a quality of live assessment
      tool (FACT-An) to assess their fatigue related to anemia.
