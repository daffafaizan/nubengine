    
      This is a single centre non-randomized pilot study. Subjects will be recruited from the
      current cohort of islet transplant recipients at the University of Alberta.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether the combination of sitagliptin and
      pantoprazole can restore insulin independence in previously insulin independent islet
      transplant recipients experiencing early graft dysfunction. The study will also evaluate the
      safety of the combination drug therapy.
