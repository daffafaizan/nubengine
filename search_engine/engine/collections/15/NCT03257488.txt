    
      OSAS is a syndrome characterized by the partial or total collapse of the high airways which
      determines snore, airflow limitation, hypopnea and apnea.These events cause desaturations,
      daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of cardio and cerebral vascular diseases.

      OSAS's prevalence is estimated between 64-83% among patients affected by resistant arterial
      hypertension; therefore OSAS's screening is mandatory during the clinical work-up of these
      patients.

      This study is a randomized, interventional, spontaneous, exploratory, cross-over and
      monocentric trial, which assesses the utility and reliability of the reduced
      cardio-respiratory monitoring (type IV portable monitoring: Somnocheck micro Weinmann) to
      estimate the prevalence of OSAS among patients affected by resistant systemic arterial
      hypertension. The results are compared with a complete cardio-respiratory monitoring (type
      III portable monitoring: Somnocheck 2 Weinmann).
