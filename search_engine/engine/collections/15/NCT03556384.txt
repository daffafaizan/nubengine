    
      This oncology study will be a phase 2 study for patients with advanced or metastatic GIST.
      This study will determine overall response rate at 6 months for TMZ therapy in patients with
      SDH-mutant/deficient GIST.

      Treatment will continue for 6 months (with option to continue if benefiting treatment) or
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first). All patients
      will have regular evaluations for assessment of safety parameters. Temozolomide dose may be
      held and/or modified for the management of adverse treatment effects according to
      pre-specified criteria. Patients will have radiographic imaging (CT or MRI) every 8 weeks to
      assess tumor resection.

      An end of treatment visit for clinical evaluations and safety assessments will be performed
      approximately 28 days (7 days) after the last dose of study drug. Patients discontinuing
      study treatment will be followed every 3-6 months for disease recurrence and survival.
