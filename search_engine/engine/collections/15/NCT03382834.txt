      histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat to reverse HIV-1 latency. This study
      evaluated the safety of tamoxifen therapy combined with vorinostat and the effectiveness of
      this combination on latent virus reactivation in HIV-1 infected post-menopausal women with
      virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy, when compared to vorinostat alone.

      The study will be conducted in two steps. During Step 1, the study enrolled women with HIV
      into two groups. Arm A received tamoxifen daily for 38 days, plus a single dose of vorinostat
      on Days 35 and 38. Arm B had a 38-day observation period with no tamoxifen, plus a single
      dose of vorinostat on Days 35 and 38. All participants continued to take ART drugs prescribed
      by their doctors. ART drugs were not be provided by the study.

      Study visits during Step 1 occurred at Days 0, 28, 35, 38, 45, and 65. Study visits could
      include physical examinations, blood collection, electrocardiograms, and adherence
      assessments.

      During Step 2, all participants will be followed for 240 additional weeks for annual
      long-term safety follow-up. These visits will be conducted by phone and will collect
      information from participants on vital status and any new cancer diagnoses.

      Step 1 has been completed and this results submission pertains to Step 1. Step 2 follow-up is
      ongoing.
