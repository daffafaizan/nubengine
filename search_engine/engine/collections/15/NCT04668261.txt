    
      Primary study objective:

      â€¢ to study the longitudinal observation of brain blood flow changes in neurosurgical patients
      to evaluate the effect of surgical or conservative treatment on the brain structural and
      hemodynamic integrity.

      Secondary study objectives:

        -  To observe the relationship between longitudinal changes in hemodynamic patterns and
           structural brain tissue changes in neurosurgical patients.

        -  To determine different hemodynamic patterns that may be used as novel imaging biomarkers
           in future studies.

      4.2 Outcomes

      Outcomes of the project:

      Primary endpoint:

      To find correlation between course of disease, neurosurgical intervention and changes in
      brain blood flow and brain structure.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Correlation between progression of disease and hemodynamic patterns over time (ie. novel
           imaging markers)

        -  Correlation of clinical management (neurosurgical treatment vs. best medical care) and
           changes in brain blood flow.
