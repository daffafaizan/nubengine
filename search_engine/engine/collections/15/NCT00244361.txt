      disorder, purported to be autoantibody-mediated. We demonstrated expansion of B-cells in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) despite tumor resection, chemotherapy, or conventional
      immunotherapy. Whether B-cells can be purged from the CSF compartment with benefit to the
      patient is unknown. Targeting of CSF B lymphocytes represents a novel and valuable paradigm
      shift in the therapy of centrally-mediated paraneoplastic disorders. The objective of this
      preliminary study is to determine if rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20+ B-cells,
      reduces or eliminates CSF B-cells in OMS and whether the reduction results in clinical
      improvement. B lymphocyte subsets and relevant T-cell subsets will be immunophenotyped in the
      CSF and peripheral blood of children with OMS by four-color dual-laser flow cytometry.
      Sixteen children with an increased percentage of CSF B-cells will be treated with rituximab
      375 mg/m2 IV once weekly for four consecutive weeks and CSF testing will be repeated at six
      months with more frequent clinical evaluations and blood testing out to 12 months. Clinical
      outcome will be rated blindly from videotapes by an experienced observer using a validated
      12-item motor evaluation scale and quantifiable parameters of sleep, behavior and motor
      function. Immunological outcome variables will include percentages of B-cell subsets and
      quantitative immunoglobulins. Post-treatment results will be compared to pre-treatment values
      statistically. If rituximab proves to be an efficacious and safe method of treating CSF
      B-cell expansion and the neurological syndrome, this study will lead to a phase II trial with
      the eventual aim of gaining FDA approval of rituximab for this indication.
