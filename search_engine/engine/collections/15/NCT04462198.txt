    
      This is a randomized-controlled, double-blind study of PIPE-505 or placebo given as an
      injection one time in subjects with sensorineural hearing loss associated with
      speech-in-noise difficulty. Visits to the clinic will occur at baseline, dosing, and days 1,
      7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 after treatment. Safety will be assessed by periodic measurement of
      vital signs, ear examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood laboratory analyses and
      occurrence of adverse events (AE). Efficacy will be assessed by periodic audiometry and other
      audiological tests.
