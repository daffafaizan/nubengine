      rejuvenation using a validated questionnaire (the FACE-Q scale). This is a prospective study
      of patients who will undergo platelet-rich therapy for facial rejuvenation at NYU Langone
      Medical Center. Platelet rich therapy (PRT) has been increasingly used for wound healing, fat
      grafting, hemostasis as well as facial enhancement. PRT involves injection of patient's own
      platelets and fibrin, and has evolved as a less invasive technique for facial rejuvenation
      compared to more traditional techniques. However, while platelet rich therapy for facial
      enrichment continues to gain popularity; little evidence exists to support its use in the
      current literature. Therefore, this study sets out to determine patient satisfaction as well
      as quality of life following PRT for facial rejuvenation. PRT has been previously used
      successfully in facial plastic surgery and is being offered as an option as part of standard
      of care for facial rejuvenation (Sclafani).

      Subjects will be identified by the principal investigator as they present to the office for
      facial rejuvenation and are interested in an alternative to soft tissue fillers. All such
      patients will be given PRT as an alternative option for facial rejuvenation and any patient
      who agrees to this therapy will be enrolled in the study. Subject enrollment will continue
      until a total of 30 subjects are recruited.
