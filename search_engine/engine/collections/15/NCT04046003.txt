      have shown that a mind-body moderate-intensity Tai Chi (TC) exercise (8-24 weeks) reduced
      pain and improved physical function for knee OA, when compared to a waiting list, attention
      control, usual physical activity, or physical therapy. However, TC's mechanisms of action
      regarding improvement of one's clinical condition and its functional outcomes in individuals
      with knee OA are poorly understood. This study is to determine how 8-week TC intervention
      alters plasma endocannabinoid and its receptors in monocytes/marcrophages, plasma oxylipinds,
      plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor, brain white matter connectivity/efficiency, and
      functional/clinical outcomes in women with knee OA.
