      component of the immunomodulating therapy in MG patients without thymoma detection. Because
      randomized studies were missing, remained a residual uncertainty on the importance of
      Thymectomy. In the study "Randomized Trial of Thymectomy in Myasthenia Gravis" (MGTX-study)
      published 2016 the effectiveness of thymectomy by patients without thymoma detection has been
      indisputable confirmed. A significant improvement of the patient's complaints and the
      reduction of the immunosuppressive drugs were particularly evident by early onset MG (EOMG)
      two to three years after performing a complete resection of the thymic tissue.

      While the MGTX study (with an open operative procedure) was being done, the
      minimally-invasive thymectomy has gained more and more acceptance. From a surgical point of
      view, the minimally invasive thoracoscopic procedure represents a gentler alternative.
      According to the momentaneous clinical-scientific point of view, further studies are
      necessary to compare both procedures. Furthermore, the MGTX study included only patients with
      generalized MG and positive anti-Acetylcholine Receptor (AChR)-antibodies, who were younger
      than 65 years, so that the relevance of thymectomy in other important subgroups, such as late
      onset MG (LOMG), the ocular MG (OMG), as well as the patients without detected antibodies
      (seronegative MG patients), who represent about 10 % of whole population of MG patients, is
      still not clear.
