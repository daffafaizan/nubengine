      muscarinic-cholinergic receptors found throughout the body and promotes fluid secretion. Due
      to this, one of the main side-effects of pilocarpine is an increased amount of sweating.
      Thus, not only are the salivary glands stimulated, but all of the body's exocrine glands'
      production is heightened. On the other hand, cevimeline is a drug with a high affinity for
      specific muscarinic receptors (M3) located on lachrymal and salivary gland epithelium. At
      least in theory, cevimeline will produce less side effects compared with pilocarpine because
      of the higher affinity for the muscarinic receptors located in the salivary glands. A limited
      number of human clinical trials in the efficacy of cevimeline and pilocarpine to increase the
      production of saliva and the side effects have been performed with no conclusive results.

      The main purposes of this study were to determine the efficacy of cevimeline and pilocarpine
      in the secretion of saliva in patients with xerostomia, and to compare the side-effects
      between these two medications.
