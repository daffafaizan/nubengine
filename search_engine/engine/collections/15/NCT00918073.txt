      factors for coronary artery disease, including cigarette smoking, likely play a large role.
      The prevalence of smoking in the HIV patient population is higher than the general
      population. We will conduct a sub-study of "An Innovative Telephone Intervention for HIV+
      Smokers," (NCT00502827) conducted by Drs. Gritz, Vidrine, and others. This is a randomized
      prospective trial that will evaluate a cellular phone delivered counseling intervention
      versus standard of care for smoking cessation. In our sub-study, we will evaluate rates of
      progression in atherosclerosis in HIV/AIDS patients who quit smoking versus those who
      continue smoking by measuring carotid intima-media thickness(CIMT) and biomarkers of
      atherosclerosis at time point baseline, 1 year, and 3 year. The biomarkers measured include
      high-sensitivity Creactive protein, homocysteine, and IL-6. We will also evaluate rates of
      progression of CIMT in those who quit smoking versus those who continue smoking based on
      race, sex, state of HIV disease, comorbid diseases and lipid profile. The central hypothesis
      is that smoking cessation win slow the atherosclerosis progression in HIV patients. A
      successful behavioral intervention is being evaluated in the parent study. The goal of this
      sub-study is to assess the effect of a modifiable coronary artery disease risk factor,
      smoking, in HIV/AIDS patients through this collaboration of cardiovascular expertise and
      metrics.
