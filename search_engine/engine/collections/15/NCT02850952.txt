      quality. Unfortunately, a lack of objectivity in the assignment of patients to nurses can
      lead to inequalities of care. Such inequalities translate to poor patient outcomes and
      diminished patient satisfaction. Furthermore, staff attrition related to nursing fatigue
      increases the cost of care due to a reliance on supplemental nurses. Rehab MATRIX is a
      patient assignment tool that objectively categorizes patients undergoing inpatient
      rehabilitation based on nurse identified acuity variables.
