      inhibitors (TKIs) with chemotherapy have shown a benefit of TKI over chemotherapy, with no
      demonstrated benefit on overall survival. After a first line of treatment with a TKI, most
      patients progress and are eligible according to the mechanism of progression to a TKI of 3rd
      generation in case of T790M resistance or chemotherapy. In patients with ALK translocation,
      crizotinib has been shown to be beneficial in first line compared to a platinum
      doublet.Despite these major advances, most patients are progressing after targeted treatments
      and chemotherapy and are facing the problem of anti-PD1 / PDL1 treatment.
