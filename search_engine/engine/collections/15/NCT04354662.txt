      for the second incidence of malignant tumors, and the third mortality factor related to
      malignant tumors. In China, most patients with gastric cancer diagnosed for the first time
      are already in the advanced stage, with stage II and III patients accounting for 63%, and the
      postoperative recurrence rate is higher. Studies have shown that patients with good
      pathological response after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (such as TRG0 or 1) have a
      better prognosis. In recent years, the AIO-FLOT4 study have found that perioperative
      chemotherapy with FLOT regimen has prolonged the PFS and OS in patients with advanced gastric
      cancer. It is preferred to recommend perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT regimen for
      patients with advanced gastric cancer in the NCCN guidelines or Chinese CSCO guidelines. How
      to further improve the efficacy of the perioperative treatment plan may be beneficial to
      improve the long-term survival of gastric cancer patients.

      Several clinical studies have also confirmed that PD-1 antibody significantly prolongs the
      life of gastric cancer patients who have failed advanced chemotherapy in the back-line
      treatment. In the KEYNOTE-059 study, the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with PD-1
      antibody in gastric cancer patients newly treated reached 62%. It is necessary to explore the
      efficacy of PD-1 antibody combined with FLOT regimen in the perioperative period. Thus the
      investigators plan to conduct this clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Toripalimab (PD-1 antibody) combined with FLOT regimen in the perioperative period.The
      secondary end points included pathological remission rate, resection rate, D2 radical
      resection rate, 5-year DFS rate and 5-year OS rate.
