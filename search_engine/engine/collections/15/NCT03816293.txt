    
      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C-section,
      abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients.

      To address this aim, we will conduct multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial
      evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI
      >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is essentially a
      phase IV clinical trial as this dressing has FDA approval for the indicated use.

      Specific Aim 2: Investigate the patients' experience of using the NPWT. To achieve this aim,
      we will survey a sub-set of patients to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to
      identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the
      device's ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort.

      Specific Aim 3: Assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling
      can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other
      post-surgical preventive measures. To address this aim, we will evaluate whether boosted tree
      modeling techniques can be used "at the bedside" via electronic medical record data feeds to
      tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients.
