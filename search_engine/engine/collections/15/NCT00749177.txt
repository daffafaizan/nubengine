      the standard treatments offered by the current Mental Health environment. Incorporating
      traditional aboriginal healing methods such as dream work, energy healing, healing circles,
      pipe ceremonies, self care, smudging, sweat lodge and traditional learning into standard
      practice will provide a culturally sensitive and supportive environment for children, youth
      and families experiencing stress, anxiety and depression.

      It is believed that Aboriginal and First Nation clients that access treatment options
      consistent with cultural beliefs will be encouraged to seek treatment earlier and will
      experience improved care and outcomes.

      In addition, the improved understanding of the role of traditional healing methods provided
      by Aboriginal Healers and Helpers in the management of these disorders will help clinicians
      incorporate these practices in the management of anxiety and depression
