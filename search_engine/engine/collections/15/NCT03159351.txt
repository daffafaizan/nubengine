      effectiveness of rTMS in treating depression after basal ganglia ischemic stroke and to
      examine whether such effects are related to restoration of white matter integrity.Sixty-six
      participants will be recruited from three centers and randomized with a 1:1 ratio to receive
      active rTMS treatment or sham rTMS treatment in addition to routine supportive treatments.The
      data of neuropsychological tests and MRI will be collected at 0, 2 and 4 weeks after the
      commencement of the treatment.The primary outcome is the measurement of 24-item Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24) scores, and the secondary outcomes include diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI) results and the results of neuropsychological tests including National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLs), Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),Clinical Global Impressions scales(CGI), Aphasia Battery in
      Chinese (ABC), Social Support Revalued Scale (SSRS) and Medical Coping Questionnaire (MCMQ).
