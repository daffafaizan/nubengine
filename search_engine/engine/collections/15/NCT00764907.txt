    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test in a randomized way the type and intensity of reintensification therapy for
           pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in each risk group: standard-risk
           (SR), intermediate-risk (IR), and high-risk (HR) group.

        -  To compare two shorter elements of reintensification (protocol III x 2 courses) to one
           (protocol II x 1 course) in terms of effectiveness when cumulative dose of most drugs
           are the same in both regimen in patients in the standard-risk group.

        -  To determine if the increased risk of failure in patients in the intermediate-risk group
           can be curtailed by a third reintensification element (protocol III x 3 courses vs
           protocol II x 1 course).

        -  To determine if the three reintensification elements (protocol III x 3 courses) achieve
           the same or better results in high-risk group patients, as compared with current applied
           HR approach in Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster Group (BFM) or Italian Association of Pediatric
           Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP).

      OUTLINE: This is a partially randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according
      to risk group (standard risk [SR] vs intermediate risk [IR] vs high risk [HR]). Patients are
      randomized in reinduction part of the treatment.

        -  Induction therapy:

             -  Protocol I' (SR B-cell precursor [BCP] ALL ): Patients receive methotrexate
                intrathecally (IT) on days 1, 12, and 33 (and possibly on days 18 and 27);

                except that they also receive daunorubicin hydrochloride on days 22 and 29.

      Approximately 2 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients proceed to
      consolidation therapy.

        -  Consolidation: Patients who have achieved complete cytomorphologic remission proceed to
           protocol mM or protocol M. Patients in HR group proceed to 3-block consolidation
           regimen.

             -  3-block consolidation regimen (HR): Patients receive 3 regimen blocks with 2 weeks
                between blocks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

                  -  Block HR-1': Patients receive dexamethasone orally or IV 3 times daily on days

                     1 (CNS-negative patients) or twice on days 1 and 5 (CNS-positive patients).
                     Patients also receive vindesine IV on days 1 and 6; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour,
                     every 12 hours, on days 2-4; and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours

                     days 1 and 2; and etoposide IV over 1 hour, every 12 hours, on days 3-5.

      Approximately 2 weeks after completion of consolidation therapy, patients proceed to
      reinduction therapy.

        -  Reinduction (randomized): Patients in continuous complete remission proceed to protocol
           II or III. Patients from SR and IR group are randomized to arms I and II; patients from
           HR group are randomized to arms II and III.

             -  Arm I (protocol II x 1 course) (SR-1 or IR-1): Patients receive dexamethasone
                orally or IV on days 1-21 followed by a taper; vincristine sulfate IV and
                doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, and 29; asparaginase IV
                over 1 hour on days 8, 11, 15, and 18; and methotrexate IT on days 1 and 18.

             -  Arm II (protocol III x 2 or 3 courses and interim maintenance therapy [IMT]) (SR-2,
                IR-2, or HR-1): Patients receive dexamethasone orally or IV three times daily on
                days 1-14 followed by a taper; vincristine sulfate IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride
                IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8; and asparaginase IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8,
                and 11. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 15; oral
                thioguanine once daily on days 15-28; cytarabine IV continuously on days 17-20 and
                24-27; and methotrexate IT on days 17 and 21 (and day 1 if there is initial CNS
                involvement). Approximately 1 week after completion of protocol III (course 1),
                patients receive IMT for 10 weeks (SR group) or 4 weeks (IR and HR groups) as
                described below. Approximately 1 week after completion of IMT, patients receive
                protocol III as above (course 2). Approximately 1 week after completion of protocol
                III (course 2), patients in IR and HR group receive IMT for another 4 weeks
                followed by another course of protocol III (course 3) 1 week later.

                  -  IMT: Patients receive oral methotrexate once weekly and oral mercaptopurine
                     daily.

             -  Arm III (HR-2): Patients receive 1 of the following regimens according to local
                practices:

                  -  Regimen HR-2A: Patients receive protocol II as in arm I, rest 1 week and
                     receive IMT for 4 weeks. Approximately 1 week later, patients receive another
                     course of protocol II.

                  -  Regimen HR-2B: Patients receive treatment as in 3-block consolidation regimen
                     with 3 weeks between each block. Approximately 3 weeks later, patients receive
                     protocol II as in arm I.

             -  Cranial radiotherapy (CRT) during reinduction: CNS positive patients (CNS status 3)
                receive CRT after completion of protocol II (SR, IR, HR-2B) or during the first
                1.5-2.5 weeks of IMT (SR, IR, HR-2A). SR and IR patients with T-cell ALL and HR
                patients receive prophylactic CRT at these same time periods.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of reinduction (some patients in HR group also undergo
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as described below), patients proceed to maintenance
      therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy (MT): Patients receive oral mercaptopurine once daily and
           methotrexate IV once weekly. Each patient subgroup (except HR patients undergoing
           transplantation) receives MT for a period that brings the total weeks of treatment to
           104 weeks, as follows:

             -  SR: Patients receive MT for 74 weeks (SR-1) or 61 weeks (SR-2).

             -  IR: Patients receive MT for 74 weeks (IR-1) or 57 weeks (IR-2).

             -  HR: Patients receive MT for 58 weeks (HR-1), 62 weeks (HR-2A), or 63 weeks (HR-2B).

      Patients with BCP-ALL and in group SR-1 or IR-1 also receive methotrexate IT once in weeks 4,
      8, 12, and 16 of MT. Patients with BCP-ALL and in group SR-2 receive methotrexate IT in weeks
      4 and 8 of MT.

        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT): Some patients in HR group may undergo ASCT
           (usually bone marrow, but may be peripheral blood or umbilical cord stem cells), (at the
           time of reinduction therapy) beginning 3-4 weeks after the completion of second protocol
           III (HR-1), the first protocol II (HR-2A), or completion of the 3-block consolidation
           regimen (HR-2B).

             -  Under 2 years old: Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -5,
                etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3
                and -2, and then undergo ASCT on day 0.

             -  At least 2 years old: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days
                -6 to -4 and receive etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -3, and then undergo ASCT on
                day 0. Fractionated local radiotherapy, if required, is administered on days -14 to
                -7.
