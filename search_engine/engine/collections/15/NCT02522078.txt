      to use regimen. Nevertheless, there is a debate whether the administration of dry misoprostol
      has similar effects compared to wet pill. It would be necessary to undertake a clinical trial
      to evaluate which regimen (dry or wet) offers a better cervical dilation pre uterine
      evacuation. The primary objective of this study is to compare the degree of cervical
      dilatation pre-uterine evacuation in subject that received 400 µg of dry or wet misoprostol 3
      or more hours before the procedure. Secondary objective is to verify whether there is a
      correlation between vaginal pH (<5 / ≥5) and the degree of cervical dilation (≥8mm / <8mm)
      with the use of wet or dry misoprostol. Women will be randomized to one of the two groups:
      dry or wet misoprostol.
