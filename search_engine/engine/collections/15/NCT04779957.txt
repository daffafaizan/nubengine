      event The occurrence of anti-HLA antibodies is a major barrier to perform a second kidney
      transplantation. Moreover, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome can occur which could
      lead to serious patient's complications, in case of early graft thrombosis. To date, no
      treatment or strategy is available to reduce these risks, after graft nephrectomy. IL-6 is a
      key cytokine in inflammation, but also in the development of T and B cells activation. This
      treatment previously demonstrated a major role in the occurrence of allo-antibodies.
      Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody blocking IL6 receptor, previously used with success in
      kidney transplantation to reduce anti-HLA antibodies mediated rejection.

      Objectives: Investigators hypothetize that Tocilizumab is usefull to prevent
      allo-sensitization post graft nephrectomy. They propose here to evaluate in a phase II pilot
      study, the safety of the use of a single dose of Tocilizumab immediately before or after
      graft nephrectomy.
