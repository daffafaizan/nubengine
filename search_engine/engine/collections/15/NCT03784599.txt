    
      This study is a multicenter single arm phase II study with a phase I run in to study the
      toxicity and efficacy of T-DM1 and osimertinib combination treatment in patients with EGFR
      mutated NSCLC and HER2 bypass track activation (HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) ≥2+ and/or
      HER2 amplification) after progression on an EGFR TKI.

      In the phase I run in, study safety will be assessed in a classical 3+3 design. Because of
      potential for overlapping hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events (AE), the first 3
      patients will receive a reduced dose of T-DM1 3.0 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks combined with
      osimertinib 80 mg once daily. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as a grade 3 AE
      toxicity according to CTC AE 4.03 that does not recover to grade ≤2 before the next cycle of
      T-DM1. DLT's will be collected up to 6 weeks after treatment initiation (2 T-DM1 cycles).
      Dose escalation within patients is not allowed.

      If 1 patient develops a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 more will be included and treated
      with T-DM1 3.0 mg/kg. If ≥2 of the 6 patients develop a DLT, further study of the combination
      will be halted. Otherwise, T-DM1 3.0 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks combined with osimertinib 80 mg
      once daily will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to put forward in the phase II part of
      this study.

      If none of the first three patients develops a DLT, the T-DM1 dose will be escalated to the
      standard dose of 3.6 mg/kg. If ≤1 patient experiences a DLT in 6 patients (3+3), T-DM1 3.6
      mg/kg IV every 3 weeks and osimertinib 80 mg once daily will be the MTD. If ≥2 patients
      develop a DLT, the T-DM1 will be lowered to 3.0 mg/kg and three more patients will be
      enrolled in this dose cohort. When ≤1 of these patients develops a DLT, this will be the MTD.
