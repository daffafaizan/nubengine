      comprehensive quantitative documentation of efficacy decay for ACTs in real world settings;
      showing how community and provider's contribute to efficacy decay. The proposed text messages
      reminder intervention builds up from the recent findings of the Kenyan study which
      demonstrated an improvement in malaria case management by 24%. This level of improvement in
      malaria case management, if coupled with other systems interventions to improve timely access
      to ACT providers, should at least double systems effectiveness. This being the case, health
      systems in developing countries will be able to address these significant challenges
      hindering taking the diseases eradication agenda forward. Inappropriate care and untimely
      access to treatment has been identified as one of important elements for ACTs efficacy decay
      that in turn continues to pose a serious challenge to achieving malaria eradication.

      Goal: The study aim to evaluate using cluster randomized control trial whether mobile phone
      text messages reminders can improve the quality of malaria case management.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To develop an automated text messaging system to send reminders to mobile phones of
           health workers based on Tanzanian malaria treatment guidelines;

        2. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on providers' compliance to the National
           Guidelines for Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment (NGMDT);

        3. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on patients adherence to malaria treatment
           with ACT

        4. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on reducing baseline efficacy decay levels.
