      procedure for transplanting ex-vivo transduced keratinocytes in patients with a deficiency of
      the ornithine transferase gene (OAT). The safety of this procedure will be evaluated in terms
      of technical complications and the immune response of the patient to the presence of the
      transduced keratinocytes. Adult patients with gyrate atrophy, a disease defined by a
      deficiency of OAT, who have been followed for an extended period of time at the National Eye
      Institute and whose natural history is known to the investigators will be evaluated for study
      enrollment. Keratinocytes, previously obtained and grown in culture from these patients, will
      be transduced with a retrovirus manufactured under GMP conditions to express the OAT gene.
      The autologous transduced keratinocytes will be returned to the patient on the upper thigh in
      a small patch prepared to receive graft. At study defined visits, the site integrity will be
      monitored and biopsies of the grafted areas will be performed. The biopsies will provide
      information to evaluate the following three secondary study objectives: 1) the ability of
      keratinocytes to express the OAT gene, 2) the extent and duration of such expression, and 3)
      the extent to which the activity present in the keratinocytes is sufficient to lower serum
      levels of ornithine.
