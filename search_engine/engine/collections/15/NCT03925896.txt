      patients, according to the patient's HLA subtypes will be divided into HLA-A2, HLA-A11,
      HLA-A24 three groups, 9 patients in each group. Using a dose climbing method, each group will
      be divided into three dose subgroups. In the first dose subgroup, 5×106/kg TCR-T cells will
      be returned, and in the second dose subgroup, 1×107/kg TCR-T cells will be returned. The
      third dose subgroup 5 x 107/kg TCR-T cells will be returned.
