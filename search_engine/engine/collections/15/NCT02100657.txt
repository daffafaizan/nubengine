    
      Phase I Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-escalating Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Trial of
      Plitidepsin (AplidinÂ®) to determine the recommended dose (RD) of plitidepsin in combination
      with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple
      myeloma (MM), to determine the efficacy of the combination
      plitidepsin/bortezomib/dexamethasone, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      combination in patients with relapsing and/or refractory MM and to study the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PDy) of plitidepsin in combination with bortezomib and
      dexamethasone.
