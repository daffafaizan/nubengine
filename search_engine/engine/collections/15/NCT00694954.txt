      receive CE or usual standard care following a negative gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Our
      primary outcome measure (diagnostic yield) and secondary outcome measures (noted below) will
      be determined after one year of followup. Patients with have a minimum of one year of
      clinical followup. Direct health care costs in each arm of the study will be determined after
      a minimum of two years of followup.

      An economic evaluation based on the results of the clinical trial is also planned.
