      of time can have decreased libido and decreased sexual function.

      Individuals may be asked to take part in this study even if they have not taken opioid pain
      medications in the last twelve months. These individuals would also be enrolled to learn if
      long-term treatment of cancer-related pain with opioid medications results in decreased sex
      hormones, decreased sex drive, and increased fatigue or depression.

      Participants in this study will be asked to complete a set of questions about their sexual
      functions, physical symptoms, and psychological symptoms such as fatigue and depression. It
      will take about 25 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

      Participants will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons of blood) to test their sex hormone
      level. Participants who are identified as having low sex hormone level (hypogonadism) will be
      referred to an endocrinologist for standard hormone replacement therapy.

      This is a one-time evaluation, no follow-up visit or questionnaires are required.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 108 individuals will take part in this study.
      All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.
