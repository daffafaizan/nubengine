    
      General Objective:

      1. Compare clinical improvement in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal
      polyps (CRSsNP) through application of SNOT 22 questionnaire and visual analogue scale of
      symptoms, sniff test, acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry and nasal endoscopy using
      Lund-Kennedy score, after 6 months of follow-up after treatment prednisone or placebo plus
      standard medical treatment for 21 days.

      Specific Objectives:

        1. Compare decreased in SNOT-22 questionnaire score and visual analog scale of symptoms
           after treatment with prednisone or placebo.

        2. Compare decreased in nasal endoscopy findings, through application of Lund-Kennedy
           score, after treatment with prednisone or placebo.

        3. Compare improvements in smell after treatment with prednisone or placebo.

        4. Determine whether there are differences in nasal permeability measured by rhinomanometry
           and acoustic rhinometry after treatment with prednisone or placebo.

        5. Determine whether there is a difference in the SNOT 22 questionnaire score, visual
           analogue scale of symptoms, score of smell and Lund-Kennedy score between CRSsNP
           patients and eosinophilia, and CRSsNP patients with normal eosinophils, receiving
           prednisone or placebo .

        6. Determine if there is a difference in the SNOT 22 questionnaire score, visual analogue
           scale of symptoms, score of smell and Lund-Kennedy score between CRSsNP patients with
           elevated total immunoglobulin E and CRSsNP patients with normal total immunoglobulin E,
           receiving treatment with prednisone or placebo.
