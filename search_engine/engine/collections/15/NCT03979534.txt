      preferred to beginning dialysis early ("the earliest the best" strategy). This strategy is
      further supported by the consideration that patient profiles are changing with the increasing
      proportion of older and higher comorbidity patients. In high comorbidity patients, survival
      is not necessarily improved by dialysis.

      Nutritional care, adapted to each patient's needs and preferences, could in part answer these
      demands. Indeed, renal function has a strict correlation with dietary patterns. Low protein
      diets may have two favourable effects: 1) slowing down kidney function decline and 2)
      delaying the need of replacement therapy (metabolic stabilizing). In dialysis, the
      nutritional state is the most important survival indicator, and nutritional follow-up should
      allow starting dialysis in a good nutritional status.

      The study proposed here is an implementation study with a principal aim to improve the use of
      low protein diets in the clinical setting, by offering a multiple choice approach and by
      adapting the diets to the patients' needs.
