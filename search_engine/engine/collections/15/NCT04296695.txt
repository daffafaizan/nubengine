      million all of China with an increasing trend of new cases. Late presenters with low CD4 T
      cells and/or with hight viral load should be paid more attention for better treatment and
      care. As a new combined antiretroviral regimen of integrase inhibitor, B/F/TAF was recently
      approved in US and European and also in China which needs more real world data in China.
      Non-inferiority or advantage of B/F/TAF comparing with the first line TDF/3TC/EFV for later
      presenters in China needs to be explored.
