      l. To assess the progression-free survival rate of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with everolimus alone or everolimus plus
      bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) among treatment arms shown to be efficacious.

      II. To estimate the overall tumor response rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors treated with one of two novel regimens.

      III. To estimate the overall biochemical response rate (as measured by plasma chromogranin A
      levels) in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with these
      regimens.

      IV. To assess the toxicity of each regimen in patients with metastatic pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors.

      V. To assess the overall survival of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated
      with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and octreotide
      acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive everolimus and octreotide acetate as in Arm I. Patients also receive
      bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.
