      Injury incidences in Swiss Army training schools are higher than in armed forces of other
      countries.There is evidence that progressive loading of physical demands at the beginning of
      basic military service and specific physical training can reduce injury incidences and
      attrition rates. A new sport concept by the Swiss Army takes into account these results of
      previous studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the influences of this
      new sport concept on the physical and psychological fitness as well as on the injury and
      attrition rates of the recruits.
