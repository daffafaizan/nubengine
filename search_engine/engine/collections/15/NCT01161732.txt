      and the combined risks of aortic valve surgery and late complications of aortic valve
      prosthesis need to be balanced against the possibility of preventing sudden death and
      lowering cardiac mortality. Considering that sudden cardiac death occurs at a rate of
      approximately 1% per year and that the average postoperative mortality of isolated AV
      replacement is 3.0-4.0%, the 2007 European Society of Cardiology guidelines do not recommend
      aortic valve surgery for asymptomatic patients with severe AS and the 2006 American College
      of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend surgery as a class IIb
      indication only in patients with extremely severe AS and who are at low operative risk.
      Clinical outcomes vary widely according to the severity of stenosis in asymptomatic AS, and
      asymptomatic patients with very severe AS are often referred for aortic valve replacement in
      clinical practice despite the lack of data supporting early surgery. Rosenhek et al recently
      reported a worse prognosis with a higher event rate and a risk of rapid deterioration in very
      severe AS, and the investigators also recently reported that compared with the conventional
      treatment strategy, early surgery in patients with very severe AS is associated with an
      improved long-term survival in a prospective, observational study. However, there have been
      no prospective,randomized studies comparing early surgery with a watchful waiting strategy in
      very severe AS. We sought to compare long-term clinical outcomes of early surgery with those
      of conventional management based on current guidelines.
