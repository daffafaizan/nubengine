    
      Current Arm: ASTX727 + itacitinib (INCB039110; JAK1 inhibitor)

      Primary Objective Phase 1:

      - Characterize the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of each novel oral targeted agent in
      combination with oral ASTX727 in order to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and
      schedule.

      Primary Objective Phase 2:

      - To test whether the overall response to each novel ASTX727 combination therapy in MDS/MPN
      patients is sufficiently high to warrant further investigation in more definitive trials.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To expand the safety analysis of each treatment combination in MDS/MPN patients.

        -  To assess the morphologic bone marrow response in MDS/MPN patients treated on each Arm
           of the study.

        -  To estimate the effect of each treatment combination on patient survival

        -  To test the applicability of the proposed MDS/MPN IWG response criteria across multiple
           Arms of this study.

      Tertiary/Exploratory objectives:

        -  To investigate genetic biomarkers of response in MDS/MPN.

        -  To characterize molecular responses to individual treatments.

        -  To evaluate synergistic effects of hypomethylation by ASTX727 and specific pathway
           blockade by study compounds.

        -  To explore the use of automated quantification of spleen volume from CT exams as a
           measure of clinical benefit

        -  To test and/or validate diagnostic algorithms and prognostic indices for MDS/MPN
           patients

        -  To investigate the correlation of patient reported outcomes with disease severity and/or
           treatment response
