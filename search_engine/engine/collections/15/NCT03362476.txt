      elevated risk for adverse health outcomes associated with alcohol use. Evidence-based alcohol
      reduction interventions for this vulnerable population are limited. To address this gap, the
      proposed study will harness the multidisciplinary expertise and experience of collaborative
      Russian-U.S. research team to develop a brief, computer-based, alcohol reduction intervention
      tailored for HIV/HCV co-infected women and evaluate its efficacy. The proposed study will be
      conducted in three sequential stages: (1) Adaptation, (2) Implementation, and (3) Evaluation.
      Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) adapted computer-based alcohol
      reduction intervention, or (2) standard-of-care control condition. The proposed trial design
      and analysis provide an appropriate conceptual and methodological framework to assess the
      efficacy of the computer-based intervention. The intervention, if effective, may be an
      efficient and cost-effective alcohol reduction strategy that is scalable and can be readily
      disseminated and integrated in clinical care at other AIDS Centres in Russia to enhance
      women's health and reduce HIV/HCV transmission risk.
