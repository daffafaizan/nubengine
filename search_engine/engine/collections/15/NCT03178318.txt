      determine the size of the sample required for a planned randomised controlled trial in the
      future. All the volunteers will be asked to lie on a trolley with the head in neutral
      position- Defined as alignment of external auditory meatus (outer ear canal) to the sternal
      angle (prominent portion of breast bone) is horizontal. A radiologist trained in ultrasound
      of the neck will identify the position of upper and lower border of the cricothyroid membrane
      using ultrasound and then mark these borders and the centre point with a black surgical
      marker pen. Then the volunteer will be asked to extend the neck and the same steps will be
      repeated using a red surgical marker pen. The distance between the two centre points will
      then be measured using a calliper/ measuring scale.
