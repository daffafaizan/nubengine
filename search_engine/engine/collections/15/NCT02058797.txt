      performance and subjective well-being. In order to find effective treatments for
      procrastination, the present study wants to test the efficacy of Coherence Therapy, compared
      with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Procrastination, negative emotional states and cognitive
      structure will be assessed in pre-treatment and post-treatment evaluation. A total of 30
      students will be randomly assigned to Coherence Therapy (n=15) or Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (n=15). In both forms of treatment students will receive three weekly sessions and
      one more session six to seven weeks after the third session. The treatment will be provided
      by trained psychotherapists. Findings would clarify the effectiveness of Coherence Therapy
      for the treatment of procrastination and the change of emotional states and cognitive
      structure of the students after the treatment.
