      contrast echocardiography for microvascular perfusion assessment, blood analysis for
      myocardial injury, and carotid US for plaque or IMT progression in subjects receiving
      ponatinib. This series of tests is intended to provide information on the presence of
      clinically-evident or subclinical microvascular angiopathy and plaque acceleration.
