      compare differences in older adults' wheelchair skill with WheelSeeU versus group-based
      information sessions. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group
      (WheelSeeU) or a control group (information sessions) using a 1:1 allocation ratio between
      groups. To support balance between groups and blinding of assignment, a central computerized
      randomization process will be designed by our team statistician, with an undisclosed block
      size and stratified by site (Vancouver n = 20 [+4 for 20% dropout]; Quebec City n = 20 +4 ).
      Once subjects are enrolled, the Tester will collect baseline data and enter them into a
      secure database. The Site Coordinator will contact Dr. Goldsmith via telephone or email and
      obtain group assignment within 48 hours. Subject contact information will be forwarded to the
      appropriate group Trainer to arrange for an initial training session or peer support session.
      To address bias, subjects will be instructed not to discuss their program and the Testers (1
      per site) will be blinded to group allocation. Follow-up testing will occur at immediately
      and 6 months post-intervention.

      To mask the participants from the study objectives, participants in both the intervention and
      control groups will be told that the intervention is designed to improve wheelchair use. The
      findings from the study will be summarized and mailed to each participant upon study
      completion.

      WheelSeeU and the control group will be held at Blusson Spinal Cord Centre, GF Strong or in
      the community depending on participant preference.
