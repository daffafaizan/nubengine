      assess changes in connectivity of resting state neural networks. 10 hyperbaric treatments at
      2 atmospheres absolute for 1 hour at pressure will be administered. A review of symptoms and
      and thorough clinical neurological examination by an experienced neurologist familiar with
      these studies will be done before and 4-6 weeks after the hyperbaric treatments.
