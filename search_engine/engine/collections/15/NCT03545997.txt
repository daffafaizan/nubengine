      including activation of the leukotriene pathway.

      In apneic patients, the urinary excretion of LTE4, a systemic marker of CysLT pathway
      activation, is increased in relation to the severity of OSAS and it's an independent
      predictor of cardiovascular risk event occurring at 10 years.

      Montelukast is a CysLT1 receptor antagonist. By blocking CysLT1 receptors, montelukast
      prevents vasoconstriction, proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, adhesion
      molecule expression, and leukocyte recruitment induced by CysLTs.Montelukast may improve
      endothelial function and reduce vascular remodeling in apneic patients.

      A pharmacological blockade of CysLT pathway would be an interesting therapeutic strategy to
      limit the cardiovascular consequences of OSAS.
