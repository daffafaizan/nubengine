      specifications of the inclusion criteria. Demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender,
      affected side) and severity of functional impairment dealing with cognitive /communication,
      manual ability and mobility were noted. After a comprehensive screening, a total of 30
      children met inclusion criteria (grades 1-4) were randomly assigned to one of two groups
      (Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy or Bimanual training), at an equal number and
      probability. Children blinded to group allocation were delivered activity-based upper limb
      training in the context of Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy or Bimanual training,
      at a similar dose and frequency (10 weeks/3 days per week/2.5 hours per day). 1 out of 3
      sessions per week was carried out in the school time (during the art or physical education
      class), while 2 out of 3 sessions were carried out in rehabilitation centers which the
      children regularly attend for regular care 2-day weekly. All participating children continued
      to receive their standard care (90 minutes per week) throughout the study period.

      During the 1-month screening period, physical characteristics of participants were described
      through classification systems including The Communication Function Classification System,
      The Manual Ability Classification System , and The Gross Motor Function Classification
      System. Participating children were evaluated before the study entry (T1), immediately
      postintervention (T2), and at 16 weeks postintervention (T3) using the KIDSCREEN-27
      questionnaire
