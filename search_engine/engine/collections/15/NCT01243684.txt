      cervical spondylosis with varying degrees of symptoms and in healthy control subjects. Fibre
      tracking of main spinal tracts will be performed. Regions of interest will also be
      identified. Diffusion parameters will be extracted. This will allow quantification of degree
      of damage in of the spinal cord. The findings will be related to motor function measures and
      comprehensive clinical tests of sensory and motor function.
