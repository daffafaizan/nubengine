      patients admitted for acute heart disease or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implementation (TAVI)
      to the cardiology units of the University Hospitals Leuven. The study uses a mixed-methods
      methodology aiming to 1) assess the feasibility and evaluate the effectiveness of geriatric
      co-management, 2) describe the experiences of intervention participants, and 3) perform a
      process evaluation. We will first consecutively recruit patients on the cardiology units to
      measure the standard of care in the control group. The geriatric co-management intervention
      will then be implemented and piloted on the participating units. Once fully implemented, we
      will consecutively recruit patients for the intervention group who will receive the geriatric
      co-management intervention.
