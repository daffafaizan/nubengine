      the scalp and skull, has become an important tool in neurophysiology and neuropsychiatry. The
      purpose of this project is (1) to use TMS as a probe of cortical excitability to investigate
      the physiology of the cerebral cortex in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and OCD-related
      disorders (including the "OCD spectrum"), which we believe to be disorders involving
      alterations in the excitability of the cortex; (2) to compare those findings to results in
      healthy individuals, and (3) to evaluate the possible effects of various pharmacological
      treatments on TMS parameters in individuals with OCD and OCD-related disorders. This protocol
      seeks to evaluate the hypothesis that TMS may provide a sensitive measure of cortical
      function that is relevant to the underlying pathology in OCD and OCD-related disorders. The
      identification of possible anomalies of TMS measures in these patient groups and changes
      elicited by pharmaceutical agents will be useful in orienting research towards investigations
      of the cortical neurotransmitter systems.
