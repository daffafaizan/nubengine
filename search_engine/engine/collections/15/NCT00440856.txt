    
      Objective. The trial aims to assess the hypothesis that presentation of removed material to
      the patient following a lumbar microdiscectomy would positively influence the improvement in
      their radiculopathic and degenerative symptoms.

      Design. Data will be collected prospectively. Patient allocation to treatment groups will be
      by simple randomization using a computer generated sequence of random numbers. Trial
      participants will be blinded as to the trial hypothesis and investigators blinded to patient
      allocation.

      Setting. Patients will all be treated in a single secondary care unit.

      Participants. All adult patients undergoing a planned lumbar microdiscectomy for
      radiculopathy due to a prolapsed intervertebral disc over a six month period will be
      considered for entry into the trial. Exclusion criteria: inability to give verbal consent,
      age less than 18, previous spinal surgery, emergency discectomies, patients having spinal
      fusions and those with no radiculopathic symptoms.

      Intervention. Patients allocated to the experimental arm will be given the removed disc
      fragments to keep once they have recovered from anaesthesia. Those in the control arm will
      not be shown disc fragments (best available treatment).

      Main outcome measure. The degree of improvement in radiculopathic and degenerative symptoms
      reported by the patient at 2-3 months after surgery.
