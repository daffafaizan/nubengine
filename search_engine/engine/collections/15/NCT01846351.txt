      degeneration. Since then we have seen that is not rare to find the coexistence of these
      entities. An ERM may produce intrinsic disorganization of the outer retina leading to
      persistent increased macular thickness and/or edema. This persistent edema may affect the
      effectiveness in the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration (eAMD).
      Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of significant ERM on the visual
      and anatomic outcomes of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for eAMD.
