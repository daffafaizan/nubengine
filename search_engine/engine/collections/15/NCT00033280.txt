        -  Determine the rate of progression in patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic
           oligodendrogliomas or mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytomas treated with neoadjuvant and
           concurrent temozolomide with radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to
      neoadjuvant temozolomide (stable disease or partial response (PR) vs complete response (CR)).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      CR or PR receive 2 courses beyond CR or PR.

      Within 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant temozolomide, patients with stable disease or
      PR undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks. Patients also receive oral temozolomide
      daily for 42 days concurrently with radiotherapy.

      Patients with CR after completion of neoadjuvant temozolomide undergo observation.

      Patients are followed at 9 and 12 months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
