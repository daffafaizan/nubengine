      coronary syndrome event patients are at risk of important additional clinical events such as
      death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Six months after patients present with an index
      event of ST-segment myocardial infarction, approximately 15% will either have died or had
      another episode of myocardial ischemia, and a similar situation exists for non-ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction/unstable angina patients. This randomized; double-blind;
      placebo controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in addition to
      standard care in patients with a recent ACS. Patients will be given rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice
      daily or 5 mg twice daily) or placebo (twice daily) in addition to standard care.
