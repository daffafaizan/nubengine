      this study was to determine the effect of ibuprofen 400 mg on tooth sensitivity (TS) caused
      by in-office bleaching.

      Methods: A triple-blind, parallel design, randomized clinical trial will be conducted on 30
      health adults who received either placebo or ibuprofen. The drugs will be administered 1 hour
      prior to the bleaching and a every eight hours during 48 hours. For bleaching used 35%
      hydrogen peroxide gel. The TS will be recorded for up and lower arc on two scales: VAS and
      0-4. The shade evaluation will be performed before and 30 days after bleaching with visual
      shade guide and spectrophotometer. The % of patients that reported TS at least once during
      treatment and the TS intensity will be evaluated by Fisher's and Mann-Whitney tests,
      respectively. The color changes will be evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA.
