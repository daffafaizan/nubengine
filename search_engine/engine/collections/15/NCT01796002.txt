    
      This is a randomized multi-center phase III study, to compare efficacy and safety of Ro-CHOP
      with standard CHOP regimen in patients with previously untreated, histologically proven PTCL.
      Given the nature of the experimental agent, this study is an open-label study. Patients are
      randomized 1:1 to receive either (Arm A) cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and
      prednisone (CHOP) administered in 3 week cycles for 6 cycles [22] or (Arm B) romidepsin CHOP
      (Ro-CHOP) administered in 3 week cycles for 6 cycles. In the Ro-CHOP arm, romidepsin will be
      administered at a dose of 12 mg/mÂ² IV on day 1 and day 8 every 3 weeks. In this study,
      patients will advance through three phases of the study: screening phase, treatment phase and
      follow-up phase. Patients will receive study drug(s) for up to 6 cycles, or until
      unacceptable toxicity will develop or progression or voluntary withdrawal. Patients will be
      followed for survival until the earliest of either 80% of patients have died or 3 years from
      the last patient randomized. Three years after the primary analysis an update of the database
      will be done and a rerun of the analysis will be performed.
