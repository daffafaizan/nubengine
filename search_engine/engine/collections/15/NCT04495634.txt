      head CT (s-HCT) as a diagnostic tool in patients with known head trauma. The investigators
      hypothesize that a stationary head CT (s-HCT) system based on the carbon nanotube linear
      array x-ray source can provide diagnostic quality head CT images. Patients included in the
      study will be 50 people who have had either a head trauma or a brain bleed and have undergone
      a head CT in the past 24 hours or who will undergo a CT scan of the head.
