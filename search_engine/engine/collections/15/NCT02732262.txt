      does. It has been described that distribution of cytochrome P450, which is associated with
      metabolism of oxycodone, differed between the races. Proper dose of intravenous oxycodone
      after major abdominal surgery has not been well defined in Korean. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the optimal dose of intravenous oxycodone for pain control after laparoscopic
      colorectal surgery in Korean based on pain score and side effects.
