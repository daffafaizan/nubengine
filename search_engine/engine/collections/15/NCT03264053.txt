      major concern for practitioners. Many researchers concluded that buccal aspect of the ridge
      is more prone to resorption, as it is primarily supplied by the periodontal tissues and
      ligments of the tooth. Therefore, extraction of the hopeless tooth, may be a reason for
      buccal cortical plate resorbing at a faster rate than the palatal plate leading to its total
      degradation. This may lead to dimensional changes in the human ridge and the aesthetic area
      is highly affected by this process. Several techniques in the litreture were proposed to
      solve the problem of thin buccal bone resorption with or without immediate implantation in
      the aesthetic area. Some of these techniques are the guided bone and soft tissue regenraton
      and bone augmentation but proved to be slight aggressive with high morbidity rate. Recently,
      several papers were published concerning the socket shield technique explaining how to
      maintain the ridge width and height. Socket shield technique that was first introduced in
      2010 aids at retaining the buccal fragment of root in place and intact thus placing the
      implant behind the lingual aspect of that fragment so that the periodontal ligments and
      tissues preserve its vitality and aids in preventing the collapsing of the buccal bone. This
      would help in improving aesthetics especially during immediate implant placment in the
      anterior maxillary region.
