      technique should be based on the patient, wound, tissue characteristics, and anatomic
      location. The purpose of these closure methods is an approximation of wound lips until the
      regenerate tissue reach a phase, where it is closed and can sustain the daily tensile forces.

      Several methods are used for wounds closure such as sutures, staples, tapes, tissue adhesives
      and laser energy. There have been two fundamental approaches to laser assisted bonding of
      tissues:

        1. Laser welding-heating the approximated edges of cuts in tissues by a laser beam;

        2. Laser soldering- applying a biological solder onto the approximated edges and heating
           the solder (and the underlying tissue).

      Seraffix has developed the Seraffix LTB (Laser Tissue Bonding) System - a laser system for
      soft tissue bonding. This innovative system includes features that make laser soldering
      suitable for clinical use. The Seraffix system is composed of CO2 laser device, propriety
      grip device (Clamps) and soldering agent (Human Albumin).
