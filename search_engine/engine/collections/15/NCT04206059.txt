      that mimic those of natural sleep. Closed loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) is a noninvasive
      inexpensive approach to augment the spectral power and duration of these slow waves. Whether
      in-phase CLAS may address this need is unknown, since acoustic potentiation of
      pharmacologically-induced slow waves has not been investigated. This prospective
      within-subject study of dexmedetomidine sedation paired with CLAS will assess the feasibility
      of augmenting EEG slow waves during sedation.
