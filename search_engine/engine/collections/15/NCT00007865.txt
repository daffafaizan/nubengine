        -  Determine the chemosensitivity rate in patients with recurrent or refractory
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) in
           combination with rituximab.

        -  Determine whether the addition of rituximab changes the toxicity profile of the ICE
           chemotherapy regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour,
      etoposide IV over 2 hours, and carboplatin IV on days 2-4. Treatment continues every 21 days
      for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation may receive 1-4 more courses of
      chemotherapy without rituximab.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
