      tests will use approximately 10 ml of blood. Blood work should be done within 3 weeks prior
      to treatment.. Women of child-bearing potential are required to have a pregnancy test done
      within 7 days prior to the start of treatment . A CT or a PET/CT scan of the chest, abdomen
      and pelvis will be done within 4 weeks prior to starting treatment . All subjects
      participating in this study will receive radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Patients will
      get 4 cycles of chemotherapy along with radiation. Each cycle of chemotherapy consists of
      gemcitabine given i.v. on day 1 and day 8 of treatment. XRT is given on days 1 and 2 and on
      days 8 and 9 twice a day. This works out to 8 treatments of XRT per course of chemo. Overall,
      a total of 32 treatments of radiation therapy will be given during the 4 sessions of
      chemotherapy. Blood work for CBC with differential and platelets will be done prior to each
      dose of chemotherapy.The investigational portion of this study is the radiation therapy given
      to the abdomen on the same day and the day after the patient receives chemotherapy.
      Three-Four weeks after treatment completion the patient will be evaluated again. The treating
      physician will examine the patient and order blood tests. These tests will use approximately
      10 ml of blood. The physician will also order a repeat CT or PET/CT to compare the disease
      status after treatment. These tests are not experimental and are part of routine check-ups of
      patients with pancreatic cancer. Patients will be followed for survival. Protected health
      information will not be reviewed by someone other than the patient's provider to identify
      potential subjects.
