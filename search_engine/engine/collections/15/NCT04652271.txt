      outcomes of pancreatic surgery worldwide. This "collaborative" model for snapshot clinical
      studies is a well-established approach for assessing current practice in a short period of
      time.

      There will be 3 months of prospective enrolment and 3 months follow up within a 12-month
      frame. The study will provide highly valuable data on outcomes after pancreatic surgery.

      The investigators are aiming at providing a verified record of true morbidity and mortality
      in consecutive unselected patients. This way the investigators will help identify relevant,
      modifiable predicting factors for outcome after pancreatic surgery.
