    
      Hypothesis:

      The combination of adductor-canal peripheral nerve block with periarticular intra-operative
      infiltration (AC+PI) provides superior analgesia and preserves motor function as compared to
      adductor-canal block (AC) only or periarticular infusion (PI) only.

      Specific Aims:

      The primary outcome of this trial is to examine pain on walking, using a 0 to 10 numeric
      rating scale (NRS), at post-operative day 1 in patients who undergo TKA using 3 different
      approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular infiltration; 2)
      adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only.

      The secondary outcomes of this trial are to examine, in patients who undergo TKA using 3
      different approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular
      infiltration; 2) adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only:

        1. pain at rest on post-operative day 1 and day 2 at 1000

        2. pain with walking on post-operative day 2

        3. pain with knee flexion on post-operative day 1 and day 2 at 1000

        4. analgesic consumption on post-operative day 1 and day 2

        5. distance walked on post-operative day 1 and day 2

        6. pain related interference with activities on post-operative day 1 and day 2

        7. length of stay
