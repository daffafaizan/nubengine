      major public health problem with substantial medical and economic consequences. The incidence
      of stroke rapidly increases with age, doubling for each decade after age 55 years. Gait
      impairment is one of the most important problems after stroke and improve walking function is
      often a key component of any rehabilitation program. To achieve this goal, robotic gait
      trainer seems to be promising. In fact, some studies underline the efficacy of robotic gait
      training based on end-effector technology, for different diseases, in particular in stroke
      patients. In this randomized controlled trial, we verify the efficacy of the robotic
      treatment in terms of improving the gait and reducing the risk of falling and its long-term
      effects.

      In this single blind randomized controlled trial the investigators will include 150 elderly
      subacute stroke patients divided in two groups to receive a traditional rehabilitation
      program or a robotic rehabilitation using G-EO system, an end-effector device for the gait
      rehabilitation, in addition to the traditional therapy. A 20 treatment sessions will be
      conducted, divided into 3 training sessions per week, for 7 weeks. The control group will
      perform traditional therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes. The technological intervention
      group, using G-EO system, will carry out 30 minutes of traditional therapy and 20 minutes of
      treatment with a robotic system. The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of the
      falling risk. Secondary outcomes are the assessment of the gait improvements and the fear of
      falling. Further evaluations, such as length and asymmetry of the step, walking and
      functional status, acceptance of the technology, will be carried.
