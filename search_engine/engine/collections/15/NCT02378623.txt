    
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      400 patients who meet the study eligibility criteria and consent for enrollment will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention with apixaban or control group with placebo. The
      randomization will be performed by a computer generated block randomization protocol. The
      majority of patients will begin intervention with Apixaban or placebo at the time of cardiac
      device placement (n approximately 300), and at least a quarter of the randomized patients (n
      ≥100) will include preexisting CIED (≥6 months) in place. Each patient will undergo a
      baseline MRI and a comprehensive cognitive screening examination. Repeat MRI and cognitive
      assessment will be performed at a follow-up period of two years from date of randomization
      (or less if clinical stroke/TIA occurs prior to this follow-up period). All subjects will
      receive a phone call at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months post-randomization to assess for
      endpoints and adverse events, as well as changes in clinical status, medications, and to
      assess study medication compliance.
