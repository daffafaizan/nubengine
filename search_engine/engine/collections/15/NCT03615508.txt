      history of taking an alpha blocker such as Tamsulosin. Participants will be recruited based
      on those two enrollment criteria, and after consenting they will undergo pupil dilation with
      10% phenylephrine. Once fully dilated the pupil size will be measured. Pupil dilation size of
      the eye affected by the Horner's Syndrome will be compared to the eye not affected by
      Horner's. Primary study outcome is the comparative dilation size of the Horner's affected eye
      to the non affected eye in all subjects.
