      I. Safety of BEAM (carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, melphalan) allogeneic transplant within
      100 days, defined as the day 100 transplant related mortality (TRM).

      II. Safety of oral ixazomib maintenance therapy from day 100 post allogeneic transplant up to
      2 years, defined by the incidence of grade III-IV acute (or overlap) graft-versus-host
      disease (GvHD) and grade III-IV ixazomib related toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      BEAM CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive carmustine on day -6, cytarabine and etoposide on
      days -5 to -2, and melphalan on day -1.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) on days -2 to
      at least 6 months with a taper as early as 3 months post-transplant and methotrexate IV on
      days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning between days 100 and 180 post-transplant, patients receive
      ixazomib PO on days 1 and 14 or days 1, 8, and 15 if the principal investigator deems it
      medically important. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days through 4 months
      post last dose of ixazomib.
