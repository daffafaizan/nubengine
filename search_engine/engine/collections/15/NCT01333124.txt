      patients with and resectable pancreatic cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy
      and curative surgery. An experimental arm that result a complete resection rate of at least
      90% would merit further study. With 90% power to reject that null hypothesis that the true
      complete resection rate is â‰¤75% with a type I error level of 5%, evaluable 53 patients are
      required. Considering the 20% unevaluable patients due to the immediate distant metastasis
      after treatment7, 8, 17 and 10% follow up loss, a total of 64 eligible patients will be
      enrolled.
