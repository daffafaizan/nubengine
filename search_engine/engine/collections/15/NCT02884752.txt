      collected all cases due to Campylobacter species between 2002 and 2012, including first and
      relapse cases. Clinical, microbiological and treatment features were analyzed using
      descriptive statistics.

      Results: 14 episodes of BJI due to Campylobacter spp were identified in 10 patients. Mean age
      was 76.8 y.o. (63-96). Sex ratio M/F was 1.5. Nine patient had hip (n=6), knee (n=2), and
      shoulder (n=2) implants. Immunosuppression was observed in 6 patients (3 cancers, 1
      cirrhosis, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, 1 corticosteroid treatment). During the 10 primary cases:
      all patients had fever and 2 presented digestive symptoms. Campylobacter spp were isolated on
      per operative samples in 5 patients. One of them presented positive blood culture. 5 patients
      had joint punctures: all of them were positives. Campylobacter species were C. fetus (n=7),
      C. coli (n=2) and C. spp (1). Strains were resistant to nalidixic acid (=10), ciprofloxacin
      (n=4), erythromycin (n=3) or cefotaxime (n=2). Only one C. fetus was susceptible to all
      antibiotics tested. Surgical treatment was performed in 8 patients (2 two-stage procedure, 6
      irrigation). The mean duration of adapted antibiotherapy was 77 days (26-237). 3 out of 4
      relapse cases were due to C. fetus. All were resistant to more than one antibiotic classes.
