      I. Compare the accuracy of single energy CT (SECT) with virtual non-calcium (VNC) double
      energy CT (DECT) to standard SECT alone in the detection of metastatic bone lesions using
      positron emission tomography (PET)-CT as the reference standard.

      OUTLINE:

      Computed tomography (CT) scans are routinely used in the evaluation of oncologic patients for
      initial diagnosis and subsequent disease staging. Detection of bone metastasis on standard
      CT, however, is limited in sensitivity, particularly in case of osteolytic intramedullary
      lesions. Recent studies have shown the ability to detect bone marrow edema using CT with the
      use of a virtual non-calcium (VNC) dual energy CT (DECT) technique. Because bone marrow edema
      is similar in composition to intramedullary bone metastases (i.e. both are of soft tissue
      composition as opposed to calcium or fat), VNC DECT may also be helpful in the detection of
      bone marrow metastasis. Cancer patients obtaining a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) CT and
      a separate diagnostic CT scan as part of their routine clinical care will be enrolled into
      the study. The diagnostic CT scan will be performed on a DECT scanner and the images will be
      reconstructed as SECT images for routine clinical interpretation as well as VNC DECT images.
      The SECT images alone will be evaluated and scored, and then the VNC DECT images will be
      added to the SECT images for a second evaluation (consecutive reading session). Multiple
      readers blinded to the PET-CT findings for detection of bony metastatic disease will
      participate.

      Researchers hypothesize the addition of VNC DECT to SECT will be more accurate in the
      detection of metastatic bone marrow lesions compared to SECT alone.
