      (BotoxÂ®) in chronic migraine (CM) patients is maintained over long term treatment is still
      limited. This study aims at assessing whether there is a sustained benefit and good safety
      with repeated onabotulinumtoxin A sessions in CM over more than three years of treatment.

      This study prospectively enrolled 65 CM patients, who were classified as responders after
      three sessions of onabotulinumtoxinA and were eligible to further continue treatment. Data
      documenting longitudinal changes from the trimester after the third onabotulinumtoxinA
      administration (T1) to the trimester after completing two years of treatment (T2) and
      eventually to the trimester after completing three years of treatment (T3) in (i) mean number
      of monthly headache days (ii) migraine severity as expressed by the mean number of days with
      peak headache intensity of >4/10, and (iii) mean number of days with use of any acute
      headache medication, were prospectively collected from patients' headache diaries.
