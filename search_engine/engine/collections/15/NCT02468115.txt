    
      This is a phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to be conducted in
      healthy volunteers. The study is designed to compare an infusion of a single dose of VIS410
      against placebo. Eligible volunteers will be admitted to the clinical center and will receive
      a single intranasal administration of influenza A (H1N1). One day (24h) after inoculation,
      subjects will receive a single administration of VIS410 or placebo. Subjects will be confined
      in the clinical center for 10 days after virus administration.

      Assessment of safety will be determined from vital sign measurements, physical examinations,
      hematology, chemistry and urinalysis laboratory testing, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs),
      pulmonary function, use of concomitant medications, and review of adverse events (AEs) should
      they occur. During confinement in the clinical center a symptom score card of influenza
      symptoms will be completed three times a day; nasopharyngeal swabs will be obtained three
      times a day and assayed for the presence of influenza virus and VIS410 concentration; serum
      samples will be assayed for VIS410 and the presence of cytokines. Upon release from the
      clinical center subjects will return for follow-up visits on days 14, 28 and either 56 or 84.
