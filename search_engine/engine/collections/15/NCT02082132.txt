      hour visit at our research facility. During the visit we will record details of their
      diabetes history as well as their general health and undertake blood and urine tests. At the
      end of the visit their participation will be complete. We will contact them later to discuss
      results of specialist blood tests and whether or not they have MODY, if they have had genetic
      testing performed.
