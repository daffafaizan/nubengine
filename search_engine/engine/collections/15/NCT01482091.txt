      analgesic therapy with opiates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents as well as fluid
      administration. It is known that there is a significant delay in time to administration of
      analgesics in children with VOC in the ED. The most easily modifiable factor that contributes
      to delayed opiate administration is route of administration.

      Intranasal medication administration is an easy, rapid way to administer opiates with minimal
      discomfort as well as bypassing first past metabolism and the blood brain barrier. Intranasal
      fentanyl has been shown to be a safe and effective analgesic for treatment of acute pain in
      children, reaching therapeutic effect in 2-10 minutes after administration.

      The investigators believe that intranasal fentanyl therapy will be able to provide expedited
      and effective pain therapy to patients with sickle cell disease presenting to the pediatric
      emergency department with a vaso-occlusive crisis
