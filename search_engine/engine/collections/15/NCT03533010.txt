      curve progression and improve bone health in early Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)
      during pubertal growth.

      AIS is a prevalent three-dimensional spinal deformity mainly affecting girls at puberty. It
      can lead to serious complications including spine degeneration, cardiopulmonary compromise,
      grossly deformed torso and psychosocial disorders. Current treatments are far from being
      satisfactory, with bracing being lengthy and physically demanding and surgery being a major
      invasive procedure.

      There is an association between AIS and low bone mass which has been reported to be a
      significant prognostic factor for curve progression. Given that dietary calcium intake and
      serum Vit-D levels were also low in AIS, we therefore propose a randomized double-blinded
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate if daily [500mg Ca + 800 IU Vit-D] can improve bone
      health and prevent curve progression. Immature AIS girls with Cobb angle 10-20 degrees will
      be randomized either to the Treatment or Placebo group with 3-year of treatment. The main
      outcome measures for evaluation for those who have completed the 3-year treatment and have
      reached skeletal maturity at the end of 3-year treatment include: (1) percentage of patients
      with increase in Cobb angleâ‰¥6 degrees and (2) percentage of patients who require bracing.
      Bone measurements using advanced image acquisition technology (HR-pQCT) to assess bone health
      will also be evaluated.
