    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib when combined with busulfan and
      fludarabine conditioning regimen.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine safety of this regimen as per National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity
      criteria.

      II. To determine time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment. III. To determine incidence of
      acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      IV. To determine relapse incidence. V. To determine non relapse mortality. VI. To determine
      overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study chemotherapy resistance. II. To study deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. III. To
      study immune recovery and cytokines (both in plasma and cells).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of sorafenib, followed by a phase II study.

      PRE-STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients receive sorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily
      (BID) on days -24 to -5, busulfan intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days -20 and -13 and -6
      and -3, and fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) IV
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      POST-STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on days 3 and 4,
      tacrolimus PO BID beginning day 5 for about 50 days, filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 7
      and sorafenib PO BID beginning between days +30 and +120 for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with matched unrelated donor receive
      mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) or IV over 2 hours TID beginning on day 5 for up
      to 90 days for longer.
