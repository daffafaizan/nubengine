      I. To evaluate, in terms of late toxicity, the safety of stereotactic radiation therapy using
      the proposed fractionation schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate, in terms of acute toxicity, the safety of stereotactic radiation therapy
      using the proposed fractionation schedule.

      II. To determine stereotactic treatment efficacy through biochemical failure (Phoenix
      criteria).

      III. To determine the protocol completion rate. IV. To describe patient-reported outcomes
      using International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and EPIC Urinary and Bowel Assessment
      questionnaires.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard daily fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) over 7-8.5 weeks.
