      adults . and delayed diagnosis in children is common . An innocuous appearing skin wound and
      a subtle functional deficit may hinder both presentation and identification of the
      injury.Pediatric flexor tendon injuries heal rapidly and contractures are rare, as long as
      the joint has not been injured. but Inadequate management can result in loss of hand function
      .

      Data involving children rehabilitation remain unclear, with some studies showing no
      difference between early rehabilitation protocols and four weeks of cast immobilization .
      Some studies claim that protocols are not necessary in children younger than six years of
      age, and that only immobilization is required and some studies show transition to a more
      aggressive early motion protocol .

      Although the incidince of flexor tendon injury in children is not low but the reported cases
      below the age of six years remains low Which makes reported results less trustworthy. This
      created the need for a better designed and larger number study to report results in this age
      group.
