      heart disease has involved the large heart arteries (epicardial arteries); however, disease
      of the very small heart arteries (coronary microvasculature) likely precedes the development
      of epicardial disease and represents the "base of the iceberg" of cardiovascular disease.
      Yet, we do not understand how dysfunctional microvasculature leads to reduced blood flow,
      symptoms and adverse outcomes.

      Coronary microvascular disease results from a combination of structural and functional
      abnormalities, so it is important to have reliable diagnostic tools that do not rely solely
      on imaging. The gold-standard for testing involves hemodynamic (blood circulation)
      measurements such as coronary flow reserve (CFR) and hyperemic microcirculatory resistance
      (HMR) that take place in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

      Ranolazine is a relatively new U.S Food and Drug Administration-approved medicine to help
      with angina (chest pain). There are no publications on the effect of Ranolazine on HMR.
