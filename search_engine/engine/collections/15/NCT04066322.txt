      chemotherapy. For patients achieved PR/SD after system treatment, resection of primary tumor
      and metastasis maybe a better way to decline tumor burden and get longer survival. this real
      world study is focused on this group of patients with metastatic PanNET, and to evaluate the
      efficacy and tolerability of surgery in selecting patients who can benefit from the
      synchronous resection of primary pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and liver metastasis after
      induction systemic treatment.
