      into two groups, with each school as a unit of randomization. All the teachers in both groups
      received an ergonomic brochure; teachers in the experimental group also received an
      extension-oriented exercise program, conducted by a physical therapist. Data were collected
      at baseline and at a two-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure recorded was the level
      of disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and Oswestry Disability Index), while
      secondary outcome measures included LBP and neck pain presence (Pain Drawing) and intensity
      (Visual Analogue Scale). At follow-up, a significant improvement was registered in the
      experimental group for all the outcomes evaluated. In conclusion a six-session
      extension-oriented exercise program proved decisive in preventing low back and neck
      complaints and in reducing consequent LBP functional disability among nursery school
      teachers.
