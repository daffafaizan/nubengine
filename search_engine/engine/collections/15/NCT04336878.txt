    
      The primary objective of the feasibility study is to provide a decision on whether to proceed
      to a full-scale, multicentre RCT.

      The two-arm randomised controlled feasibility study will:

        1. Assess the numbers of eligible pregnant women accessing the healthcare services at each
           partner healthcare site;

        2. Assess screening, recruitment and attrition rates;

        3. Assess willingness of healthcare staff to recruit women and deliver the HHIPBe
           intervention as part of routine antenatal clinical care;

        4. Assess indicators of engagement with the intervention by women (self-reported logbooks/
           app data/ qualitative post-intervention interviews);

        5. Assess the acceptability of randomisation to a 'usual care' group and women's views on
           completion of study measures at each time-point;

        6. Assess the acceptability of the intervention to women;

        7. Assess fidelity of intervention implementation across each partner site i.e. was HHIPBe
           delivered as intended;

        8. Trial the outcome measures that would be used in a full trial of HHIPBe (and gather data
           to inform a power calculation for a full trial) including assessment of: GWG,
           habit-formation and diet and activity behaviours up to 6 weeks postpartum; and health
           economics measures, alongside an exploration of the potential for data linkage to
           maternal and neonatal outcomes in each jurisdiction.
