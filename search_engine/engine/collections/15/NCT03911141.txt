      mortality in the United States (US). Regular physical activity has been demonstrated to
      reduce the risk of ASCVD and is associated with a number of other health benefits. Yet, less
      than 50% of adults in the US achieve enough physical activity to actually obtain these
      benefits. Insights from behavioral economics have been shown to both better reflect the
      'predictable irrationality' of humans and to be effective in designing interventions that
      achieve sustained improvements in health behavior. Our prior work has demonstrated that
      interventions using financial incentives and gamification can leverage principles from
      behavioral economics to increase physical activity during 3-month interventions and sustain
      effects in 3-month follow-up periods. These findings warrant further investigation of
      longer-term effects. In this study, we conduct a four-arm randomized, controlled trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of using behavioral economic approaches including gamification,
      financial incentives, or both to increase physical activity among patients with elevated risk
      for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease during a 12-month intervention with a 6-month
      follow-up.
