      anger/ aggression management approach in this population. Since the investigator's prior
      research shows that stronger hostile attributions are associated with poorer perspective
      taking,39 ICAN employs a unique perspective-positioning technique to train perspective taking
      and reduce hostile attributions. After recalling a personal situation in which others'
      ambiguous actions led to an unpleasant outcome, participants will explore different
      perspectives: sitting or standing in one position, s/he will explore his or her own thoughts
      and feelings (self-perspective), then move to a different position to experience the other
      person's perspective, eliciting their thoughts and feelings.

      In 40 participants with TBI, we will conduct a Phase I, randomized waitlist controlled trial
      with 4 data collection points: Baseline; Week 1; Week 8 (post-treatment for ICAN; post-wait
      period for WLC); Week 15 (WLC post-treatment).
