    
      Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immunologically mediated form of lung disease, resulting
      from inhalation exposure to a large variety of antigens. For unknown reasons, a subgroup of
      patients with HP without a known inciting antigen exposure develops chronic disease with
      progressive pulmonary fibrosis (the leading cause of death). Accurately identifying patients
      at risk of disease progression is necessary for prognosis and therapy.

      Enrolled subjects will be followed for 24 months and complete 5 visits to one of the study
      centers. Blood biomarkers will be collected in addition to other clinical data to determine
      if these biomarkers can predict disease progression.
