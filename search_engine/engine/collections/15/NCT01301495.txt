      prognosis is still very poor [1-4]. At presentation, between 50-60 % of patients have
      unresectable disease [5,6]. For these patients, palliation is the goal with a particular
      focus on the relief of dysphagia, which is the major etiology of morbidity [5,6]. Presently,
      Self expanding metal stent (SEMS) have become the treatment of choice for dysphagia
      associated with unresectable esophageal and GE junction malignancies.

      In this study, a newly designed and FDA approved fully covered metal stents will be used to
      palliate 20 patients with malignant lesion of the esophagus. Dysphagia score will be assessed
      before and after treatment to confirm efficacy

      The objectives are:

        1. To evaluate if the newly fully covered metal stent , HANAROSTENT can provide adequate
           palliation of cancerous lesions of the esophagus;

        2. To determine whether it is non-inferior in efficacy and safety to the esophageal stents
           currently available at UVa with minimal complications and improvement of symptoms
