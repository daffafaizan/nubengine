      frequently prescribed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, there has been
      some evidence that prokinetics might improve PD symptom fluctuations. From this background,
      the investigators will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of DA-9701 in PD
      patients.

      In this study, 40 patients will be enrolled and randomly allocated 1:1 to receive either
      domperidone or DA-9701. The gastric function of each study participant will be evaluated
      using the MRI technique before and after 4 weeks of the treatment. The study participants
      will also be subjected to complete the gastrointestinal symptom diary before and during the
      treatment period. In addition, plasma levodopa concentrations will be determined 30 minutes
      after dose administration before and after treatment.
