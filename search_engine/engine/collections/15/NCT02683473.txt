      phenotyping in infants. The overarching aim is to complete a prospective assessment of energy
      expenditure in the new infant metabolic chamber approximately one week apart to determine the
      accuracy and precision of infant protocols related to energy metabolism (sleeping metabolic
      rate, resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis) and physical activity. This
      cross-sectional study will answer the following questions:

        1. What is the test re-test reliability of measuring energy expenditure (sleeping metabolic
           rate, resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis) in an infant under the same
           conditions, 5-7 days apart?

        2. What is the reliability of 24h energy expenditure estimated by the infant metabolic
           chamber in comparison to a 7-day doubly labeled water study?

        3. How do energy expenditure measurements in infants need to be adjusted to account for
           variability in infant size and body composition?
