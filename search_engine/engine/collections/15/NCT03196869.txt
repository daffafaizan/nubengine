      used inducing chemotherapy, cisplatin is the preferred drug for the same period
      chemotherapy.Dendritic cells (DC) play an essential role in the induction and regulation of
      immune responses.The effect of radiation and chemotherapy is closely related to the patients'
      immune function.In this study, Phase II clinical trials were performed. Patients with locally
      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were randomly divided into experimental group
      and control group. The trial group was treated with docetaxel + lorosine-induced chemotherapy
      combined with lorplatin concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The control group was
      treated with TPF Cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy, observed the relationship between
      dendritic cells subsets and clinical prognosis of patients, to provide a new method for the
      treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma and technical support
