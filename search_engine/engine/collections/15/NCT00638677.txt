      transmission of ms. Possibly xylitol delivered to infants could positively influence
      colonization/metabolism of ms. By combining in a food supplement xylitol and B. lactis BB12
      (a well known probiotic bacteria) we may be able to positively affect both gut and oral
      colonization, reflected in both dental and general health (solid data available on the latter
      aim). Though B. lactis is in wide use in baby formulas and in in vitro tests it apparently is
      safe for the teeth, no clinical studies have looked at effects of its administration to
      infants on oral health. Our study aims to look at caries occurrence in infants who have
      received the xylitol + BB12 food supplement with a pacifier.

      Recruiting of subjects to the study is completed.
