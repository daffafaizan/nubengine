      I. To evaluate the mechanism(s) of action of pioglitazone as a candidate chemopreventive
      agent for lung cancer by investigating the effects on Ki-67 defined in non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) tumor tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of pioglitazone on multiple markers listed below:

        -  Tumor tissue: caspase-3, cyclin D1, p21/Waf1, peroxisome proliferative activated
           receptor, gamma (PPARγ), mucin 1 (MUC1).

        -  Premalignant tissue: Ki-67, caspase-3, PPARγ.

        -  Histologically normal tissue: Ki-67, PPARγ. II. To evaluate the toxicity and safety of
           pioglitazone in this patient population.

      III. To analyze the expression of serum markers that are affected by pioglitazone.

      IV. To describe the effects of limited treatment with pioglitazone on tumor metabolic
      activity as determined by FDG-PET (assessed before and after a minimum of 2 weeks of
      treatment).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14-42 days.
      Patients then undergo surgery.
