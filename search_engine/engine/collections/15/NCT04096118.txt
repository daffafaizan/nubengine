      for survival rate in preoperative chemoradiation rectal cancer patients. The other secondary
      objective was to determine the relationship between total harvested lymph nodes and survival
      rate in each stage. This is a retrospective, single-centered study, collecting data of
      patients from January 2011 to December 2017. Including a total of 163 patients with rectal
      cancer who underwent surgery following neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Using Cox regression and
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine whether the lymph node ratio can be used to
      predict the survival rate and determine the cut-off value to distinguish the prognosis of the
      disease.
