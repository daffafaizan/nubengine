    
      The main criteria is the evaluation of global knee pain during the last 24 hours at D 49
      after the inclusion.

      The response to the treatment will be evaluated during the inclusion visit (V1/D0) and after
      6 weeks of treatment, during the following visit (V3/D49).

      The level of the global pain of the patient during the last 24 hours will be collected by
      investigators with a VAS (0 mm = no pain ; 100mm = maximun pain) at each visit.
