      relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and inhibition of cellular proliferation.
      Studies in the Cardiology Branch have demonstrated that nitric oxide activity is reduced in
      the coronary and peripheral vasculature of patients with atherosclerosis and in those with
      risk factors for atherosclerosis. Bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, may be an
      important modulator of vascular tone in vivo because it is tonically produced by the
      endothelium. Bradykinin is inactivated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) that is found
      on the endothelial cell surface. The activity of plasma ACE is variable among individuals and
      is at least partly genetically determined. ACE activity may modulate the local vascular
      effects of bradykinin, and thus, ACE inhibitors would be expected to improve
      endothelium-dependent responses in patients with higher tissue ACE activity.

      This protocol is designed to determine 1) the role of bradykinin in stimulating nitric oxide
      release in the human coronary and peripheral vasculature; 2) whether ACE inhibitors improve
      bradykinin-induced vasodilation, and if so, whether this occurs as a result of
      endothelium-dependent release of nitric oxide; 3) whether ACE inhibitors improve the abnormal
      shear-induced coronary vasodilation in patients with normal coronary arteries and those with
      coronary artery disease; 4) whether ACE inhibitors and bradykinin affect platelet function;
      5) whether the vascular responses to ACE inhibition and bradykinin depend on the ACE
      genotype.
