      intervention for low-income patients recently hospitalized with heart failure relative to
      providing education alone (both strategies are described in detail in the Intervention
      section below). The investigators refer to their novel intervention strategy as 'Enhanced
      Training' and their education-only strategy the investigators refer to as 'Enhanced
      Education'. These two strategies of participant follow-up will be assessed and compared by
      analyzing patient's all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year follow-up period (the
      investigators note that, for patients with heart failure, the average number of such
      all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year period has tripled over the past 25 years). The
      Enhanced Training strategy aims to improve patient receipt of evidence-based therapy by: 1)
      activating patients using a culturally sensitive approach that might better resonate with the
      investigators predominantly urban, African-American and Hispanic, target population; 2)
      providing timely and useful information to the primary care provider; and 3) promoting
      effective communication between patients and their primary care provider. The Enhanced
      Education strategy is less intrusive and aims to provide patients and primary care providers
      with appropriate educational materials via mail. The primary aims of this research study are
      to determine if Enhanced Training and/or Enhanced Education will improve: patient adherence
      to drug therapy and salt restriction, health care provider adherence to evidence-based
      guidelines, and patient functional capacity and quality of life. Secondary aims will include
      assessing impact of the interventions on CRP and BNP, which are two key biomarkers of heart
      failure progression.
