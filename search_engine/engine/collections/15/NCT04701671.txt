      and related neural substrates, and the developmental course of weight gain and LOC eating
      from middle childhood through early adolescence. Specific aims are to:

        1. Investigate prospective associations between general and food-specific EF and z-BMI
           trajectories. We expect that across risk groups, a) poorer baseline performance on both
           general and food-specific behavioral EF measures will predict steeper z-BMI gain
           trajectories; and b) worsening general and food-specific EF will track with the steepest
           z-BMI gain trajectories.

        2. Investigate associations between general and food-specific EF and LOC eating
           trajectories. We expect that across risk groups, a) poorer baseline performance on
           general and food-specific behavioral EF measures will predict worsening course of LOC
           eating; and b) worsening general and food-specific EF will track with worsening course
           of LOC eating.

        3. Investigate prospective associations between EF neural substrates and trajectories of
           z-BMI and LOC eating. We expect that across risk groups, a) greater activation in
           prefrontal regions associated with EF (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal
           cingulate, parietal cortex) during general and food-specific WM tasks, and b) smaller
           decreases in activation of these regions over 18 months, will predict steeper z-BMI gain
           trajectories and worsening course of LOC eating.
