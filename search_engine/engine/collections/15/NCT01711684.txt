      DPCP gel composition as a topical immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cutaneous
      metastases. This study is investigator initiated, carried out only at Rockefeller University
      and the Sponsor holds the IND and is providing the test agent. The products to be evaluated
      are 0.4% DPCP, in a non-volatile gel vehicle, and 0.04% DPCP in the same gel vehicle applied
      to the target lesions biweekly for 14 weeks. It is our goal to apply the study drug to all
      cutaneous metastatic lesions, but at the Investigator's discretion, certain lesions will be
      avoided if they are in particularly difficult locations such as around the eyes or on the
      lips. The estimated duration of the study is 142 days with 112 days of treatment followed by
      subject examination on Day 142. If DPCP is shown to cause resolution of lesions by this
      visit, there will be the possibility of continuing DPCP use as long as study medication
      continues to be provided to The Rockefeller University.
