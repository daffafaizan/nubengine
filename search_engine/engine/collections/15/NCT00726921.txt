      real time perfusion (DSE with RTCE) and coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) to
      detect anatomically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) as defined by quantitative
      coronary angiography in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients Secondary: To identify which
      of these tests is most predictive of patient outcomes.

      This will be a pilot study enrolling 75 participants. This is based off obtaining 80% power
      and a 90% rectangular confidence region for sensitivity and specificity using one-sided
      confidence limits, this corresponds to two 95% univariate confidence intervals (one for
      sensitivity and one for specificity). With 73 patients screened in total there will be 80%
      power to form a 90% rectangular confidence region around 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity,
      excluding sensitivities less than 69% and specificities less than 73%. We believe the
      sensitivities and specificities of both DSE with RTCE and cCTA will be within these
      confidence regions.
