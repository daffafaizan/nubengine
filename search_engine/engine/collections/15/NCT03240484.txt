      both a spinal fusion procedure and a total hip replacement. Studies have found that those who
      have received spinal fusion may have worse outcomes following a total hip replacement than
      those who have not received a spinal fusion. The information obtained from this study will
      allow surgeons and researchers to better understand why some who've had a spine fusion have
      more complications post total hip replacement compared to those who did not have spinal
      fusion surgery.
