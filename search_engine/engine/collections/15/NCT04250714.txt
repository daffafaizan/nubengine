      Cryoablation System when used to perform pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for the ablation
      treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), according to the current and future guidelines and
      product indications for use. This may include but not limited to: repeated ablations to treat
      AF, concomitant or delayed adjunctive ablation strategies with other products and use of
      different diagnostic products to validate the results such as 3D mapping systems.
