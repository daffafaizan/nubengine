      shoulder with minimal bone resection and low peripheral fracture risk, while preserving
      humeral bone stock. Non cemented head implants also allow for an easy re-intervention if
      needed. The success of resurfacing implants largely depends on the etiology, with the best
      results in primary shoulder arthrosis, and the worst in post-traumatic and cuff-tear
      arthropathy.

      The Aequalis® Resurfacing Humeral Head is designed to restore the humeral head. It shares the
      same indications as shoulder arthroplasty in general, including the various types of
      arthritis and conditions resulting in loss of joint cartilage, joint incongruity, pain, and
      stiffness. Resurfacing humeral head implants allow minimal bone resection while preserving
      humeral bone stock as compared to standard anatomic humeral implants.

      However, few data are available on mid-term effects of the resurfacing head implant developed
      by Tornier. This Post-Marketing study is implemented for the Aequalis® Resurfacing Head in
      shoulder arthroplasty to collect medium and long-term clinical data on performance and
      safety. It is designed to collect data from consecutive series in European patients for at
      least 12 months of follow-up and up to 10 years. If possible, the study duration and
      collection of information will be prolonged. Further follow-up can be implemented, by
      amendments.
