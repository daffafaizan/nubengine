      ,000 gastric cancer-related deaths by gastric cancer in 2012. The studies from Japan and
      Korea have found gastric cancer screening, especially of the mass population, reduces
      mortality from gastric cancer, but the data is seldom in China. The ways include radiographic
      and endoscopic screening, although those methods were shown to reduce gastric cancer
      mortality, and was recommended as gold standard for population-based screening by Japan and
      Korea, but many problems have been pointed out: A serious drawback is low uptake of the
      target population; fear for radiation exposure(0.6 mSv), swallowing unpleasantness due to the
      use of barium meal, accidental fall during the examination and constipation, causing rare but
      more serious complications such as intestinal obstruction or diverticulitis after examination
      may account for the reasons for this low uptake, endoscopic screening is labor-intensive,
      more costly per examination as complete disinfection of the scope is mandatory, and requires
      a large number of well-trained experienced endoscopists.

      Serological method, so-called ABC method , has been useful as gastric cancer preliminary
      screening in some areas, such as China, Japan and Korea. The major reasons are attributed to
      its simplicity, safety (radiation-free, discomfort free), and cost-efficiency. The ABC method
      is a blood test to stratify the risk of gastric cancer using the combination of H. pylori
      antibody and pepsinogen I and II, that was documented by large-scale studies in Japan. But
      the data was short in China, especially in the community.
