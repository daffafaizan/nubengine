      hallmark of altered protein metabolism in muscle of humans with obesity. The most striking
      feature of this, is a characteristic reduction in the content of the slow MHC-I isoform,
      which is responsible for determining the content of Type I muscle fibers. These fibers are
      characterized by increased capacity for glucose uptake, and in contrast to Type II fibers,
      maintain sensitivity to fuel metabolism within the adverse metabolic environment of obesity.
      Increased content of Type I fibers in skeletal muscle, and thus favorable metabolic effects
      in muscle, require increased expression of MHC-I in muscle. Importantly, the slow MHC-I gene
      drives the molecular mechanisms that determine the overall MHC protein metabolism and fiber
      type phenotype in skeletal muscle. The project seeks to determine the underlying biology that
      sustains distorted MHC protein metabolism in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity.

      The investigators evaluate protein metabolism in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity and
      lean controls, and focus specifically on that of MHC isoforms. The investigators determine
      gene expression of the MHC isoforms and associated molecular factors implicated in activating
      Type I muscle fiber programming. Acute aerobic exercise and increase in plasma amino acids
      are employed as experimental tools to target biological processes of transcription and
      translation related to MHC genes expression in skeletal muscle. The overall findings will
      provide an understanding of mechanisms responsible for unfavorable MHC proteome and fiber
      type phenotype in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity.
