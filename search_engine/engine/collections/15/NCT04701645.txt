      measure local intratumor response to chemotherapy and other clinically relevant drugs in
      ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

      Participants with suspected or confirmed ovarian cancer whose treatment plan includes surgery
      as a component of standard-of-care treatment will be identified.

      -The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow-up.

      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is: implantable microdevice

        -  Participant will undergo percutaneous placement of several microdevices in a selected
           tumor deposit prior to surgery. The microdevices will dwell in the tumor tissue for
           approximately 24 +/- 8 hours to allow time for tissue effects of the drugs in the
           microdevice reservoirs. Microdevices will then be removed by resection of the tumor mass
           during a previously planned, and clinically indicated, surgical procedure.

        -  It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this microdevice. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the
      microdevice as a tool to identify which cancer treatment is best for any disease.
