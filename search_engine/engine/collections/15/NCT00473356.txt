      effectively a nutritional supplement, Juven, helps people keep lean muscle mass (the amount
      of muscle tissue in your body) and sustain weight loss after gastric bypass surgery. Abbott
      laboratories, the manufacturer of Juven, sponsors this research study. Juven is commercially
      available without prescription in the United States.

      If you decide to participate, you will have a DEXA scan to check your lean body mass, an
      indirect calorimetry (your breath is collected for a period of time and is analyzed) test to
      check your basal metabolic rate (how much energy your body uses at rest), and a blood test to
      check your certain hormone made by your intestines (bowel or guts). Each of these tests will
      be run on you three times. Once, before your gastric bypass surgery, once 2 weeks after your
      surgery and once two months after your surgery.

      If you qualify for the study, you will be randomly (like the flip of a coin) assigned by a
      computer to receive either Juven twice a day by mouth, or to continue with standard care.

      As part of your normal post-operative instructions, you should avoid becoming pregnant for
      two years after your surgery. Acceptable forms of birth control after gastric bypass include
      barrier methods (condoms, diaphragm, etc.), Depo-Provera (the shot) and Nuva-Ring (Vaginal
      ring). The birth control pill is not as reliable after gastric bypass because its absorption
      is unpredictable. The effects of Juven in pregnant women have not been tested. If you should
      become pregnant, you should stop taking Juven and notify Dr. Clements or his staff.
