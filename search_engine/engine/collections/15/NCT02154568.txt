      Department of Defense (DoD) is studying airflow in the lungs using computational fluid
      dynamics in order to characterize disease-specific airflow patterns and provide useful
      information for medical applications. To validate these models, they are seeking to obtain
      experimental data of airflow in human lungs, both healthy and diseased. An assessment of
      airflow can be obtained by using hyperpolarized noble gas (HNG) magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) or, more specifically, hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe) MRI in conjunction with
      flow-encoding schemes that are well-established in conventional proton MRI

      Four chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and four healthy subjects will
      undergo pulmonary function tests (PFTs), computed tomography (CT) scan covering the mouth,
      neck, and chest, and hyperpolarized helium 3 MRI. Before and after the MRI scans, three
      spirometry readings will be taken while the subject is lying in the same position as in the
      MR scanners. Data will be analyzed by the BHSAI. UVa will provide the de-identified raw image
      data and the de-identified results of the spirometry and other tests to BHSAI
