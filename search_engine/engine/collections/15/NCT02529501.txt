      among a representative sample of anesthesiologists.

      The factors influencing the choice of anesthesia (spinal anesthesia or short general
      anesthesia) will be assessed in patients undergoing an outpatient surgery. Data will be
      collected by the physician during the inclusion visit (peripostoperative consultation).
      Additional data regarding the patient's perception (pain and satisfaction) will be collected
      using a self-questionnaire 7 days after the surgery.
