      They will be randomized to have cortical ovarian biopsies taken from either the left or right
      ovary. The biopsies will be fragmented in 1x1 mm2 pieces and immediately auto-transplanted in
      a peritoneal pocket under the right ovary.

      The contralateral untouched ovary will act as the control, making each woman their own
      control.

      Follow up: each week in 2,5 months the women will be assessed by transvaginal ultrasound and
      hormonal status. After 2,5-6 months the women will receive a FSH stimulation cycle (rFSH 300
      IU or Corifollitropin) followed by standard IVF/ICSI,

      Hypothesis: the ovaries contain a pool of resting primordial follicles. By fragmentation of
      cortical ovarian tissue, manipulation of the local environment in the tissue will inhibit the
      Hippo Pathway and hereby active recruitment and growth of primordial follicles.
