    
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, phase 3 study. Patients that have
      been treated with Copaxone for at least 6 months at the screening visit will be randomised
      for treatment with simvastatin or placebo as an add-on to their Copaxone treatment. Patients
      will start treatment with 40 mg peroral simvastatin daily (or an apparently identical
      placebo) for one month. Hereafter, patients will escalate dosage to 80 mg daily. The patients
      will be examined clinically at screening, baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Blood samples
      for immunology will be performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Blood samples for
      safety assessments will be performed at all study visits. MRI will be performed (T1-weighted
      and T2-weighted) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.
