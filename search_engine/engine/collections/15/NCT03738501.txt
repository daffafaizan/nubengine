      bronchiolitis is the first reason of children hospitalisation worldwide. Symptoms are based
      on airway inflammation associated to an increased mucus production and cell necrosis leading
      to a multifactorial airway obstruction. Recommended treatments are supportive care based on
      oxygenation and rehydration. Airway clearance techniques represented by chest physiotherapy
      remain controversial.

      Considering that bronchiolitis impacts respiratory condition in young infants feeding and
      sleep may be reduced. Evaluating quality of life represented by feeding and sleep in
      hospitalized infants may be an important outcome in this population.

      The investigators hypothesized that chest physiotherapy with SET will improve children's
      quality of life, especially 24 hours food intake and sleep.
