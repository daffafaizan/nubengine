      heart rate and uterine activity will be monitored in all patients. Cervical dilation is
      assigned by admitting physicians. Sonography will be performed to document fetal
      presentation.

      Upon admission to the labor and delivery floor, patients meeting inclusion criteria and no
      exclusion criteria will be consented. There will be no monetary incentives for participation.

      Patients will be randomized to either Propranolol 2mg of IV or placebo at the time of
      induction. Maternal vitals will be collected per standard labor management.

      Episodes of uterine activity that are deemed excessive by the physician will be treated with
      a standard combination of maneuvers that included a change in maternal position, oxygen
      administration, and terbutaline 250 Âµg subcutaneously. Persistent abnormal fetal heart rate
      patterns resulted in intervention by removing the patient from the study. Urgent cesarean
      delivery is defined as a cesarean delivery performed during the ripening process for abnormal
      fetal heart rate that did not respond to standard maneuvers.
