      elderly population are affected. Patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, first
      and second line therapy with behavioral modifications and pharmacotherapy are offered
      additional treatment options. Third line therapy involves injection of onabotulinumtoxinA
      (BotoxÂ©, Allergen) into the bladder detrusor muscle.

      Botox was approved for use for the diagnosis of OAB in 2013. Cincinnati Urogynecology
      Associates (CUA), TriHealth Inc. has incorporated intravesical Botox injections into the
      management algorithm for refractory OAB, since 2014. Currently, patients who fail to improve
      after a trial of first and second line therapy are offered treatment with Botox.

      The standard practice is to request patients return to the office for a routine PVR
      measurement using straight catheterization within approximately two-four weeks following
      their Botox injection. This is done regardless if patients are exhibiting symptoms of urinary
      retention. Patients with an elevated PVR are treated with CISC if they are symptomatic.

      Nevertheless, many studies suggest that patients are accurately able to self-identify
      symptoms of urinary retention, and treating asymptomatic urinary retention may not be
      necessary.

      The investigators aim to describe how many patients with PVR >200mL had symptoms following
      intravesical injection of Botox for OAB.
