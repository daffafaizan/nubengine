      inferring what a pronoun refers to, or inferring why a protagonist in a story did something
      based on information distributed through the text). These skills develop in the preschool
      years and are demonstrated when children make sense of stories that are read to them. While
      important for later reading ability and academic success, relatively little is known about
      whether anything can be done to improve inference-making skills in the preschool years. One
      possibility is that parent-child book reading would help. During book reading, some parents
      naturally ask their children questions about the story that would require them to make
      inferences about the text. The current study is designed to test whether doing this promotes
      children's ability to make inferences. Half the parents in this study will be given books
      with inference eliciting questions added to them and will be provided with training about how
      to ask these questions and respond to their children's answers. The other half of the parents
      will be given a maths exercise book and asked to spend the same amount of time per day
      working through this.
