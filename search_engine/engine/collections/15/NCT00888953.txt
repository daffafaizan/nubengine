      residents each year. Up to 10% of fallers require hospitalization or suffer a fracture.
      Psychological consequences affects between 20 and 80% of fallers, which suffer a lack of
      self-confidence that leads to reduction of activities and an increase of the dependence in
      activities of daily living.

      Not all the residents have the same risk, and each person can have more than one risk factor
      that can be identified (previous falls, self confidence, weakness, gait disorders, dizziness,
      cognitive impairment, etc).

      Identification of risk factors is the first step to reduce falls, but is not enough by
      itself. For this reason, interventions directed towards the correction of identified risk
      factors are required. In this setting, multifactorial interventions are the most successful
      to reduce falls numbers and its consequences.

      As individual randomization of residents presents important inconveniences (group
      contamination, control arm residents could felt discriminated), we will randomized nursing
      homes to each group.
