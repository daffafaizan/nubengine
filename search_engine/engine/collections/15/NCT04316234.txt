      causing passive vape exposure for present individuals. Little is known about the potential
      adverse health effects of passive vape, and people with respiratory diseases may be more
      susceptible.

      Aim: to investigate local and systemic effects of short-term passive exposure to vape from
      e-cigarettes among patients with mild or moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD).

      Design: In a randomised double-blinded cross-over study non-smoking COPD patients were
      exposed for four hours at two different exposure conditions separated by 14 days; A) clean
      filtered air and B) passive vaping under controlled environmental conditions.

      Measurements: TSI P-TRAK Ultrafine Particle Counter was used for particle counts. Health
      effects, including lung function (FEV1/FVC) and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were
      evaluated in relation to local and systemic effects prior to, right after and 24 h. after
      exposure.

      Analysis: Mixed methods approach taking both time and exposure into account.
