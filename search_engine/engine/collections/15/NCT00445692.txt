      I. Evaluate the toxicity of the use of lenalidomide/biaxin (clarithromycin)/dexamethasone as
      maintenance therapy after autologous/syngeneic transplant.

      II. Evaluate the median time to disease progression. III. Evaluate survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive clarithromycin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and dexamethasone PO once a
      week. Treatment with clarithromycin and dexamethasone continues for up to 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive lenalidomide
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Courses with lenalidomide repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *After one year of treatment, dexamethasone is tapered for an additional 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
