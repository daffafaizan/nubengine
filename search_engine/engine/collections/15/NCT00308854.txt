      Actinic keratoses occur most commonly in fair skin, especially in the elderly. They mainly
      occur in sun-exposed skin areas like head and hands. It is standard of care to remove AK when
      diagnosed, which can be achieved by either physical ablation, chemotherapeutic agents or
      photodynamic therapy (PDT). A direct comparison versus placebo which is necessary for the
      exact quantification of the effect of PD P 506 A has not yet been performed and is subject of
      this study protocol.
