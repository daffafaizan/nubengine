      transplantation (HSCT) have been well documented. Most commonly patients present with
      congestive heart failure and/or pericarditis after receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide,
      total body irradiation (TBI) or other intensive conditioning / preparative regimens prior to
      the allogeneic transplant. The majority of the data in the medical literature suggests that
      the rate of serious cardiac events appears to be relatively low at approximately 5% or less.
      Recently, there appears to have been a cluster of patient cases (approximately 15) of
      significant cardiomyopathy in patients who have received an allogeneic HSCT at the NIH
      Clinical Center over the past year. These cases have been consulted on by the Cardiology
      consult service and have included both NCI and NHLBI protocol patients. This cluster of cases
      has prompted concern that the incidence of cardiac toxicity recently seen at the NIH Clinical
      Center is not consistent with the reported incidence of significant cardiac toxicity in the
      medical literature.

      The proposed retrospective chart review is intended to further define the incidence of
      cardiac toxicity, primarily focusing on cardiomyopathy. The project is an initial step to
      consolidate the data from both the NCI and NHLBI transplant programs and clarify the
      documented cardiac toxicities, the incidence, and the demographics of the patient
      populations. We also plan to document the presence or absence of a variety of known and
      suspected risk factors for cardiotoxicity. This analysis will only be preliminary but will
      potentially lead to more formal prospective studies on cardiotoxicity related to allogeneic
      HSCT.
