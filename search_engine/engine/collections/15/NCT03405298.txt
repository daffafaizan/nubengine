      developed to address specific goals for Medicaid policies, procedures, and model programs for
      Medicaid Recipients in Michigan.

      Benzodiazepine use in the United States is common and increases with age, used by 8.7% of
      patients aged 65-80 years. Benzodiazepines-which include well-known medications such as
      Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin-are most commonly used for anxiety and insomnia, even though
      psychotherapy and alternative medications are now recommended preferentially over
      benzodiazepines. Use is a particular concern among older adults, given the links between
      benzodiazepine prescribing and a variety of adverse outcomes including falls, fractures and
      motor vehicle accidents.

      Attempts to reduce benzodiazepine use have met with limited success in the real world, as
      patients are reluctant to consider the possibility of stopping them and providers are
      reluctant to even suggest the possibility. In the course of a brief return visit in primary
      care, providers simply do not have the time or incentive to engage in a potentially
      difficult, lengthy discussion with patients about reducing or stopping their benzodiazepine.

      The goal of this project is to evaluate direct patient education compared to direct patient
      education paired with additional support and encouragement from a care manager in order to
      reduce chronic benzodiazepine use. Strategies to help reduce benzodiazepine use are of great
      interest to providers and our findings would have significance for all providers, and may
      even conceivably improve the care of patient both inside and outside the Medicaid program.
