        -  Develop and evaluate 2 "Motivational Relapse Prevention" (MRP) treatments of varying
           intensity for reducing postpartum smoking relapse among pregnant women who quit smoking
           during pregnancy.

        -  Assess MRP and Enhanced MRP (MRP+) effects on treatment mechanisms and the role of those
           mechanisms in mediating MRP and MRP+ effects on abstinence.

        -  Assess the cost-effectiveness of both the MRP and MRP+ treatments relative to each other
           and to usual care for reducing postpartum smoking relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (usual care [UC]): Participants receive self-help materials and brief relapse
           prevention advice based on the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice
           Guideline.

        -  Arm II (motivational relapse prevention [MRP]): Participants receive the same
           intervention as in arm I. Participants also undergo telephone counseling over 30 minutes
           at 34 and 36 weeks gestation and then at 2, 4, 7, and 16 weeks postpartum.

        -  Arm III (enhanced MRP [MRP+]): Participants receive the same intervention as in arm I
           and telephone counseling as in arm II. Participants also undergo in-person counseling
           over 1 hour at 30-33 weeks gestation and then at 8 weeks postpartum.

      Participants in all arms complete questionnaires at baseline, at 30-33 weeks gestation, and
      then at 8 and 26 weeks postpartum.

      Participants are followed at 8 and 26 weeks postpartum.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 participants will be accrued for this study.
