      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of trametinib in combination with navitoclax,
      and the maximal doses at which both drugs can be safely administered together. (Phase Ib) II.
      To determine the response rate of the combination of trametinib and navitoclax in subjects
      with KRAS or NRAS mutation-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors in disease-specific
      expansion cohorts. (Phase II) III. To confirm the safety and tolerability of trametinib and
      navitoclax in combination at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in the Phase 1b
      portion. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of both drugs administered together. (Phase Ib) II. To
      assess for evidence of response to therapy. (Phase Ib) III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      response to therapy in tumor biopsies. (Phase Ib) IV. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      response to therapy in tumor biopsies (first 15 patients enrolled overall). (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and navitoclax PO QD on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      If unacceptable toxicity is observed, patients may receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
