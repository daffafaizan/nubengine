      all supraglottic airway devices.

      Fasting from midnight the day before surgery, and when the patient enters the operating room,
      a blood pressure monitor, electrocardiogram, pulse saturator is mounted, and baseline blood
      pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate are recorded. As an anesthesia-inducing facial
      mask, it provides 100% of 4-6L/min of oxygen. Propofol is administered at 2 mg/kg, and after
      the patient's self-breathing is lost, 5% sevoflurane is supplied for 3 minutes to deepen the
      depth of anesthesia. After inserting the appropriate size of supraglottic airway (i-gel)
      according to the patient's weight, the esophageal temperature probe is inserted through the
      gastric lumen to the end of the supraglottic airway device i-gel. After 10 minutes, when the
      body temperature measurement measured in the esophagus stabilizes, the body temperature is
      measured at the tympanic membrane and temporal artery at 10-minute intervals. For the
      objectivity of body temperature measurement, the same operator performs it, and the left and
      right sides of the tympanic membrane can be measured differently, so both sides are measured
      and averaged. After Tourniquet deflation, body temperature is measured and recorded every 10
      minutes from 10 minutes.
