      nervous system in preterm infants and are indicative of behavioral development. It is
      emphasized that the identification of sleep-wake patterns in preterm infants is critical to
      the detection of future disorders, early diagnosis and planning of intervention studies.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess factors affecting the maturation of sleep
      wake cycles in preterm infants by actigraphy, sleep diaries, direct observation, and aEEG.
      Our secondary objectives were to assess the neurodevelopment of these infants.

      In this study we aimed to recruit a total of 25 premature babies born between 28 to 37 weeks
      of gestational age over a six month period in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Marmara
      University Pendik Training and Research Hospital. Sleep architecture will be assessed at 32
      corrected age by actigraphy, sleep diaries, and aEEG. Simultaneous video recording and direct
      observation will be performed and sleep stages will be defined. Anderson Behavioral State
      Scale will also be applied. Philips Respironics Actiwatch-2 devices will be used. The follow
      up will be at post conceptional 40 weeks, 12 and 24 weeks corrected age. Development will be
      assessed by Bayley test and Ages and Stages Questionnaire.
