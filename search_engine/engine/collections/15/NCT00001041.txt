      with increased transmission of HIV-1 to the fetus. Slowing the progression of disease,
      reducing the titer of virus in plasma, and increasing the titer of epitope-specific antibody
      are potentially attainable goals through active immunization of the mother during pregnancy.

      Pregnant women are randomized to receive an initial injection of MN rgp120 vaccine or alum
      placebo between week 16 and week 24 of gestation, followed by monthly booster injections
      concluding at the end of pregnancy, for a total of five injections. Patients may have
      optional booster immunizations (vaccine or placebo) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after delivery.
      Mothers and infants are followed through 18 months after delivery. Per 06/94 addendum,
      patients will be contacted once or twice per year for at least 5 years to check on health
      status of patient and child. PER 12/21/94 ADDENDUM, post-partum immunizations are
      discontinued.
