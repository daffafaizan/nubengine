      disease has long been recognized. Dietary plant stanol esters have been shown to effectively
      reduce serum levels of total and LDL cholesterol. Plant stanols decrease the absorption of
      both biliary and dietary cholesterol from the small intestine and thereby reduce serum LDL
      cholesterol levels.

      This study aims to verify the effect of plant stanol esters on blood lipids. Subjects with
      elevated fasting blood lipid concentrations will be randomized to study groups. The groups
      consume yoghurt type minidrink containing plant stanol ester (2 g plant stanols per day) or
      similar minidrink without plant stanol esters. After 10 weeks study period serum total and
      lipoproteins lipids, non-cholesterol sterols and apolipoproteins will by analyzed.
