    
      The objectives of this trial are:

        -  To generate additional information about the overall safety profile,

        -  To generate safety information of hepatically or renally impaired patients, as
           appropriate, and

        -  To generate safety information when patients are also taking concomitant medications
           and/or therapies without trial restrictions when decitabine is administered at a dose of
           20 mg/m² over a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks in
           patients with MDS or AML (≥ 30% blasts).

      The purpose of this open-label, expanded-access trial is to provide decitabine to patients
      with AML or MDS who have completed participation per protocol in the DACO-018 study and for
      whom continuation of treatment with decitabine is indicated, per the opinion of the
      investigator. In order to continue treatment with decitabine, at a minimum, there must be no
      disease progression while the patient was participating in the DACO-018 trial and during the
      period after the patient discontinued from the DACO-018 study and before entering this trial.
      Patients must enroll in this trial within 8 weeks of discontinuing from the DACO-018 study
      and not have received any other chemotherapy for their disease during this interim period.

      Decitabine will be administered at a dose of 20 mg/m² over a 1-hour intravenous infusion for
      5 consecutive days every 4 weeks.
