    
      Background: Occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during IVF pregnancies has been
      reported in numerous case reports and in two small consecutive series. The incidence of VTE
      after IVF has been claimed to be comparable to the incidence of VTE during normal pregnancy.
      No information exists concerning pulmonary embolism (PE).

      Aim: The aim is to estimate and compare the risk of both PE and VTE during the trimesters of
      pregnancy after IVF to that in age and period matched control women.

      Design and methods: A cross-sectional study using linkage of Swedish population and health
      registers. The Swedish National Patient Register encompasses inpatients and outpatients.
      Inpatient data in Sweden is available nationwide since 1987. Outpatient diagnoses from
      hospitals started to be collected in 1997. Data in the Patient Register will be linked to the
      Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR) at the National Board of Health and Welfare through the
      unique personal identity number assigned to all Swedish residents, Exposed women: Mothers who
      had given birth to a child as a result of IVF will be retrieved from the Swedish IVF Register
      at the National Board of Health and Welfare. The Swedish IVF Register is now a part of the
      Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR) at the National Board of Health and Welfare and includes
      information on IVF pregnancies since 1982.

      We will restrict the retrieval to mothers of a child born as from 1990 until 2008 and who had
      their first child born after assisted reproduction by IVF.

      Unexposed women: Each IVF woman will be matched with 5 unexposed women from the MBR by
      calendar year of delivery and maternal age.

      Information will be retrieved on country of birth, pre-pregnancy body mass index, family
      situation, cigarette smoking habits, number of older siblings, singleton/multiple births, and
      estimated length of gestation from the MBR register. Dates of the trimesters is calculated
      from the length of gestation. WomenÂ´s education is found in the Register of Education,
      Statistics Sweden, by linkage through the personal identity number.

      Diagnoses of VTE including PE will be found by linkage to the Swedish Patient Register of the
      National Board of Health and Welfare. This register comprises date of admission and
      discharge, and main diagnosis with up to seven contributing diagnoses. Diagnoses are recorded
      according to the International Classification of Diagnoses (ICD), ninth version prior to 1996
      and the tenth version from 1997. Codes used were 415B, 451B, 452, 453C-D, 453W, 453X, 673C,
      671D-E, 671F in ICD9 and I260, I269, I801- 3, I808-9, I822-3, I828-9, O223, O225, O871, O873,
      O879, O882 in ICD10.

      The study is approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
      Sweden (Dnr 2010/267-31/4).
