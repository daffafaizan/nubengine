      One group will receive usual care dispensed in units (control). The other group
      (intervention) will be offered six individual assistance with health care worker physician or
      nurse) during the period of 9 months with a minimum interval of 30 days, plus 9 monthly
      visits structured by community health agents. Adherence will be measured in both groups at
      baseline and months 3, 6, 9 and 12, through validated questionnaire and pill count. Also
      evaluated clinical outcome measures (blood pressure, hospitalizations and deaths). The
      analysis will be done by intention to treat comparing adherence measures and clinical outcome
      between groups (Student t test and chi-square test) and within groups over time (paired t
      test and McNemar). It will be accepted p value <0.05.
