      and deaths each year worldwide. Because of this, additional treatments for influenza are
      needed. One potential treatment may be the use of high-titer anti-influenza immune plasma.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with high-titer
      versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma, in addition to standard care, in participants
      hospitalized with severe influenza A infection.

      This study enrolled people aged 2 weeks or older who are hospitalized with severe influenza A
      infection. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either high-titer anti-influenza
      plasma or low-titer (control) anti-influenza plasma on Day 0. In addition, all participants
      received standard care antivirals. Participants were assessed on Day 0 (baseline) and on Days
      1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28. For participants who were not hospitalized on Days 2, 14, and 28,
      researchers could contact participants by telephone. Study procedures included clinical
      assessments, blood collection, and oropharyngeal swabs.
