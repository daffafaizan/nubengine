      Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a
      quit attempt. Nicotine replacement therapy, the most widely used pharmacotherapy, yields end
      of treatment quit rates of <25% suggesting that managing nicotine withdrawal is not
      sufficient. To improve quit rates significantly, a more refined mechanistic understanding is
      needed. Neuroimaging can identify mechanisms underlying behavior change beyond self-report
      and behavioral measures. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show that brief
      (e.g., 24 hr.) abstinence from smoking produces working memory deficits associated with
      reduced neural activity in cognitive control circuits and weakened resting state functional
      connectivity. Neural reactivity to smoking cues also increases risk of relapse, and
      psychological stress can enhance neural responses to smoking cues and increase smoking
      intensity. This study will examine how abstinence-induced brain changes contribute to
      clinical outcomes in treatment-seeking smokers. Using a validated fMRI abstinence challenge
      paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre-treatment fMRI scans:
      after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. The investigators will
      examine brain responses during performance of tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity,
      and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then
      set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6 months
      to assess time to relapse using a validated smoking relapse protocol.
