      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium in
           combination with zoledronic acid or pamidronate disodium in patients with relapsed or
           refractory multiple myeloma and bone pain. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with these regimens. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of these regimens on changes in patient-reported bone pain levels.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, pilot, phase I, dose-escalation study of samarium
      Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium IV over 1 minute on day
           1. Patients also receive zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes or pamidronate disodium IV
           over 2-4 hours on day 1 and then monthly thereafter in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium at the MTD determined
           in phase I and zoledronic acid or pamidronate disodium as in phase I.

      Bone pain is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.
