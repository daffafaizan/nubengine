      placebo controlled crossover design study. Subjects were screened to determine their health
      status (e.g. height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure and medical history). Subjects
      were randomly assigned to a sequence of two treatments with two study periods. The treatments
      are frozen wild blueberries and a placebo developed to match calories and fiber of the frozen
      wild blueberries. The subjects were asked to avoid high polyphenol foods in their typical
      diet for 7 days and consume one of the two treatments as a dietary intervention. After the
      seventh day subjects consumed a test meal along with either the wild blueberry or placebo.
      Blood was collected to determine glucose and satiety hormone levels.
