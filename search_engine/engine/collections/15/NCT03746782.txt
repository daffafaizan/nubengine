      antagonist (DAPT) are regarded as the current standard of care therapy for patients with
      Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). As thrombin potently induces platelet dense granular release
      and causes secondary adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-mediated P2Y12 receptor activation,
      apixaban via inhibition of thrombin generation may exhibit synergistic activity with direct
      P2Y12 receptor blockers such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor. The results from the study will
      provide a clearer understanding of how these antithrombotic agents work in combination and
      how the anti-Xa, apixaban, may reduce the contribution of thrombin and general platelet
      reactivity when used alone and in combination with antiplatelet agents. This study does NOT
      involve administration of medication to subjects. Experiments will be performed on donated
      blood samples from participants.
