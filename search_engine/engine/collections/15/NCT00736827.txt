      dysfunction in kidney transplantation. Clinical manifestation ranges from BK viremia and
      nephritis to renal dysfunction. It has been suggested that BK virus reactivation alone is not
      sufficient to cause BK viremia and nephropathy, thus a second hit is essential for kidney
      specific damage, such as an inflammatory reaction or ischemia. Critically ill
      postoperative/posttraumatic patients via the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
      and the compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome (CARS) are at increased risk to
      develop organ dysfunctions, such as acute renal failure. CARS, reflecting
      postoperative/posttraumatic immunosuppression, may favor viral reactivation. However,
      prevalence of BK viremia in critically ill postoperative/posttraumatic patients has up to now
      not been systematically evaluated. Moreover, it is not known whether BK viremia is associated
      with a distinct biomarker pattern in these patients. Therefore, the present study is
      performed to clarify whether postoperative/posttraumatic immunosuppression is associated with
      BK viremia, and acute renal failure with BK virus reactivation, respectively.
