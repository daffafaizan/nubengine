      metastatic status. But there is a different prognosis in cancer patients of the same stage.
      The coagulation status of cancer patients was considered as an important possible prognostic
      factor. So in this study, we want to evaluate patients' coagulation status and find the
      relation of coagulation status and cancer status.

      We thus propose a prospective study using coagulation factors in order to search for the
      relationship between cancer stage and pre-coagulation status in Taiwanese lung cancer
      patients. We will also evaluate the potential use of tissue factor as a prognosis predictor
      in lung cancer patients.
