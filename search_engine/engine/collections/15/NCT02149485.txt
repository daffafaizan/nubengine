      A physical examination of the children will be performed, a swab for collection of buccal
      cells for (future) DNA methylation analysis will be taken and their cognitive and
      socioemotional development will be assessed. In the 8 years old children cardiovascular
      status will be evaluated.

      Main study parameters: general health, cognitive and socioemotional development, parent-child
      interaction and parental stress.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      The study procedure consists of filling out questionnaires by parents and a one-time visit to
      the hospital. No invasive interventions will be performed, except 1 tube of blood in the 8
      year old group. The risks associated with the study procedure are very small. The results
      provide more information about the risks of PGD to prospective parents who are considering
      PGD and to healthcare providers involved in PGD treatment.
