      pontine glioma (DIPG), the investigators examined a hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen up
      to a dose of 39Gy in 13 fractions, completed in 2.5-3 weeks, instead of 6 weeks.

      This schedule offers a reduction in patient burden, especially preferable in children with a
      poor compliance and performance status. The non-inferiority of the hypofractionated regimen
      in its clinical end-results, with the reduction of the overall treatment time to less than
      its half will decrease the burden for the patient, his/her family and the treating
      department. This will be considered as added value without compromising the survival or
      increasing side effects.
