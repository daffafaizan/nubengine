      numerous substances that act on the smooth muscle fibres. The release of these products is
      modulated, in turn, by various circulating molecules, by the autonomic nervous system and by
      local mechanical factors such as shear stress.

      The essential hypertension is associated to increased risks of cardiovascular and stroke
      morbidity and mortality and constitutes a major cause of severe kidney failure. The essential
      hypertension is a complex and multi-factorial disease; the dysfunction of the endothelium is
      of a great importance in the physiopathology of this disease, concerning both the
      consequences of the increase of the blood pressure and the possible cause of the hypertension
      development.

      The Stendo pulsating suit is expected to increase the cutaneous microcirculation measured by
      laser Doppler laser flowmetry and potentially to decrease the central blood pressure. Each
      patient will be his own witness and the clinical records will be assessed before, during when
      relevant, and after a pulsating suit session.
