      by the project coordinator (International PI). On D-Day, the local investigators will be
      asked

        1. to complete questions aiming at describing their ICU (number of beds, number of patients
           present on D-Day, type medical/surgical/other, local phosphate reference value, presence
           of an hypophosphatemia treatment protocol in the ICU and route of phosphate delivery in
           case of hypophosphatemia)

        2. to indicate how many patients had a blood phosphate <0.08 mmol/l, for each patient with
           hypophosphatemia, to record the exact lowest value on D-Day, and to record age, number
           of days in ICU on D-Day, presence (or not) of artificial nutrition and continuous renal
           replacement therapy, if any phosphate administration is ongoing Data will be recorded in
           and electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF) in REDCap, and analysed with descriptive
           statistics No outcome data will be recorded (pure point-prevalence) There is no
           intervention
