      behavioral and developmental disorders, ranging from behavioral treatment and sensory
      exposure therapy to pharmaceutical treatments. Although improvements in behavior have
      resulted from these interventions, they are limited in numerous ways. They are usually
      time-consuming, both for the child and the teacher or clinician providing the intervention.
      In order to see an effect of the intervention, most children must engage in the intervention
      procedure for several years. Moreover, the effects of most current intervention procedures
      are minimal to moderate. Pharmaceutical prescriptions are often accompanied by undesirable
      side effects that may modulate behavior, emotion, and physiological functions. The
      behavioral, neurobiological, and clinical insights gained from this project may eventually
      lead to better treatment of emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders.
