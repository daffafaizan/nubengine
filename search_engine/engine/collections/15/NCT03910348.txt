    
      Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of six months of supervised
      whole-body vibration (WBV) and high-impact (HI) exercises on bone mineral density (BMD),
      serum bone turnover markers, fall risk, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive
      symptoms in postmenopausal women, additionally, to evaluate the advantage of each training
      program to another.

      Methods: In a prospective, randomized controlled 6-month interventional trial 58 eligible
      postmenopausal women were assigned to WBV training group (n=19), HI training group (n=19), or
      control group (n=20). The patients in both training groups participated in a supervised
      training program, which consisted of the one-hour exercise session three times a week for six
      months. The WBV groups received vibration (30-35 Hz, 2-4 mm) in five different static
      positions. The HI group jumped rope (10-50 jumps/day). All patients received calcium (1000
      mg) and vitamin D (880 IU) supplementation per day. In all participants, baseline and
      six-month BMD at the lumbar spine and femur were measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry
      (DXA). Serum osteocalcin (OC) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) were
      measured at baseline, three- and six-month intervals. Fall risk was assessed by using the
      Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and fall index measured by static posturography at baseline,
      three- and six-month intervals. HRQoL and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Quality
      of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) and Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively, at baseline and six-month of the study.
