      new, safe and effective therapies to combat increasing growth. A novel Implantable Gastric
      Electrical Stimulation (GES), MEASTRO(R) Rechargeable System, has been recently approved by
      the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in weight reduction in patients aged
      18 years through adulthood who have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 to 45 kg/m2 with one or
      more obesity related co-morbid conditions, and have failed at least one supervised management
      program within the past 5 years.

      Melcap System Ltd. has developed an innovative ingestible capsule system device that uses GES
      for the treatment of overweight and obesity. The system is intended to suppress hunger,
      reduce appetite, increase satiation and promote weight reduction in overweight and class I
      obese adults who have a Body Mass Index of 27 kg/m2 to 34.9 kg/m2 with no related co-morbid
      conditions.

      The study is a FIH prospective, open label, randomized study. It will include a 3 days
      screening period and 4 days treatment session under a close supervision and follow up. Each
      subject will ingest a total of 2 capsules (ODC) on the first and the third day of the study.
      The total duration of subject participation including the termination visit will be eight
      days.

      The study will be conducted at a single medical center, Meir Hospital, Israel.
