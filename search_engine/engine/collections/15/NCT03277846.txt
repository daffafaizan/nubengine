    
      A 2x2 factor Randomized Controlled Trial with block randomization. Inpatient subjects at the
      Carrier Clinic who are referred for ECT will be recruited, typed regarding their acceptance
      of ECT, and randomized to either treatment with TES or to a Sham condition. Treatment
      non-responders in either condition will continue as in patients at the Carrier Clinic until
      they reach acceptable levels of functioning to be discharged.
