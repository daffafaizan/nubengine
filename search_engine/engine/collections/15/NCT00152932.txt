      pressure is still the only accepted form of treatment for glaucoma.

      Over the past decade, epidemiological and experimental evidence suggested that impaired
      ocular blood flow is an important risk factor with an important role in the pathogenesis of
      primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Several studies suggest that ischemia-promoting vascular
      factors may contribute to glaucomatous damage including vasospasm, impaired ocular perfusion
      pressure and general vascular disorders such as low blood pressure, especially dips in blood
      pressure at night.

      Different techniques are employed to assess vascular dysfunction in the eye. As the
      methodology of ocular blood flow assessment is complex and differs in various aspects (e.g.
      target tissue and physiological parameters), comparative studies are required in order to
      enhance the interpretation of these measurements.

      Our laboratory has state of the art equipment to assess ocular blood flow. One study done by
      us suggested that one drop of Dorzolamide 2% does not improve retinal blood flow in normal
      eyes. In the present study we plan to extend this study to 2 weeks of treatment in patients
      with POAG.

      Dorzolamide hydrochloride 2% is a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which reduces
      intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing the production of aqueous humour. Pharmacological
      studies on volunteers and glaucoma patients, using Color Doppler Imaging (measuring the
      retrobulbar blood flow) and Scanning laser Ophthalmoscopy (measuring arteriovenous passage
      time), indicate that topically applied Dorzolamide may increase perfusion of the optic nerve
      and peripapillary retina.
