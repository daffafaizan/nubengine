    
      This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of D2C7-IT, when
      delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) following confirmatory
      diagnostic biopsy in recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and IV malignant
      glioma patients, and/or to determine what dose will be considered in a phase II trial. The
      patient will remain in the hospital during the entire infusion. At the completion of the
      infusion, the catheters will be removed within 6 hours and a CT scan will be obtained after
      the catheters are pulled. The patient will be observed in hospital for a minimum of another 6
      hours.

      A two-stage continual reassessment method (CRM) design will be used to determine the MTD of
      D2C7-IT where the first stage involves dose escalation in successive patients until an
      initial dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. Cohorts of 2 patients will be accrued to
      this study within both stages of the trial. The first patient of each cohort will be observed
      through the completion of the D2C7-IT infusion, before additional patients in that cohort are
      treated. Once the optimal dose level of D2C7-IT is determined (dose escalation completed), a
      total of 27 recurrent patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients will be treated at
      that dose level as a dose expansion cohort.

      Following D2C7-IT infusion, subjects will be evaluated in clinic at 2 weeks for adverse
      events and followed at 4 and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter until 48 weeks.
