      adjuvant to general anesthesia. Postsynaptic activation of alpha2 adrenoceptors in the
      central nervous system (CNS) inhibits sympathetic activity and thus can decrease blood
      pressure and heart rate. The blockade of sympathetic activity decrease the neuroendocrine
      stress response and may decrease the incidence of hypokalemia. The hypokalemia can increase
      the incidence of arrythmia, especially in cardiac patients. We postulated that
      dexmedetomidine could decrease the neuroendocrine stress response, thus decrease arrhythmia
      during cardiac surgery. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine have been reported to have
      cardioprotective effect with previous animal studies.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether the intraoperative
      dexmedetomidine infusion can reduce the incidence of hypokalemia and arrythmia, and
      myocardial injury in subjects undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft. We are also
      trying to compare these effects with those of remifentanil infusion.
