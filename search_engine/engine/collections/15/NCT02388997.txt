    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study involving a group of 42 mild
      asthmatics. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to omalizumab (a humanized monoclonal anti-IgE
      antibody) or placebo for 8 weeks and then inoculated with rhinovirus (strain-16 produced
      under GMP conditions and approved for this research by the FDA). Clinical and laboratory
      (mechanistic) data will be evaluated for 8 weeks before and for 4 weeks after the virus
      challenge.

      The study is being done to test the hypothesis that the reduction of total free IgE in
      asthmatics treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks prior to and during an experimental RV
      challenge will lead to a significant decline in lower respiratory tract (chest) symptoms
      recorded by subjects during the first four days of infection following the challenge compared
      to lower respiratory tract symptoms recorded during the same period by asthmatic subjects who
      are treated with placebo.

      The primary endpoint will be based on the comparison of cumulative lower respiratory tract
      symptoms scores (CLRTS) in the asthmatic subjects treated with omalizumab compared to those
      treated with placebo over the first 4 days of acute infection. Diary cards will be scored
      daily for cough, shortness of breath, chest discomfort and wheezing using a modification of
      the Jackson criteria. To participate in this study, subjects must live within 90 minutes by
      car from the University of Virginia.

      Note: This protocol has been reviewed and is being monitored for safety by the NIH/NIAID
      Safety Monitoring Committee and by he IRB at the University of Virginia (IRB-HSR# 14427).
