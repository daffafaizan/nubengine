      which muscle at oropharyngeal region weakness and the recovery course of these patients are
      still unknown.

      The ultrasonography was used to measure the oropharyngeal swallowing function. The high
      resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) could be used to measure the postoperative recovery
      esophageal function.

      We aimed to observe the changes and recovery course swallowing function parameters during the
      preoperative and postoperative period in the patients receiving anterior cervical spine
      surgery by HRIM and ultrasonography. Consecutive patients who will fulfill the criteria of
      cervical spine surgery patients under general anesthesia and aged >= 20 will be enrolled. The
      patients would receive the dysphagia questionnaire. All subjects would receive the swallowing
      function by ultrasonography and HRIM before the surgeries. The cough test was also measured.
      After the surgery, the patient would be followed the swallowing function in the postoperative
      one day, 1 week, and 1 months, 3 months (If needed) by HRIM and ultrasonography.
