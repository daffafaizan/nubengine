      the lens. Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO) remains the most frequent long term
      complication. This is initiated by the migration and proliferation of residual lens
      epithelial cells from the lens equator in the space between the posterior capsule and
      intraocular lens (IOL)

      The combination of IOL material and a sharp edged design is effective in preventing PCO.
      Aurolab has developed 360 degree square edge IOL with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)

      100 bilateral senile cataract patients are going to be recruited. First group of 50 patients
      will receive square edge PMMA in one eye and round edge PMMA in fellow eye. Another group of
      50 patients will receive square edge PMMA in one eye and acrysof in fellow eye. PCO will be
      assessed during each follow up using EPCO software.
