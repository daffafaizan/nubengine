    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of NY-ESO-1 protein with MIS416 in combination with
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effectiveness of these combinatorial therapies by assessing NY-ESO-1
      specific cellular and humoral immunity: peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster of
      differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T-cells; peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies;
      peripheral blood frequency of CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T-cells; explore
      time to disease progression.

      OUTLINE:

      COHORT I (C1): Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein with MIS416 vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on
      days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, and 113 in the absence of disease progression or toxicity.

      COHORT II (C2): Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein with MIS416 vaccine as in Cohort I.
      Patients also receive sirolimus orally (PO) daily for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks off
      starting on days 1, 29, 57, and 85.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then at 12
      months.
