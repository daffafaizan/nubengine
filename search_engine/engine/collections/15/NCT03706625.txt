      biomarkers in rare but severe tumors arising in immune-suppressed compared for some tumors in
      immune-competent patients. Indeed, this tumors present a deficient immune environment, either
      due to the host acquired immune deficiency, i.e. transplantations or HIV infection, or
      because the diseased tissue belongs in an immune sanctuary as the brain. The primary
      hypothesis, in this context, is that these tumor mutational profiles and their changes during
      drug therapy must be influenced by the immune environment and response. This must lead to
      differences from similar tumors observed in immune-competent environments (immunocompetent
      individuals or tissues expressing immunity), responsible for: modification in the molecular
      targets for appropriate drugs ; alteration of tumor immunogenicity and of future immune-based
      therapies ; specific biomarkers for monitoring the response to drug therapy. The objectives
      of this program are to carry on invasive and non-invasive investigations in order to define
      the mutational profile of these free types of severe tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), lung
      cancers and gliomas arising in hosts or tissues with altered immunity. These investigations
      will lead to : identify novel invasive and non-invasive biomarkers for predicting and
      evaluating efficacy of future personalized and immune-based therapies; compare tumors from
      immune-suppressed and immune-competent hosts; discover hot spots of tumoral mutations as
      mechanisms of tumors resistance, new molecular targets for future molecular and immune-bases
      therapeutic strategies; define the tumor immunomutanome as a score of neo-epitopes
      predicting: tumor immunogenicity, disease outcome and efficacy of immunotherapies; detect
      non-invasive tumoral biomarkers from liquid biopsies based on Circulating tumoral DNA and
      Circulating tumoral Cells to facilitate future diagnosis and monitoring of such tumors;
      identify biomarkers of tumor escape or resistance to treatments.
