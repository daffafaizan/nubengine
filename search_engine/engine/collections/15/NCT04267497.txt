    
      Phase of the clinical trial Phase I trial (pilot study), prospective, randomised, controlled
      trial using a drug under conditions of use not approved for the form of administration.

      It is a Phase I study since the primary objective includes tolerance analysis, safety and
      pharmacokinetic and distribution studies of nebulized amphotericin, but when administered to
      patients it also carries out the preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of the
      treatment.

      Primary and secondary variables

      Primary variable:

      Reduction of >20% of post-nebulized FVC and FEV1 in relation to values obtained before
      nebulization.

      In each visit made during the nebulized therapy period (week 1 visit in view of week 6) the
      following parameters will be objectified: before and after nebulization:

        -  forced vital capacity (FVC)

        -  forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1) Both parameters will be measured with the
           Micro Spirometer; Micro Medical Ltd; Rochester UK). Repeat 3 times and obtain the higher
           value

      Secondary variables:

        -  Related to tolerability and safety

        -  At systemic level: Fr Resp/min: Breathing rate per minute, Fr Card/min: Heart rate per
           minute, BP (mmHg): Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Sat 02 (%): Percentage of
           oxygen saturation (digital pulse oximetry), blood test disturbances.

        -  At the pulmonary level: symptomatic cough, bronchospasm (auscultation), dyspnea or
           shortness of breath, need for bronchodilator treatment.

        -  Others: bad taste in mouth, nausea, dysphagia Given the practical absence of systemic
           passage of nebulized Ambisome confirmed in other studies, the practical absence of
           reported systemic reactions and given the high number of systemic events that these
           patients develop in relation to their underlying pathology and the use of other systemic
           treatments, adverse events of an extrapulmonary or systemic nature that are not
           considered adverse reactions (related to nebulized therapy, the object of the study)
           will not be collected for the study.

        -  related to pharmacokinetics

        -  Concentration of amphotericin in bronchoalveolar lavage

        -  Plasma amphotericin concentration Related to Effectiveness

        -  Radiological efficacy (including PET-CT control): Image response and PET-CT performance:
           Quantification of SUV metabolic uptake index in a combined positron emission tomography
           (PET-CT).

        -  Microbiological efficacy in BAL: Microbiological response in bronchoalveolar lavage
           (BAL): Comparison of results of calcofluor staining, fungal culture, galactomannan,
           BDGlucan and Aspergillus PCR of BAL samples obtained by fibrobronchoscopy

        -  Serum microbiological response: Comparison of results for galactomannan and BDGlucan in
           serum during the weeks of study follow-up
