    
      This is a single-center randomized controlled trial study to verify the effect of drinking
      water on renal function after PA surgery treatment and to follow up the clinical outcomes. We
      will take short-term follow-up on whether increasing water intake can improve eGFR decline in
      the early stage of PA patients after surgical treatment and further long-term follow-up to
      investigate whether increasing drinking water has long-term memory effect to slow down renal
      function deterioration and improve clinical outcomes. This study will be completed in 1 year.
