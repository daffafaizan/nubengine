      indirect calorimetry, and on appetite using visual analogue scales (VAS). The planned sample
      size is 54 healthy male and female adults, both lean and overweight. We plan to test 6
      metabolism-boosting beverages in the following order: 1) Raspberry Tea 2) Banana Shake 3)
      Chai Latte 4) Strawberry Shake 5) Cappuccino 6) Hot Cocoa. In the order that they are
      screened, each subject will be assigned to receive 1 of 6 Metabolism-boosting beverages. Each
      MBB will contain 90 mg EGCG and 100 mg caffeine.
