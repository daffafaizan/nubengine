      regime of vancomycin is leading to the appropriate pharmacokinetic targets in pediatric
      patients. Therefore data will be collected from all pediatric patients hospitalized in
      University Hospitals Leuven between January 2012 and April 2014 who were treated with
      vancomycine. Patient files will be screened for relevant information. Individual patients can
      be included multiple times if vancomycin has been administered more than once.
