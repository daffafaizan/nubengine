    
      This study consists of two parts: a Phase 1A dose escalation to identify the MTD and the RD
      of ETC-1907206 administered in combination with dasatinib and a Phase 1B expansion at the RD.

      Phase 1A: A dose escalation with an adaptive design model using ordinal continual
      reassessment method (oCRM) will be used to characterise the dose toxicity curve of
      ETC-1907206 when administered orally every other day (EOD) under fasted conditions in
      combination with oral once daily dasatinib (per locally approved product prescribing
      instructions) in order to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD)
      for Phase 1B.

      Phase 1B: Open-label, non-randomised, to assess preliminary clinical activity and safety of
      ETC-1907206 administered orally EOD under fasted conditions at the RD identified in Phase 1A,
      in combination with dasatinib (per locally approved product prescribing instructions).

      Patients will continue in the study until disease progression, the start of new anti-cancer
      therapy, unacceptable toxicity, death, or the completion of 12 separate 4-week treatment
      cycles, whichever occurs first.

      As long as the Sponsor agrees to continue treatment, patients who complete 12 cycles of
      treatment and have no evidence of disease progression are allowed to continue on treatment
      past the end of treatment (EOT) visit until there is disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, the patient decides to withdraw, or it is judged not to be in the patient's
      interest to continue on the study.

      Malignancy assessments of the underlying disease at enrolment (blood and bone marrow),
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling
      for ETC-1907206 and dasatinib, sample collection for ETC-1907206 and dasatinib biomarker
      analysis, and safety and tolerability assessments will be performed during the study.
