      infarction will be evaluated for eligibility in this study. Eligible subjects will undergo
      standard treatment after admission to the hospital and will then undergo liposuction under
      local anesthesia, after which ADRC's will be isolated from the lipoaspirate. According to
      randomization subjects will receive either ADRC's or placebo.
