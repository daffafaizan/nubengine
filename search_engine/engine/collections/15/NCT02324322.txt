      therefore, there is a definite need to further understand the mechanism of breakdown in the
      musculoskeletal system after a SCI, and, more importantly, find a clinical strategy that will
      treat muscle and bone loss.

      This pilot research grant will collect results that will be used for the design of a
      multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether a Robotic Exoskeleton
      training [100 sessions; 1hr/session; 4-5 sessions/week] can improve musculoskeletal outcomes
      more than other current interventions. If the overall objective is to use the progression of
      technology to enhance functional ambulation for persons with a spinal cord injury, then the
      investigators need to evaluate the health benefits associated with continual use of the
      device.

      The study will be a prospective, single-group, repeated measure design using a 2 -month lead
      in to establish stability, 5-month intervention phase and 2 -month follow-up phase for
      retention will be performed. Each participant will be used as his or her own control. This
      project will be completed at two sites: Kessler Foundation will be the lead site that will be
      under the direction of Dr. Gail F Forrest (Principal Investigator) and Spinal Cord Damage
      Research Center, James J Peters VA Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Ann M. Spungen
      (collaborator). Both sites have exoskeletal-assisted walking programs.
