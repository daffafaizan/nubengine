      study will investigate the effectiveness of a conservative treatment approach for chronic
      LBP. To this point few treatment approaches specifically address the resolution of underlying
      pathologies leading to a high probability of recurrence of LBP. Further, current treatment
      options for lumbar disc pathology have been of limited demonstrated effectiveness. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether a non-surgical therapeutic approach designed to
      effect intervertebral widening and allow for reduction of disc protrusion will reduce
      patients' pain and improve their activity levels.

      The study will assess whether a computer-assisted traction treatment [decompression] protocol
      results in improvement in patient pain levels and daily activity levels. Further, to
      determine if such treatment results in intervertebral widening and reduction of any disc
      protrusions as demonstrated by direct imaging of the lumbar spine. A double-blind (treatment
      vs. sham treatment) design will be employed

      Specific Aims To study the effectiveness of decompression therapy for LBP patients with
      lumbar disc herniation and degenerative disc problems.

      To demonstrate that decompression therapy for LBP patients results in a demonstrated
      reduction in levels of reported pain.

      To demonstrate that decompression therapy for LBP patients results in a demonstrated greater
      return to daily activities.

      To demonstrate that decompression therapy for LBP patients results in increased
      intervertebral space and reduced disk protrusion (if present) as measured by MRI.
