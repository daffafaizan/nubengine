      Protocol of number: preACLF2011 Title: A randomized, open label study evaluating the efficacy
      and safety of glucocorticoids in patients with HBV associated pre-ACLF.

      Sponsor: Department of infectious diseases, Southwest Hospital.

      Indication: HBV associated acute-on-chronic pre-liver failure(pre-ACLF-HBV).

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids in patients with
      pre-ACLF-HBV.

      Trial Design: Randomized, open label study. Patients with pre-ACLF-HBV will be randomized 1:1
      to one of the two groups: A)10mg dexamethasone were intravenously injected po daily for the
      first 5 days, in combination with continued lamivudine 100mg po daily and traditional
      supporting treatments for 13 weeks. B)Any glucocorticoids will be not given in all patients.
      Continued lamivudine 100mg po daily and traditional supporting treatments will be given for
      13 weeks.

      Number of patients: Approximate number of patients to be randomized: N=200 (100 patients in
      each group)

      Length of study: Screening period: 3 days; treatment period: 13 weeks.

      Duration of study: 30 months after first patient randomized, including an recruitment period
      of 26 months.

      Investigational treated regimen: Short-term glucocorticoids treatment (10mg dexamethasone,
      iv, once day for the first 5 days).

      Concomitant and comparative regimen treatments: Lamivudine 100mg po daily, traditional
      supporting treatments including: ①Transfusion of magnesium glycyrrhizinate injection (200mg,
      1/d) and reduced glutathione (1200mg, 1/d); ②S-adenosyl-L- methionine (500 mg, intravenously,
      2/d); ③Transfusion of human albumin (10 g, twice a week) and fresh frozen plasma (200 ml,
      twice a week); ④Nutritional supplements and prophylactic therapies for various complications
      being given.

      Assessments of efficacy: Primary endpoint: the survival rate at week 13. Secondary endpoint:
      ①The levels of serum T-Bil ≤51.3µmol/L; ②PTA >80%.

      Safety:Adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory tests.

      Procedures(summary): After signing informed consent and meeting screening parameters,
      patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups as described under trial
      design above. After randomization patients will be seen for evaluation at days
      5,10,14,21,28,42,56,70,84,91.

      Statistical analysis Assume 1:1 randomization. The sample size is calculated for the primary
      efficacy variable, the survival rate. Assuming the survival rate equals to: 90% for group A
      and 50% for group B. 100 patients in each group are required to yield a 80% chance of
      detecting such a difference when a two-tailed test is employed at the 0.05 significance
      levels. Every eligible subject will be assigned with a randomization code and receive one of
      the two treatments, according to the sequence of enrolled.
