      temozolomide in combination with O6-BG in patients with temozolomide-resistant anaplastic
      glioma.

      Forty-one to 104 evaluable patients with temozolomide-resistant anaplastic glioma will be
      enrolled in this study. Total accrual on this study will not exceed 116 patients. The
      patients will receive daily temozolomide on 5 consecutive days (days 1-5) along with bolus
      infusions of O6-BG on days 1, 3, and 5 and a continuous infusion of O6-BG beginning
      immediately after the first bolus infusion and continuing until immediately prior to the last
      bolus injection. Patients will be evaluated for AEs during the course of therapy. Patients
      may receive treatment at the same dose level until appearance of significant
      treatment-related toxicities, disease progression or withdrawal of consent.

      Tumor response will be evaluated at the end of cycle 1, cycle 2 and then every two cycles for
      the duration of therapy, using physical and neurological examinations and diagnostic imaging.
