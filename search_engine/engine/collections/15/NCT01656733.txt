      smoking cessation during pregnancy. The specific aims are: (1) To examine the efficacy of the
      nicotine inhaler compared to a matching placebo for smoking cessation during pregnancy; (2)
      To compare the nicotine inhaler with placebo on overall nicotine exposure (i.e., serum
      cotinine concentrations), and on birth outcomes (i.e., birth weight and gestational age); (3)
      To identify factors that determine which women benefit most from the use of the nicotine
      inhaler for smoking cessation during pregnancy; (4) To explore mechanisms by which the
      nicotine inhaler increases birth weight and gestational age.

      Subjects will be recruited from two prenatal clinics that serve primarily a low-income,
      minority population.

      Pregnant smokers (n=270) who smoke at least 5 cigarettes/ day will receive nurse-delivered
      behavioral counseling and be randomized to receive a 6-week course of treatment with either a
      nicotine inhaler or placebo, followed by a 6-week taper. Birth outcomes will be obtained on
      all participants
