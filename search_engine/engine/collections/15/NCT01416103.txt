    
      Background and purpose: The Tryg Foundation Denmark has awarded funds for a study that tests
      how to most efficiently combine welfare-to-work schemes with efforts against alcoholism, in
      relation to a return to the labour market.

      The study will be carried out in a number of Danish municipalities in the time frame
      2011-2014.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a welfare-to-work scheme combined with
      alcohol treatment is more efficient than a welfare-to-work scheme alone, for unemployed
      citizens with alcohol problems.

      Design: If the welfare recipient meets the inclusion criteria, then the recipient is provided
      with information about the project by the caseworker. If the recipient wishes to participate
      in the project he/she is asked to fill out a consent form and a questionnaire regarding
      employment status, alcohol consumption, other habits of abuse, health status and background
      information.

      Welfare recipients who do not wish to participate will as usual be referred to the
      welfare-to-work schemes deemed most appropriate by the caseworker.

      The intervention is designed as a randomized controlled trial, where heavy drinkers who meet
      the inclusion criteria and wish to participate will be allocated to either:

      A) An intervention group receiving welfare-to-work scheme combined with alcohol treatment.

      or

      B) A control group receiving only welfare-to-work scheme.

      After 6 and 12 months there will be a follow-up where participants will be asked to answer a
      questionnaire with questions about their employment status, alcohol consumption, other habits
      of abuse, health status and background information.

      In this study ANCOVA is chosen to analyses the effective of the intervention.
