    
      This was a multi-center, randomized, evaluator and subject-blind, placebo controlled study
      design

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the test articles to block the
      development of a cold sore lesion from progressing beyond the prodromal stage following a
      UV-induced process.

      The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was to determine if a recurrent oral herpes
      episode initiated with prodromal symptoms was aborted before progressing to a lesion
      (vesicle) via assessing lesion stages by a trained evaluator.

      The secondary efficacy endpoints included: a) subject self-assessments and b) test article
      weights and diaries to track treatment compliance.
