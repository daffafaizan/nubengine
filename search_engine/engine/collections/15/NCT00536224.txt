      coronary syndrome (ACS) symptoms cannot be identified undergo further evaluation to rule out
      myocardial ischemia and appraisal of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in chest pain
      observation units (CPOUs). CPOU admission may represent a "teachable moment," but there has
      been little research on the effectiveness of brief, practical interventions for
      cardiovascular risk reduction in this population, despite the fact that the vast majority of
      these patients have at least one modifiable CRF and many do not receive regular primary care
      follow-up. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief counseling intervention
      initiated in the CPOU has a significant impact upon health attitudes (readiness to change)
      and cardiovascular risk-related behaviors (diet, exercise, and smoking). Based on the Health
      Belief Model (HBM), the intervention is designed to provide patients with tailored
      information on their cardiovascular risk, to negotiate goals for change, and to build
      problem-solving skills. All participants who are admitted to the CPOU for evaluation of ACS
      symptoms will be randomized to brief intervention (face-to-face counseling in the CPOU,
      coupled with telephone counseling at 4 weeks) or to minimal intervention (booklet with
      general information on CRFs) after a negative initial troponin measurement. We will conduct a
      baseline survey and follow-up telephone interviews at 2- and 6-month to assess stage of
      change and CRF-related behaviors. Linear mixed models and logistic regression (with
      generalized estimating equations) will be used to compare continuous and dichotomous
      behavioral outcomes across treatment arms, respectively. The proposed trial will evaluate the
      feasibility and effectiveness of delivering brief interventions for cardiovascular risk
      reduction in the CPOU setting, will provide insight into mechanisms of behavior change in
      these patients, and will guide the development of future case management interventions.
