      I. Assess the feasibility of conducting a 14-week cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program in
      women with breast cancer after completion of acute therapy.

      II. Preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of CR in improving cardiorespiratory fitness (peak
      oxygen uptake, maximum volume of oxygen [VO2 max]) at baseline and 14 weeks.

      III. Explore changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (blood pressure,
      cholesterol, fasting glucose, and body mass index) between baseline and 14-week follow-up.
      Blood pressure and body mass index will also be checked at 8 weeks.

      IV. Quantify the difference in quality of life (QoL) between baseline, 8 week, and 14 week
      follow up, adjusting for baseline QoL values.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in a CR program consisting of 1-hour CR intervention sessions, based on
      a personalized exercise prescription, 3 times per week for 14 weeks (a total of 36 sessions).
      Components of the exercise prescription includes intensity, mode, duration, and frequency.
      Intensity of exercise is guided by the results of a graded exercise stress test, rating of
      perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate, and symptoms, such as chest pain/angina or shortness of
      breath. If exercise is well-tolerated during CR sessions, patients are encouraged to
      supplement their exercise program at home, increasing their exercise frequency to up to 5
      times per week. Patients may attend weekly educational sessions offered by the Phase 2 CR
      program which covers topics such as stress management, smoking cessation, nutrition, and
      weight loss.
