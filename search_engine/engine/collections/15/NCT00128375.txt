      approximately 435,000 of the 2.4 million deaths each year in the United States. Most smokers
      make multiple attempts to quit smoking, but only 2-3% succeed each year. Smoking cessation
      programs have proven effective in helping smokers quit, but only about 5% of smokers enroll
      in smoking cessation programs each year.

      Financial incentives have been shown to increase enrollment in smoking cessation programs and
      short-term quit rates, but have not been well tested as a mechanism for increasing long-term
      quit rates. The existing evidence suggests that they could be highly effective, particularly
      among heavy smokers and low income smokers. In addition, financial incentives for smoking
      cessation will likely be more cost effective than most covered health services and at least
      as cost effective as other recommended smoking cessation treatments.

      This study is a two-arm randomized clinical trial of financial incentives for smoking
      cessation among a sample of 850 male and female smokers from GE Energy worksites throughout
      the U.S. Smokers will be randomized to receive either usual care (information about local
      community-based smoking cessation resources, coverage of prescription drugs and physician
      visits) or usual care plus a package of financial incentives that includes $100 for
      completion of a community-based tobacco cessation program, $250 for short-term smoking
      cessation at either 3 months or 6 months after randomization, and $400 for smoking cessation
      6 months post-quit date (biochemically confirmed).
