      extender exercise, and kinesiotaping application on viscoelasticity of hamstrings and
      standing long jump performance on rowers. A total of 60 professional rowing athletes were
      included. Viscoelasticity of hamstrings were assessed by MyotonPRO, Tallinn, Estonia.
      Athletic performance was assessed by Standing Long Jump Test (SLJT). The athletes were
      randomly divided into Ballistic Hamstring Stretching Group (n= 20), Hamstring Extender
      Exercise Group (n= 20), and Kinesiotape Group (n= 20). For balistic hamstring stretching,
      athletes were asked to reach the floor in the BS group by leaning over in the standing
      posture without knee flexion. When they feel the tension in hamstring muscle groups, athletes
      were requested to make small rebounding motion at degrees between 3°-5° for half a minute.
      For hamstring extender exercise, athletes were asked to apply the exercise 12 repetitions and
      3 sets. Kinesiotaping was applied on the hamstring muscle with Y shape and 25% tension force.
