      18-month clinical performance of resin composite restorations in primary molars after partial
      carious removal. This randomized clinical trial will include subjects (5-10 year-old
      children) selected at Pediatric Clinic of Federal University of Santa Maria. The sample will
      consist of 70 primary molars presenting active cavitated carious lesions (with radiographic
      involvement of the outer half of the dentin), located on the occlusal surface. The sample
      will be randomly divided into two groups according to the etching time of the dentin prior
      adhesive application (Adper Single Bond 2; 3M ESPE): applying of 35% phosphoric acid by 15 s
      - recommend by manufacturers and half-reduced etching time (7 s). The restorations will be
      clinically followed every 6 months for up to 18-month using the FDI criteria for clinical
      evaluation. Survival estimates for restoration longevity will be evaluated using the
      Kaplan-Meier method.
