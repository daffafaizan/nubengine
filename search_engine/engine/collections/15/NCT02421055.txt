      bariatric surgery through altered gut microbiome-host co-metabolism. The secondary objective
      is to identify novel biomarkers for the preoperative prognostication of T2DM remission
      following bariatric surgery.

      The study will longitudinally phenotype obese diabetics and non-diabetics undergoing
      Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy surgery. Patients will be assessed
      preoperatively and at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. Clinical measures recorded will
      include; 1) anthropometric & physiological measurements, 2) demographic details, 3)
      biochemical parameters including HbA1c, 4) anti-hyperglycaemic and other medication use, 5)
      co-morbidity status and 6) dietary choices through 24hr dietary recall questionnaires.

      Blood, urine and stool samples will be collected at the above time points. Changes to the
      microbiome will be assessed using metagenomic sequencing. Global metabonomic profiles of
      serum, urine and faecal water will be generated using 1H-NMR. Further targeted analyses of
      bile acid and short-chain fatty acid profiles will be performed using LC-MS / GC-MS.

      The study will utilise multivariate statistical analysis techniques to identify metabolic
      pathways altered following intervention, and novel host-microbiome co-metabolism pathways
      that impact upon phenotype. A supervised multivariate analysis, mapping T2DM outcomes to
      metagenomic and metabonomic data will be performed with the aim of identifying novel
      preoperative biomarkers that are able to prognosticate T2DM resolution following bariatric
      surgery.
