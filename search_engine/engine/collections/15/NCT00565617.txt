    
      Hypothesis: Severely Treatment Resistant Unipolar Depressed Subjects with EpCS of medial
      prefrontal cortex will show a significant decrease in depression symptoms at 6 months
      post-implant when compared to baseline and to a matched control group treated with
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

      Method: We will enroll 5 subjects with severe refractory depression in an open trial with a 1
      month placebo lead in, and for up to 1 years. We will also naturalistically follow 5 matched
      control patients treated with ECT. Depressive and cognitive symptoms will be rated
      periodically to assess the safety and efficacy of this procedure.

      Significance: This study takes advantage of the expertise at MUSC with various
      neuromodulation technologies to begin answering the crucial role of targeted cortical brain
      stimulation and its potential role in treatment resistant depression. This is a crucial pilot
      study that might lead to an entire new class of therapies for depression.
