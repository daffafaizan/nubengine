      common cancer in female. In VietNam, the disease is the fourth cancer in male, the sixth
      cancer in female and increasing recently. About 20-40% of the colon cancer patients had
      distant metastasis at the time of diagnose, those treatment outcome remains poor (5years
      survival is about 11%). The targetted therapy medications are still not affordable for
      majority of Vietnamese patients. So that, 3 cytotoxic drugs (5-Fluoro-Uracil, Oxaliplatin and
      Irinotecan) remain back-bone in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer.

      According to one meta-analysis, the overall survival rate significantly correlated to the use
      of all 3 these drugs in the treatment time. If patients were give two drugs as the doublet in
      a line (FOLFOX/XELOX, FOLFIRI/XELIRI), not 100% of patients are treated with all 3 these
      drugs because some abandonned the following treatment lines. So, the trials that give all 3
      drugs in a line (first-line) as triplet (FOLFOXIRI) were carried out and had primirily good
      outcome. In 2010, FOLFOXIRI were recommended in NCCN guideline.

      In VietNam, FOLFOXIRI has been applied to treat patient since 2013. However, since then there
      was no clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and the toxicity of this combination.
      Therefore, we carried out the work "Research on the treatment of metastatic colon cancer
      patients treated by FOLFOXIRI"
