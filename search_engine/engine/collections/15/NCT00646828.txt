      not affected relatives. It includes also relatives of adult relative of patients with PHA1 in
      whom no mutation was found. Cardiovascular evaluation is conducted with cardiac and vascular
      ultrasound assessment and cardiac NMR, ambulatory blood pressure measurement.

      Protocol duration is 2 days . Detailed genetic study is conducted in family without
      identified mutation in MINERALORECEPTOR.
