    
      This is a Phase 2 prospective, open-label treatment study of the safety and efficacy of
      MT1621 in TK2 deficient patients who participated in the retrospective Study MT-1621-101.
      Patients who are being treated with dC/dT and did not participate in MT-1621-101 may also be
      allowed to enroll with Sponsor approval. For all patients, it is important to ensure that
      collection of clinical and functional measurements prior to treatment with dC/dT are
      sufficient to serve as baseline assessments for purposes of evaluating safety and efficacy.

      After enrollment into this study, patients will transition from their current chemical-grade
      dC/dT or dCMP/dTMP to the same dose of MT1621, or continue use of MT1621 at their current
      dose (by weight), up to a maximum of 400 mg/kg/day. Patients who are on a dose <400 mg/kg/day
      dC/dT or dCMP/dTMP will initiate treatment with MT1621 at the same dose (by weight), and the
      Investigator will have the options of continuing at this dose or escalating to a higher dose,
      with the highest dose being 400 mg/kg/day MT1621. The dose may be reduced for tolerability
      reasons.

      Safety and efficacy will be assessed upon enrollment, at 1 month, every 3 months through 18
      months, every 6 months through 36 months, then annually thereafter, and at end of study
      participation. For patients who did not participate in Study MT-1621-101, specific
      assessments for each patient will be determined by the Sponsor in discussion with the
      Investigator based on data collected as baseline assessments for purposes of evaluating
      safety and efficacy.

      The study will include sparse PK sampling.
