      secondary efficacy endpoints are the reduction of mucositis, whatever the grade, the
      reduction of time with mucositis, the time to onset of mucositis symptoms, the reduction of
      pain intensity and evaluation of quality of life.The secondary endpoints for safety are
      severe adverse events and potential toxicity. Patients will be allocated at inclusion with a
      1/1 ratio either to laser-on or laser-off groups. In the laser group, patients will undergo
      laser therapy performed by nurses, which will consist of irradiation of the whole oral cavity
      during 2 minutes with 250mW power. In the laser-off group, laser therapy will be carried out
      with equipment off during the same time, and still performed by nurses. Protective eye
      shields will be used to avoid detrimental effects on eyes and to keep the subjects blind.
