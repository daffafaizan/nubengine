      airway pressure (PAP) therapy acceptance and adherence and sleep quality among patients with
      SCI/D. The proposed study is very relevant to the mission of the VA in promoting optimal
      health for all Veterans, including those with disabilities. To this end, this study is a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of a combined sleep and PAP
      adherence program, called the "BEST" program (Best practices PAP + patient Education +ongoing
      Support and Training). The central aim of this proposal therefore is to test the efficacy
      between two PAP adherence programs. The study has two main aims. First, the investigators aim
      to test the efficacy of the educational program in improving adherence to PAP therapy for the
      first 6 months of use (with data available for some subjects for up to 12 months). Second,
      the investigators will evaluate the impact of the program on sleep quality and on three key
      areas of function: general functioning (using measures specific to SCI/D patients),
      respiratory functioning (via spirometry) and quality of life (assessed with measures
      appropriate for use with patients having limited mobility) over the 3-month intervention
      period. The investigators will also explore whether the intervention is more effective for
      some subgroups of patients than others. The proposed work is very relevant to VA's patient
      care mission, addressing a critical need for patients who suffer from disparity in access to
      high quality care because of their disabilities. The investigators anticipate that the
      investigators' work will yield significant new knowledge that improves the health and quality
      of life for Veterans living with SCI/D.
