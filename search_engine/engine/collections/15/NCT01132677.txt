      Primary i. To determine if patients' VAS "pain while walking" is different at 6 weeks
      post-injection in patients who receive a single injection of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA)
      versus patients who receive a single injection of Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc Oneâ„¢) for treatment
      of knee OA.

      Secondary i. To determine if differences in VAS "pain while walking" scores exist at 1 and 3
      weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      ii. To determine if differences in VAS "pain at rest" scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3
      and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      iii. To determine if differences in VAS "pain with stairs" scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks
      and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      iii. To determine if differences in KOOS questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months and
      6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      iv. To determine if differences in WOMAC questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months, and
      6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      v. To determine if differences in adverse events exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3, and 6
      months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      vi. To track the number of patients who receive additional injections after 3 months
      following their index injection.
