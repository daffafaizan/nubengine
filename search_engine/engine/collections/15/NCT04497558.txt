      repeated implantation failure. In order to further explore the clinical utility of
      endometrial receptivity array in patients with repeated implantation failure, the patients
      divide into the experimental group or the control group. In the experimental group, those
      patients undergo endometrial receptivity array. In the control group, those patients do not
      receive any treatment before next cycle of transfer. In the experimental group, according to
      the results of endometrial receptivity array, the transplantation time will be adjusted and
      retransplantation will be carried out. In the control group, no intervention will be
      performed. Statistical analysis of the two groups of primary endpoint (clinical pregnancy
      rate) and secondary endpoint (endometrial implantation window evaluation results, embryo
      implantation rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, early abortion rate, ectopic pregnancy rate)
      are done. Through the comparative analysis of clinical outcomes to verify the clinical
      efficacy of endometrial receptivity analysis in patients with repeated implant failure, this
      method will provide a new treatment for repeated implant failure population.
