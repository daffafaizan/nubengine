      the United States and resulting in tremendous health care costs and psychological burden.
      Older adults are disproportionately impacted by pain, with an estimated 60-70% of people over
      the age of 65 reporting persistent pain. Despite this, pain management is frequently
      suboptimal among older adults as pharmacological therapies show limited clinical efficacy and
      a greater risk of adverse effects, and nonpharmacological (e.g., psychological) treatments
      are often underutilized.

      Resilience is conceptualized as adaptive functioning in the face of adversity and comprises a
      range of psychological, social, and physical resources. Increasing evidence suggests that
      modifiable resilience factors are associated with more favorable pain outcomes, including
      lower clinical pain/disability, higher quality of life, and enhanced psychological and
      physical functioning. Although cross-sectional research supports the significance of these
      resilience factors in pain adaptation, and positive psychological therapies have been shown
      to yield improvements in health and well-being, strategies to augment resilience are
      understudied in individuals with chronic pain.

      Using a Stage Model approach,the aim of this project is to conduct a Stage I pilot study and
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of a resilience intervention for chronic low back
      pain among older adults. Intervention modules will specifically engage hope, self-efficacy,
      positive affect, and pain acceptance.
