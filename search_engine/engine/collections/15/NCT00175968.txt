      bed rest), energetic restriction (-25%, fat reduced), and their combination on
      endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation will be compared with ambulatory control
      conditions. Using venous occlusion plethysmography cumulative intraarterial dose-response
      curves to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside)
      vasodilators will be constructed in 10 healthy male volunteers before and on day 13 of each
      of the four intervention periods.
