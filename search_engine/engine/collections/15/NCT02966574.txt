      its interest in metastatic cancers.

      Breast cancers, especially hormone-sensitive ones, are very osteophilic and bones are the
      most frequent metastatic site. Other sites include the lungs, liver, pleura, distant lymph
      nodes, soft tissue and the central nervous system.

      Metastasis are located exclusively in the bones in 30% of the cases. The most commonly
      affected bones include the axial skeleton, rich in hematopoietic bone marrow : column,
      pelvis, skull, ribs, clavicles, the proximal part of the femur and humerus. Five percent of
      breast cancers are directly metastatic and 20 to 30% of localized breast cancers progress to
      metastatic stage. This potentially affects a large number of patients, with a median survival
      of 30 to 36 months.Patients with bone metastases only have a better survival rate than
      others: 20% at 5 years. It is therefore important to use a reliable and reproducible
      examination for the monitoring of treatment response.

      Apart from morphological criteria (lesion size and RECIST criteria), MRI provides
      quantitative functional criteria (diffusion and ADC values). According to a recent study,
      whole body MRI is as good as PET/CT and more effective than bone scintigraphy for the
      diagnosis of bone metastases for cancers of breast and prostate with a high metastatic risk.
      However, this is a preliminary study with a limited and heterogeneous cohort of patients.

      Therefore, it seems appropriate to study the performance of whole body MRI in the
      pre-therapeutic assessment of breast cancer with a high risk for metastasis and the
      monitoring of metastatic breast cancer.
