    
      BACKGROUND:

      Tremendous progress in the past few years has led to the identification of several circadian
      clock genes. This now makes it possible to determine how alterations of human circadian clock
      genes and their expression could lead to differences in circadian and sleep/wake cycle
      phenotypes. Of particular interest for understanding genetics of the human circadian system
      are individuals with sleep phase disorders, such as DSPS and advanced sleep phase syndrome
      (ASPS), because recent studies indicate a genetic basis for these disorders. While it is
      assumed that both ASPS and DSPS are disorders of circadian timing, little is known about how
      the circadian clock system, or its interaction with sleep processes, are affected in these
      individuals.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Participants will complete questionnaires and actigraphy to determine sleep patterns and
      quality.
