      tolerability of a de-pigmenting regimen when used by subjects with mild to severe mottled
      hyperpigmentation and melasma. Efficacy will be assessed using visual grading, device
      measurements and digital photography. Tolerance and safety will be evaluated by grading for
      objective and subjective signs of irritation, and the incidence and severity of adverse
      events. Efficacy and tolerance of this product are compared to that of Hydroquinone, which is
      applied to one side of the subject's face while the herbal de-pigmenting regimen is applied
      to the other side of the face.

      The two product pigmentation reducing herbal regimen is based on the novel concept of
      inhibiting all 14 major and the 3 branch steps in the melanin cascade.
