      stage IV melanoma treated with vinorelbine. II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative toxic
      effects of vinorelbine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine by IV over 6 to 10 minutes weekly. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or complete response to
      therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
