        1. Experimental group: using EverLift submucosal injection for polyps 4-9mm of the colon

        2. Control group: not using EverLift submucosal injection for polyps 4-9mm of the colon

        3. Methods:

             1. Colonoscopy will be performed in the same standard of care manner as if no study
                was taking place.

             2. If polyps 4-9mm are identified, the endoscopist is randomized to performing
                polypectomy with or without submucosal injection of EverLift.

             3. After removal of the polypectomy, two biopsies are performed at the margin of the
                polypectomy site to identify residual lesion.

             4. The polyp as well as well as the two biopsies are reviewed by a pathologist.
