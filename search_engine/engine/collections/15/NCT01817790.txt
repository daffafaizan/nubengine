      treatment of nasal symptoms, several large well-controlled studies in which FP maintained
      adequate control of nasal symptoms when administered in a dose of 200 micrograms (mcg)
      once-daily (QD) also suggested improvement in ocular symptoms. This study will employ a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multi-center design that compares FP and placebo
      nasal sprays in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to assess the effectiveness on
      ocular symptoms associated with AR.
