      dose of acyclovir 400mg in 60 African HIV-negative heterosexual women who have a history of
      genital ulcer disease (GUD), are HSV-2 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative. The study will
      also examine the time to healing of genital lesion and duration of HSV shedding from GUD
      among 90 HIV negative African women who have a history of GUD and are Herpes Simplex Virus
      (HSV)-2 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive episodic
      acyclovir or matching placebo.
