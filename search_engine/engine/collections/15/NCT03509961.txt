    
      A Phase II pilot trial will estimate survival after a non-TBI based conditioning regimen in
      patients diagnosed with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are pre-allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) next-generation-sequence (NGS) minimal residual
      disease (MRD) negative.

      The relationship of NGS-MRD status to survival in children, adolescents, and young adults
      with B-ALL undergoing any approach to allogeneic HCT will be explored in a larger cohort
      (treatment [phase II] and observational arms of the study).

      The primary objective is to estimate 2-year event free survival (EFS) in pre-HCT NGS-MRD
      negative patients with B-ALL undergoing a non-TBI based conditioning regimen through a
      multi-center prospective trial. The accrual period is 3 years.

      Patients that are NGS-MRD negative with B-ALL may be eligible for the Treatment Arm, which is
      myeloablative non-TBI conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa followed -matched
      related, unrelated, and umbilical cord blood transplants. Patients that are NGS-MRD positive
      will be followed on the observational arm for outcome.

      Study sampling will include NGS-MRD bone marrow (BM) aspirate and peripheral blood (PB)
      samples collected [same day when possible] pre-HCT (within 4 weeks), and post-HCT on days 42
      ± 14, 100 ± 20, and 365 ± 60; PB samples only will also be collected day 180± 60 and 270± 60;
      day +30, day +100, and 1-year post-HCT. NGS-MRD peripheral blood sample only at 6 months and
      9 months post-HCT; (Blast specimen at time of diagnosis or relapse is required for NGS-MRD
      testing).
