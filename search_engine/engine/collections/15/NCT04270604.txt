      stem cells. These stem cells can become any cell in the human body, including cells that may
      be difficult, invasive, or even impossible to obtain directly. For example, researchers may
      create pancreatic insulin-producing cells to learn more about type 1 diabetes, or brain cells
      to learn more about Parkinson's disease.

      Additionally, researchers perform genetic testing to learn more about DNA, a material in most
      cells that contains instructions for the body's development and functions (such as traits
      like eye color and risk of certain diseases). A piece of DNA that determines the specific
      role of a cell is called a "gene." If the instructions in a gene are abnormal, this can lead
      to disease.

      Participation in the study involves: (1) completion of a health questionnaire, (2) donation
      of a skin and/or blood sample from which stem cells may be created, (3) possible collection
      of a saliva sample for genetic analysis, and (4) possible future follow-up to provide
      additional information or learn about other research studies. This study is not a clinical
      trial.
