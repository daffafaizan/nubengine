      undergoing general or uro-surgical operations under general anesthesia will be included in
      this double-blinded study. Patients will be randomly assigned into two equal groups, each
      group including 36 patients. In one group 36 children will receive nebulized midazolam 0.2
      mg/kg in 3 ml normal saline plus 5 ml clear juice (orally) 30 min before undergoing general
      anesthesia. In the other group 36 children will receive oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg in 5 ml
      clear juice plus nebulizer of 3 ml normal saline 30 min before undergoing GA.
