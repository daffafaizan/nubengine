    
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study in 60 healthy male subjects who meet the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria for the study. Each subject will participate in
      a screening period, a baseline period (the day preceding drug administration), and a
      single-dose treatment period with an on-site observation period of at least 48 hours after
      the dose.
