      Anaerobic performance is negatively affected by sedentary behaviour due to loss of muscle
      strength and endurance. Exercise is an effective method to increase muscle strength and
      physical performance.

      Exercising in water has unique physiological characteristics such as buoyancy, hydrostatic
      pressure, and metacentric effect. In addition, exercising in high speeds in water leads
      strengthening. Deep water running is employed to imitate the running on land. It is advocated
      that deep water running might result additional benefits than running on land. Therefore, the
      effect of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of deep water running and
      treadmill running in sedentary young adults.
