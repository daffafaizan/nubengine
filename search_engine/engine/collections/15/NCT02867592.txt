      I. To determine the objective response rate (complete response + partial response) of
      cabozantinib-s-malate (XL184) in children and young adults.

      II. To estimate whether XL184 therapy either improves the disease control rate at 4 months in
      patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma as compared to a historical Childrens
      Oncology Group (COG) experience or produces an objective response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further define XL184 related toxicities in pediatric, adolescent and young adult
      patients.

      II. To further define XL184 pharmacokinetics in the pediatric and adolescent patients.

      III. To estimate 1-year time to progression, progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival for each stratum, and if feasible to compare to historical controls.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of XL184 on patients' immune cell subsets. II. To obtain tumor tissue
      (snap frozen, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded [FFPE] blocks, or unstained slides) from
      diagnosis, recurrence, or both, for possible future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for
      1 year and then annually for up to 5 years.
