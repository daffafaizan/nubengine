      Like most serious games, it targets both physical and cognitive components. Studies that
      evaluate serious games lack an appropriate control group, thus this study aims to evaluate
      the efficacy of serious games played with the Medimoov platform on fear of falling and fall
      risks. This pilot study is an open randomized controlled trial in parallel groups with blind
      data collection for the primary outcome.

      The intervention group will follow bi-weekly sessions with Medimoov. The control group will
      follow the usual rehabilitation program: the standard psychomotor therapy program.

      Both interventions will be consistent with rehabilitation programs prescribed by
      participants' physicians. Each intervention, guided by a psychomotor therapist, will last
      eight weeks with bi-weekly sessions of 35 minutes.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Three assessments will be
      conducted focusing on physical and cognitive capacities. The first assessment will be
      conducted five or fewer days before the beginning of the rehabilitation program, the second
      will occur during week 4 and the third one during week 8, at the end of the rehabilitation
      program. Assessments will be blinded: assessors will not know the assigned group of each
      participant.
