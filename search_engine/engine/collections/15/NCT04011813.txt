      centrifugation-frozen-thawing cycle. Samples were obtained from men undergoing routine semen
      analysis at the Center for Reproductive Medicine. Spermatozoa were selected by density
      gradient centrifugation, washed and frozen using a programmable device. Each step was
      performed in parallel with (H+ arm) or without (H- arm) 50mM hypotaurine supplementation.
      After thawing, investigator team compared for both conditions the total and progressive
      mobility, vitality, integrity of the acrosome, markers of Protein Kinase A (PKA) dependent
      capacitation intracellular signaling pathway and nuclear quality by measuring chromatin
      packaging, DNA fragmentation and oxidation and vacuoles presence in the spermatozoa head.
