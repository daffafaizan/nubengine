      medical condition and the factors that contribute to their adaptation. Rare and undiagnosed
      conditions are often chronic and disabling, with symptoms affecting different organ systems
      at various levels of severity. Perhaps the most challenging feature of an undiagnosed medical
      condition that has lasted two or more years, however, is its characteristic uncertainty. In
      the absence of a diagnosis, health care professionals can provide only limited treatment and
      prognostic information. It is not well understood how individuals cope with and adapt to
      chronic uncertainty, and the factors that influence this process. To design future
      interventions, descriptive studies are needed to reveal predictors that can be manipulated to
      improve outcomes. In this study, Lazarus and Folkman's Transactional Model of Stress and
      Coping provides a framework to examine coping and adaptation in the parents of children who
      have had a chronic, undiagnosed medical condition for two or more years. A cross-sectional
      research design using a mixed methods survey will be used to examine the relationships among
      appraisals (perceptions of uncertainty and perceived personal control), time elapsed since
      parents first realized their child was sick, coping and adaptation. Parents will be recruited
      from web-based support networks for parents of undiagnosed children via website postings,
      email listservs and printed newsletter postings. Participants will have the option to
      complete an online or paper version of the questionnaire. The main outcome variable is
      adaptation to living with one's child's undiagnosed medical condition.
