      first phase of this study is to screen varsity level college athletes for EIB using Eucapnic
      hyperventilation (EVH). Those athletes who screen positive, will be enrolled in phase two, a
      randomized double-blinded placebo controlled double crossover study. At enrollment, athletes
      will undergo a cardiopulmonary stress test (CPST) and induced sputum sampling and will then
      be prescribed daily montelukast/placebo for a three week period. Athletes will return after
      three weeks and repeat the EVH, CPST, and induced sputum. They will then have a one week
      washout period followed by crossover once again to daily montelukast/placebo for another
      three weeks. After the second three weeks they will once again return for a final EVH, CPST,
      and induced sputum. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that effectively blunting the
      EIB response with montelukast, indices of ventilation,exercise tolerance, and perhaps overall
      physical fitness improve, allowing athletes to train more effectively, in a nonergogenic
      manner.
