      randomized to either ACET or non ACET control. Both groups were able to receive standard
      therapies (in-hospital monitoring, magnesium and anti-hypertensives as appropriate). The
      first five days of the therapeutic arm (ACET) consisted of a dose-finding trial, where
      epidural ropivacaine infusions (10ml/hr for 24 hours) of 0•04%, 0•06%, 0•08% and 0•1% and a
      saline placebo were each administered via tunneled epidural catheters in a randomized,
      double-blinded, cross-over design over five consecutive days; all three women received all
      doses. Doppler measurement of flow in the uterine artery was performed at baseline and at the
      end of each dose period. The ideal dose for an individual was determined to be lowest dose of
      drug giving maximal effect without side effects; in the second stage of the study, this dose
      was administered until delivery with the addition of a second placebo day to during this
      period.
