      clinical trial consisting of 2 postprandial tests for each period. Overweight or obese
      postmenopausal women and men aged 40 to 65 will be recruited from the greater Fort Collins,
      CO area. After telephone prescreening, participants will report to the study site for their
      first visit (Screening) where they will receive verbal and written explanation of the
      project, provide informed consent, followed by screening assessments. Qualified participants
      will be scheduled for a baseline visit and randomly assigned to their respective treatments.
      On the second visit (Baseline) following an overnight fast, anthropometrics and blood
      pressure will be measured and diet and physical activity records will be collected. Subjects
      will ingest their respective treatment 10 min prior to consuming the high-fat test meal.
      Various assessments will be performed and samples collected prior to and up to 4 hours
      post-meal consumption. At the third visit (Final), all assessments and sample collections
      will be repeated at the same time points but 24 hours after consuming the last dose of their
      respective treatments to test chronic rather than acute effects. Subjects will undergo a
      4-week washout period before crossing over to the next treatment period. This will be
      repeated for all 4 treatments.
