      syndrome (SPS), including deficits in performance of scapular and glenohumeral muscles. Such
      deficits can lead to inadequate kinematics and decreased acromiohumeral distance (AHD).
      Exercises that aim at correcting these deficits, such as movement training, were suggested to
      improve symptoms and functional limitations. To date, few studies have assessed outcomes
      following an intervention focused on movement training.

      Objectives: Evaluate the effects of a rehabilitation program based on movement training on
      symptoms, functional limitations and AHD in individuals with SPS.

      Design: Prospective single group pre-post design. Methods: Twenty-five participants with SPS
      (SPS group) participated in a 6-week program. Twenty asymptomatic volunteers were recruited
      for normative AHD values (control group). Outcomes of both groups were evaluated at baseline
      and 6 weeks, i.e. immediately following intervention for the SPS group. Changes in symptoms
      and functional limitations for SPS group were assessed using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff
      index (WORC) and Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH). Changes in AHD
      for both groups were assessed using ultrasonographic measures.
