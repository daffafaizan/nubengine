      occlusion of coronary artery by this plaque rupture. Until now, evaluation of vulnerable
      plaque have been mainly performed with invasive imaging modalities such as optical coherence
      tomography or intravascular ultrasound.

      Recently, positron emission tomography(PET) using 18F-Sodium fluoride (NaF) showed promising
      results for detecting vulnerable plaques in some pilot studies.

      In this study, we will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-NaF PET for non-invasively
      detecting vulnerable plaque, diagnosed by optical coherence tomography (OCT).
