    
      This study will evaluate participants with complaints of dry mouth to determine the cause and
      severity of their salivary gland dysfunction and their possible eligibility for other NIDCR
      protocols. Salivary secretions have antibacterial, lubricating, remineralizing, digestive,
      buffering and cleansing properties. Impaired function of these glands can cause an increase
      in tooth decay; a variety of oral hard and soft tissue changes, with painful, burning or
      ulcerated or oral mucosa; problems chewing, swallowing and speaking; and diminished taste and
      smell.

      Participants with dry mouth complaints suggestive of salivary gland dysfunction may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants will have a complete medical and dental history. Saliva samples will be
      collected from the major salivary glands, which are located in the cheeks and under the
      tongue. Several blood samples will also be drawn for tests. Some participants will have a
      biopsy of the minor salivary glands, usually from inside the lower lip, to confirm or rule
      out the diagnosis of Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and to determine the extent of changes
      in the salivary glands. An eye examination including a standard eye examination and a dry eye
      assessment is done. The ability to taste and smell may also be evaluated, and participants
      may have an ultrasound examination of their swallowing function.
