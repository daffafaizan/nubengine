      asked to participate. The investigators will send a package of questionnaires to evaluate
      quality of life and stigmatization before nevus surgery. One year after surgical therapy is
      finished (sometimes more then one session is necessary), the scar will be clinically
      evaluated and also another questionnaire package will be sent to evaluate the same parameters
      again. All parameters are checked for the patients and the families as well. Therefore self
      and proxy reports of the parents are asked. Moreover, for the patients this is done with
      interviews in case they are older than 7 years.
