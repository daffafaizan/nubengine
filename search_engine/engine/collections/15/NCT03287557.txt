    
      This pilot project is a prospective, observational study in 20 patients who are admitted to
      University of Kentucky (UK) Chandler Medical Center with a diagnosis of severe,
      non-penetrating traumatic brain injury (TBI) or aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).

      All adult participants with a primary diagnosis of severe, non-penetrating TBI or aSAH who
      are admitted to the neuroscience or trauma intensive care units will be screened for
      potential inclusion into this study. Once a potential participant is identified, the
      legally-authorized representative will be approached for study consent and HIPAA
      authorization. If the participant regains consent capacity before the end of the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection period, assent will be obtained from the research
      participant.

      In this research study, up to 5 small samples of CSF, will be carefully removed from the
      device, already in place, that drains excess CSF from the participant's head. The samples
      will be less than 1 teaspoon (< 5 mL) each. These samples will be frozen and stored until
      samples from approximately 20 participants have been obtained.

      These samples will then be prepared and sent to a research laboratory to analyze the proteins
      in the samples collected from each research participant.

      Because the results of this study will not affect the treatment participants receive in or
      outside of the hospital, the investigator will not share the results of this study with the
      participant, their doctor or their family member(s).
