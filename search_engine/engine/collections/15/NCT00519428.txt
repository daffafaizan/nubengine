      dysfunction and costs. Depression is undertreated, but even when treatment is adequate and
      effective, sources of delay in current pharmacologic strategies include: mechanistic delays,
      those related to the physiologic and behavioral effects of antidepressants; dosing delays in
      identifying the effective dose; and programmatic delays in identifying an effective agent
      using sequential monotherapy. This study will randomize 240 patients with Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) to 12 week double
      blind treatment with combined escitalopram and bupropion or each antidepressant administered
      alone to evaluate whether combined escitalopram and bupropion result in more rapid remission
      and greater over-all remission than monotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest
      that bupropion might prevent one mechanistic delay inherent in escitalopram monotherapy.
      Rapid dose escalation may counter dosing delays. The simultaneous use of two known
      antidepressant medications may alleviate programmatic delays inherent in usual sequential
      monotherapy. Six months follow up and careful assessment of adverse events will address
      tolerability, acceptability, sustainability, and pharmacoeconomic concerns. If successful,
      this study might have a significant impact on clinical practice, public health, and
      depression's cost consequences.
