      cell carcinoma from the Oct 2014. The patients will be divided into three groups.Experimental
      group 1 : single drug Capecitabine and concurrent radiotherapy.Experimental group 2:
      Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin and concurrent radiotherapy. Control group:cisplatin plus
      5-fluorouracil and concurrent radiotherapy. To evaluate the overall survival of the three
      group. Also observe the patient's progression-free survival, response rate, pathologic
      complete response rate and adverse events.
