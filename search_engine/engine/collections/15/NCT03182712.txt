      acid (n-3 PUFA) and vitamin E supplementation before and after an acute high intensity
      exercise bout on lipid profile, glycemic, redox and inflammatory parameters in type 2
      diabetic (T2DM) patients. Thirty T2DM patients, without chronic complications, took part in
      this study. Blood and urine samples were collected after 12 h-fasting state for baseline
      biochemical analysis. Thereafter, subjects performed an incremental workload VO2max test on a
      cycle ergometer to determine the load of the high intensity submaximal exercise. On the
      following week, blood samples were collected before and immediately after the exercise test
      for measurements of oxidative stress (OS) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).
      Afterwards, participants were randomly allocated into two groups: placebo (gelatin) and n-3
      PUFA (capsules containing 180 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, 120 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and
      2 mg of vitamin E). Three capsules were ingested daily for eight weeks. Then, the examination
      protocol and the exercise test were repeated and the samples collected.
