      happens through different mechanisms and with a different onset of side effects. Median Nerve
      Neural Mobilization is a physical therapy technique that achieves pain relief through
      mechanical stimulation of the median nerve and the brachial plexus. The proper mechanical
      stimulation of the nerve and its surrounding neural tissue induces a wide variety of
      physiologic responses that may reduce cervicobrachial pain including the activation of
      descending nervous system pain modulation mechanisms, all though the entire set of underlying
      reasons for this pain reduction is not completely understood. Among the effects caused by the
      Neural Tissue Mobilization that produce pain relief are: intraneural edema reduction, changes
      on the intraneural nerve pressure,dispersion of pro-inflammatory substances and an increase
      in nerve mobility

      Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used worldwide to control pain, fever and
      inflammation.Oral intake of Ibuprofen produces a hypoalgesic effect due to biochemical
      inhibition of the COX enzymes, which convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2).
      PGH2, which in turn, is converted by other enzymes to several types of prostaglandins and
      thromboxanes (which are mediators of pain and inflammation).

      Side effects derived from the oral intake of Ibuprofen are related to its systemic action and
      can be severe in some patients. This fact suggests that oral Ibuprofen may not be suitable to
      use in all types of patients suffering from cervicobrachial pain, meanwhile the Median Nerve
      Neural Mobilization has little to no side effects known. This reveals a point of interest in
      determining comparative effectiveness between this two therapeutic options in the treatment
      of cervicobrachial pain.
