    
      This study is a multi-center BCCA study that evaluates the impact of the Oncotype DX® assay
      on the decision making of the treating physician and the patient. The study also has a
      pharmacoeconomic component. All eligible patients in which either physician and/or patient
      determine that results from the 21 gene recurrence score could provide additional information
      useful in the decision making process regarding adjuvant chemotherapy or not will be asked by
      the participating physicians to participate in the study. If interested, the patient will
      consent to the study. The physician will complete a baseline questionnaire to document
      recommended adjuvant systemic therapies (pre-Oncotype DX®). The Oncotype DX® assay will be
      ordered after receipt of the Physician and Patient Registration and assignment of patient
      study number. The physician will discuss the results of the Oncotype DX® assay with the
      patient once the result is available and upon receipt of the pre-test questionnaire. The
      physician will complete a follow-up questionnaire (to document recommended adjuvant systemic
      therapies post Oncotype DX®) after the result of the Oncotype DX® assay is known.
