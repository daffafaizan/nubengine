      emergency patients with acute abdominal symptoms. Accuracy of unenhanced CT is assessed by
      comparing diagnosis and therapeutic management recorded before and after unenhanced CT versus
      gold standard diagnosis and management. Gold standard diagnosis and management are
      established at 3 month follow up, based on patient's medical records and a systematic
      telephone interview.
