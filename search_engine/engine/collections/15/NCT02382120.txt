      the non-invasive capnodynamic cardiac output measurement in mechanically ventilated patients.
      We will study 30 patients undergoing cardiovascular by pass in which an invasive
      trans-thoracic thermodilution method (PICCOScience) is indicated - the reference method.

      A pair of thermodilutions and capnodynamic cardiac output measurement will be performed along
      the surgery. Analysis of precision will be done at the begining of the protocol and during
      stable hemodynamic conditions. Accuracy will then assessed using the Bland-Altmann plot and
      regression analysis.
