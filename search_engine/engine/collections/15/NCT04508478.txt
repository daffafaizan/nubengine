    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been a global threat due to its increasing incidence and
      prevalence, and also its potential complications of embolic stroke and heart failure, and
      therefore has a great impact on life expectancy and quality of life. AF with preserved
      ventricular function is associated with exercise intolerance, and the effect of physical
      training had shown to improve life quality and heart function in the population. However, the
      optimal physical training modalities and intensities are not well studies.

      Here we conduct a prospective, randomized, and interventional trial to investigate the
      effects of different exercise training programs to the burden of AF. We also exploit advanced
      imaging modalities, including dual x-ray absorptiometry and muscle magnetic resonance, to
      explore the change of body mass compositions. With this project, we will be able to explore
      the effects of different physical exercise modalities to the burden of AF and heart function,
      and also build up a best exercise training program, specific for this population.
