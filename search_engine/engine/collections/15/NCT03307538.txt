      can result in cure. Unfortunately, in the majority of these patients the tumors are found to
      be unresectable at presentation due to local invasive tumor growth or the presence of distant
      metastases. For these patients palliative chemotherapy is the standard treatment yielding an
      estimated median overall survival of 12-15.2 months. There is no evidence from randomized
      trials that supports the routine use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for
      unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. However, small and most often retrospective studies
      combining chemotherapy with SBRT showed promising results with overall survival reaching up
      to 33-35 months.

      This pilot study is designed as a first step to confirm and extend these findings. Up to six
      patients diagnosed with unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma will be treated with
      standard chemotherapy followed by SBRT in order to assess possible severe side effects of the
      treatment. As part of this research, patients will be followed with CT- or MRI-scan and blood
      tests exams until progression. In addition to this clinical evaluation, the investigators
      will also work towards developing a predictive assay for radiotherapy response of both normal
      and tumor tissue by establishing normal tissue and tumor organoids and determining several
      key parameters for their response to ionizing radiation treatment.
