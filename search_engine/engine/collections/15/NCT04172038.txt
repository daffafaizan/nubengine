      System (MHS) within the Department of Defense (DoD) and the most common chronic pain
      condition in the MHS and civilian healthcare is low back pain (LBP). Key questions exist
      however about the relative effectiveness of various strategies at different Steps, how to
      sequence treatments and individualize care based on specific patient characteristics and the
      resource implications. This study will recruit active duty military members or members of
      Reserves or National Guard on active duty, family members of active duty personnel, or
      Tricare beneficiaries seeing a primary care provider for chronic LBP in an MHS facility, ages
      18-65. All participants will first receive 6 weeks of Phase I care with either physical
      therapy (PT) or Move to Health (M2H) interventions. After Phase I the investigators will
      assess response to initial treatment strategy. Phase I responders will be receive up to 2
      additional sessions of treatment to facilitate a transition to self-management. Phase I
      non-responders will be randomly assigned to a more intensive Phase II treatment of either
      mindfulness or a combined PT+M2H intervention for 8 weeks. Randomization at each phase will
      be stratified by site, gender, and active duty status (adding Phase I treatment assignment at
      Phase II). Follow-up assessments for all participants will occur at 18 weeks (conclusion of
      Phase II), 6 months and 12 months after enrollment. Outcomes include patient-reported
      measures and health care costs.
