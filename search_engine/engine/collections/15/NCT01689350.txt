      lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, cyclophosphamide can cause severe side effects, including
      bone marrow suppression, infection, gastrointestinal reaction, hemorrhagic cystitis, and the
      etc. Significant variation in efficacy and toxicity of CPA has been observed. Since the
      development of applicable therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of cyclophosphamide has been
      reported, it will help to improve the efficacy and reduce toxicities in SLE treatment.
      However, the TDM is a passive strategy which usually lags behind the appearance of
      toxicities. Thereforeï¼Œit is especially crucial to give individuals genotype-based personal
      prescription of cyclophosphamide in order to gain the most effective therapies. Thus, the
      purpose of this study is to compare the genotype-based personal prescription of
      cyclophosphamide with the traditional prescription, in order to verify the efficacy of the
      genotype-based personal prescription.
