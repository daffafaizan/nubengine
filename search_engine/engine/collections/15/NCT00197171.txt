    
      Open, randomised, long-term antibody persistence studies, conducted in 2 centers. Immune
      persistence was compared between subjects who received two doses of GSK Biologicals combined
      hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine at either 0, 6 month schedule or 0, 12 month schedule.
      These long-term follow-up studies involved taking blood samples at approximately 5 and 6
      years after the primary vaccination of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine, to assess antibody
      persistence and a retrospective safety follow-up.
