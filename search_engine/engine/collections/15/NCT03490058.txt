      planning clinics (Kisumu, Kenya), youth friendly clinics (Johannesburg, South Africa), and
      mobile youth friendly clinics (Cape Town, South Africa). The investigators will evaluate PrEP
      delivery and follow cohorts of young women at each clinic location to understand PrEP uptake
      and use. In the Kisumu clinics, the investigators will also offer expedited partner therapy
      and partner HIV self-tests to women who test positive for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea. At one
      clinic in Johannesburg, the investigators will evaluate the use of a decision support tool to
      improve the decision to initiate PrEP.
