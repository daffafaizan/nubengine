      detect and identify bacterial (and toxins), viral, and parasitic pathogens extracted from
      human stool specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of infectious colitis
      or gastroenteritis.

      The objective of this study is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of xTAG GPP through a
      multi-site, method comparison study on prospectively collected, left-over, and anonymized
      stool specimens. The prospective sample set will also be supplemented with pre-selected
      archived left-over specimens (for low prevalence targets only). Diagnostic accuracy will be
      expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity and specificity for each target.
