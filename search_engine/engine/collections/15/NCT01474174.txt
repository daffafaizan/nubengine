      I. The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of influenza
      vaccination in patients with central nervous system tumors as defined by a four-fold increase
      in hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers from the pre-vaccination baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. A secondary objective of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of influenza
      vaccination in patients with central nervous system tumors as defined by a serum
      post-vaccination HI titer of at least 1:40.

      II. The secondary objectives of this pilot study include an assessment of the relationship
      between a variety of clinical factors and seroconversion following influenza vaccination.

      III. Subgroup analyses will include an investigation of seroconversion and treatment
      (actively receiving chemotherapy, radiation therapy or both), disease status (active
      treatment vs long term followup), and use and dose of glucocorticoids.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. An additional area of interest which will be further explored in this pilot study is an
      assessment of the relationship between serologic markers of immune function and response to
      vaccination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, 21 days, and 3
      and/or 6 months.
