      disease (ILD) is shortness of breath, a symptom which greatly affects their abilities to
      carry out activities of daily living. Breathing retraining has been reported to lead to
      improvements in dyspnoea and walking distance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      patients. Evidence regarding the effects of such an intervention in ILD patients is though
      lacking. In view of this, the aims of such a study were to identify whether breathing
      retraining led to better management of dyspnoea and improved walking distance in ILD
      patients. Twenty Seven ILD patients were randomly distributed to either the control group
      (n=15) which received a 12-week Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) programme without breathing
      retraining or the active group (n=12) which received a 12-week PR programme with breathing
      retraining. All patients had both the 6-minute walk test and their level of breathlessness
      assessed using the Dyspnoea Borg scale assessed at baseline and at 4 weekly intervals for a
      12-week period throughout the programme.
