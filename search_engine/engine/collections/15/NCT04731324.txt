      and pharmacodynamics (PD) following a single-oral dose administration of ZYIL1 to healthy
      subjects aged between 18-55 years old (Both Inclusive).

      It will be conducted in up to 7 cohorts of 6 subjects each. Each cohort will be enrolled
      within a 28 day screening period to ensure subjects meet all the inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria. Subjects will be administered single oral dose of ZYIL1 on Day 1.

      In this study each cohort containing six subjects will be given a single oral dose of ZYIL1
      in ascending manner. Initially, up to 3 cohorts of 18 subjects will be enrolled and dosed.
      Interim analysis will be done after completion of three cohorts and submitted to Central
      Licensing Authority of India(CLA). Further cohorts (i.e. cohort S4 onwards) will be conducted
      after obtaining approval of CLA.

      This is the first administration of ZYIL1 in humans; therefore, study design adjustments may
      be made based on emerging data from each dose cohort based on review of preliminary safety,
      tolerability, and PK results.
