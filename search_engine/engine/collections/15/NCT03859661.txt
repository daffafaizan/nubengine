      provided for patients, especially at home.

      The Chief Investigator has formulated a new biscuit 'Fitabisc' that contains the key
      antioxidants; vitamins C and E, selenium and glutamine. The advantage of a biscuit is that
      all ingredients of interest are combined within the one item and so this may be easier for
      patients to 'take' than other types of supplement. A survey involving 17 community pharmacies
      in England and Northern Ireland found that 60% of patients aged 60 - 89 years had difficulty
      swallowing tablets and capsules. The consistency of the biscuit is softer than traditional
      shortbread and crumbs readily which we hope will make it easy to eat.

      The aim of this study is to test the palatability of Fitabisc and whether patients undergoing
      abdominal surgery can eat it in the desired quantities for 10 days before they are admitted
      to hospital.

      In summary, most studies to date have looked perioperative or postoperative supplementation
      with antioxidants alone. No attempt has been made to do this using a palatable biscuit that
      would facilitate preoperative oral supplementation. If this study confirms the palatability
      of the biscuit and there is adherence to eating it then it would be our intention to set up a
      prospective randomized study in which the potential efficacy of Fitabisc would be evaluated.
