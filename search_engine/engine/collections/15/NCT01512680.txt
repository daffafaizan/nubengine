      which focuses on patient autonomy, carbs counting and insulin dose adaptation. In this study
      we plan to enroll 60 patients who will be educated toFIT and followed during one year.
      Patient will follow normal path of eductation which is composed of a 3 days inpatient
      admission, a medical visit one month after the education, and a 4hours reminder session six
      months after the education. We will compare HbA1c, hypoglycemia, weight, before the
      education, and after. Patient will also wear a continuous glucose sensor during one week
      before, at month 6 and month 12 to allow comparison of glucose variablity.
