      (ventricles) of the heart beat too fast. This condition can be life threatening because these
      ventricles are the main pumping chambers of the heart. The fast heartbeat is caused by
      electrical impulses that travel incorrectly in your heart.

      One way to treat VT is to have a catheter ablation procedure. A catheter ablation is a
      procedure that creates scar tissue in the heart to interrupt the electrical impulses that
      create irregular heart rhythms.

      It is possible that the ablation procedure might cause a blood clot to form. The blood clot
      can stop blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke. When blood flow is interrupted to a
      certain part of the brain, that part does not receive enough oxygen. As a result of the
      stroke the affected areas of the brain are unable to function normally.

      Apixaban (also known as Eliquis) is a blood thinning drug, also called an anticoagulant. It
      interferes with the body's natural blood clotting ability by inactivating a specific enzyme
      that the body needs to form blood clots.

      Participation in this study will last about 30 days.
