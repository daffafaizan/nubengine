      are randomized into endoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernioplasty (TEP) or open
      Lichtenstein hernioplasty. Pain reaction to surgery and return to work are asked many times
      using questionnaire and pain diary (pain scores from 1h to 30 days after surgery). Surgical
      complications and use of pain killers are carefully recorded. Clinical examination is
      performed if necessary.
