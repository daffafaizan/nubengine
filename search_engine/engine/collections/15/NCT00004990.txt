      steroid dosing regimen for patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), using a
      pilot study design that will enroll 20 patients. Although the literature reports variable
      steroid responsiveness, remission rates of up to 30-40 percent have recently been reported in
      nephrotic adult patients treated with daily prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day for at least 4 months,
      followed by a taper over 3-4 months. Such a prolonged and aggressive steroid course is
      fraught with significant morbidity, but this approach has been advocated by some authors
      because of the poor prognosis for renal survival in nephrotic patients with FSGS who do not
      achieve remission with steroid treatment. We plan to test an eight month course of high dose
      steroid therapy administered in monthly pulses instead of daily doses, for comparable
      efficacy in achieving remission, and for the occurrence of adverse steroid side effects. We
      plan to enroll patients with nephrotic syndrome due to biopsy-proven FSGS, who have either
      not been treated, or have responded to conventional steroid dosing regimens and relapsed. We
      plan to treat them with monthly oral pulses of dexamethasone (40-60 mg/d x 4 days), for 8
      months. The primary endpoint will be induction of complete remission, defined as urine
      protein less than 300 mg/d. Patients will also be evaluated for manifestations of steroid
      toxicity. Patients will be seen in follow up at intervals up to 24 months following study
      entry. If this study suggests that remission of nephrotic syndrome can be attained with this
      regimen, and with an acceptable toxicity profile, we will plan a randomized controlled trial
      of this regimen compared with daily or alternate day oral steroids.
