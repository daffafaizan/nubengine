      I. To assess the complete response (CR) rate with lenalidomide and sonidegib (LDE225)
      maintenance following an upfront single autologous stem cell transplant (SCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of lenalidomide and LDE225 when used as maintenance therapy in
      patients post autologous SCT.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival rate at 1 and 2 years post autologous SCT.

      III. To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negative status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and lenalidomide PO QD on
      days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stringent complete response (sCR),
      CR, very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), minor response (MR), or stable
      disease (SD) (or unconfirmed [u]sCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR) continue treatment in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 90 days for up to 3
      years.
