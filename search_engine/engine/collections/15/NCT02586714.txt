      and fetal nutrition and body composition, and sought to determine the most accurate method of
      maternal body composition analysis in late pregnancy. This project integrates body
      composition analysis, nutrition, and metabolic factors to study the impact of maternal body
      composition and diet on placental function and fetal growth.

      Research Project: The proposed enrollment of 41 pregnant women at term (>37 weeks gestation)
      was completed in September 2013. The subjects underwent four body composition measurements
      (bioelectrical impedance, skin-fold thickness, BodPod, and deuterium dilution) and dietary
      surveys along with a fasting blood draw. The subjects returned 2 weeks postpartum for repeat
      measurements along with a DEXA scan.
