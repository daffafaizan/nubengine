    
      This is an interventional, multicenter, non-comparative post-marketing clinical investigation
      in participants implanted bilaterally with the Mini WELL Toric Ready intraocular lens (IOL)
      for 6 months after the second eye implant.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the Mini WELL Toric
      Ready IOL, in particular, visual performance and rotational stability at 6 months following
      second eye implantation.

      The first hypothesis raised for this study is related to rotational stability. The rotation
      of the Mini WELL Toric Ready IOL compared between Visit 0a (the day of surgery) and Visit 4
      (120 180 days post-operative follow-up) shall be less than ±10° in 90% of the cases.

      The second hypothesis is regarding severe visual distortions. The rate of severe visual
      distortions for the Mini WELL Toric Ready IOL reported 6 months post-operative will be less
      than 10 percents.

      The study will involve 45participants in 3 countries in order to achieve a target number of
      38 evaluable participants completing the study.

      This clinical study is composed of 9 scheduled visits. Following completion of the Informed
      Consent process, a pre-operative examination will take place to determine each patient's
      eligibility. Eligible patients, who wish to continue with the study, will be invited to
      undergo their first surgical procedure within 30 days. They will be required to undergo their
      second surgical procedure within 2 weeks of the initial operation. They will also be required
      to return for additional post-operative follow-up visits, 1-2 days after each eye surgery,
      7-14 days after each eye surgery, 30-60 days after bilateral surgery and 120-180 days after
      bilateral surgery.
