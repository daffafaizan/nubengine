      ultrasound, the forced vital capacity(FVC), and chemical examinations including blood routine
      examination, routine urine test, liver function, renal function. During tranilast treatment
      (0.1g each time, three times a day) , participants need regular follow-up (1 per month)
      including liver and kidney function, blood glucose level monitoring, every three months to
      retest ultrasound and the forced vital capacity(FVC). With 3 month as a time point,
      participants were observed for four points(one point if only skin invasion ).After the
      experiment, the experimental data will be arranged and the data will be statistically
      processed (t test) to determine whether it is meaningful.
