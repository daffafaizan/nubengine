      2) a high glucose (HG) trial. Each trial was blind to the participant, performed in a random
      order, and was 15 d in length. During days 1-14 of each trial, the participants consumed
      either 710 ml per day of a HF-sweetened beverage (sweetened with 50 g fructose and 15 g
      glucose) for 2-wk (HF trial) or 710 ml per day of a HG-sweetened beverage (sweetened with 50
      g glucose and 15 g fructose) for 2-wk (HG trial) on top of their normal diet. In addition,
      the participants were instructed to maintain their normal physical activity levels during
      each trial (which were measured with an accelerometer). On day 15 of each trial, the
      participants reported to the lab after a ~ 11 h overnight fast for metabolic testing. During
      this testing day, the participants remained in the lab for 12 h and consumed three liquid
      meals (one meal every 4 h and HF meals during HF trial and HG meals during HG trial), while
      blood samples were taken every 15 or 30 min throughout the 12 h testing day. During testing,
      the participants remained physically inactive (< 3,000 steps).
