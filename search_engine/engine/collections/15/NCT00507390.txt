      Medical School, will be recruited. All these patients have a history of documented
      ventricular arrhythmia. Data from previous studies predict that 90% of these patients will
      have abnormal MTWA. A total of 45 ICD patients will be recruited. The study design will be a
      double blind randomised placebo controlled crossover design. A baseline MTWA test will be
      performed and patients with an abnormal test will be selected. The patients will be
      randomised to receive fish oil supplements (2g/day) or placebo for 8 weeks each. At the end
      of each intervention period, a repeat MWTA test will be performed. A 10 ml venous blood
      sampled will also be collected at baseline, and after each intervention period (3 samples in
      total). Patients in atrial fibrillation, frequent atrial or ventricular ectopics, or with
      ventricular pacing from the ICD, unstable angina, NYHA IV heart failure, pregnancy or child
      bearing potential will be excluded from the study.

      End Points of the Study. The primary endpoint will be quantitative and qualitative measures
      of MTWA during n-3 PUFAs treatment compared to placebo.

      Statistical Analysis: Quantitative differences in MTWA measurements will be analysed by a
      Student's t-test and qualitative differences by a chi squared test. A probability of 0.05%
      will be considered significant.
