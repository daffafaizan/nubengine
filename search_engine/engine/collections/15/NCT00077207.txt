      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of an induction and maintenance regimen
           comprising carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide in children with progressive
           and/or symptomatic low-grade gliomas.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine 3-year progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Correlate response and progression-free survival with the genomic profile of tumors in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22;
           vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; and oral temozolomide on days 43-47.
           Four weeks after the completion of induction therapy, patients achieving stable or
           responding disease proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive carboplatin and temozolomide as in induction
           therapy and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 10 weeks for a
           total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
