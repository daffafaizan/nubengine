    
      Fifty glaucoma patients (POAG and PEX) planned for trabeculectomy will be recruited.

      At baseline, patients will be trained to use the iCare Home tonometer (RTHome), a handheld
      device based on rebound tonometry and designed for patients to use at home. After the
      training session and when patients feel confident, a measurement will be recorded. At the
      same visit, a new measurement will be obtained by the study staff, an optometrist or a nurse,
      using the same device. No IOP values will be visible for the examiner at that point. A single
      IOP measurement will be obtained by the same study staff using Goldmann applanation tonometry
      (GAT). Patients will come for a second visit where new measurements will be made in the same
      way as at baseline.

      In between visits, patients will borrow the iCare Home tonometer to measure their IOP at 06
      and 10 am, and at 2, 6 and 10 pm during three consecutive days to obtain an IOP curve.

      Two-three months after trabeculectomy, a new IOP curve will be obtained following the same
      procedure as pre-operatively. There will be no restrictions in patients' daily activities
      regarding diet, physical activity or slee. If patients use any eyedrops, they will continue
      to use them as prescribed.
