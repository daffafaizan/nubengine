      complication-free rate of the 4-SITE Lead/Header System in order to verify its clinical
      performance, long-term reliability and functional integrity. The LSS of 4-SITE Study is a
      non-randomized, multi-center, global clinical investigation of subjects implanted with the
      4-SITE Lead/Header System. The study is designed to collect product performance information,
      any reportable adverse events and withdrawal data.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate, document and report on the appropriate
      clinical performance, the long-term reliability and the functional integrity of the 4-SITE
      Lead/Header System. This 4-SITE Lead/Header System consists of a 4-SITE ENDOTAKÂ® RELIANCE
      defibrillation lead connected to a 4-SITE Header (which is the only PG component under study)
      of a single or dual chamber (VR and DR) implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or a
      cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD (CRT-D) BSC pulse generator. Additionally,
      system-related diagnostic information and implant data will be collected during the conduct
      of this study.
