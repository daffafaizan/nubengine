      dimensions such as walking speed and distance, etc. Such skills remain compromised in the
      majority of stroke survivors due to insufficient or lack of targeted practice. The
      investigators propose to test a new, individually-tailored intervention, developed by the
      research team, grounded in best evidence in community ambulation, principles of motor
      learning and participatory action research. This unique intervention will combine virtual
      reality (VR) and field training practice to optimize learning that can be generalized to
      daily walking activities.

      Participants will engage in the 4-week, individually-tailored intervention that comprises of
      supervised VR training sessions (3 times/week) performed in the clinical setting. VR sessions
      will be completed by field training assignments. Subjects will be assessed twice prior to the
      intervention, immediately after the intervention and at follow up.

      Generalized estimating equations will be used to compare changes in main and secondary
      outcomes across time points, with each personal factor of interest (e.g. walking capacity,
      visual-perceptual function, and cognitive function) analyzed individually while adjusting for
      age. Outcomes on adherence, safety and acceptability will be analyzed with descriptive
      statistics.

      Required sample size was estimated based on Green's rule (effect size=0.5, power=80%, Î±=0.05)
      with a variance inflation factor assuming moderate within-subject correlations for 3
      post-baseline measurement time points. This yields a sample size of 30. Assuming a worst-case
      scenario of 30% attrition rate, a total of 40 stroke subjects (20/site) will be recruited.
