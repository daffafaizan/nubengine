      microbiome is in the front face of microbiome-host cross-talk. Confocal laser endomicroscopy
      (CLE) can provide realtime mucosal images during ongoing endoscopy. We hypothesized that the
      mucosal pattern, here evaluated by endomicroscopy, may constitute specific microbiome niches
      and participate the evolvement of the mucosal microbiome.
