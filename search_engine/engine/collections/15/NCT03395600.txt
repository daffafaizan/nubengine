      anaesthesia, lipophilic opioids such as sufentanil, are often combined with local anesthetics
      to prolong the duration of analgesia and improve the analgesic effect. However, dose
      combinations of local anesthetics and opioids, especially in the initial loading dose, vary
      greatly from hospital to hospital and often depend upon the different routines adopted by
      anesthesiologists. In clinical practice, there are still some controversy about opioid dose
      selection in terms of analgesic onset time and adverse reactions.

      In this study, three combinations of bupivacaine and sufentanil were chosen, commonly used in
      the clinic, and extended the observation period to 24 hours after delivery. We hypothesized
      that increasing the concentration of local anesthetic, rather than increasing the dose of
      sufentanil, would achieve a faster analgesic effect with minimal adverse effects on the
      mother and fetus. To test our hypothesis, our primary outcome was to compare the times of
      analgesia onset of the three combinations, and the secondary outcomes were to compare the
      effects on maternal and infant adverse reactions.
