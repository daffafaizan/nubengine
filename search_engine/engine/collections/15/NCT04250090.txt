      placing ureteral stents include improvement of ureteral obstruction, protecting renal
      function and drainage of infection. Although there are several reports regarding the
      effectiveness of long-term ureteral stents for malignancy ureteral obstruction, ureteral
      stricture and urolithiasis, the experience is limited about the long-term ureteral stents
      made by Taiwan. Thus, The investigators will conduct this post-marketing survey to observe
      and investigate the changes of ureteral stents, e.g. hydronephrosis, infection and stone
      formation. Now this product has been approved by European Medical Device Administration. The
      investigators have to propose the 5-year post-market survey report. Though this observation
      study, The investigators can further understand the clinical safety and effectiveness of
      placing ureteral stents
