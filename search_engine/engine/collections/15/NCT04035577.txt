      IntelliCare Hub app and encouraged to use it daily. To ensure a sample representative of
      likely end users, 10 students from each site will be recruited: 5 with elevated distress as
      measured by scores > 10 on either the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 and 5 without elevated scores on either
      measure, for a total of 20 participants. The rationale for 10 participants in each group is
      based on past usability research indicating saturation is typically reached within 10
      participants. This trial aims to identify software bugs and usability problems that emerge
      over extended use and to examine preliminary effects of program use. During the trial,
      participants will be prompted to complete the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 every week. At baseline, 4
      weeks, and 8 weeks, participants will be prompted within the app to complete the Depression
      Literacy Questionnaire and Anxiety Literacy Questionnaire to measure mental health literacy,
      the Knowledge and Beliefs about Services scale to measure knowledge of campus mental health
      services, the Barriers to Mental Health Help-Seeking questionnaire to measure treatment
      barriers, and the Cognitive and Behavioral Response to Stress Scale to measure cognitive and
      behavioral coping skills. At 4 and 8 weeks participants will be asked to participate in a
      user-feedback interview via the telephone. This is to gain insight on the user's experience
      with the app.
