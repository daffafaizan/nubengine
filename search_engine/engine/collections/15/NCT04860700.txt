      To determine the anti-tumor activity of anlotinib hydrochloride (Objective Response rate,ORR)
      in patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety profile of anlotinib. II. To assess progression-free survival time. III.
      To assess disease control rate.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anlotinib hydrochloride 12mg orally once daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo urine and blood sample collection, imaging examinations at baseline and
      periodically during study.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.
