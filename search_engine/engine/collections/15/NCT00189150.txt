      commonly administered together in transplant patients. Following oral administration, both
      MMF and VGCV are metabolized to active forms, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and gancoclovir (GCV)
      respectively. Both MPA and GCV are eliminated through kidney and renal excretion, but there
      is no data on how MPA pharmacokinetic parameters are affected by GCV at steady state
      condition. Both MPA and GCV can cause neutropenia and although unsubstantiated, some
      clinicians have observed an increased occurrence of neutropenia when these agents are used in
      combination. In the presence of neutropenia, practitioners are often challenged when making
      decisions regarding whether the dosage of one or both agents should be reduced. It would be
      useful to know whether the neutropenia is due to increased drug concentration or whether it
      is due to direct effects of these agents on the bone marrow.
