    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo-controlled
      (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a
      real effect in a clinical trial), parallel-group (a medical research study comparing the
      response in 2 or more groups of participants receiving different interventions), multi-center
      (more than one clinical site will work on a medical research study), protocol of ustekinumab.
      The protocol will consist of 2 studies: an Induction study and a Maintenance study with
      unique endpoints. Screening period will be up to 8 Weeks. Induction study will be at least 8
      weeks duration for each participant. Participant with clinical response in the Induction
      study will be eligible for the Maintenance study. The Maintenance study will be 44 weeks
      duration. After completion of the maintenance study, a long term extension will follow
      eligible participants for an additional 3 years. Clinical remission will be evaluated at Week
      8 in the Induction study. Clinical remission among ustekinumab Induction responders will be
      evaluated at week 44 in the Maintenance study. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout.
