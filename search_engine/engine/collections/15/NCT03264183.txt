      the normal values and ranges for pathology findings have been defined by transthoracic means
      alone. TEE offers different images planes when compared to TTE, which may make the
      measurements obtained differ from those obtained by TTE. In the operating room environment
      the vast majority of echocardiography is completed by transesophageal means for many reasons;
      largely access to the patient and the continuous use of TEE as a hemodynamic monitor.
      However, given the fact that most echocardiographic measurements have only been validated by
      TTE, there remains a question as to the validity or precision of TEE-derived measurements.
