    
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CRP apheresis in patients
      following ischemic stroke. CRP apheresis is to be conducted with the aim of reducing cerebral
      damage following the guideline-appropriate primary therapy of ischemic stroke.

      A possible protective effect of CRP apheresis will be assessed by clinical scores, laboratory
      determination of immunologic parameters and determination of the size of the infarct area by
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      The study will be randomized, controlled and monocentric.
