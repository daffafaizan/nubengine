    
      Up to 30 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of Heart Failure will be enrolled in the study.
      It is expected that the subjects will be enrolled over a period of approximately 6 months.

      3 follow up visits are planned at 2, 4 and 6 months (+/- one week) following the LINQ ICM
      implant.

      The total expected duration of the study is of about 1 year. According to the enrolment
      chronological order, each subject will be allocated to Diuretic Suspension group (DS),
      Diuretic Increase (DI) or Diuretic+MRA medication Suspension (DMS), which will define the
      medication regimen before the follow-up visit.

      Primary objective of the study is detecting the variation of impedance magnitude and the time
      of occurrence after medication regimen changes will be evaluated at each follow-up.
