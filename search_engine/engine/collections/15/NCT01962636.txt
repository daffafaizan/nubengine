      diseases.

        -  data collection from transplant preparative therapy consisting of treatments with
           chemotherapeutic regimens and total body irradiation.

        -  data collection from umbilical cord blood selection and infusion.

        -  data collection from standard supportive disease and transplant related care.

      Pre- and post-transplant medication, UCB selection and infusion, supportive care, and
      follow-up will be according to the current University of Minnesota BMT guidelines.

      An average of 18 patients are expected to be treated on this protocol per year.
