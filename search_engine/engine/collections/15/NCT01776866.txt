      associated with lower contrast usage and radiation exposure compared with standard coronary
      angiography (SA). Single-axis rotational coronary angiography (RA) has been proved by
      previous studies without any reduction in diagnostic accuracy compared to SA. However, the
      rotational protocol is obvious different between DARCA and single-axis RA. A recent study has
      assessed the diagnostic accuracy of DARCA, but this study was not designed for image content
      analysis and the number of patients included did not provide sufficient statistical power to
      allow a valid comparison of DARCA with SA. The diagnostic accuracy of DARCA aroused our
      attention.
