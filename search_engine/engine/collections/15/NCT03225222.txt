      urological practice. Although robust data from the European Randomised study of Screening for
      Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) suggest a disease specific survival benefit in favor of
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based PCa screening, the coinciding unfavorable harm-benefit
      precludes that PCa screening can be adopted as a public health policy. The diagnostic pathway
      needs to be optimized to reduce unnecessary testing and to avoid diagnosing those cancers
      that will never harm a patient if not detected through screening. Some men may thus benefit
      from PCa screening, but with the currently used diagnostics (i.e. the PSA test and systematic
      TRUS (transrectal ultrasound )-guided prostate biopsy) many more men are harmed by
      unnecessary testing and the cascade of diagnostic and treatment related events that follow.

      Further refinements to screening strategies, focusing on detecting only those PCa that are
      potentially life threatening (clinically significant) are needed to become acceptable to the
      general population and health care providers. The investigators propose such a refinement
      within this protocol, with upfront individual risk prediction and in addition a MRI-driven
      diagnostic pathway in only those men that are considered to be at intermediate/high-risk of
      having a potentially life threatening PCa (in general defined as Gleason sum Score (GS) =7).
