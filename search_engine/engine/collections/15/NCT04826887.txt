      alternative lasers and surgical procedures used for BPH. The SOLTIVE Laser system is a
      compact system which is significantly smaller than Holmium laser systems. The laser fiber is
      also smaller in diameter allowing for improved maneuverability with decreased fiber
      degradation and endoscope damage. The continuous wave pattern produces fast, hemostatic cuts
      during the removal and furthermore the associated hemostasis improves the visual field.
      Additionally, based on the 1940nm wavelength is absorbed nearly five times more in water. For
      all the stated reasons, the SOLTIVE Thulium Laser should improve the enucleation efficiency
      and warrants further investigation.
