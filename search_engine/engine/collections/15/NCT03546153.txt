      pain do not know the cause of their pain. This leads to ineffective treatments.

      Recently, the idea of an over activated nervous system is thought to be one of the main
      reasons for chronic pain. Over activated nervous system means pain processing areas in the
      spine or brain might be more sensitive. Aerobic exercise, such as walking and cycling, is
      often used to decrease chronic pain. Aerobic exercise is a form of physical exercise that
      strengthen the heart and lungs in order to improve the body's utilization of oxygen.

      The researchers want to examine if aerobic exercise is effective in decreasing over
      activation of the nervous system. Gaining a better understanding of effects of aerobic
      exercise on the nervous system may lead to more effective treatments for low back pain.
