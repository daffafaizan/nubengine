      to gather preliminary data for a grant submission. No safety issues were found in the adult
      pilot study. This study will evaluate the effect of different doses of propanolol. The risks
      of this study involve the risks of three (3) blood draws and the risks of propanolol. In
      order to minimize the risks children with sickle cell disease and asthma will be excluded
      because asthma is a contraindication to the use of propanolol. In addition, patients will not
      be hypertensive or bradycardic.
