      polymerase chain reaction in detecting minimal residual disease following therapy with
      cladribine in patients with hairy cell leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are obtained from patients at time of bone marrow
      biopsies to assess minimal residual disease using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and
      polymerase chain reaction. Patients are followed for 2 years or until disease relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-24 months.
