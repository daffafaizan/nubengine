      to reduce oxidative stress and improve recovery from cardiac surgery, particularly in elderly
      and high risk cases. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of perioperative metabolic
      therapy at a biochemical and clinical level in cardiac surgical patients.

      Methods Patients (n = 117, mean age 65 Â± 1.0 years, 74% male) undergoing elective coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery were randomized to receive for a minimum of 2
      weeks before and one month after surgery, either metabolic therapy (coenzyme Q10, magnesium
      orotate, lipoic acid, omega-3 fatty acids and selenium) or placebo. Biochemical and clinical
      outcomes were assessed.
