      patients will be allocated in intervention group and receive nutrient rich flour mix i.e.
      IAtta (100 g) along with dietary and physical activity counseling and 75 patients will be
      allocated in the control group who will receive whole wheat flour with dietary and physical
      activity counseling. Intervention group patients will collect 14 packets of 100 g of IAtta
      every fortnight during their clinician appointments while the control patients will collect
      14 packets of 100 g of whole wheat flour at every clinician visit for 6 months.

      Dietary counseling for 30 minutes will be imparted to all patients on each visit by the
      nutritionist. Depending on the physical status of the patients, low level of physical
      activity (walking and/or stairs), will be encouraged daily during counseling sessions.

      Nutritional, biochemical, quality of life and anthropometric estimations would be assessed at
      baseline, after 3 months and at 6 months of intervention for all patients.
