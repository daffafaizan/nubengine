      for tissue acquisition for pancreatic lesions. Despite widespread adoption of the techniques,
      the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA for pancreatic lesion is highly variable, with sensitivities
      ranging from 64-95%, specificities ranging from 75-100% and overall diagnostic accuracy
      ranging from 78-95%.

      Despite its mainstay as the primary technique for tissue acquisition, EUS-FNA has several
      limitations. The standard EUS-FNA does not routinely provide core biopsy specimen with
      preserved tissue architecture, which is required for immunohistochemical staining and for
      definitive diagnosis of conditions, such as lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors,
      Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-4-associated lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis. Furthermore,
      the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA is highly dependent on the availability of bedside
      cytotechnologist or cytopathologist for rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE), which increases the
      overall cost required to perform EUS-FNA.

      Recently, multiple dedicated EUS fine needle biopsy (FNB) needles have been developed to
      obtain core specimens. Early small studies have shown promising results with these EUS-FNB
      needles.

      The objective of this paired cohort study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA
      with ROSE compared to EUS-FNA with ROSE. If EUS-FNB without ROSE is shown to be non-inferior
      to the current standard of care of EUS-FNA with ROSE in pancreatic lesions, this study has
      the potential to make EUS-guided tissue acquisition more economical (with elimination for the
      need for cytopathology staff onsite) as well as provide core histological specimen without
      sacrificing the overall diagnostic yield.
