    
      This study will examine trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) versus trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)
      in patients with HER2-positive primary BC who have residual invasive disease in breast or
      axillary lymph nodes with higher risk of recurrence, which includes patients who were
      inoperable at disease presentation or had pathological node-positive status after neoadjuvant
      therapy.

      The primary objective is to compare invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) between T-DXd and
      T-DM1 treatment arms in this population. The key secondary objective of the study is to
      evaluate disease-free survival (DFS).
