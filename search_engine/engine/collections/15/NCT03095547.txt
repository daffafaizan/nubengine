    
      Open label randomised parallel group evaluation of three or four dosing schedules over a
      period of 21 days. Subjects will be randomised into the groups as follows:

        1. Cohort A: Pre-treat with tacrolimus 2 mg on day -9 and cyclosporine A 100 mg on Day -3
           and obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) curves for both compounds prior to dosing with F901318.
           Then, F901318 360 mg b.i.d. for 1 or two days followed by 240 mg b.i.d. for 18 or 19
           days (Days 2 or 3-20) and 240 mg o.m. on Day 21 (n=12, ideally 6 females minimum 3
           females, 6 males, maximum 9 males). Dose again with tacrolimus on Day 9 and with
           cyclosporine A on day 16 and obtain full PK curves.

        2. Cohort B: F901318 360 mg b.i.d. for 1 or 2 days followed by 240 mg b.i.d. for 5 or 6
           days. On Day 8, add posaconazole tablets 300 mg b.i.d. followed by 300 mg daily for 6
           days (Days 9-14) and decrease F901318 dose to 120 mg daily from Day 8 onwards. On Day
           15, discontinue posaconazole but continue F901318 for a further 6 days at a dose of 120
           mg daily (Days 15 to 21) (n=12, ideally 6 females, 6 males).

        3. Cohort C: F901318 360 mg b.i.d. for one or two days followed by 240 mg b.i.d for 19 days
           (Day 1-20) and 240 mg o.m. on Day 21. On Day 8, add pantoprazole 40 mg daily for 7 days.
           On Day 15, discontinue pantoprazole but continue F901318 240 mg b.i.d to day 20 and 240
           mg o.m. on Day 21 (n=12, ideally 6 females, 6 males).

        4. Cohort D (optional): F901318 for 21 days. Will be conducted, if necessary after
           completion of cohorts A-C. Dose schedule to be determined on the basis of results from
           ongoing study F901318-01-06-16 and cohort A of this study but could be up to 480 mg
           b.i.d for up to three days followed by up to 360 mg bid for 17-19 days and up to 360
           o.m. on Day 21 with the objective of achieving and maintaining C12 of 1Âµg/mL throughout
           the dosing period (n=12, ideally 6 females, 6 males). The decision to proceed will be
           taken based on QC'd pharmacokinetic data by the PI and representative(s) of the Sponsor.

      Intensive PK evaluations of F901318 and metabolite and concomitant medications will occur as
      follows:

        -  Day 1 (F901318 and metabolite alone)

        -  Day 7 (F901318 and metabolite alone)

        -  Day 14 (F901318 and metabolite and posaconazole cohort B)

        -  Day 21 (F901318 and metabolite)

      Peak and trough levels of F901318 and metabolite (and posaconazole in cohort B on Days 8-20)
      will be obtained on intermediate days.

      PK curves for tacrolimus will be obtained from Day -9 to Day -3 and from Day 9 to Day 15
      (cohort A)

      PK curves for cyclosporine A will be obtained from Day -3 to Day 1 (prior to dosing with
      F901318) and from Day 18 to Day 21 (cohort A)

      Adverse events and 12 lead ECGs will be recorded and blood and urine samples will be obtained
      for safety evaluation throughout.

      All subjects will return for a post-study visit 8 to 10 days after the last dose of study
      medication.
