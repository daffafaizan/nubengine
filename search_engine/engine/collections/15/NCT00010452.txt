      treatment (no prior treatment vs prior surgical treatment) and geographic area.

      Patients who meet all study criteria are put in the "Immediate Treatment Group." Patients
      receive an intralesional injection of picibanil (OK432) with the aid of ultrasonography or
      transillumination for localization of cysts. Treatment repeats every 6-8 weeks for a total of
      up to 4 injections.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.
