    
      Twenty healthy adults (age range = 20 - 85 years) with intact buttock and bilateral posterior
      thigh sensation and intact skin integrity will be recruited. Twenty additional individuals
      (ages 20 - 85 years) with a history of stroke (n=10) and spinal cord injury (n=10) with
      documented sensory impairment, but intact skin integrity in the area of the buttock and
      posterior thighs will also be recruited. Individuals post-stroke will likely have impaired
      sensation on one side of their buttock & leg; whereas, individuals post-spinal cord injury
      will likely have impaired sensation bilaterally in the buttock and posterior thigh areas. The
      goal is to recruit equal numbers of males and females with a variety of body builds (height,
      weight, and body mass index) across the age range in both groups.

      Procedures: In one 2 1/2 hour session, participants will a) sit still on [static condition]
      and b) perform the dynamic task of reaching in multiple directions [active condition] on the
      Ease alternating pressure cushion and on one static air cushion [randomized for order] for an
      estimated duration of one hour (32 minutes x two cushions) so that pressure mapping
      comparisons between cushions can be made. "The motion of the Ease cushions regularly shifts
      those points of pressure [every 3 minutes], and allows fresh blood to flow where the pressure
      has been lifted." Pressure mapping will capture the pressure amount, duration, and
      distribution of pressure between the skin of the buttock and posterior thighs and the
      wheelchair cushion surface. Documentation of the skin response (skin becomes pink, red, or
      blanches), and the participant's subjective opinions of comfort, ease of transfer, and
      postural stability will occur.
