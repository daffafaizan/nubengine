      patients with breast cancer compared with their three weekly counterparts. It is unknown if
      dose dense neoadjuvant therapy will improve survival in resectable breast cancer. This study
      is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dose-dense(biweekly) carboplatin and paclitaxel Â±
      trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment in early breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic
      complete response is used as a surrogate marker for survival. Safety and tolerability
      assessed by number of grade 4 toxicities and hospitalizations.
