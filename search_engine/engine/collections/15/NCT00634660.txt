      are 16 to 50 years old. Seven cohorts are planned, each consisting of 5 subjects; the cohorts
      as planned are 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg. Increasing doses of
      rAvPAL-PEG will be assessed sequentially until the final dose is evaluated or any of the
      stopping criteria are reached. Subjects will each receive a single dose and then will be
      followed for a total of 42 days (6 weeks) with visits to the clinical research unit (CRU) as
      specified in the Schedule of Events Toxicity will be measured according to the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v 3).
