    
      T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is a neoplasm of lymphoblasts committed to the T-cell
      lineage, typically composed of small to medium-sized blast with scant cytoplasm, moderately
      condensed to dispersed chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli, involving bone marrow and blood
      or presenting with primary involvement of the thymus or of nodal or extranodal sites.
      T-ALL/LBL is generally considered a higher-risk disease than B-ALL. Compared to B-ALL,
      T-LBL/ALL is associated with a higher risk of induction failure, early relapse, and isolated
      CNS relapse.

      Chidamide is a novel oral HDACi with promising activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
      Chidamide, a new oral isotype-selective HDACi, approved in China for the treatment of R/R
      PTCL in December 2014. Based on the pediatric-inspired, PEG-L-asparaginase-intensified and
      MRD-directed PDT-ALL-2016 protocol, this open-label, two-arm, multi-site trial PDT-ALL-LBL is
      aimed to evaluate the safety and effect of oral histone deacetylase inhibitor chidamide for
      adult T-ALL/LBL. Compared to PDT-ALL-2016 for B-ALL, HDACi chidamide will be administrated
      from induction therapy to maintenance therapy, along with higher dose of consolidation
      regimen of cytarabine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide.

      The intervention of PDT-ALL-LBL consists of diagnostic test (bone marrow aspiration, flow
      immunophenotyping, karyotypingï¼ŒFISH, NGS, Flow-MRD), induction regimen (chidamide,
      dexamethasone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, Idarubicin, pegaspargase), consolidation
      regimen (chidamide, prednisone, cytarabine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, etoposide,
      adriamycin, 6-mercaptopurine, pegaspargase), MRD assessment (MRD1/d14, MRD2/d24, MRD3/d45,
      MRD4/pre-allo-HSCT) and maintenance regimen (chidamide, vincristine, methotrexate,
      6-mercaptopurine), intrathecal injection, radiation therapy (for mediastinum- and/or central
      nervous system-involved lymphoma/leukemia) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation for patients with donor.
