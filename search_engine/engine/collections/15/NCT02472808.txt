      conventional TBNA with EBUS-TBNA for obtaining tissue samples from mediastinal lymph nodes
      for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis when combined with transbronchial lung biopsy and
      endobronchial biopsy. It will be conducted on 80 consecutive patients with suspected
      sarcoidosis presenting to Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders in AIIMS (All
      India Institute of Medical Sciences), New Delhi. This study will help to know whether EBUS
      (Endobronchial Ultrasound guided) or conventional TBNA is better for obtaining tissue samples
      from mediastinal lymph nodes for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. It will also help to know the
      value of adding rapid onsite evaluation of the cytology smears to both the procedures. It
      will also help to determine the overall yield of different procedures when they are combined
      for obtaining tissue samples for a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
