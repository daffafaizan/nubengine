    
      Primary Objectives

        1. To determine the safety of CD22.CAR-T cells in lymphoma patients refractory or resistent
           to anti-CD19:TCRz:CD28 CAR-T cells

        2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of CD22.CAR-T cells.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine the feasibility of CD22.CAR-T cells in lymphoma patients refractory or
           resistent to anti-CD19:TCRz:CD28 CAR-T cells

        2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of CD22.CAR-T cells.

        3. To assess the intratumoral infiltration of CD22.CAR-T cells.

        4. To correlate the subsets and differentiation of CD22.CAR-T cells to observed anti-tumor
           efficacy
