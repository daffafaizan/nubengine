      the prospect of enabling the development of new therapeutic avenues for patients diagnosed
      with cancer in the central nervous system.

      During the patient's routine operative procedure, if extra tissue deemed unnecessary for
      diagnostic or clinical purposes is available, selected samples will undergo DNA and/or RNA
      extraction and integrity analysis, whole genome and RNA sequencing, DNA and RNA methylome
      analyses, proteomic analysis, immunoprofiling, and primary culturing of the tumor cells.
      These cultures will then be used for drug screenings and to create patient-derived
      xenografts.
