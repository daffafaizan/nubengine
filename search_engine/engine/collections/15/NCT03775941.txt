      Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) will be analyzed for the present study. Zip
      code-based recruitment and monitoring enrollment for key demographic variables (e.g., age,
      sex, ethnicity) were used to maintain adequate representation of Rockland County and prevent
      sampling biases (e.g., cohort effects). NKI-RS eligibility was designed for inclusivity.

      Procedure: All participants completed a medical evaluation, psychiatric interview,
      self-report questionnaires, standardized battery of cognitive tests, and neuroimaging at NKI.
      Complete details about the MRI measurement parameters can be located on the NKI-RS website
      for DTI and MPRAGE and protocols. Quality assurance of raw data, inclusive of monitoring
      standard operating procedures, error-handling, and compiling the data dictionary, is
      maintained by NKI-RS. Raw neuroimaging data was acquired by NKI-RS and processed at Suffolk
      University using TRACULA and FreeSurfer 5.3.

      Statistical Plan: Analyses will be performed on de-identified phenotypic and neuroimaging
      data from adult NKI-RS participants available at the start of this study (October 2016).
      Analyses will evaluate the potential for CRF to modulate decline in WM integrity and EF
      observed with aging. Mixed-effects modeling will investigate the extent to which CRF predicts
      WM integrity, as both a global measurement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and FA within nine
      major WM tracts. Structural equation modeling will examine whether higher FA within frontal
      WM tracts partially mediates a positive relationship between CRF and EF. The role of age and
      clinical characteristics (e.g., cardiovascular risk factors, depression) will also be
      explored as covariates in the link between CRF, WM, and EF.
