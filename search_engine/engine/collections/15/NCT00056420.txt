      involved tics and voluntary movement in patients with Tourette's syndrome or chronic motor
      tic disorder. By employing a combination of EEG methods that utilize analyses in the domains
      of both frequency (e.g., event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS),
      event-related partial coherence, phase coherence) and time (e.g., event-related partial
      correlation), we intend to determine

        1. Whether the cortical neurocircuitry involved in the performance of a simple, voluntary
           motor task differs in patients with tic disorders from that of healthy volunteers;

        2. Whether the network involved in the generation of unwanted tics differs from that of
           normal voluntary movement (i.e., mimicked tics); and

        3. What role, if any, premonitory urge and/or tic suppression plays in the modulation of
           this neurocircuitry.
