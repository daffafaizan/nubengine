      I. To evaluate the response of ponatinib (ponatinib hydrochloride) in patients with
      fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) altered cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of ponatinib in advanced solid tumors with genomic
      FGFR alterations.

      II. To assess progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with ponatinib.

      III. To determine candidate genomic and proteomic biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to
      ponatinib using unbiased high throughput approaches (exome, transcriptome, reverse phase
      protein array [RPPA]).

      IV. To assess response of ponatinib in advanced cancers with subsets of genomic FGFR
      alterations (fusions vs. amplifications vs. mutations).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ponatinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 52 weeks.
