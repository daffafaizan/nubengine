      diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis, were planned to be treated with either intravenous
      sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam-TM) or the ThermoMed-TM device of Thermosurgery
      Technologies, Inc. at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Pentostam is the standard of care
      for this disease, but the i.v. administration and the many known side effects prompt the
      search for an improved method of treating this disease, especially for milder cases. This
      study compares the safety and efficacy of these two treatment approached.
