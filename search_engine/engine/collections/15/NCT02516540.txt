      cancer during their lifetime. There is evidence from the literature that for sporadic breast
      cancer disease risk and the course of disease can be significantly influenced by physical
      activity, nutrition and weight. The hypothesis of this 3 year, prospective randomized
      multicenter efficacy trial is that a structured life-style intervention program with exercise
      training and mediterranean diet is effective regarding increased adherence to a mediterranean
      diet, reduction of body mass index, and increase of physical fitness.
