      extremity muscle fatigability and strength measures, and create a preliminary model that can
      better explain the variance in gait performance based on these muscle performance values.
      Objective criterion-based measures of physical fatigue (i.e., fatigability) and muscle
      weakness have been associated with impaired task performance in people with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). MS-related deficits in muscle capacity result in higher fall risks and a loss
      of function. However, it is unclear if lower extremity fatigability tests add clinical value
      to objective strength testing in the rehabilitation and clinical management of MS. Better
      understanding how patterns of lower extremity (LE) fatigability and strength affect mobility
      in people with MS could improve outcome measure development and inform rehabilitation
      strategies.
