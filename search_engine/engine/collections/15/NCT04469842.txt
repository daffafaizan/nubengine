      refractory to medical treatment, providing an improvement in both survival and quality of
      life.[1,2] Despite the benefits, patients are at risk for myriad side effects including
      infection, malignancy, neurologic complications (headache, tremor, seizures),
      gastrointestinal distress and renal failure, to name a few.[3] Many of these are related to
      the requisite need for life-long immunosuppression. Current standard immunosuppressive
      regimens for lung transplant recipients include calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus preferred
      over cyclosporine), antiproliferative agents (mycophenolate mofetil vs. azathioprine) and
      corticosteroids; calcineurin inhibitors serve as the backbone of immunosuppression.[4] Renal
      dysfunction is perhaps the most prevalent complication after lung transplantation, affecting
      up to 90% of post-transplant recipients.[5] By 5-year post-transplant, ~8% of patients may
      require renal replacement therapy and/or renal transplantation.[6] Renal dysfunction tends to
      occur early on in the post-transplant period. Monnier and colleagues showed in a
      single-center analysis that the incidence of acute kidney injury within the index
      hospitalization was ~75%; the median loss of glomerular function within the first year was
      ~45%.[7] Moreover, Canales and colleagues showed that >55% of patients in a cohort of 219
      lung transplant recipients had a doubling of their pre-transplant serum creatinine, the
      majority occurring within the first year post-transplant.[8] Early renal dysfunction in lung
      transplant recipients is associated with a poor overall prognosis. Broelkroleof and
      colleagues demonstrated that loss of renal function within he first month post-transplant is
      predictive of chronic kidney disease.[9] Moreover, chronic kidney disease is associated with
      a five times increased risk of mortality.[5] Perhaps the greatest contributor to the
      development of CKD in solid-organ transplant recipients are the calcineurin inhibitors
      (CNIs).[10] CNIs cause renal compromise (calcineurin inhibitor nephropathy, CIN) via acute
      and chronic mechanisms. Acute CIN is due to potent vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles in
      the kidney, resulting in ischemia.[11,12] Chronic CIN is thought to be largely mediated by
      interstitial fibrosis as the end-result of arteriolar sclerosis, oxygen free-radical injury,
      and upregulation of pro-fibrotic pathways including PDGF, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      signaling, TGFB and matrix metalloproteinase-9.[11,13] Attempts at utilizing CNI-free or
      CNI-reduced regimens in the lung transplantation population has been understudied and/or
      unsuccessful to date. Belatacept, a CTLA4-fusion molecule that prevents CD28-mediated
      co-stimulation to activate T-lymphocytes, has been well-studied in renal transplantation as
      an alternative to CNIs. The BENEFIT Trial, a phase III clinical study of Belatacept vs.
      Cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients, demonstrated improvement in patient and
      allograft survival, and mean eGFR (~70 cc/min vs ~45cc/min) at seven years. However, rates of
      biopsy proven acute cellular rejection were twice as much with Belatacept.[14] Case reports
      of Belatacept as rescue therapy in lung transplant recipients intolerant of CNIs are mixed;
      there are reports of increased ACR and fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome.[15,16]
      The mTOR inhibitor class of immunosuppression has also been incorporated into regimens in an
      effort to ameliorate CNI-toxicity. Villanueva and colleagues assessed outcomes of conversion
      to Sirolimus and reduced Tacrolimus in 49 patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
      (chronic rejection) or CNI-intolerance; there was no difference in renal function one year
      following sirolimus initiation.[17] Conversely, Shitrit and colleagues demonstrated that
      sirolimus plus low-dose tacrolimus led to an improvement in GFR of 10 mL/min, compared to
      control maintenance immunosuppression in a pilot study of sixteen lung allograft
      recipients.[18] More recently, Gottlieb and colleagues demonstrated that conversion to
      quadruple immunosuppression therapy with low-dose CNI (target tacrolimus trough 3-5) led to
      improvements in eGFR of 10cc/mL compared to standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus trough
      >5). There was no considerable difference in biopsy-proven acute rejection, chronic rejection
      and death.[20] The conversion for those in the 4-drug experimental group occurred on average
      11 months following transplant, which may account for the muted benefit; perhaps an earlier
      change in immunosuppression management would have led to more clinically significant results.
      Notably, discontinuation rates of sirolimus in case reports are variable, with most studies
      reporting a 20-80% discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal distress, pneumonitis,
      thrombocytopenia, etc., making the mTOR inhibitor class less appealing.[19] It is apparent
      that changes to immunosuppression management earlier in the post-transplant period are ideal
      to see a maximum benefit in preserved renal function.9 However, this is complicated by the
      concerns for acute cellular rejection, which has a peak incidence at 6 months post-lung
      transplantation.[21,22] Acute cellular rejection is a leading risk factor for the development
      of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD, chronic rejection).[23] Hence any dose reduction
      in CNI or the use of an agent associated with ACR (Belatacept) is less desirable within the
      first few months post-transplant.

      Given the preference to utilize a CNI-based regimen early-post transplant but still minimize
      nephrotoxic effects, the investigators seek to determine whether the early use of long acting
      tacrolimus, LCP-Tacrolimus (LCP-tacro, Envarsus XR, Veloxis Pharmaceuticals), results in
      improved renal function compared to intermediate release tacrolimus (IR-tacrolimus,
      IR-tacro). Anecdotally, LCP-tacro has been used in lung transplant recipients as an
      alternative agent for those with debilitating headache or tremor. Early use of LCP-tacro has
      not been widely adopted due to perceptions associated with ability to closely titrate trough
      levels and cost. However, early use of LCP-tacro may provide several benefits. As a
      long-acting formulation, LCP-tacro allows for daily dosing. Moreover, LCP-tacro has greater
      absorption and bioavailability, leading to decreased swings in peak and trough
      concentrations; frequent fluctuations in serum tacrolimus levels potentiates afferent
      arteriolar vasoconstriction.[24] A steady state of systemic tacrolimus trough levels is
      desirable, since tacrolimus metabolism is directly related to nephrotoxicity.[25] The use of
      LCP-Tacro has been studied in renal transplant recipients. Langone and colleagues identified
      that LCP-tacrolimus compared to IR-tacrolimus was associated with improved tremor incidence
      and quality of life.[1] Rostaing and colleagues demonstrated that the use of LCP-tacro
      compared to intermediate tacrolimus was non-inferior in terms of combined death, allograft
      failure, biopsy-proven acute rejection and loss to follow-up. However, the use of LCP-tacro
      was associated with a significant reduction in total daily dose, and a 30% reduction in peak
      dose, without an increase in biopsy proven acute rejection episodes. Although not a
      prospective end-point, there was no significant impact on renal function.[26] In other
      studies, though, higher concentration/ drug (C/D) ratios for tacrolimus are associated with
      an improved renal safety profile.[27] It is conceivable that a clinical benefit of LCP-tacro
      over IR-tacro may be better manifested in clinical arenas that require higher target
      tacrolimus trough levels, such as lung allograft recipients, where initial post-transplant
      targets can be as high as 12-15 ng/mL, compared to renal transplantation where target trough
      levels are a relatively conservative 4-8 ng/mL.[2, 3] The experience of LCP-tacrolimus in the
      realm of lung transplantation is limited. Murakoezy and colleagues studied 53 patients that
      were converted from short-acting Tacrolimus to long-acting Envarsus. Conversion was performed
      at an average 3.6 years post-transplant. Ten patients were switched back due to side-effects
      (unknown), though the remainder tolerated conversion without complication. Ahmed and
      colleagues demonstrated feasibility in using long-acting Tacrolimus in 8 patients that were
      unable to achieve sufficient therapeutic levels with a short-acting formulation due to
      suspected polymorphisms of CYP3A4/3A5.[28] McCurry and colleagues assessed safety and
      feasibility of LCP-tacrolimus in a retrospective analysis of 18 lung transplant recipients.
      They found that patients on LCP-tacro had a 27% reduction in total dose. No patients
      experienced any adverse effects. Moreover, 2/18 patients had an improvement in tremors and
      headache.[29] Given the limited experience with of LCP-tacrolimus in lung transplant
      populations, the investigators propose a prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and side-effect profile of early use LCP-tacro within the
      first 9 months post-transplantation. It is hypothesized that the early use of LCP-tacro in
      lung transplant recipients is safe and tolerable, and associated with an improved side-effect
      profile compared to patients treated with standard IR-tacro.
