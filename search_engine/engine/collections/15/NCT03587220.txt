      induce a first-degree sunburn, will be used to induce a non-specific inflammation in the
      skin. This model is well-known to produce both peripheral and central hyperalgesia through
      sensitization of peripheral and central nociceptors. Capsaicin, the active substance in chili
      peppers, is currently used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, and prolonged application of
      8% capsaicin patch causes profound desensitization to painful heat stimuli and itch
      provocations. Therefore, the investigators would like to monitor the development of
      unspecific UVB-cutaneous inflammation and consequent neurogenic flare in a capsaicin
      pre-treated area. Moreover the investigators want to test if pre-treating the skin with
      lidocaine can reduce the pain associated with the capsaicin application without affecting its
      desensitization action.
