      Test will be done at the UMRS 872 laboratory of the INSERM - Laboratory of Immunopathology
      and Therapeutic immunointervention - in Paris ; two catalytic activities will be tested: the
      DNase activity and the hydrolase activity.

      Means to analyse the two activities: digestion of plasmid and Affinity-linked Oligonucleotide
      Nuclease Assay for DNase activity and hydrolysis of a peptide PFR-MCA for hydrolase activity.
