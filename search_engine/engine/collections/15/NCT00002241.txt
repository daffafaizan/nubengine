      patients have physical exams and laboratory tests of blood and urine, and CD4 cell counts and
      plasma viral RNA are measured. At Week 24, the proportion of patients with plasma viral RNA
      below 400 copies/ml is determined to identify any clinically meaningful antiretroviral
      activity for the drug regimen. An observed response proportion of 80% or higher will be
      considered clinically meaningful.
