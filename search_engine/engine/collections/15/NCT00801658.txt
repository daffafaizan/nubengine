      frequency-doubled). Thanks to the low laser energy used and the short duration of treatment,
      only pigmented cells of the trabecular meshwork are targeted and selectively treated.
      Neighboring, non-pigmented cells and tissue are spared collateral and thermic damage, the
      architecture of the trabecular meshwork remains intact. The SLT procedure uses less than 1%
      of the energy of the ALT procedure with an extremely low pulsation duration.

      Several studies confirm the effective IOD reduction of SLT and rate the procedure as an
      relatively safe and effective therapy for glaucoma. Also repeated use of the SLT procedure is
      considered as meaningful. Meanwhile the SLT procedure is used as primary and supplementary
      treatment of glaucoma and study confirmed that the SLT procedure was just as effective as
      administration of Latanoprost in reducing IOD in newly-diagnosed glaucoma.
