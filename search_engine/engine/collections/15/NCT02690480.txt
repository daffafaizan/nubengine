    
      Patients must have at least one lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be
      accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment by CT, MRI or plan
      x-ray. Patients with bone-only disease must have a lytic or mixed (lytic + blastic) lesion,
      which has not been previously irradiated and can be accurately assessed by CT/MRI or x-ray.
      Approximately 190 patients will be randomized 1:1 between the experimental arm (approximately
      95 patients treated with fulvestrant plus palbociclib) and the control arm (approximately 95
      patients treated with fulvestrant plus placebo).

      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To compare the efficacy of fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib versus fulvestrant
      plus placebo in terms of the rate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 1 year in
      postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously
      treated with endocrine therapy for at least 5 years and remaining disease free for more than
      12 months following its completion or have "de novo" metastatic disease
