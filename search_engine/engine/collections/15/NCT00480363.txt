    
      A total of up to 120 patients diagnosed of smoldering Multiple Myeloma with high risk of
      progression to symptomatic MM will be included.

      Patients will be stratified according its diagnosis date and randomized 1 to 1 to receive
      Revlimid and Dexamethasone (Group A) in 9 treatment cycles and maintenance with lower doses
      until progression or No treatment and observation until progression (Group B).

      The patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to three study periods:
      Pre-treatment, Treatment and Follow up.

      The Pre-treatment includes Screening and baseline visits. After providing informed consent,
      patients will be evaluated for study eligibility and then Patients will be stratified and
      randomized (1:1) to Group A or Group B.

      During Treatment Period patients will be evaluated once a month. Once the treatment period
      has finished a maintenance treatment with low doses of Revlimid and Dexamethasone will be
      carry out in Group A. During this period we will evaluate response, progression-free survival
      and global survival every two months.
