      (University of Basel) as well as in Germany (University of LÃ¼beck). A total of 36
      participants will be included. The estimated duration of the study is 15 months. All
      participants play a video game from the genre "Third Person Adventure". A character is
      navigated through a fantasy world using a keyboard and mouse. In the fantasy world,
      "stations" in the form of glowing gems are sought where players have to solve different
      tasks.

      Participants are randomized to receive either the therapeutic video game with metacognitive
      training content or another video game with attention and memory tasks ("control
      intervention"). The control intervention does not include metacognitive tasks. Metacognitive
      training is an approach for the treatment of psychotic disorders, particularly delusions. The
      focus of metacognitive training is on thought distortions (so-called "cognitive biases") that
      are more pronounced in people with psychosis. The control intervention includes easily
      understandable, playful tasks. The intervention will take 4 appointments within 2 weeks.
