      stroke in cancer patients. Enrollment will occur at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
      (NYPH)/Weill Cornell Medical Center (WCMC) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
      (MSKCC). Measurements will occur at the NYPH/WCMC and MSKCC Neurovascular Ultrasound
      Laboratories, the MSKCC Central Laboratory, and the Sharp Laboratory at the University of
      California, Davis. Three groups of adult patients will be enrolled. Group 1 will consist of
      consecutive patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. Group 2 will
      be patients with acute ischemic stroke and no cancer. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 will be
      enrolled at 96 hours +/- 24 hours of stroke onset. Group 3 will include patients with active
      solid tumor cancer and no stroke. This group will allow us to confirm that differences
      between stroke patients with and without cancer are not simply incidental findings that can
      be expected in all cancer patients regardless of thrombotic status. Demographics,
      comorbidities, and stroke severity (for Groups 1 and 2 only) will be recorded on admission
      using a structured form. Study patients will undergo three facets of testing: 1) Transcranial
      Doppler (TCD) microemboli detection; 2) hematological biomarker testing; 3) peripheral blood
      leukocyte RNA gene expression analysis.
