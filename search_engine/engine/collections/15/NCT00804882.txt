      (MetS), it is unclear how metabolic risk factors impact left ventricular structure and
      function in Mexican Americans with HF. There is also a gap in the knowledge of the principal
      etiology of HF in this ethnic group. The overall objective of this pilot study is to define
      the association between MetS and and non-ischemic HF in Mexican Americans. Our central
      hypothesis is that there is a positive graded association between an increasing number of
      metabolic risk factors (ie. individual components of MetS) and increasingly compromised LV
      structure and function in this population, independent of blood pressure and CAD.
      Additionally, we hypothesize that this association is more pronounced than that seen in
      non-Hispanic whites suggesting a predominant role of MetS on HF among Mexican Americans. The
      rationale that underlies the proposed research is that, once the association between
      metabolic risk factors and HF in this ethnic group is defined, future research on the impact
      of management of these metabolic risk factors on HF outcomes, both among Mexican Americans
      and in the larger population, will be advanced.
