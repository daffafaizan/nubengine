      gradually played an important role in biomedical technology. For a large number of medical
      record data analysis, image analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism difference analysis,
      etc., all relevant research on the development and application of artificial intelligence can
      be observed extensively. For clinical indication, patients may receive a variety of
      cardiovascular routine examination and treatments, such as: cardiac ultrasound, multi-path
      ECG, cardiovascular and peripheral angiography, intravascular ultrasound and optical
      coherence tomography, electrical physiology, etc... The current study is for the
      investigative cardiovascular team to take the advantage that in addition to the examination
      and treatment the participants should appropriately receive, the investigators can also
      analyze the individual differences and using the "deep learning methodology" to analyze the
      difference in physical fitness, therapeutic effectiveness and the consideration in the safety
      of the treatment. The additional goal of this study is to improve the quality of health care,
      the realization of cardiovascular "precise medicine" especially with personal difference on
      genetic variation.

      This study will analyze the differences in the individualization of cardiovascular disease
      between diseases and other subjects to further improve the quality of care for clinical
      patients. By using artificial intelligence deep learning system, the investigators hope to
      not only improve the diagnostic rate and also gain more accurately predict the patient's
      recovery, improve medical quality in the near future.
