      I. To determine if in-office movement trackers or baseline metabolic equivalents (METs)
      groups identify those patients who are at highest risk for severe adverse event (SAE)s on
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs, unexpected healthcare
      encounters, depending on the change in activity level classification between the baseline
      METs group and mid-treatment METs group (at month 3).

      II. Explore association between patient reported outcome (PRO) data and movement tracker
      data.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete movement assessment 5-15 days prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and at day 1 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients' SAE data is collected.
      Patients are observed during their neoadjuvant chemotherapy for up to 6 months.
