      the presence of pain, the magnitude of pain, the duration of pain, and the location of pain.

      The hypotheses of this study are:

        -  Treatment with Invisalign ® aligners result in less pain than the braces

        -  Treatment with Invisalign ® aligners result in less irritation to the soft tissues with
           braces

        -  Pain should increase each time the aligners are put in the mouse and decrease until
           disappearing on the third day.

        -  The quality of life will be most affected by treatment with braces than with Invisalign
           ®.

        -  Null Hypothesis: There is no difference at all points between the two treatments.
