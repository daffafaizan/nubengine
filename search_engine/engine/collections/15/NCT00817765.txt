      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

      Fosamprenavir is a PI that is used to treat HIV-infection in combination with ritonavir. Once
      hydrolyzed to amprenavir, this substance is a substrate for CYP3A4. Ritonavir is an extremely
      potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and serves as a booster of the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir.
      Posaconazole is a very potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and therefore might enhance amprenavir
      pharmacokinetics in a similar way as ritonavir.

      The current study is designed to test this hypothesis. When there is an indication for
      antifungal therapy in an HIV-infected patient, temporal replacement of ritonavir by
      posaconazole would be an attractive option for combined treatment of HIV and fungal
      infection.
