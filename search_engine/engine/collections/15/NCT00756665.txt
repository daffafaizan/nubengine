    
      This is a multi-center, prospective active surveillance study with selective intervention in
      patients with previously untreated, clinically localized prostate cancer at diagnosis.
      Candidates are assessed based on an extended core biopsy, serum PSA (including PSA kinetics,
      if available), digital rectal examination (DRE), and assessment of cancer grade and extent.

      Active surveillance is defined as serial PSA measurements and prostate examination with
      routine prostate biopsy and therapeutic intervention considered at the time one or more of
      the following:

        -  Grade or volume progression

        -  Clinical progression

      The objectives of the study are as follows:

      Primary Objective

      â€¢ To discover and confirm biomarkers that predict aggressive disease as defined by
      pre-specified histological, PSA, clinical criteria, or outcomes based on these variables.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the proportion of patients on active surveillance who progress based on the
           above criteria.

        -  To determine the clinical predictors of disease progression.
