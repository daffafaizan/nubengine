      determine whether they would receive a CPM. Those subjects receiving a CPM were instructed to
      use it for 4-6 hours daily throughout the first two postoperative weeks. The total number of
      pain medications and average pain scores over the two weeks, as well as Hip Outcome Score
      Activity of Daily Living (HOS ADL) scores at standard time points were compared via a two
      sample t-test and intention-to-treat analysis.
