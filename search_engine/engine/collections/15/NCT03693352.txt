      capnodynamic equation to determine changes in functional residual capacity measured during
      anesthesia. The investigators will studied 40 mechanically ventilated patients undergoing
      general anesthesia. Functional residual capacity will be continuously measured in a non
      invasive way using expired carbon dioxide. Changes in functional residual capacity with
      standard modification in body positioning (Trendelenburg or anti-Trendelenburg position) and
      ventilatory settings wiil be tested.
