      doses. Treatment will begin with 5 mg, three times a day and will increase by 50% every two
      weeks to 10-15 mg, three to six times a day, as clinically needed, and if tolerated. Patients
      will be monitored for strength and side effects via routine out-patient clinic visits at
      initial intervals of 1 month, increasing to intervals of 12 months as permitted. Results of
      treatment and adverse events will be reported to the FDA. Treatment will be continued
      indefinitely if a good clinical response is achieved and side effects are tolerable.
