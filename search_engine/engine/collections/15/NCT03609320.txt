      (MOs) are healthcare visits during which a patient is eligible, but does not receive a
      vaccine. MOs for vaccination contribute strongly to low HPV vaccination rates. This
      single-arm study (embedded within arm 2 of a 2-arm cluster RCT) will implement a 3-component
      bundle intervention together in practices that previously received standard of care. This
      study will test the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of the bundled intervention, which
      trains providers in HPV vaccine communication (done through online educational modules and
      live office practice sessions), provides performance feedback reports (that pull from
      electronic health record (EHR) data, and compare participants' performance to their own
      previous performance and performance of others) and provider prompts (via EHR and also office
      staff prompts, e.g., placing Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) on desk) to reduce MOs and
      increase HPV vaccination rates. Throughout the intervention participants will also receive
      weekly text message mini-lessons that will remind participants of the project.
