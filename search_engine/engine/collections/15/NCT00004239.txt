      malignancies and renal or hepatic impairment. II. Establish dosing guidelines for this drug
      in this patient population. III. Determine the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this drug
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into 5 groups according to renal and hepatic function: Group
      1: Normal renal function and normal hepatic function Group 2: Moderate renal impairment and
      normal hepatic function Group 3: Severe renal impairment and normal hepatic function Group 4:
      End stage renal impairment and normal hepatic function Group 5: Normal renal function and
      moderate hepatic impairment Group 1: Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3,
      and 5. Groups 2-5: Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Dose
      escalation occurs independently in each of the treatment groups. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of 506U78 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicities. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
