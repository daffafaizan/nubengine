      A. Determine the presence and extent of intima-media calcifications in athletes B. Determine
      the relationship between these calcifications and the level, length and intensity of sports
      activity.

      C. Determine the relationship between these properties and calcification of the arterial wall
      D. Analyze the relationship between the type of sports activity and properties of the
      arterial wall.

      E. Examine the relationship between the properties of the arterial wall and peripheral
      perfusion pressures.

      F. Examine the relationship between the properties of the arterial wall, changes in
      afterload, morphology and systolic heart function.

      G. Analyze the relationships between the parameters characterizing the arterial wall and
      muscle mass of the lower limbs.

      H. Analyze the relationship between the presence of intramural calcification and bone density
      determined by densitometry.

      I. Analyze the relationship between the presence of intramural calcification and dietary
      protein intake and calcium.

      J. Compare indices of pressure at the ankle and toe, depending on the extent of
      calcification.

      K. Create a collection of biological samples (serum).
