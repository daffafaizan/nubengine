      61 cases over the age of 18 who were scheduled for elective percutaneous dilatation
      tracheostomy in intensive care units were included in the study.

      Elective percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy cases were randomly divided into two groups.
      Group 1 was determined as endotracheal tube and group 2 as pro-seal laryngeal mask group.

      In the endotracheal tube group, which is a conventional method, after entering the trachea
      with percutaneous technique, the intubation tube was removed before dilatation and
      percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy was performed with the Seldinger method.

      In the pro-seal laryngeal mask group, the fiberoptic bronchoscope was advanced with a
      pro-seal laryngeal mask, and after the correct position was achieved, percutaneous dilatation
      tracheostomy was performed using the Seldinger Method.

      Arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, arterial blood gas, mechanical
      ventilation mode, positive end expiratory pressure and mean airway pressure values were
      recorded before and 30 minutes after the procedure.

      The time until the end of the procedure and complications were determined.
