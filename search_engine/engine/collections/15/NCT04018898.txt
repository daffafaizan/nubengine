      (PRISMA-7) is the Ministry of Health and Social Services' reference tool for the assessment
      of older ED users in Quebec (Canada). PRISMA-7 has been initially designed to screen
      disability in community-dwelling older adults and has never been validated for risk for
      short-term adverse events in older ED users. "Emergency room evaluation and recommendations"
      (ER2) is another clinical tool which is currently evaluated in Quebec. Compared to PRISMA-7,
      ER2 has been especially designed for assessing risk for short-term ED adverse events. No
      study has compared PRISMA-7 and ER2 risk for short-term adverse events. We hypothesised that
      ER2 could be a better prognostic tool compared to PRISMA-7 for long length of stay in ED and
      hospital stay, and hospital admission because it was designed and validated for this specific
      goal. The study aims to 1) examine and compared PRISMA-7 and ER2 risk for long length of ED
      and hospital stay and hospital admission, and 2) to establish their performance criteria
      (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      likelihood ratios) for these three short-term adverse events in older ED users.
