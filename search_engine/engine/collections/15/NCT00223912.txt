      consequence of increasing levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and reducing levels of
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In addition, the exercise-associated improvement
      in the lipid profile and reduction in fat mass may decrease platelet aggregability and blood
      coagulation, as well as increase fibrinolysis. Thus, it can be hypothesized that physical
      exercise training has a powerful beneficial impact on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.
      Although, regular exercise has been shown to reduce the incidence of CVD and death or causes
      a regression of symptoms in able-bodied individuals, this salutary effect of prolonged
      (months) exercise in persons with SCI has not been documented. The present study will
      evaluate the effects on hemostasis of exercise training in persons with chronic SCI. The
      effect of exercise on hemostasis will be determined in persons with SCI, a population
      appreciated to have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is
      anticipated that this study will ultimately increase our understanding of CVD in this group,
      and it will eventually help reduce the occurrence of premature macrovascular disease.
