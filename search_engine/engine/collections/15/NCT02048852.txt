      particular areas of interest:

           cessation, switching tobacco products and multiple use?

        2. What is the potential impact of modifying nicotine levels on dependence, and smoking
           rate and cessation, as well as patterns of switching products and use of multiple
           tobacco products?

        3. Beyond nicotine, what other constituents enhance addictive properties?
