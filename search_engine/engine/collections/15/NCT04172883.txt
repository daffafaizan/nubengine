      Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) has diagnostic
      and treatment delivery features which helps in slowing the progression of Atrial
      Fibrillation. A Study conducted in Europe, called the MINERVA Trial, showed the efficacy of a
      feature within Medtronic CIED's called (rATP)â„¢, in the termination of abnormal rhythms by
      pacing stimuli, and clinical benefit in reducing incidence of Atrial Fibrillation. However,
      there is dearth of local evidence of this within the Indian population and also a need to
      show that turning on rATP does not compromise on battery depletion.

      The MANDATE-AF study is a prospective , Interventional , Randomized, single blind study
      aiming to show that a reduced sequence programming of this rATP therapy ,can improve device
      battery longevity and is as effective as the Minerva trial ATP programming when it comes to
      showing its impact on time to persistent AF and on the progression of AT/AF within the Indian
      population.

      The study analyses patients implanted with a Medtronic cardiac implantable device with an
      atrial lead and equipped with atrial ATP therapies.

      The patients will be randomized into two groups:

        -  an interventional arm including patients with a conservative atrial ATP therapies
           programming setting

        -  a control, arm including patients with the same atrial ATP therapies programming setting
           adopted in the Minerva Trial

      Cardiovascular events will be collected prospectively for at least 24 months after
      enrollment. Physicians will be recommended to schedule in clinic follow-up visits every 6
      months and remote follow-up visits every 3 months in between. Every patient will be followed
      for at least 24 months, until the last patient enrolled exits the study.
