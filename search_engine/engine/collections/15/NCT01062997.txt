      versus Hoffman II bridging external fixation supplemented by K-wire fixation in patients with
      comminuted distal radius fractures, AO/OTA type C2 & C3. On the basis of power analysis a
      total of 140 patients are to be included in this project. The follow-up period is 2 years and
      evaluation is based on x-ray analysis, grip strength, range of movement, pain and various
      tools to measure quality of life and satisfaction with the treatment (EQ-5d, SF-36,
      Quick-DASH).
