      tolerated and provides optimal binding in resected tumor specimens or tumor biopsies in
      patients with breast, head and neck, prostate, or cervical carcinoma or high grade soft
      tissue sarcomas. II. Define the toxic effects of EF5 in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive etanidazole derivative EF5 IV over
      1-2 hours. Approximately 24-48 hours after EF5 treatment, patients undergo surgical resection
      or biopsy of tumor. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of EF5 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding
      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal dose is defined
      as the dose level at or preceding the MTD and resulting in optimal tumor-to-normal-tissue
      binding. Patients are followed at 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
