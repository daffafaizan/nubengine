    
      This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled, parallel design study, with 3 treatment
      groups (placebo, collagen peptide, and essential amino acid). The study will involve 3
      visits: a baseline testing/familiarization session, and 2 exercise trials which will include
      muscle biopsies, blood draws, and the infusion of a tracer isotope in order to measure muscle
      protein synthesis.
