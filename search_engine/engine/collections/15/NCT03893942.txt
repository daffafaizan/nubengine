      patients' lives, beyond intestinal symptoms alone. The sequelae of this can be seen in the
      increased rates of depression and reduced quality of life (QoL). Surgery may provide a way to
      effectively induce long-term symptoms remission, although there is a short postoperative
      transitory period whereas quality of life might decrease. Over the last years, increasing
      interest has been gained by perioperative recovery protocols, aiming to accelerate functional
      recovery and to reduce complications. Some of these protocols include an in-depth discussion
      with both dedicated nurses and/or surgeons to decrease surgery-associated stress reaction.
      Nevertheless, no one of the proposed protocols has included a psychological assessment in
      order to correlate it with functional recovery. We suggest that studying the psychological
      characteristics of the patients (with a specific focus on mindfulness) could lead to open a
      new research front to optimize patients' outcomes.
