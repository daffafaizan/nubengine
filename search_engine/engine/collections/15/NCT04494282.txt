      day of the endoscopic drainage of PP. Group 2 the ERP will be performed 6 weeks after the
      endoscopic drainage of PP. Each ERP will be performed by an expert in ERP in patients who
      fulfilled the Atlanta criteria for PP. The patients will be enrolled and informed consent
      will be explained and signed. In those patients who ERP fails, a second attempt will be
      performed 6 weeks after the endoscopic drainage of PP (Group 1) or a magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography will be performed (Group 2).
