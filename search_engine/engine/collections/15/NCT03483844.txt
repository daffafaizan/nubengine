      during the pre-surgical planning of vertebral arthrodesis. It is necessary in the definition
      of the fixation points to avoid malposition of transpedicular screws and potential visceral,
      vascular or neurological damage.

      It is known that multislice CT involves an increased radiation exposure for patients, while
      dual-energy CT uses a low-dose acquisition protocol and VEO reconstruction software.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of low-dose dual energy CT in the
      pre-surgical planning of patients with progression of scoliosis who are candidated for
      vertebral arthrodesis.
