      oxygen supply methods are often difficult to maintain adequate oxygenation during
      bronchoscopy. In particular, bronchoscopy to patients already showing hypoxemia can be
      dangerous even though applying conventional oxygen therapy. Thus, we want to elucidate the
      usefulness of nasal high flow oxygen therapy to hypoxemic patients undergoing diagnostic
      bronchoscopy.
