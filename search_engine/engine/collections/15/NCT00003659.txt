        -  Determine the response rate in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with
           sequential fludarabine, high dose cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.

        -  Survival up to 5 years

        -  Utilize flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction as sensitive measures of minimal
           residual disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study.

      Patients receive fludarabine IV once daily for 5 days. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks
      for 3 or 6 courses.

      Three weeks later, cyclophosphamide is administered intravenously every 2-3 weeks for 3
      courses. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered on days 2-10. Beginning 4 weeks after the last
      dose of cyclophosphamide, patients receive rituximab by intravenous infusion once weekly for
      4 weeks.

      Patient are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients within 3 years.
