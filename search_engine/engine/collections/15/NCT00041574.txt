      This study will enroll a limited number of patients (5-7) from several disease categories in
      order to develop the experience with testing acute and chronic responsiveness to INO therapy.
      The following groups will be tested:

        1. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH)

        2. Severe pulmonary hypertension due to congenital (anatomic) heart disease

        3. Pulmonary hypertension or severe impairment of gas exchange in infants and children with
           chronic lung disease

        4. Pulmonary hypertension or severe impairment of gas exchange due to severe chronic lung
           disease in adults

        5. Pulmonary hypertension or severe impairment of gas exchange in hematologic and
           transplant disorders - young children and adults with sickle cell disease, chronic lung
           disease after bone marrow transplant, cardiac transplant, or lung transplant
