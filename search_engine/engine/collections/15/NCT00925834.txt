      investigate the effects of verbal suggestions ('vasodilatation') in combination with either a
      placebo-intervention (sodium chloride 0.9%) or an underdosed vasodilating medication
      (nitroglycerine) on the diameter of coronary arteries. 60 patients with a clinical indication
      to undergo a coronary angiogram were recruited in the German Heart Centre Munich. Patients
      with acute myocardial events and the necessity for coronary intervention were excluded from
      the study. Patients were randomized into one of four arms of the two experiments:

      Experiment A: Intracoronary (i.c.) placebo-infusion together with a standardized verbal
      suggestion of coronary vasodilation vs. i.c. placebo-infusion without verbal suggestion.

      Experiment B: i.c. infusion of a very low dosed nitroglycerin together with a standardized
      verbal suggestion of coronary vasodilation vs. i.c. nitroglycerine infusion without verbal
      suggestion.

      To our best knowledge this study is the first to investigate the modulating effects of verbal
      suggestions going along with medical interventions on the diameter of coronary arteries
      during heart catheterization.
