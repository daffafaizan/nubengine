      dyspeptic Hp-infected adults will assess whether Hp eradication results in improvements in
      the levels of iron stores. Iron stores will be assessed by (i) SF as primary outcome, and the
      following secondary outcomes: (ii) serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), (iii) the ratio of sTfR
      to SF or R/F, which will be used to estimate body iron, (iv) transferrin saturation (TS), (v)
      zinc protoporhyrin (ZPP) and (vi) hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and at 6 months of follow-up.
      This study is a double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) of Hp eradication allocating 400
      Hp-infected asymptomatic/mildly dyspeptic adults 18-65 years of age of El Paso, Texas, to
      receive either (i) a 14-day quadruple Hp eradication therapy described above or (ii) placebo.
      We expect that at least 240 will complete the study medications and follow-up.
