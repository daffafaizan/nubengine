      sporting environment. Strength is a key aspect of athletic performance. Despite the
      prevalence of dry needling within a sporting environment, the effects of dry needling on
      strength remains unknown.

      This study will investigate the effects of dry needling on maximal isometric strength with a
      view to informing clinical practice amongst clinicians working in the elite sport setting.
