    
      Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized in most cases by T cell and
      antibody responses to neuromuscular junction proteins such as skeletal muscle nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Antibodies against epitopes of the AChR of the neuromuscular
      junction cause failure of neuromuscular transmission, resulting in the characteristic fatigue
      and weakness associated with this severe disorder.

      The study will evaluate an innovative candidate in MG.
