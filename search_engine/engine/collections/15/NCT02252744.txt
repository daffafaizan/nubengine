      arthritis by information sheets and direct recruitment of patients of potential study
      participants diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Subjective assessment for dry eye disease
      was performed using Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. The following
      objective tests of dry eye disease were employed: tear osmolarity (TO), tear break-up time
      (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining score and conjunctival lissamine green staining scores
      using the National Eye Institute-recommended grading system, and Schirmer without anesthetic.
      The Dry Eye Severity Grading Scheme highlighted by the Dry Eye WorkShop was adapted to
      quantify dry eye disease severity level.
