    
      This is a prospective, randomized trial comparing the endovascular coiling (endovascular
      coiling) versus the flow diversion for large and giant aneurysm treatment. The endovascular
      coiling used in this study are FDA-approved and in common use at institutions in this country
      and across the world. The flow diversion devices are FDA-approved for anterior circulation
      aneurysms >10 mm and are in common use at institutions in this country and across the world.
      Patients will be enrolled who meet the inclusion criteria and consent to participate.
      Patients will be randomly assigned by a central web-based system in a 1:1 manner to treatment
      with either endovascular coiling or flow diversion. Data on each patient will be collected at
      the time of enrollment and treatment, and at subsequent follow-up visits.
