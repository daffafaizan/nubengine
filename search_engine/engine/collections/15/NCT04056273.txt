      computed tomography (CT)-guided core needle biopsy, radial probe endobronchial ultrasound
      (rEBUS)-guided transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), convex probe EBUS transbronchial needle
      aspiration (TBNA), and echo-guided core needle biopsy. rEBUS-guided TBLB has relatively low
      limitation of lesion position, comparing to echo-guided core needle biopsy and EBUS-TBNA, and
      doesn't need to deal with the risk of radiation exposure.1 For peripheral pulmonary lesions
      (PPL), it has good yield rate and the operation is easy.2 However, when bleeding occurs, the
      procedure time is prolonged for hemostasis. Nonetheless, using a guide sheath can help with
      the problem. According to the literatures, biopsy yield rates vary but on average it is
      higher with a guide sheath (62~90% vs. 41~73%), while the complication rates are about the
      same (1.3~4.4% 1.5~5.0%). The investigators would like to know whether the diagnostic rate is
      higher with a guide sheath and so do the procedure time and the complication rate. Whether
      the lesion character affect the yield rate will also be studied.
