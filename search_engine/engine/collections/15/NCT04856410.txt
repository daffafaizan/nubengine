      be carried out in a joint effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
      and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as well as the European Space Agency (ESA). The project
      targets NASA's particular interest in studying the 'Cognitive-perceptual-visuospatial brain
      domain changes due to isolation and confinement' as part of the Complement of Integrated
      Protocols for Human Exploration Research (CIPHER) project on the International Space Station
      (ISS). The collected data will demonstrate whether prolonging mission duration to one year
      will have detrimental effects on general cognitive performance (measured with the Cognition
      test battery), spatial cognition, structural and functional brain changes in general, and
      hippocampal plasticity more specifically relative to the shorter 6-month and 2-month ISS
      missions. Using state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, investigators will determine the
      biological basis for any changes in cognitive performance, with a focus on hippocampal
      plasticity and spatial cognition. Similar data already gathered on the ISS and in several
      short- and long-duration space analog environments will be used to generate a normative data
      base for long-duration missions. Finally, investigators will derive dose-response
      relationships between cognitive-visuospatial brain domain changes and mission duration that
      will allow predicting vulnerability to adverse cognitive or behavioral impairment and
      psychiatric disorders on interplanetary expeditions such as a mission to Mars. The two
      projects will deliver a highly unique and comprehensive set of integrated neuroimaging and
      neurocognitive tools for the evaluation and ultimately prevention of adverse effects on brain
      structure and function that lead to behavioral effects associated with exploration-type
      missions.
