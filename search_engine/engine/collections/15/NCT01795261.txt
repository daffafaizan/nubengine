      congregation-based Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) delivered by lay health advisors
      (Intervention Group; IG), versus a Facility Based Approach (Control Group; CG) on the HIV
      testing rate and PMTCT completion among 2,700 pregnant women. Four dioceses with forty
      churches nested in the dioceses, will be randomly assigned to either the IG (N=2; n=20) or
      the CG (N=2; n=20). The HBI combines a family educational game show and an integrated on-site
      laboratory testing in the context of a baby shower. Monthly prayer sessions for pregnant
      women will be used for recruitment and a baby reception following infant baptisms will be
      used for follow up after delivery. The primary outcome is difference in testing rate among
      pregnant women in IG compared to CG. The secondary outcomes are HIV testing rate among male
      partners and PMTCT completion among HIV-infected pregnant women. Pregnant women will complete
      an investigator-administered questionnaire at the baby reception to collect information on
      HIV testing and PMTCT completion. Data will be confirmed with Health Facilities and on-site
      testing data. This proposal is a collaboration among Partners for Prevention, education,
      Training, Treatment and Research (PeTR-Global Solutions)/AIDSRelief (our PEPFAR-funded
      partner in Nigeria responsible for training, HIV testing, linkage to treatment and local
      oversight of the project); New York University School of Medicine (program evaluation and
      shares oversight with PI), Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno (provide
      overall oversight, data management and evaluation of program effectiveness).
