    
      CORT125281 is a selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist. In this study, CORT125281
      will be administered orally in combination with enzalutamide to patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the regimen. The study
      consists of two phases: a dose-determination phase and an expansion phase. The dose
      determination phase is designed to determine dose-limiting toxicities and the RD of
      CORT125281 plus enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC. Once the recommended dosing regimen has
      been determined, the following expansion cohorts will be enrolled and treated with CORT125281
      plus enzalutamide at the recommended dose level.

      Abi-Resistant Cohort: Patients who have progressed during treatment with abiraterone, and
      have received no other androgen receptor (AR)-blocking therapies

      ARant-Resistant Cohort: Patients who have progressed during treatment with enzalutamide or
      other second-generation AR inhibitors.

      The effect of food on CORT125281 PK will be assessed in a portion of the patients enrolled in
      the Expansion Phase. The two expansion cohorts will be enrolled in parallel.

      In each phase of the study, routine assessments of safety and tolerability will be performed
      and samples will be collected to determine standard PK parameters for CORT125281,
      enzalutamide, and their major metabolites. PD, quality of life evaluations and preliminary
      evaluations of anti-tumor activity of CORT125281 with enzalutamide will be performed
      throughout the study.
