      nonopioid analgesics are often not sufficient enough, and opioids have many adverse events.
      For this reasons fascia iliaca compartment block could be the treatment of choice. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the fascia iliaca compartment block
      for pain management in the emergency department, especially the effect on stress response and
      the effect on the acute confusional state. The investigators intend to conduct a randomized
      clinical trial in hip fracture patients years 65 and older presenting in the emergency
      department. In addition to standard analgesia with parenteral paracetamol, the first group of
      patients will receive fascia iliaca compartment block and the second group placebo. The
      investigators will monitor the effect of treatment protocol on laboratory parameters of
      stress response copeptin and cortisol, frequency and severity of acute confusional state,
      pain intensity and the need for additional opioid analgesics. Data obtained from this
      research could significantly improve the standard and quality of analgesia in the older
      patients with hip fracture. Regional anesthesia can diminish or prevent the development of
      stress response and cognitive impairment and these are the factors that complicate recovery
      of this fragile group of patients.
