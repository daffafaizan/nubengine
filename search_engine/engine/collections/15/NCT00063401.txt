      peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer will be enrolled. By receiving combination therapy with
      cetuximab (C225)/paclitaxel/carboplatin, these subjects will experience longer
      progression-free survival than previously reported for subjects receiving only paclitaxel and
      carboplatin.
