      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib hydrochloride when administered with
           cisplatin and pelvic radiotherapy in patients with stage IB-IVA squamous cell carcinoma
           of the cervix.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-35 and cisplatin IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for
      approximately 5 weeks concurrently with chemotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose proceeding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks.
