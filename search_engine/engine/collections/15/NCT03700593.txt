      established, with a great deal of literature generated regarding the safety and benefits of a
      colorectal robotic approach for benign and malignant disease. The section of colorectal
      surgery at the Lankenau Medical Center has been an active and robust contributor to surgical
      literature on laparoscopic surgery, robotic colorectal surgery, and single port laparoscopic
      surgery. Its one investigator has been involved in the development of clinical applications
      to the single port robotic platform where this has been utilized in cadaver work that has
      been published. Recently, the SP robot has gone through FDA clearance and is now available
      for clinical utilization. The FDA approval is for urologic surgery. The SP robot will be
      utilized in the same fashion to perform the same colorectal operations that the investigators
      have been performing with multiple port placements in the past to accomplish robotic surgery
      in a single port platform in the colorectal arena. The principal investigator has worked on
      the SP robot over the past 3 years with extensive cadaver experience to develop its safe
      application in the colorectal field. This study will entail a collection of demographics,
      preoperative, perioperative and postoperative outcomes of the patients into a database to
      follow this, report on the outcomes, and notably answer questions to demonstrate the
      feasibility and safety of this approach in colorectal patients.
