      have determined that the graphs are not consistent enough to draw any conclusions. Given the
      technical difficulties we have encountered with the Med-Storm Stress Detector, as well as the
      labor intensity associated with it, we have decided that we will no longer use it from
      patient 14 on. We will not mark the time points and hand movements described in the protocol,
      as this data was used to understand the skin conductance data. We will continue to enroll
      patients to complete this pilot/exploratory study, as the other secondary outcomes--in
      particular, the surveys--could provide valuable information.
