      Cohort, and Part C - REMD-477 in Combination with Metformin. Part A includes 5 cohorts that

      subjects randomized in a 3:1 (active: placebo) fashion. Part B includes a single dose cohort
      that will enroll 12 subjects (9 on active treatment and 3 on placebo) with dose level and
      frequency determined by a Dose Level Review Meeting (DLRM)Committee. Part C includes 2
      cohorts of T2DM patients currently treated with metformin alone, and each cohort will consist
      of 15 subjects (10 on active treatment and 3 on placebo).
