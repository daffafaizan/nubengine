      with either new onset or therapy resistant rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will be
      conducted at 7 sites with NIAMS being the coordinating center and 6 external centers.
      Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is a traditional medicinal plant that is and has been
      used in China for many years to treat inflammatory conditions including RA. This study we
      will be testing if a standardized plant extract from the roots of TwHF is superior to
      Sulfasalazine in improving the signs and symptoms in subjects with RA, as assessed by the ACR
      20 criteria. Those subjects, who qualify for the study, will be allowed to continue on stable
      doses of NSAID therapy and/or low dose corticosteroids but will discontinue any DMARDs, or
      biologicals prior to the start of the study. Study subjects will then be randomized to
      receive either TwHF or Sulfasalazine and subjects will remain on double blind medication for
      24 weeks. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter using a
      standardized joint exam, questionnaires and laboratory measures for inflammation. ACR 20
      responses will be calculated at each visit and compared in both groups at the end of
      evaluation at 24 weeks. Safety will be monitored throughout the trial. This is the first
      study that compares the extract of TwHF to a currently used DMARD in treating patients with
      RA and will help to define the role of new anti-inflammatory and possibly disease modifying
      agents in treating patients with RA.
