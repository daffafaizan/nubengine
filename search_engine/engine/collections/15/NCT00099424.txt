      in which the participants are randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of dynamic resistance and
      whole-body endurance exercises followed by 12 weeks without intervention or vice versa.
      Consenting participants will be assessed at baseline (before randomization, week 0) and at
      weeks 12 and 24.
