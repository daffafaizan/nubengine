      data using the ROSA Total Knee robotic instrumentation and conventional instrumentation in
      primary total knee arthroplasty.

      The assessments will include: Planned vs actual component positioning; Workflow efficiency;
      Patient safety based on incidence and frequency of adverse events; Clinical performance
      measured by overall pain and function, quality of life data, and radiographic parameters.
