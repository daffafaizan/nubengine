      tumors locating at body and tail [1]. Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula
      (CR-POPF) is the major complication after pancreatectomy. In literature, reported CR-POPF
      rate after distal pancreatectomy varied between 5% and 64% from different centers. It's still
      a challenge to prevent CR-POPF via effective pancreatic remnant closure and no consensus on
      the optimal surgical technique has been established. Reported surgical strategies to prevent
      CR-POPF included stapler transection, staple line reinforcement, stump coverage with
      autologous tissue or fibrin glue, mesh reinforcement, and prophylactic administration of
      octreotide. However, none had convincing outcome [2-4].

      Data has shown that staple line plus suture reinforcement might potentially decrease the
      CR-POPF rate of patients who underwent distal pancreatectomies, but well-designed
      high-quality evidence is lacking. Meanwhile, prior researches have commonly included
      minimally invasive and open cases together. Moreover, stapler and suture were combined in
      most studies making interpretation difficult [5-8].

      Thus, the investigators design a single-centered, parallel, randomized controlled trial to
      compare the efficacy of routine staple line plus reinforcement versus staple only on the
      CR-POPF rate of participants who underwent minimally invasive distal pancreatectomies.
