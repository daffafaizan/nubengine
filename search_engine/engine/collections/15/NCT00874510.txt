    
      Background: The release of the Institute of Medicine report on resident work hours and
      patient safety highlighted the risks to patient and resident safety of extended duty on-call
      shifts.

      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of
      mandatory naps during extended duty overnight shifts for residents.

      Methods: For each site (PVAMC and HUP), every other month residents will be randomized to
      either work the standard schedule (which involves interns being on duty for 30 continuous
      hours) vs. the mandatory nap schedule, which involves interns signing out their beepers for 5
      hours in the middle of the night to covering night floats and for 3 hours in Year 2. The
      primary outcome will be the amount slept as measured by actigraphs, with secondary outcomes
      of cognitive alertness measured by 3-minute psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT), Stanford
      sleepiness Scale, and other measures of resident and patient well-being.
