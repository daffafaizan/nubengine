      risk for repeated intestinal infections. Infants who are 12-18 months of age living in the
      District of Independencia, Lima, Peru will be eligible for enrollment. We will conduct a
      randomized double blind placebo controlled trial comparing twice daily supplementation with
      bovine lactoferrin versus a placebo (maltodextrin) Therapy will be continued for 6 months
      with close monitoring of all study participants for diarrhea and growth.

      Specific aim 1: Determine the effect of bovine lactoferrin supplementation on prevention of
      diarrhea,measured by the number of episodes of diarrhea during a 6 month trial in previously
      weaned Peruvian children enrolled at 12 to 18 months of age.

      Specific aim 2: Determine the effect of bovine lactoferrin supplementation on growth.
