      and commonly occur after hospitalization when multiple changes to medication regimens take
      place in the context of poor patient education, inadequate information transfer and delayed
      continuity of care. Medication reconciliation - i.e., any intentional process to resolve
      discrepancies between what medications the patient is taking and what medications the health
      care team thinks the patient is taking - has been designated a "National Patient Safety Goal"
      since 2005.2-6 Recent studies examining inpatient computerized medication reconciliation
      tools and pharmacist-facilitated medication reconciliation programs at hospital discharge
      have shown promising results. However, little is known about successful medication
      reconciliation strategies following discharge, representing an untapped point of leverage to
      improve medication safety.

      With recently awarded seed funding, and in collaboration with the Department of Veterans'
      Affairs (VA) nationwide Medication Reconciliation Initiative, we are developing an
      informatics-based tool for medication reconciliation following hospital discharge by secure,
      e-mail-like communication: the Secure Messaging for Medication Reconciliation Tool (SMMRT).
      In this proposed study, we plan to pilot the SMMRT prototype through My HealtheVet (MHV), the
      VA's secure personal health record and web portal, among 50 Veterans at VA Boston, with the
      following two Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Refine the existing SMMRT prototype and integrate it into MHV's secure
      messaging web-interface, with authentication of secure two-way communication between patient
      and primary healthcare team. We will use a participatory and patient-centered process
      involving the primary care clinicians, pharmacists, nurses, other staff members and Veterans
      working collaboratively with the research team to establish the usability and acceptability
      of the prototype SMMRT.

      Specific Aim 2: Pilot the SMMRT prototype, refined through Specific Aim 1, among 50 Veterans
      with primary care relationships and hospitalized at our facility. Veterans will be recruited
      prior to hospital discharge, enrolled in MHV if necessary, and trained in the use of secure
      messaging and specifically the SMMRT tool.

      This study will benefit from a recently funded preliminary study (Veterans' Engineering
      Resource Center seed funding, $25,000), in enabling us to analyze the primary care
      environment's receptivity to SMMRT-based post-discharge medication reconciliation, focusing
      on staff activation and education, workflow optimization to incorporate staff and clinicians
      managing SMMRT's incoming and outgoing messages, and coordination with MHV staff to ensure
      continued successful software integration.

      This proposed CIMIT-funded study will lead to a refined and strengthened intervention to
      enhance the preliminary use of SMMRT, as well as qualitative results that will constitute the
      foundation of an investigator-initiated research proposal alongside a full-scale
      implementation of SMMRT into MHV for Veterans nationwide.
