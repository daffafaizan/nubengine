        -  Compare relapse-free survival of patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma treated
           in the adjuvant setting with either radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy and chemotherapy
           given sequentially.

        -  Compare overall survival of this patient population treated with these 2 adjuvant
           regimens.

        -  Evaluate the addition of chemotherapy to standard adjuvant radiotherapy, in terms of
           toxicity, in these patients.

        -  Study whether the pattern of relapse in these patients is influenced by the addition of
           chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to center and histologic type (serous papillary and clear cell vs all other types).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients undergo hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy and extirpation of
      macroscopic suspicious lymph nodes.

        -  Arm I: Within 7 weeks after surgery, patients begin radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy followed by or preceded by chemotherapy*. Patients
           receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes and doxorubicin or epirubicin IV over 10-20 minutes
           on day 1. Treament repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

      NOTE: *If radiotherapy is preceded by chemotherapy, radiotherapy begins within 4 weeks after
      chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed at 3 and 6 months and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.
