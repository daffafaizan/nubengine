      disease. To date two prophylactic modalities are being used: mechanical (intermittent
      pneumatic compression [IPC]) and pharmacological (anticoagulant). Both are effective; however
      each carries its own advantages and disadvantages.

      The purpose of this study is to compare in total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients the safety
      and effectiveness of the mobile ActiveCare CECT based prophylaxis protocol and compare it
      with LMWH standard of care protocol for this patient population.

      The protocol is based upon the CECT system as the primary DVT prophylaxis method (with or
      without the addition of low dose baby aspirin [81 mg]).
