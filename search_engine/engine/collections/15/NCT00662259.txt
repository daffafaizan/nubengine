      response to a known, FDA approved marketed anxiolytic. As such, this is not a study testing
      safety and efficacy of an approved medicine; it is a study to evaluate the usefulness of fMRI
      (a non-significant risk device procedure) to correlate the clinical/behavioral effects of a
      marketed anxiolytic with brain activity assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. fMRI is a
      more direct measure of brain function than behavior, outcomes are quantitative and objective.
      As such, it may be more specific, i.e., may be more sensitive to drug effects or show them
      earlier than clinical endpoints and enable determination of efficacy in smaller or shorter
      studies than those required to show effects on clinical endpoints. Finally, imaging may allow
      differentiation of placebo responders from true drug responders.
