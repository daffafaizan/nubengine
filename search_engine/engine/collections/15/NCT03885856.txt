      significant effect on daily activities as a result of a loss of motion and strength. The goal
      of rotator cuff repair is to treat the patient's current clinical symptoms and improve
      shoulder function and to prevent the long-term consequences of rotator cuff arthropathy. This
      project aims at a retrospective analysis of preexisting risk factors for sustaining rotator
      cuff injury as well as for failing to reach the previous functional level, used surgical
      technique -either single row repair or double row repair- and its significance for the
      functional outcome.
