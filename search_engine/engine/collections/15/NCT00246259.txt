      conducted at Screening, Baseline, Week 2, every 4 weeks till Week 22, at Week 28, every 12
      weeks till Week 88 and at Week 104. All eligible participants will receive either risperidone
      long acting injection 25 milligram (mg) intramuscularly (into the muscle) along with their
      current oral medication (atypical antipsychotic - risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine) or
