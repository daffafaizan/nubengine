    
      This is a parallel group clinical trial comparing two types of follow-up in patients operated
      and treated in a General and GI surgery department. Face-to-face vs telematic follow-up by
      using a platform that offers videoconferencing will be compared.

      The hypothesis is that a follow-up based on a telematic visit will no add extra comorbidities
      while could reduce costs and increase patients satisfaction.

      Patients will be included and assigned randomly to each group using an informatics program
      until 100 patients are reached in each arm of the study ("n" total = 200 patients)
      Information regarding the type of follow-up and the instructions to perform the telematic
      visit will be provided to patients before discharge. The follow-up date will be set according
      to the established protocol for each type of pathology.

      In case of clinical complications patients will be referred to the emergency department or
      will be visited in face-to-face basis.

      The main and secondary outcomes will be evaluated 30 days after the date of the follow-up.
