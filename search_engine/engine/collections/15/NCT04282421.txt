      However, because of complications such as infection, graft-versus-host disease and
      conditioning toxicity, this procedure is associated with a high morbidity-mortality rate. The
      discovery of molecular and genetic markers permitted to improve therapeutic strategy and
      survival of patient in the last few years. In this study, the investigators want to make an
      overview of survival, incidence of relapse and incidence of acute and chronic graft versus
      host disease in allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myelofibrosis, in five centers in
      France, between 2007 and 2017.
