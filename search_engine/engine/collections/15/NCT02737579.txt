      fluoroscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide increased soft tissue information
      about the cardiovascular system. By combining the familiar X-ray environment with superior
      magnetic resonance imaging, the investigator hopes to enhance and expand the capabilities of
      cardiac catheterization techniques.

      The investigator will conduct cardiac catheterization procedures using XFM guidance in
      pediatric research patients who are undergoing medically necessary procedures. The
      investigator aims to decrease the exposure of these patients to the routine hazards of
      ionizing radiation and contrast exposure compared to the standard of care approach.
