    
      This is a 24-week, randomized, and placebo-controlled intervention trial to investigate the
      effects of green tea polyphenols (GTP) and Tai Chi (TC) on relevant primary and secondary
      endpoints in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Women at least 2 years after menopause,
      with osteopenia, will be recruited primarily from local senior independent/assisted living
      facilities, municipal senior community centers, and obstetrics and gynecology clinics. After
      screening, qualified participants will be matched for age and will be randomly assigned to
      one of the four treatment groups: placebo, GTP, placebo+TC, and GTP+TC. During the 24-week
      intervention, all participants will be provided with calcium and vitamin D daily. The
      participants in the placebo group will receive medicinal starch for 24 weeks. The GTP
      participants will receive GTP for 24 weeks. The placebo+TC participants will receive both
      placebo and TC treatments for 24 weeks. The GTP+TC participants will receive both GTP and TC
      treatments for 24 weeks. Participants will receive the primary and secondary outcome measures
      at baseline, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. The primary outcome measures are concentrations of bone
      biomarkers. The secondary outcome measure is a biomarker of oxidative stress DNA damage.
      Additional secondary outcome is muscle strength/physical function. Investigators evaluating
      the endpoints will be blinded to intervention allocation.
