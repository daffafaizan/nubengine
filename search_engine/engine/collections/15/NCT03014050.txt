      cognitive impairment, and other non-motor symptoms. Here, we propose to use "Bio Electro
      Stimulation Therapy" (B.E.S.T.) using the "e-Tapper TT-R1"owned by Immumax International Co.
      Ltd., a Hong Kong based company. The "e-Tapper" is a non-invasive, handheld electronic device
      designed to apply micro current stimulation to a person's hand at specified points
      representing various body parts, such as the head, leg, or foot. This is one form of Bio
      Electro Stimulation Therapy, known as "11-point Hand Treatment System". The current delivered
      is less than one milliampere. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this micro current stimulation
      may reduce resting tremor, restore facial expressions, and improve ease of movement, mood,
      and sleep quality in patients with PD. Scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the
      B.E.S.T. Hand Therapy appears to be lacking in the English language (Western) literature. The
      goal of this pilot device feasibility study is to examine whether B.E.S.T. can increase
      physical activity and functional fitness, enhance cognition, improve mood and subjective
      sleep quality, and modulate resting tremor and gait parameters in PD patients over a 6-week
      period.
