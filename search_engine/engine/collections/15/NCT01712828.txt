      fixed-sequence crossover study with lenalidomide alone in Period 1, followed by lenalidomide
      in combination with quinidine in Period 2. Part 2 will be a fixed-sequence, three-period,
      crossover study with lenalidomide alone in Period 1, temsirolimus (via direct intravenous
      infusion) in Period 2, and lenalidomide in combination with temsirolimus (via direct
      intravenous infusion) in Period 3. Diphenhydramine (given via intravenous injection) will be
      administered shortly before temsirolimus in order to decrease the chances of an allergic
      reaction to temsirolimus. Part 1 and Part 2 will be conducted at the same time. Subjects can
      only participate in either Part 1 or Part 2.
