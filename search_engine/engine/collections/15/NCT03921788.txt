      pelvic vein dilation and blood reflux through them in combination with venous pelvic pain;
      the second is patients with pelvic vein dilatation without venous pelvic pain. The third,
      control group will include healthy female volunteers without pelvic veins and any chronic
      pain syndromes.

      At the second stage of the study, a study will be made of the levels of calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the substance P (SP) in the serum using an ELISA method. In
      addition, after studying the content of the CGRP and SP in the serum of volunteers, the
      investigators expect to obtain the reference values of these neuropeptides. In this phase of
      the study, a statistical analysis of the data obtained will be carried out, a correlation
      analysis between venous pelvic pain and the level of the CGRP and CP.

      The data for each patient will be entered into a specially designed patient questionnaire. It
      will include clinical and ultrasound data, results of ELISA.
