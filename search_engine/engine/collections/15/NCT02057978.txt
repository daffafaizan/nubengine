    
      The primary end point is to observe in-stent late lumenn loss after 9 months of the stent
      implantation.

      This study is based on non-inferior assumption (vs. EXCEL-II V EXCEL Stent), requring all of
      end points reach statictic significance.

      Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including any
      plans for site monitoring and auditing.

      Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or
      consistency with other data fields in the registry.

      Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of
      registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (e.g., medical records, paper or
      electronic case report forms, or interactive voice response systems).

      Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by the registry,
      including the source of the variable, coding information if used and normal ranges if
      relevant.

      Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as
      patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse
      events, and change management.

      Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary
      to demonstrate an effect.

      Plan for missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing,
      unavailable, "non-reported," uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data
      inconsistency or out-of-range results Statistical analysis plan describing the analytical
      principles and statistical techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and
      secondary objectives, as specified in the study protocol or plan.
