    
      This is a long-term observational study of patients who received at least one dose of study
      treatment (plerixafor or placebo) in a multicenter, randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate AMD3100 plus granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (GCSF) versus G-CSF plus placebo to mobilize and transplant Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients
      (protocol AMD31003102LTF [NCT00103662]). The objective of this study is to assess
      progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with at least 1 dose of
      study treatment (placebo or plerixafor) for a period of 5 years following the first dose of
      study treatment (placebo or plerixafor) in protocol AMD3100-3102 (NCT00103662).
