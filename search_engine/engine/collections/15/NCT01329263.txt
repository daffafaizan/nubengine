      menthol smokers switch to non-menthol cigarettes. Participants will initially smoke their
      preferred brand (control) cigarettes, followed by smoking Camel Crush cigarettes, which have
      the ability to be menthol or non-menthol. Participants given Camel Crush cigarettes will
      smoke them as menthol, then non-menthol cigarettes for 15 days each. Participants will
      provide breath and urine samples to measure smoke exposures, track cigarette usage to
      establish changes in daily cigarette consumption and complete smoking topography assessments
      of smoking behavior, such as puff volume.
