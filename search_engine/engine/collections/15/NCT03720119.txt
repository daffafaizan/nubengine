      because of superior pain control and fewer side effects. In this contest, lidocaine
      hydrochloride (ORTODERMINA速) plays an important role in pain management during wound healing.
      The properties of ORTODERMINA速 and its ability to maintain an adequate level of active drug
      over the lesion allow a persistent anaesthetic effect. ORTODERMINA速 is a drug for topical
      application in the form of cream, with a high safety profile. However, although the incidence
      of adverse effects with Lidocaine Ointment 5% is quite low, caution should be exercised,
      particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly
      proportional to the total dose of local anaesthetic agent administered.

      This multicentric observational study is aimed to evaluate the relief gained with
      ORTODERMINA速 on wound pain in patients with painful wounds and to collect safety information
      on this treatment.
