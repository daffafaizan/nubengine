      Previous pilot studies demonstrated that short-term bar consumption results in favorable
      increases in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), particularly large-HDL (HDL-L) in most lean but only in
      some overweight/obese individuals. Obesity is associated with poor gastrointestinal health
      and systemic inflammation, which are also associated with low HDL. Our hypothesis is that a
      carefully formulated nutritional supplement bar delivered in a whole food matrix can correct
      micronutrient deficiencies in obese adults and have a beneficial impact on indices of insulin
      dysregulation and the metabolic syndrome. The aims of this project are 1) to characterize the
      effect size on indices of lipid profile, homocysteine, inflammation, insulin resistance,
      micronutrient levels, DNA integrity, hunger and satiety, BMI, waist circumference, and blood
      pressure with different formulations of CHORI bar taken twice daily for periods ranging from
      2-8 weeks. We will also evaluate gut inflammation, redox status, tissue metals, and DNA
      integrity with novel exploratory assays that may serve as markers for micronutrient
      malnutrition and chronic disease risk. 2) Where significant improvement in the outcome
      variables is observed, we will attempt to "deconstruct" the bars and attempt to determine the
      active ingredients responsible for these changes.
