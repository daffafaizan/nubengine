      participants to assess the relative bioavailability JNJ-63623872. The study population will
      consist of 48 healthy adult participants, equally divided over 2 panels: 24 participants in
      Panel 1 and 24 participants in Panel 2. participants will be randomized within each panel.
      Participants will not be randomized between panels. Panels 1 and 2 will be performed
      sequentially. Participants having participated in one panel cannot also participate in the
      other panel. In Panel 1, during 4 subsequent treatment sessions (Periods I, II, III and IV),
      each participant will receive 4 treatments (Treatments A, B, C, and D), randomized according
      to a classical 4 sequence, 4 period Williams design. In Panel 2, during 3 subsequent
      treatment sessions (Periods I, II and III), each participant will receive 3 treatments
      (Treatments E, F, and G) randomized according to a classical 6 sequence, 3 period Williams
      design. Primarily, pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
