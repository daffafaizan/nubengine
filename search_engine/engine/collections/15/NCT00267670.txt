      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or 'fatty liver disease'. There is currently no FDA
      approved available treatment for NASH. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential
      benefit of the medication, pentoxifylline, for the treatment of NASH. The effectiveness of
      this drug will be determined by taking blood samples and a liver biopsy. To determine if
      there is any effect of the medication, two-thirds of the patients participating in the study
      will receive pentoxifylline and one-third will receive placebo (sugar pill). Thus, an
      individual's chance of receiving the drug is 67%. In addition to receiving a study drug
      (placebo or pentoxifylline) the subjects will be encouraged to achieve modest weight loss
      (~1-2 lbs/week) via low-fat diet and exercise.

      The drug (Pentoxifylline) being studied is not approved for use in people who have NASH.
      Pentoxifylline is considered experimental in this study. Pentoxifylline has been safely used
      for the treatment of other medical conditions such as alcohol related liver disease and poor
      circulation. Pentoxifylline is a pill which is taken three times a day.
