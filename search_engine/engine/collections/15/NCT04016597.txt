    
      In a single-center, crossover study conducted at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland,
      35 healthy, non-smoking adults (>=18 years) will be invited to perform DLNO measurements in
      random order using the MasterScreenTM (PFT Pro, Jaeger, CareFusion, Hoechberg, Germany) and
      HypAir (Medisoft, Dinant, Belgium) devices during one study visit.

      The order of the tests on the MasterscreenTM and HypAir devices will be randomly allocated
      using central randomisation.
