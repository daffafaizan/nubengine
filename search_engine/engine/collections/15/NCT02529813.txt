    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of genetically modified, CD19-specific
      T cells administered into patients with CD19+ advanced lymphoid malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To screen for the development of host immune responses against the CD19-specific chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR).

      II. To describe the homing ability of the infused T cells. III. To assess disease response.
      IV. To determine persistence of CAR+ T cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of CD19 positive chimeric antigen receptor T-cells.

      LYMPHODEPLETING CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients may receive standard chemotherapy comprised of
      fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on
      days -5 to -3 or cyclophosphamide IV every 12 hours on days -5 to -3 at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      Within 30 days post completion of lymphodepletion, patients receive CD19 positive chimeric
      antigen receptor T-cells IV over 15-30 minutes on day 0, or split into two portions on days 0
      and 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.
