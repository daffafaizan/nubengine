      systemic and adipose tissue inflammation. Dysbiosis of gut microbiome is considered to make a
      difference in obesity. On the other hand, both long-term and short-term dietary interventions
      can induce changes in the body composition and structure and function of gut microbiome.
      However, it is not really clear how gut microbiome changes along with weight loss in
      overweight or obese.

      In the present study, investigators aim to characterize the gut microbiome among overweight
      or obese participants on a modified Atkins diets. The stool and blood samples were collected
      by an interval of every 5% and 10% of weight loss, respectively. Data collecting mainly
      covers: 1) body composition analysis ; 2) obesity related biochemical metabolism; 3)
      measurement of gut microbiome using metagenome and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques; 4)
      metabolomics of serum and gut microbiome; 5) measurement of physical activity and diets using
      questionnaires.
