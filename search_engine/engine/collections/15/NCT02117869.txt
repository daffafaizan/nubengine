      which will include a physical exam, pregnancy test if applicable, and a review of your
      medical history. If you qualify you will then undergo three separate study visits as
      described below.

      While participating in this study, participants will not eat grapefruit or other citrus
      fruits (oranges, lemons, for example) or drink non-study specific grapefruit juice or other
      citrus fruit juices, or citrus containing foods (orange marmalade, for example) for 1 week
      prior to each study visit. In addition, no herbal or other dietary supplements or over the
      counter medications should be taken for 48 hours before and during the study visits.

      During each of the three study visits, separated by at least 2 weeks, one of two different
      grapefruit juice products (either the low furanocoumarin grapefruit hybrid or regular
      grapefruit) or water will be provided. The order in which these three drinks will be received
      will be random, like the toss of a coin. Also, 1 dose of midazolam (a drug normally used to
      make someone sleepy or relaxed before a medical test) will be given during each visit.

      Each study visit will consist of three days, on Days 1 and 2 a drink of 200ml (about 7
      ounces) of the assigned grapefruit juice or water will be given.

      On Day 3 of each study visit, you will fast (abstain from having anything to eat or drink
      except water) from 12 a.m. the night before, and report to the clinic for the study day at
      8am.
