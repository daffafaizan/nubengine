    
      Patients with T2DM will be recruited from outpatient clinic of the Hospital de Clinicas de
      Porto Alegre. Patients will be randomized to NMES session, with maximal intensity tolerance
      by to induce visible contractions or to NMES-placebo, with minimal intensity to provide a
      sensory stimulus, but insufficient to elicit a tetanic muscular contraction. Subjects will
      attend to research facility four times. On the first visit clinical, physical examination and
      autonomic evaluation (Ewing test) will be performed and a blood sample will be collected. On
      the second visit CGMS will be placed for glycemic variability evaluation. On the third visit
      NMES or NMES-placebo will be performed in a randomized way. On the fourth visit the CGMS will
      be removed. Blood pressure and heart rate will be evaluated during the protocol each 5
      minutes and oxygenation tissue will be evaluated before, during and immediately after the
      protocol, through NIRS.
