      been treated. Most people who receive treatment and take their medications as directed have a
      good result. This is usually determined by measuring the amount of HIV in the blood (viral
      load). The best response is when HIV cannot be found (less than 50 copies/mL) in the blood.
      However, it has recently become clear that some people with HIV who are receiving effective
      HIV drugs continue to have more health problems than people without HIV infection. Sometimes,
      there is damage to organs in the body, including bone, kidneys, and the brain.
