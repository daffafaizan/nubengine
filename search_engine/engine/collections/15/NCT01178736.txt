      low resource settings where screening programs are not currently in place and establishing a
      population based mammographic screening would be expensive, resource intensive, and difficult
      if not impossible to implement. The effectiveness of the screening and diagnostic methodology
      used for early detection of breast, cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancers in low resource
      settings will be studied. The program would involve screening of asymptomatic women for
      Breast and Cervical cancer and diagnostic assessment of symptomatic women for Ovarian and
      Endometrial cancer. Women in the age group of 30-59 yrs will be screened once every three
      years utilizing the following methods: Breast - clinical breast examination [CBE] and
      Sonography, followed by Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of screen positive cases;
      Cervical - Human Papilloma Virus DNA testing followed by Cryotherapy of screen positive cases
      (Single visit, screen and treat approach); Ovarian - Transvaginal sonogram and clinical
      evaluation; Endometrial - Transvaginal sonographic assessment of the endometrial stripe.
