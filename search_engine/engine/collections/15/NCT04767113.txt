      catheter, induce catheter-related infection or venous thromboembolism in the deep veins or
      pulmonary vessels, which furthermore progress into the post-thrombotic syndrome. Researches
      using echogenic mass as the primary outcome could miss those premature thrombi which might
      not be seen on traditional ultrasonography but may be detected by Duplex and Doppler
      ultrasound with vessel compression. Moreover, studies indicated that some thrombus developed
      after the catheter removal. Removal of the catheter is not the endpoint of thrombus
      detection. This study is designed to determine the preventive effects of continuous heparin
      infusion on real-world central venous catheter-related thrombosis in infants after cardiac
      surgery. One hundred and twenty-four infants were randomized to the intervention group or the
      control group. Unfractionated heparin or normal saline was infused continuously through each
      lumen of the central venous catheter at the speed of 0.5 ml/h/line until the catheter was
      removed. Catheter-related thrombosis was detected by point-of-care Duplex and Doppler
      ultrasound periodically until 30 days after the cardiac surgery or discharge, whichever comes
      first.
