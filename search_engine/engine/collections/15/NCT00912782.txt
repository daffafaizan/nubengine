      patients, accounting for up to 25% of all hospital stays, and 50% of all costs within the
      first year of initiating dialysis.The AVF provides higher blood flow rates, fewer thrombotic
      and infectious complications, and lower morbidity and cost compared with prosthetic grafts or
      central venous catheters.However,up to 50% of newly created AVF's fail to mature sufficiently
      for chronic hemodialysis use. Clearly, determining factors predictive of poor AVF maturation
      are important from both patient care and health policy perspectives and are worthy of
      investigation.

      Vitamin D has antiproliferative, antioxidant and antiangiogenic properties. The observed
      association of vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of cardiovascular and peripheral
      vascular disease may extend to the vasculature used in the creation of an AVF.

      As renal function worsens, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) produce less vitamin D,
      due to impaired renal conversion of 25-hydroxy- to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by declining renal
      1-alpha hydroxylase. As a result, at the time of dialysis initiation,78%-90% of ESRD patients
      are vitamin D deficient. Until recently, vitamin D deficiency among CKD and ESRD patients was
      only treated if hyperparathyroidism was present, however, more attention is now paid to
      nutritional vitamin D deficiency given its association with a range of comorbid
      conditions.Furthermore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and its analogue compounds are associated
      with improved survival in the CKD and ESRD populations. We believe that the observed benefits
      of vitamin D may improve AVF maturation among a population in which vitamin D deficiency is
      highly prevalent.
