      management of patients with heart disease. Several imaging methods exist, but are limited by
      cost, invasiveness, or exposure to radio-isotopes. Conventional echocardiography is a
      noninvasive method that allows estimation of left ventricular size and function; however,
      quantitative measurements of volume are not widely used due to lack of reproducibility and
      inaccurate measurements. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is a new technique that
      can be used to derive volume measurements from a single image acquisition. We hypothesize
      that real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is an accurate method for making left
      ventricular volume measurements. We therefore propose to measure left ventricular volumes
      using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography in human subjects and correlate these
      measurements with magnetic resonance imaging, a more accurate noninvasive method for
      obtaining these measurements.
