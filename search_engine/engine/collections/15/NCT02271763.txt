      for finding a specific part of the neck. Finding this part of the neck is important for
      anesthesiologists in emergencies and can sometimes be difficult. We would like to determine
      if using ultrasound is easier and more reliable than examining the neck by hand. Newer
      methods using ultrasound have not been studied in detail in the pregnant population.

      This study aims to describe a simple technique for identifying the cricothyroid membrane. The
      secondary aim is to determine how ultrasound compares to palpation in pregnant women at term.
