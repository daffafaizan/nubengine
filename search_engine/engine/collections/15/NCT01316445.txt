      effectiveness, convenience, speed, and safety. The only FDA-approved treatment for acute
      repetitive seizures must be given rectally, but nasal or buccal midazolam have been shown to
      be at least as effective. The purpose of this study is to characterize the time to effect on
      brain activity of intranasal (or nasal) midazolam and compare it with buccal midazolam. This
      research will recruit patients with epilepsy who are undergoing EEG recordings for clinical
      purposes, including those with intracranial EEG. EEG will be evaluated during administration
      of buccal or nasal midazolam for augmentation of beta waves signifying action of midazolam on
      the brain, and the time to effect will be compared between buccal and nasal formulations.
      Subjects will be given a brief survey after the administration to evaluate sedation,
      discomfort and other adverse effects of the medication. This study will help characterize the
      action of nasal and buccal benzodiazepines and to determine the most effective method of
      administration.
