      premature mortality. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish are known to have
      cardioprotective effects in subects with normal renal function. The aim of present study is
      to examine the effect of OMACOR (Omega-3-acid ethyl ester 90) on the incidence of
      cardiovascular events and mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, who has
      previously experienced a cardiovascular event.

      Design: A prospective, randomised, placebo controlled study. 2 year treatment period.
