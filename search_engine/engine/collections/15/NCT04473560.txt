      may be life-threatening condition with an estimated 30-day mortality rate about 10-30%. In
      high-risk pulmonary embolism, systemic thrombolysis is indicated, whereas recent development
      of interventional cardiology has made catheter-directed techniques an important alternative
      to thrombolytic therapy. The controversy concerns also risk stratification and treatment in
      intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism patients. A significant percentage of
      intermediate-high risk patients with pulmonary embolism may experience rapid hemodynamic
      deterioration and then the prognosis in this group is significantly worse. Catheter-directed
      techniques are aimed to quickly relive obstruction and restore pulmonary blood flow, thus
      increasing cardiac output and immediately restoring hemodynamic stability.

      The scope of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of catheter-directed
      approaches in high-risk and intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism patients.

      The primary data recorded include details of each patient's clinical status, co-morbidities
      with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the implemented catheter-directed therapy, the results
      of additional studies (lab tests results, electrocardiogram, imaging studies), and the
      outcome. The study endpoints comprise technical success, clinically relevant
      procedure-related complications or bleeding events, classified according to the Valve
      Academic Research Consortium-2 guidelines criteria.

      Collecting the fore mentioned data allows for clinicians to better manage the pulmonary
      embolism patients with increased mortality risk.
