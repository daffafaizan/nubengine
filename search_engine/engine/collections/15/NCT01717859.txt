    
      This is a 24-week, double blind open label clinical trial study to evaluate 57 active
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients who have moderate to severe disease activity with total
      Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDUS) >10 of 34 joints evaluated by Ultrasound (US) (at screening
      to enter into the study). All patients will begin treatment with tocilizumab at a dose of
      4mg/kg. Two study sites will recruit patients (UCLA and UF) using the same protocol, after
      standardizing US acquisition methods, as well as scoring. US synovitis scores will be
      acquired at screening, baseline, and pre-infusion at 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks, to be able to
      determine whether change in pre-infusion synovitis score at 4 weeks can be used to predict
      change in disease activity at 12 weeks. This will provide evidence to whether such reading is
      useful in predicting which patients may require escalation of dose from 4 to 8 mg/kg. At 12
      weeks, patients not meeting low disease activity within the 4mg/kg (disease activity score
      DAS28/ Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)-4item<3.2) will increase the tocilizumab dose to
      8mg/kg (maximum dose 800mg) in a blinded manner to enable evaluation of these US-focused
      objectives in the context of the current FDA-approved label. The ultrasound scorer will not
      know information about patient's disease activity (Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint
      Count (SJC), labs etc) or if there was dose escalation at 12 weeks. The clinical assessor of
      disease activity will be blinded to the ultrasound scores. Additionally, the patient will
      also be blinded to dose escalation. If patients in the 4mg/kg arm achieve DAS28<3.2 at 12
      weeks, patients will continue with their current dose for the duration of the study. Please
      see the below Table for details on the blinding plan.
