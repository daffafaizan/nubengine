      all known. In the cannula ileostomy group, a double row of concentric purse-string sutures
      were placed in the ileum wall using 3-0 absorbable suture. The diameters of the purse-string
      rings were about 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The investigators then made a small incision
      within the inner purse-string and inserted the trachea cannula into the proximal end of the
      ileum. The inner purse-string suture then was tied, followed by the outer purse-string
      suture. The outer purse string should capsulate the inner purse string to prevent leakage.
      Normal saline was injected into the air bag until the ileum wall began to turn pale. The
      investigators then pulled the cannula out through the abdominal wall. The incision site in
      the ileum was approximated to the inner abdominal wall and extraperitonized by fixing the
      mobilized ileum wall around the cannula to the inner abdominal wall. This was accomplished
      using 3-4 interrupted sutures.

      In the LI group, patients accepted reversal operation at least 3 months after operation if
      operation condition permission.

      In the cannula ileostomy group, the cannula will be removed after 3-4 weeks. If anastomotic
      leakage occurred, The investigators will keep the cannula until the anastomotic leakage was
      cured.
