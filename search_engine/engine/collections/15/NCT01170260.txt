      about participants' attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding sexual behavior, condom use,
      and drug use. A saliva sample is provided as well. A "Time-Line Follow-Back" is conducted,
      noting on which days certain activities occurred, such as sexual intercourse, alcohol use,
      marijuana use, and cigarette use. A urine sample is also collected in order to test for the
      STD's chlamydia and gonorrhea (if results are positive, we schedule a meeting with the
      participant to administer medication to treat the STD).

      In the second session, a 3-hour interventional health class is held with groups of
      same-gender participants. There are 3 different health classes (one focusing just on sex risk
      reduction, one focusing on sex and alcohol risk reduction, and one focusing on sex, alcohol,
      and marijuana risk reduction); participants are randomly assigned to one.

      Participants are contacted 3 months after the intervention, 6 months after, 9 months after,
      and 12 months after, in order to meet. These meetings entail completing another Time-Line
      Follow-Back and completing another questionnaire. At the final 12 month meeting, we collect
      another urine sample to again test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. As before, if results are
      positive, we schedule a meeting with the participant to administer medical treatment.
