      blood pressure (BP) control, and the lower BPs are considered to be a result of an
      improvement in volume status via increasing sodium removal. However, sodium, apart from
      volume, may have an independent effect on BP regulation. It is speculated that a reduction in
      exchangeable sodium, even without a change in body water content, may improve BP control.
      Unfortunately, as of yet, no clinical studies have actually provided the evidence in this
      field.

      In general population, dietary salt loading produces significant increase in aortic pulse
      wave velocity, which is reversed by lowering sodium intake. To the investigators knowledge,
      the effect of sodium on arterial stiffness has not been investigated in hemodialysis
      patients.

      A regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been achieved through strict dietary
      sodium restriction in hemodialysis patients. Lack of effect on LVH was observed in low sodium
      dialysis which may be due to the shorter time interval.
