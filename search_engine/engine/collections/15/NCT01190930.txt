    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To determine if a maintenance regimen containing weekly oral methotrexate at 40
      mg/m^2/week will result in an improved disease free survival (DFS) compared to that
      containing weekly oral methotrexate at 20 mg/m^2/week in the average-risk (AR) subset of
      patients with standard-risk B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). (Complete
      effective January 13, 2017) II. To determine whether a reduced-pulses maintenance regimen
      with vincristine (vincristine sulfate)/dexamethasone pulses delivered every 12 weeks can be
      used without adversely impacting DFS as compared to pulses given every 4 weeks in the AR
      subset of patients with standard risk B-precursor ALL.

      III. To confirm that patients in the low-risk (LR) subset of standard risk B-precursor ALL,
      based on clinical and cytogenetic features and minimal residual disease (MRD) criteria, can
      attain a 5 year DFS of at least 95% with either a P9904 based regimen that includes 6 courses
      of intermediate dose (1 g/m^2 over 24 hours) methotrexate without alkylating agents or
      anthracyclines (Arm LR-M), or an outpatient based regimen identical to that of AR patients
      with reduced vincristine/dexamethasone pulses at 12 week intervals during maintenance (Arm
      LR-C).

      IV. To provide standardized treatment and enhanced supportive care to children with
      standard-risk (SR) Down syndrome B-ALL in order to improve outcomes and facilitate further
      study of this biologically and clinically unique patient subgroup.

      V. To improve understanding of the biology of localized B-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma
      (B-LLy) and Down syndrome (DS) B-LLy by obtaining biologic data, including fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH) for recurrent cytogenetic lesions on paraffin specimen, and banking
      tissue for future research.

      VI. To describe the 5-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients
      with Murphy stage I and II B-LLy receiving modified AR B-ALL therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the burden of AR B-ALL therapy as measured by surveys of the child's quality of
      life, missed days of school/daycare/work by children and parents, family functioning,
      parental perception of the child's health vulnerability, physical functioning, and emotional
      distress, 1) overall at different time points during and at the end of therapy, and by 2)
      comparing children randomized to every 4 week vs. every 12 week dexamethasone/vincristine
      pulses during maintenance. (Closed to accrual as of April 19, 2013) II. To characterize the
      onset, severity, and natural history of vincristine associated neuropathy by physical
      therapists (or occupational therapists) in children undergoing therapy for AR B-ALL, 1)
      overall at different time points during and at the end of therapy, and by 2) comparing
      children randomized to every 4 week vs. every 12 week dexamethasone/vincristine pulses during
      maintenance. (Closed to accrual as of March 15, 2013)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the correlation of minimal marrow disease (MMD) at diagnosis and outcome for
      patients with B-LLy. (Closed effective Amendment #5)

      OUTLINE:

      All patients receive induction therapy comprising intrathecal (IT) cytarabine on day 1;
      vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV twice daily
      (BID) on days 1-28; pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on day 4; and IT methotrexate* on days 8
      and 29. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease are eligible to transfer to
      COG-AALL0622 by day 15 of induction therapy and patients with high-risk (HR) or very
      high-risk (VHR) disease are eligible to transfer to a COG HR or VHR trial at the end of
      induction therapy. Patients with standard-risk disease with Down syndrome (DS) who have bone
      marrow minimal residual disease 0.01% are eligible to transfer to the DS stratum of the HR
      trial. Patients with induction failure (defined as M3 [> 25% lymphoblasts] on day 29) may be
      eligible for the COG VHR-acute lymphoblastic leukemia study.
