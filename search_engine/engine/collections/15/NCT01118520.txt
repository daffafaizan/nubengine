      (AAA) growth rate, in a pilot 3-arm randomised controlled trial (i.e. the study treatment is
      chosen by random for each patient). The three interventions are ACE-inhibition with
      perindopril; equivalent blood pressure reduction with amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker)
      and a placebo tablet. By comparing the effects in the perindopril and amlodipine arms, this
      design will permit an evaluation of any blood pressure independent effects of perindopril.

      Pending results of this pilot trial, we plan to work with the local and National Aneurysm
      Screening programme to conduct a larger, definitive trial, to investigate the hypothesis that
      blood pressure reduction with an ACE-inhibitor slows the rate of small AAA growth
      preferentially compared with other antihypertensive agents.

      Secondary research questions in this trial are the effects of perindopril therapy on
      aneurysm-related death rates, other diseases possibly caused by an AAA and quality of life
      compared to similar blood pressure lowering effects with amlodipine and placebo.
