      admission. HAP occurs in patients on conventional hospital wards and in intensive care units
      (ICU), some of them associated to mechanical ventilation, known as Ventilator Associated
      Pneumonia (VAP). VAP is the most common infection on intensive care units representing 82% of
      HAP cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most frequent pathogens involved in ICU-HAP
      and despite of adequate treatment its crude mortality remains as high as 70% of the cases.
