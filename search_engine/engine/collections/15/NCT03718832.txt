    
      This is a pragmatic, prospective, randomized controlled trial of Geisinger's Fresh Food
      Farmacy (FFF) program as the program expands to new sites. Qualifying subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either early participation in the FFF program (treatment group) or
      later participation (control group).

      Approximately 500 Geisinger subjects will participate in this study with about half assigned
      to the treatment group and about half to the control group. The treatment group will begin
      the program soon after trial recruitment: the "Begin Now" group. The control group will begin
      the program after 6 months: the "Begin Later" group. Approximately 2000 household members
      will be included in the data-only portion of the research.

      Outcomes will include clinical measures, such as HbA1c, survey responses including
      self-assessed health measures, and utilization / healthy-behavior measures from EHR and paid
      claims data. These will be measured for subjects and their household members.
