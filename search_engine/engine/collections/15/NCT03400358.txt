      uterocervical angle (UCA) emerged as a new ultrasound parameter in the prediction of labor.
      Dziadosz et al concluded that the performance of UCA was even better than the cervical length
      in their cohort. A wide UCA during second trimester shown to have an increased risk of
      preterm labor and narrow angle was less likely to have labor.

      The investigators are aimed to investigate predictive role of both cervical length and UCA in
      the termination of second trimester pregnancy.The investigators focused on multiparous women
      who are taking Foley baloon for the cervical preparation and aim to measure their UCA.
