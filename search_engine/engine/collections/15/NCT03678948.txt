    
      This is a non-inferiority, prospective, single blinded, randomized, single-center study
      design with enrollment of 82 randomized subjects (to assure 70 subjects complete the study).
      The sample size of 82 participants was calculated from a power analysis. The study was
      powered to detect at least a seven point change in KOOS pain score based on achieving 80%
      statistical power to detect a non-inferiority margin. Study duration will be until the last
      subject enrolled reaches 52 weeks post-operative.

      The 82 randomized subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the Werewolf Coblation wand
      treatment group or mechanical debridement treatment group. Subjects will be blinded to their
      treatment assignment until they complete all study visits. Upon withdraw from the study,
      termination from the study, or new or recurrent symptoms requiring a subsequent arthroscopy,
      the blinded assignment will be revealed to the subject.
