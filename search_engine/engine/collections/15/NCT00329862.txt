      as truncal vagotomy. The vagus nerves will be cut just below the diaphragm using the same
      access ports that are used during the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. During the
      surgical procedure, the first fifteen patients will also receive a dose of Baclofen, a vagus
      nerve stimulant, and an endoscopy at the end of the procedure during which congo red dye will
      sprayed within the stomach. The Baclofen and endoscopy are used to ensure that all branches
      of the vagus nerve have been cut. If, after 15 complete vagotomies, are verified by the above
      testing then the use of Baclofen and endoscopy will be abandoned.
