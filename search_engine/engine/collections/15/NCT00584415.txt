      electrode-tissue interface temperature, combined with the anatomical guidance of
      electroanatomical mapping should allow:

        1. Isolation of the pulmonary veins at the LA-PV junction with the same or lower risk of
           pulmonary vein stenosis;

        2. Creation of continuous, transmural linear left atrial lesions with the same or lower
           risk of thromboembolism;

        3. These two factors will eliminate documented episodes of symptomatic sustained AF in
           patients with frequent (>3 episodes/month) or infrequent (<3 episodes/month);

        4. Patients with interruption of the vagal response (sinus bradycardia or AV block) during
           stimulation at the sites of left atrial autonomic ganglionated plexi (GP) will have
           lower recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
