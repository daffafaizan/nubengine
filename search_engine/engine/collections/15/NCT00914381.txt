      TSF+VC). VBRT voucher value increased for each successive cocaine-free urine sample obtained
      twice weekly during the 1st 12 weeks and was faded from the final earned value to $5 during
      the last 12 weeks. All subjects earned vouchers for attendance at scheduled twice weekly
      counseling sessions. Manual-guided CRA and TSF were provided by experienced clinicians.
