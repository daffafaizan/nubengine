      for this size, the half-width would be equal to 5% for a frequency of 50% corresponding to a
      confidence interval of maximum width. In view of the type of survey and the need for 12
      months of monitoring in the context of standard practice, it may be anticipated that the
      drop-off rate will be about 20%. A sample size of N = 500 patients was therefore chosen.
