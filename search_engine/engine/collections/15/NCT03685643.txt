      associated with risks such as unsafe sexual behavior and privacy concerns in young adults.

      The study design is an open-labeled cluster randomized controlled trial with an intervention
      and a placebo control arm. The intervention group will receive a web-based intervention
      developed through focus group discussions, crowdsourcing contest, and a Peer-Vetted Creative
      Production (PVCP) workshop comprising of four short videos, a risk assessment tool, and a
      scenario game. The control group will receive a web-based resource with similar multimedia
      elements on health and exercise.

      Based on the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model, the primary outcome
      of this study is self-efficacy in using dating applications measured by the General Self
      Efficacy Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in attitudes regarding risk perception
      measured by the Risk Propensity Scale and depression symptoms.
