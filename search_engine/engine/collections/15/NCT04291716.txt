      awareness and amnesia. The frequency of seizures is not easily documented. The individual who
      suffers from seizures may be unaware that a seizure is occurring. Many seizures, including
      generalized major motor seizures, have stereotyped, vigorous motor activity associated with
      the events.

      Currently, accurate seizure detection relies on EEG and video which are limited by time, size
      and mobility. Seizure detection can also use biomarkers such as movement patterns described
      by gyroscopes. These devices can monitor patterns of movement which correspond to the
      activity during seizures and kept in a log of seizures without patient input. The log can be
      used to notify patients or caregivers of seizures.

      This study is to determine the accuracy of a system using a commercial, wearable device
      linked to a computer algorithm based in the cloud which stores the movement pattern and
      notifies the patient and others of a generalized major motor seizure. The accuracy will be
      determined by a comparison of the system detections to simultaneously recorded video
      electroencephalogram, considered the "gold standard" of seizure detection.
