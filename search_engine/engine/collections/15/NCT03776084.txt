      patients diagnosed with SAHS and with indication of CPAP of the sleep unit of the Hospital de
      Sabadell. Is a cohort study. The dependent variables are adherence to treatment (% patients
      who continue using CPAP one year after initiation of treatment) and objective compliance with
      treatment (defined as use of â‰¥4h / night). For a confidence level of 95%, a sample of 405
      patients was recruited, recruited consecutively at a rate of 33 patients per month among
      those diagnosed with SAHS and those indicated with CPAP treatment. This number foresees a
      possible abandonment rate of 5%. For the statistical analysis of the data related to
      compliance with the therapy and compliance with the follow-up process, descriptive analysis
      of the data with means, median and 95% CI, or percentages with 95% CI. For the statistical
      analysis of the factors influencing compliance: multivariate logistic regression.
