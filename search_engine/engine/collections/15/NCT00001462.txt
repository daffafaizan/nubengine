      earlier and their lung function declines faster than the general population of individuals
      with chronic obstructive lung disease. This study is designed to better understand the
      pathogenesis of lung destruction in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficient individuals and to
      characterize the pathobiology of early lung destruction. To accomplish this we intend to use
      bronchoalveolar lavage to determine and quantify the factors that initiate and sustain lung
      inflammation in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficient individuals with lung function above a force
      expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of greater than 50% of predicted.
