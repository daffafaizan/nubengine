      the axilla along the medial border of the arm to pass into the forearm via the cubital tunnel
      at the elbow. Cubital tunnel syndrome is the result of compression and traction on the ulnar
      nerve about the elbow, which can occur at multiple sites. The most proximal possible site of
      compression causing is the arcade of Struthers. This entity has been described as an
      aponeurotic band, as a fibrous canal or as thickened connective tissue. Regardless of the
      nomenclature, ulnar nerve compression has been documented at the location of the arcade of
      Struthers, which is 6 to 10 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle. Simple open in situ
      decompression typically results in decompression of the ulnar nerve 6 cm proximal and 6 cm
      distal to the medial epicondyle while endoscopic ulnar nerve decompression decompresses on
      average 17 cm of the ulnar nerve (range 25-23 cm), thus consistently reaching the area of the
      arcade of Struthers. Recurrent cubital tunnel syndrome after simple decompression can be due
      failure to the release of the arcade of Struthers, and the revision surgery involved
      extending the incision and length of ulnar nerve release. With the advances in ultrasound
      imaging, the identification of the arcade of Struthers in mid arm is feasible. hence, it
      would be beneficial to identify the presence and the location of the arcade of Struthers
      pre-operatively, to direct the surgical procedure to decompress the ulnar nerve more
      proximally in cases of a simple decompression in situ.
