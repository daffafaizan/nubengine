      addresses the question whether an excess of apoptotic/necrotic cells can induce an at least
      transient autoimmune phenomena in humans. If the hypothesis of a transient induction of
      autoimmunity by trauma proves to be correct, this study will provide a novel insight into the
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
