      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival.

      Secondary

        -  Compare toxicities.

        -  Compare response rate.

        -  Compare overall survival.

        -  Evaluate clinical benefits.

        -  Compare quality of life.

        -  Identify biomarkers that predict therapeutic response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV once weekly for 7 weeks followed by 1 week of rest (course1). For the
           next 2 courses, patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride weekly for 3 weeks followed
           by 1 week of rest and sorafenib tosylate twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily and gemcitabine hydrochloride as in
           arm I.

      After completing 3 courses of therapy, patients in both arms who have stable or responding
      disease may continue to receive sorafenib tosylate or placebo in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
