    
      This is a real-life, non-interventional, observational, multicentre study in all patients
      (including children) receiving Zimino® in France.

      The patients will be evaluated during the index hospitalisation and on follow-up days 30
      (±15) and 90 (±15) after hospital discharge. The follow-up can be a phone call or a visit to
      the hospital. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be identified consecutively at
      each hospital. The participating hospitals will vary in size and medical activities,
      depending on their location and the population size they serve.

      The physician will determine the patient's treatment strategy. Drug prescriptions and the
      indications to perform diagnostic or therapeutic procedures will be left completely to the
      discretion of the physicians.

      The estimated enrollment period is 12 months (enrollment of the first patient - enrollment of
      the last patient), or less if the cohort (n=600) is completed earlier, and the maximum total
      data collection period is 15 months.
