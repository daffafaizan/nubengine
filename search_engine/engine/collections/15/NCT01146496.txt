      (mean adult population 900) in rural Sri Lanka to determine the effectiveness and cost of the
      provision of safe storage containers to prevent pesticide poisoning.

      The study will be based in Anuradhapura District where we have carried out public health
      studies of pesticide poisoning since 2002. 81 intervention and 81 control villages will be
      recruited. Randomisation will be clustered, with villages rather than households randomised.
      A census will be performed at baseline and after 3 years to establish the population
      demographics and number of person-years exposed.

      The primary outcome will be the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning; secondary outcomes
      will be the incidence of all self-poisoning, all self-harm, fatal self-harm, pesticide
      poisoning and unintentional paediatric pesticide poisoning. We will use Poisson regression
      models, taking account of clustering and stratification, for the analysis.

      The study will provide definitive evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of this approach
      that will determine whether it should be promoted across Asia.
