      health-related quality of life scale and neuro-ophthalmological tests are administered. The
      duration of intervention is about 3 hours by patient and one year to finish this part.

      In the second part, we include about 40 of 100 MS patients who present an oscillopsia due to
      pendular nystagmus and a group of 20 control subjects. The patients and subject will perform
      a motion detection task and the vision-specific health-related quality of life, the
      intervention lasting 1 hour. Then the patients will be randomized in one group treated by
      rehabilitation (one 30 mn session per week during 3 months) and the other one without
      treatment. A motion detection task and the vision-specific health-related quality of life
      scale will be performed at the end of the treatment for both groups.
