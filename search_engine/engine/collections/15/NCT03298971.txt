      5-year overall survival rates of childhood osteosarcoma survivors have been increasing
      substantially with a percentage approaching to 70%. Regrettably, the improved survival rates
      may lead to long-term sequelae related to disease and treatments that can negatively affect
      survivors' physical and psychological well-being. Despite numerous studies have examined the
      impact of cancer and treatment-related late effects on the physical and psychological aspects
      of osteosarcoma survivors in the foreign countries, it has not been studied specifically in
      Hong Kong Chinese population. Problems arise when there is a difference in perception and
      recognition of psychological problems and emotional well-being between Western and Chinese
      culture. Moreover, the difference in coping strategies between Chinese and Western children
      also affects how they react and cope with the devastating effect from cancer and its
      treatments. Due to the cultural and belief differences, the findings from those studies in
      the foreign counties may not be applicable and transferable in Hong Kong context. There is
      thus an imperative need to investigate the impact of cancer and treatment-related effects on
      the physical and psychosocial well-being and quality of life among Hong Kong Chinese
      survivors of childhood osteosarcoma in order to raise awareness of the holistic wellness of
      osteosarcoma survivors.
