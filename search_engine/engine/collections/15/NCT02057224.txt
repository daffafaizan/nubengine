      efferent activity has been used successfully to treat drug-resistant hypertension. Previous
      studies has demonstrated a reduction of muscle sympathetic nerve activity and renal and total
      body noradrenaline spillover. In addition, renal denervation seems to improve glucose
      metabolism and insulin sensitivity, representing the first potential nonpharmaceutical
      approach for treating insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms are unclear. There is a
      clear relationship between sympathetic overactivity and insulin resistance. Activation of the
      sympathetic nervous systems contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders and
      insulin itself induces sympathetic overactivity. One possible explanation to improved glucose
      metabolism after renal denervation is altered adipose tissue function (due to the reduction
      in sympathetic activity). Therefore,15 individuals undergoing renal denervation are
      recruited. The clinical study includes anthropometry, peripheral blood samples, body
      composition, heart rate variability and subcutaneous fat biopsies before renal denervation
      and after 6 months.
