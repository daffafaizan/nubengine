      (induction therapy). Clinical response will be assessed by audiology and MRI at weeks 12 and
      24. Subjects with hearing decline at weeks 12 or 24 will be taken off of protocol. At week
      24, patients with a clinical response or stable disease (together comprising "clinical
      benefit") will transition to maintenance therapy with bevacizumab. During the maintenance
      phase, subjects will be treated with open-label bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to
      72 weeks. Subjects will be followed with audiology and MRI scans every 12 weeks. The total
      time of the study will be 96 weeks (24 weeks induction + 72 weeks maintenance).

      Subjects will be allowed to increase their bevacizumab dose to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks during
      maintenance therapy if they experience hearing decline during maintenance therapy (defined as
      decrease in word recognition score below the 95% critical difference compared with the word
      recognition score at baseline, Appendix A). Subjects will be taken off of study if their word
      recognition score does not remain within the 95% critical difference after receiving
      bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.
