    
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients on ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) make antibodies in
      response to the coronavirus vaccine. Ocrelizumab depletes B-lymphocytes and has the potential
      to reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. The impact of ocrelizumab treatment on coronavirus
      vaccines is unknown.

      Natalizumab (Tysabri) likely has a minimal impact the efficacy of vaccines. In this study the
      investigators will take blood samples in patients being treated with either ocrelizumab or
      natalizumab before and after vaccination with an FDA-authorized coronavirus (COVID-19)
      vaccine and compare the antibody response in both groups.
