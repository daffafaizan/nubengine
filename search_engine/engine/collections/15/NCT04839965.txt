    
      Ampion is the low molecular weight filtrate of human serum albumin with the in vitro ability
      to modulate inflammatory cytokine levels. Ampion has the potential to improve clinical
      outcomes for COVID-19 patients by reducing inflammatory cytokines correlated with the
      disease.

      This study aims to evaluate Ampion and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 requiring
      supplemental oxygen.
