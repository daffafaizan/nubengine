    
      In this study, a single-center, randomized, open, two-cycle, self-crossover, single-dose
      administration design was used to evaluate the bioequivalence of the tested preparations and
      reference preparations given to Chinese healthy subjects with single-dose, fasting and
      post-meal administration of Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Sustained Release Tablets.

      This study was divided into two parts: fasting administration and high-fat post-meal
      administration.The healthy subjects were randomly divided into two groups with the same
      number of patients in each group. The washing period was 7Â±1 days.

      In this study, venous blood was collected at 18 time points (fasting and postprandial) within
      1h (0h) before administration and at 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h, 4.0h, 5.0h, 6.0h, 7.0h, 8.0h, 9.0h,
      10.0h, 11.0h, 12.0h, 16.0h, 36.0h, 48.0h, and 72.0h after administration.

      A total of 60 healthy subjects were enrolled into the equivalence test, among which:

        1. Study on human bioequivalence of drug administration on an empty stomach: 30 healthy
           subjects (male and female).

        2. Human bioequivalence of high-fat post-meal administration: 30 healthy subjects (male and
           female).
