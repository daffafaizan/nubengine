      whom will recruit 60 elder participants to be randomized into either the intervention
      (CBT+exercise) or control (enhanced usual care) groups. Each participant randomized into the
      intervention group will receive 10 sessions of individual CBT for depression and anxiety
      (Positive Minds), using a translated and culturally adapted manual, and administered by a
      trained community health worker. In addition, each participant will engage in three exercise
      groups per week for 12 weeks, using the Increased Velocity Specific to Task (Strong Bodies;
      InVEST) protocol. Both intervention and control groups will be assessed biweekly for symptoms
      of depression, anxiety, and suicidality, and both groups will participate in a thorough
      assessment at baseline, and 2, 6, and 12 months after baseline.
