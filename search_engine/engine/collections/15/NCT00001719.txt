      to hepatic anatomy and the dynamics of portal blood flow. These differences may result from
      inhomogeneous delivery of hepatic toxins or trophic substances, tumor secretion products or
      tumor metastases to different portions of the liver. In addition to effects on the natural
      history of hepatic disease, these features may affect the performance (planning/methods) and
      interpretation of diagnostic studies, such as hepatic venous sampling for measurement of
      tumor secretion products. This study will combine non-invasive quantitative in vivo
      measurements of blood flow with in vitro modeling of the vascular system. The purpose of the
      study is to define the normal hemodynamics of hepatic blood flow, particularly portal flow,
      using Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and to draw inferences regarding the role of
      hemodynamics in the natural history of hepatic disease.
