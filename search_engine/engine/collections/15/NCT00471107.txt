    
      OBJECTIVE: The principal objective is to establish whether DC polarization of left lateral
      prefrontal cortex can enhance verbal memory.

      STUDY POPULATION: 75 healthy volunteers over the age of 18 will be enrolled.

      DESIGN: The study is a double-blind parallel study with three arms: anodal polarization,
      cathodal polarization, and sham treatment.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure is performance on the WMS-III Word Lists test.
      Secondary outcome measures, testing for effects of DC polarization on basic information
      processing and non-verbal memory, respectively, are the CalCAP and WMS-III Visual
      Reproduction Test. The Verbal Fluency Test will be administered prior to stimulation and 24
      hours post-stimulation to screen for other residual effects of the polarization on the
      stimulated region.
