    
      This 12 week multicomponent, tailored, progressive program will consist of both moderate
      intensity walking and strengthening exercises at home. This single centre, single arm study
      will incorporate a behavioural change consultation at baseline and weekly behavioural support
      throughout. This study will follow-up patients at 24 weeks to determine exercise maintenance.
      Outcome measures will be completed at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. A qualitative evaluation
      will be conducted after the 24 week follow-up to determine impact, patient experience and
      measures that might assist in refining the program.
