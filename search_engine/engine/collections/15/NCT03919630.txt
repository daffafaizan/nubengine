      musculoskeletal, cervical spine, disc, or soft tissue elements and are accompanied by neck
      pain. Dominant features of cervicogenic headache include unilateral head pain, external
      pressure over the ipsilateral upper neck, limited cervical range of motion, and trigger
      attacks by various neck motions. Cervicogenic headaches typically originate from the
      atlanto-occipital and upper 3 segments of the cervical spine and can radiate to the head or
      face region. Physical therapist have for some time been treating cervicogenic headaches with
      a variety of different treatment techniques ranging from conservative therapy, passive and
      active range of motion, stretching for cervical, strengthening exercises for the upper
      extremity, and manual therapy. However, little is known about the effects of thrust and
      non-thrust manipulative physical therapy treatments along with exercises to help reduce
      cervicogenic headaches. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of physical
      therapy in treating headaches using non-thrust to the upper 3 segments of the cervical spine
      or thrust mobilizations to the upper 3 segments, plus the addition of postural corrective
      exercises in treating cervicogenic headaches.
