    
      The study is a prospective multi-center evaluation of approximately 350 subjects implanted
      with a St. Jude Medical (SJM) Trifectaâ„¢ GT valve. It will be conducted in approximately 35
      sites worldwide.

      Subjects will be followed for 5 years. The total duration of the study is expected to be 6
      years, assuming all subjects are enrolled within 1 year of study initiation. To ensure
      enrollment balance across sites, no individual site can enroll more than 10% of the sample
      size (n=35 subjects) without prior approval from the sponsor.
