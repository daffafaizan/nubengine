      with CONSORT quality guidelines.The RCT will compare the outcome of 16 sessions of IBCT
      compared to 16 sessions of ERP in OCD patients. The principal investigators and independent
      evaluators will be blind to the random allocation treatment conditions with a randomization
      ratio of 1:1. Both treatments will be administered by trained therapists on a weekly
      one-on-one basis over a 16-week period with 6-month follow-up conforming to current thinking
      on relapse in OCD. Conditions of treatment delivery, duration and monitoring will be
      equivalent across all groups. Both treatments are manualized and any newly engaged therapists
      will receive intensive training in one therapy protocol to ensure optimal delivery of each
      modality.

      The objective of the present study is to establish IBCT as a psychological treatment that is
      as effective as ERP, but significantly more tolerable and generalizable for the high
      proportion of patients who are unable to benefit from ERP.

      The hypotheses is IBCT is non-inferior to ERP; IBCT is superior to ERP among OCD patients
      with high levels of OVI and IBCT is more tolerable than ERP with lower rates of treatment
      refusal, drop-out and higher levels of treatment satisfaction in comparison to ERP.
