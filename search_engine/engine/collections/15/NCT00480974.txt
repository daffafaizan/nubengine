      significant decrease in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises and other crises related to
      SCA. Several studies were published with relative short term follow up in pediatric and young
      adult age. The purpose of this study is to assess the long term follow up in a group of
      patients that initiated Hydroxyurea treatment in childhood.

      A long term follow up will be recorded in a cohort of twenty SCA patients treated by
      Hydroxyurea for a period between 5 to 12 years. The frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, acute
      chest syndrome, blood transfusions, and hospitalization will be recorded retrospectively.
      Also the mean hgb level and hgb F percentage will be summarized.
