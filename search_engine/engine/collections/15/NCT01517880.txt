      myopathy caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid (SA). Substrate
      replacement therapy is a potential therapeutic strategy based on the success of replacing
      missing SA and reducing muscle disease in a relevant mouse model of the human disease
      (Malicdan et al., 2009). Successful use of SA replacement therapy in humans is believed to
      depend upon providing steady long-term exposure to the compound in an extended release form
      (such as Sialic Acid-Extended Release [SA-ER]), given SA's short half-life. Following a Phase
      1 study to establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) for SA-ER, Ultragenyx is conducting this study
      to assess the dose and potential pharmacodynamic effect of restoring sialylation of muscle by
      treatment with SA-ER at two dose levels as compared to placebo when administered over two 24
      week periods of time. The study will also evaluate safety, as well as the effect of SA-ER on
      clinical measures of muscle strength, mobility, function and self-reported disability and
      quality of life. Effects on muscle volume/mass and function and on serum biomarkers will be
      evaluated as exploratory measures. These data should allow the selection of a dose and the
      appropriate design for a Phase 3 clinical study.
