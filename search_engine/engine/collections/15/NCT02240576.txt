      to patients who suffered a nasal fracture five to ten years ago (time period 2005-2013) with
      nose reposition afterwards under general anaesthesia in the chirurgical day care centre (CDC)
      of university hospital (UZ) Leuven.

      The control population (HC) will be recruited by sending a slightly adapted questionnaire
      (form in addendum) to patients who had surgery of the vocal cords under general anaesthesia
      in the CDC of UZ Leuven in the same period as the patient group. The control group will be
      age and sex-matched with the patient group.
