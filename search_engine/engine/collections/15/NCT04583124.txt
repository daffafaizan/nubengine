      central and peripheral nervous system. Neurotoxicity is present in up to 75% of this
      population, which implies a large impact in quality of life. There is a special interest in
      the preventive possibilities of therapeutic exercise relating to these neurological sequelae,
      whose benefits could improve thanks to the combination with vagal activation techniques.

      This superiority randomized controlled trial will be aimed to check the effects of a
      multimodal intervention (ATENTO) based on moderate-high intensity and individualized
      therapeutic exercise (aerobic and strength exercises) and vagal activation techniques
      (myofascial stretching and breathing exercises), on neurotoxicity prevention in women with
      breast cancer before starting potentially neurotoxic treatments (ATENTO-B) versus throughout
      them (ATENTO-T). A sample of 56 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer calculated with a
      power of 85% will be allocated into two groups.

      This study could provide an impetus for the introduction of early multimodal intervention
      methods of preventing neurotoxicity and consequently avoid the current QoL deterioration that
      breast cancer patients suffer throughout their treatments.
