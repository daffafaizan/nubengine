      positioning is usually performed under local anesthesia in fully awake patients. The
      procedure is uncomfortable to the patients who have to remain motionless during the whole
      surgery. Previous reports of electrode positioning under general anesthesia was found to be
      less accurate. This result was probably due to the effect of the anesthetics on the
      electrical activity of the Basal Ganglia.

      The purpose of this study is to detect possible changes in the electrical activity of the
      Basal Ganglia related to propofol sedation. Electrical activity of single neurons will be
      recorded before and after sedation.
