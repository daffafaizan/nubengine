      I. Compare the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate)
      and doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) to that of those treated with sorafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare time to progression (TTP) of patients treated with sorafenib and doxorubicin to
      that of those treated with sorafenib.

      II. Compare progression-free-survival (PFS) of patients treated with sorafenib and
      doxorubicin to that of those treated with sorafenib.

      III. Compare tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria of patients treated with sorafenib and doxorubicin to that of those treated with
      sorafenib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1 and sorafenib
      tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After 6 courses, patients may continue to receive sorafenib tosylate PO QD or BID in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO QD or BID on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
