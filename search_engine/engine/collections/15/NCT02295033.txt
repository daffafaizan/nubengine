    
      This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution, menopausal
      status, clinical tumor size, nodal status, presence of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, age, and
      resection margin status.

      The objective of this trial is to assess the local recurrence rate and the cosmetic result in
      women who have had conservative resection of small breast cancers and who are randomly
      assigned after postoperative whole-breast irradiation to no boost vs. 15-16 Gy boost
      (patients with microscopically complete resections) or 10 Gy vs. 25-26 Gy boost (patients
      with microscopically incomplete resections).

      Following tumorectomy, all patients receive radiotherapy for 5 weeks.

      Patients with microscopically negative resection margins are randomized to one of 2 groups:
      no further radiotherapy; or a radiotherapy boost with either external-beam radiotherapy or an
      interstitial implant.

      Patients with microscopically positive resection margins are also randomized to receive
      either lower dose or higher dose radiotherapy boosts by external beam or interstitial
      implant.

      Patients with positive lymph nodes are encouraged to receive at least 6 courses of adjuvant
      or perioperative chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy provided radiotherapy is initiated within
      6 months of surgery. All other patients begin radiotherapy within 9 weeks of surgery. All
      postmenopausal women with positive lymph nodes receive oral tamoxifen daily for 2 years.
