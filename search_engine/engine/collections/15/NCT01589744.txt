      aim to show control of the bleeding stops in the case of PPH but to prove, in a clinical
      situation with no foreseeable risk to the volunteers included (volunteers who have given
      birth without placental abruption after 30 minutes despite the directed delivery), proof of
      concept of using this system in these women that creates a vacuum in the Intra uterine
      Haemostatic vacuum and thus a joining of the walls of the uterus. This first step seems
      essential in order to effectively implement this medical device with serenity in emergency
      situations of PPH.
