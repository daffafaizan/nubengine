      and/or related disease. Participants could be evaluated on a yearly basis, undergoing a
      baseline visit and possible follow-up evaluations with an interval of one year. At each
      visit, participants could undergo any combination of the following based on their symptoms
      and complaints: a neurological assessment, a speech/language assessment, a neuropsychometric
      assessment, an MRI, an FDG PET/CT scan, a PiB PET/CT scan, a Tau PET/CT scan, a DaTscan, a
      gait lab test, an ocular motor or eye movement exam and/or a swallow evaluation. At baseline
      only, all participants will be asked to provide a blood sample to allow for future genetic
      studies.
