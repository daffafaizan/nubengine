      DSAEK and UT-DSAEK for Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) and Moderate Pseudophakic
      Bullous Keratopathy (PBK). To secondarily research the correlates criterions with best
      spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) 12 months postoperatively.

      In a retrospective, single-center, observational study, 218 eyes treated with DMEK (n=110),
      UT-DSAEK (n=58) and DSAEK (n=50) surgeries were studied. Patients requiring posterior
      lamellar transplantation for FECD or moderate PBK, with preoperative BSCVA of less than 0.3
      logmar, were selected. Patients with pathologies that may seriously affect VA postoperatively
      were excluded. Graft thickness for DSAEK was measured during the surgery and in vivo at D8,
      D15, M1, M6, M12 and M24. The primary endpoint was best spectacle corrected visual acuity
      (BSCVA) in logMAR at 6, 12 and 24 months. We deliberately differentiated our postoperative
      visual results by comparing DMEK with DSAEK or UT-DSAEK with central graft thickness (CGT)
      measurements carried out either pre-operatively (less than or greater than 130 µm) or
      post-operatively at 6 months (less than or greater than 100µm). Type of endothelial graft,
      Donor and recipient's ages, Graft's endothelial cell density (ECD), Rebubbling rate,
      preoperative VA, graft's indications and surgical time were also tested to explain BSCVA at
      12 months.
