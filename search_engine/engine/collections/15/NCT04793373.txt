      result in a similar overall success rate for catheter placement, but with a larger reduction
      in change of elapsed time for identification of epidural space and catheter placement of each
      practitioner. Moreover, we hypothesize that the cumulative learning summary curve using
      EpiFaith® syringe will be higher than conventional glass syringe in resident trainees, which
      will show the possible value of EpiFaith® syringe for teaching and learning obstetric
      epidural anesthesia.
