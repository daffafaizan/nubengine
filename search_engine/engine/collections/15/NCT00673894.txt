      GLP-1 and insulin in participants with type 2 diabetes. Preliminary data published by our
      group suggests that glutamine is a strong determinant of GLP-1 secretion in vitro. We tested
      the hypothesis that glutamine lowers postprandial blood glucose and investigated whether the
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin modifies this effect.
