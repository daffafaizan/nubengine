    
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-center study to examine the feasibility of the
      TransLoc DPS electrode placement and removal. Twelve (12) subjects undergoing a surgical
      procedure will receive the device (four electrodes) and will be followed until electrode
      removal up to seven days post-procedure. Subjects will be selected from surgical candidates
      undergoing laparoscopic, open abdominal, and open thoracic procedures.

      The primary endpoints are identified to show the viability of the procedure and integrity of
      the system through the placement, use, monitoring, and removal of the electrodes. The
      secondary endpoints are identified to determine the effectiveness of electrode placement.

      The long-term intent of these investigations is to avoid the effects of ventilator induced
      diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) and the associated complications and costs, and to improve the
      quality of patient care.
