      theta burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) targeting right inferior frontal region
      in resistant obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, monocentric study. The study will also assess the interest of some
      clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, electrophysiological variables in response
      prediction, besides physiopathological information.

      There is an increasing interest in developping treatments for resistant OCD, which are not
      responding to the conventional treatment, represented by pharmacotherapy associated to
      cognitive behavioral therapy. Repetitive TMS represents a promising non invasive brain
      stimulation approach, but efficacy, best available brain target, optimal responder profile
      and stimulation parameters need to be further documented.

      In this study, the included patients will be randomly assigned to an active (theta burst TMS)
      or sham-placebo treatment group. TMS will be added to their stable pharmacotherapy. The brain
      target, the right inferior frontal region, involved in the inhibition control brain network,
      will be defined in a personalized manner via a fMRI paradigm for each patient. TMS will be
      delivered daily for 2 successive weeks. Measures of different clinical, neuropsychological ,
      electrophysiological (cortical excitability) variables will be performed at baseline, as well
      as at the end of the TMS course, and 1 week after. Other assessments are planned at 3 and 6
      months, in order to highlight the evolution of the potential benefit.
