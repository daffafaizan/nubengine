      antineoplastic activity by preventing angiogenesis and enhancing tumor cell apoptosis. Also
      it was suggested that measurement of serum taurine level in hepatic patients beside fibroscan
      is of great value in the early diagnosis of any fibrotic and cancerous liver changes.Aim of
      the work was to correlate serum taurine level with the levels of the specific tumor markers
      (α- fetoprotein and α-L-fucosidase ) for early diagnosis of different stages of HCC in
      Egyptian patients.

      This observational case-control study was conducted in the Tropical Medicine Department,
      Ahmed Maher Teaching Hospital. Eighty hepatic patients were assigned to three groups (Chronic
      hepatitis, Cirrhosis and HCC). Twenty healthy subjects were enrolled as a control group.
      Serum levels of AFP, AFU, and taurine beside complete biochemical analysis and liver biopsies
      from all selected patients were done. Patients who accepted to be a candidate for living
      donor liver transplant (LDLT) were referred to Ain Shams University Specialized Hospital
      (ASUSH) liver transplant unit.
