      the procedure, sedation, analgesia or anesthesia are often required. Propofol and alfentanyl
      are used for these patients for years, but these drugs are used in intravenous form and can
      be found in follicular fluid. Although further investigation needs to be undertaken to
      investigate any potential influence on fertilization and implantation rates, we
      anesthesiologist want to lower the use of drugs in these women. Target-controlled infusion
      (TCI) pumps can estimate and calculate the target and plasma concentration of propofol. By
      using these pumps , we can estimate the stable concentration of drugs. Besides, Bispectral
      index (BIS) monitor can help us to evaluate awareness or unarousable amnesia when we turn
      lower the drug use and keep patients amnesia during the procedure. Transcutaneous carbon
      dioxide monitor (tcCO2) can mimic the level of CO2 in patients by using noninvasive method.
      During anesthesia, CO2 will retain and may induce CO2 nacrosis, so we use these noninvasive
      method to help us to detect CO2 level preventing CO2 nacrosis and to see if there are any
      relationship with BIS.
