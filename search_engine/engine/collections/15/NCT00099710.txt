      anti-inflammatory (NSAID), and cholesterol-lowering properties, all of which make it a good
      candidate in the prevention and treatment of AD. The study will examine the safety and
      tolerability of 2 different doses of curcumin C3 complex. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      tests will be used to examine how the curcumin is absorbed in the body, and whether it has an
      effect on inflammation, oxidative damage, and cholesterol levels. Participants will also be
      tested to determine the potential effect of curcumin on cognition, behavior, and daily
      function in patients with mild to moderate AD.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of curcumin, or a placebo,
      for the initial 6 months of the trial. For the final 6 months, those receiving a placebo will
      be switched to one of the two doses of the drug. The 33 participants will make 7 visits to
      the study site over a 12-month period. These visits may include a physical and neurological
      examination, routine laboratory tests, lumbar puncture, and neuropsychological (mood and
      memory) evaluations.
