      antiviral activities to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and reduces the adverse effects
      of nephrotoxicity and bone mineral density reduction. This drug has already been reimbursed
      by National Health Insurance, and can be used for the treatment of patients with chronic
      hepatitis B.

      This is a single-arm prospective clinical trial to enroll patients who discontinued entecavir
      (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and experienced a clinical hepatitis flare up.
      They can be retreated with TAF for 48 weeks without postponing a 3-month observation period
      for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. The virological control, ALT level recovery, and
      changes in liver fibrosis, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core-associated antigen,
      and renal function will be observed during retreatment. In addition, a group of patients with
      the same characteristics who received retreatment with entecavir or TDF will be collected as
      a control group for comparison. We believe this study can help us understand the clinical
      benefits of switching to TAF for retreatment after hepatitis flare in patients to discontinue
      oral antiviral agents.
