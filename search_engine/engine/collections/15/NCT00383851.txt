      most standard systemic therapy, and all newly diagnosed patients should be considered
      candidates for clinical trials. Although advanced melanoma is relatively resistant to
      therapy, several biologic response modifiers and cytotoxic agents have been reported to
      produce objective responses. Once melanoma is metastatic, treatments are palliative rather
      than curative. In spite of many attempts at multimodality therapy, the prognosis in this
      disease remains poor. Further agents are needed if progress is to be made with melanoma
      treatment.

      ATN-224 is an orally active, small molecule that has been shown in cellular and animal models
      to be antiangiogenic and to have activity against melanoma cell lines. Clinical studies with
      a similar agent (ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) indicate that the agent can be administered
      continuously on a daily basis for years in some patients. ATN-224 has the potential to affect
      the progression of melanoma by mechanisms that include both antiangiogenic and antitumor
      pathways. Temozolomide, a commonly used agent for melanoma, also has a tolerable profile.
