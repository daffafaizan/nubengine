      Background:Non-pharmacological interventions are a valuable aspect of Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease(COPD) treatment, leading to the role of nurses to become more and more
      important. An Education-Based Intervention Program(EBIP) consists of several steps that aim
      to achieve better health outcomes through guidingCOPD patients to reduce dyspnea symptoms and
      improve chronic self-care management skills. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dyspnea
      and chronic self-care management outcomes of EBIP compared to routine care.

      Method:A total of 61 Stage II COPD patients that were hospitalized and treated in the month
      of January 2019 in a university hospital were selected for the study, who had been discharged
      less than one month ago and resided downtown. 51 conforming patients were divided into
      experimental(EBIP intervention) and control groups for a single-blind randomized trial. Data
      were collected using an introductory information form, pulmonary function test(PFT), the
      Baseline Dyspnea Index(BDI), body mass index(BMI) and the Self Care Management Process in
      Chronic Illness(SCMP-G) scale. There were no addition interventions to the control group. The
      intervention group underwent a 3-month EBIP intervention that included education, house
      visits and follow-ups through phone calls. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0
      with descriptive statistics, x2,Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. p<0.05 was
      statistically significant.
