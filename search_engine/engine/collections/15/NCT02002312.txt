      advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The trial requires 14 patients. CT scans will be
      carried out at baseline and after 12 weeks, for response assessment using RECIST criteria.

      Patients will initially receive 5 mCi/10 mg Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab antibody (an imaging
      dose preceeding Lu-177-girentuximab treatment). Whole body and blood measurements of
      radioactivity will be obtained on at least three occasions for one week to determine
      targeting and dosimetry. Only if at least one known and evaluable metastatic lesion is
      visualized with In-111-DOTA-girentuximab, therapeutic Lu-177-DOTA- girentuximab will be
      administered the following week. In the absence of disease progression and after recovery
      from toxicity, patients may be retreated no sooner than 12 weeks after the prior treatment
      with a dose of no more than 75% of the previous dose, for a total of not more than three
      treatments. Only patients who have normal pharmacokinetics on the preceding diagnostic
      In-111-girentuximab study (indicative of human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) negativity) are
      eligible for retreatment.
