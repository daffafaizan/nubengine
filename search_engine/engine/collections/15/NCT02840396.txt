    
      Background:

      Several studies investigating healthy or clinical populations have shown that (r)TMS applied
      over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has an effect on language-related processes
      such as verbal working memory (Osaka et al., 2007), sentence comprehension (Cotelli et al.,
      2011) and language switching (Holtzheimer et al., 2005, Nardone et al., 2011).

      Clinical observations and neuroimaging studies seem to confirm the role of executive
      functions and frontal structures in language processing in monolingual and bilingual subjects
      (e.g. Fabbro et al., 2000, Abutalebi & Green 2007). However, only few studies investigated
      the effects of modulation of cognitive control-networks on lexical access.

      Aim and procedure:

      The study will investigate the role of the DLPFC and executive functioning in L1 and L2
      language processing. The core question is whether rTMS over the DLPFC will influence lexical
      access and language production.

      Each participant will take part in two sessions: 1. rTMS session 2. Sham rTMS session. After
      the application of rTMS/Sham rTMS, the participants will conduct two language tasks
      (translation, picture naming) and a non-verbal task, while the EEG is recorded.
