      change is to better understand their current levels of engagement in these behaviors and
      determine which factors most influence their engagement. Within and outside the Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA), little is known about how patients with risk factors for T2DM
      view their risk of developing T2DM, what these patients understand about strategies to reduce
      this risk, and to what degree at-risk patients are currently engaging in behaviors to prevent
      T2DM. This project will generate important new data in these areas and will improve the
      investigators' understanding of the effects of a prediabetes diagnosis and brief counseling
      on engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM and mediators of these behaviors.
