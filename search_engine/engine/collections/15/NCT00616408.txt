    
      From Jan 1st 1995 to December 31st 2006, all files of patients with newly diagnosed active
      acromegaly out of the 297 patients coming to our Department for acromegaly who received
      first-line treatment with LAR will be considered for this study.

      As our routine procedure, all patients signed an informed consent to approve diagnostic
      testing, treatment decision, methods for follow-up and data treatment for scientific
      purposes. This study has been conducted in accordance with the Helsinki II Declaration on
      human experimentation. This study takes advantage from data collected in a large, prospective
      study to investigate the effect of first-line surgery or medical therapy (with somatostatin
      analogues and/or dopamine/agonists) on GH, IGF-I, tumor mass, cardiovascular risk markers,
      cardiomyopathy, hypertension, metabolic profile and prostate diseases in all the patients
      coming for a diagnosis of acromegaly in our Department and approved by our Ethical Committee
      the 14/10/97 (no.60/97).
