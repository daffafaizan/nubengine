    
      AZT is currently indicated for primary treatment in children with HIV-associated signs and
      symptoms and for those with significant immunodeficiency. This study will attempt to
      determine whether early treatment with AZT prevents the development of symptoms in
      HIV-infected infants who are asymptomatic.

      Patients are randomized to receive oral AZT (at age-adjusted doses) or placebo. Patients are
      evaluated at weeks 2 and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter; those who reach a study endpoint
      will have their treatment unblinded to allow the clinician to determine which treatment
      regimen the patient should then receive. Patients who meet the criteria for changes to
      open-label AZT will be given the appropriate age-adjusted dose without unblinding the
      original randomization assignment. Patients who complete or discontinue treatment are
      followed every 6 months for up to 2 years.
