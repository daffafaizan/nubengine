      dysregulation of the emotions of people with Borderline Personality Disorder.

      Up to this date there is no other study measuring neuropeptides kinetics of patient with
      Borderline Personality Disorder after an interpersonal stress.

      This task of stress is meant to reproduce what people with Borderline Personality Disorder
      suffer in their everyday life (ecological).

      To reach this point, an imaginary interpersonal stress will be asked to be reproduced by the
      participants.

      Neuropeptides concentrations and clinical data (fear, shame, anger, moral pain, compelling
      needs (suicidal and non-suicidal)) will be collected at different times (pre stress, post
      stress immediat, 5 minutes post stress,15 minutes post stress and 40 minutes post stress)

      As copeptin ( fragment C terminal of the vasopressin) and vasopressin are found in
      stoichiometric concentration in the plasma as copeptin is more stable than vasopressin,
      plasma copeptin level will be used to reflect the one of vasopressin.

      The hypothesis is that both the neuropeptide variation and clinical data before and after the
      interpersonal stress will be higher for the patient with Borderline Personality Disorder than
      healthy controls.

      A correlation between clinical assessments and neuropeptides kinetics is expected. This study
      will help to identify inter-individual and contextual factors impacting neuropeptide's
      kinetics
