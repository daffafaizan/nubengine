      have led to significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival.
      Cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) is an auxiliary antitumor treatment. Research has
      demonstrated the median overall survival (OS) in patients received CIK combined with
      chemotherapy (5-Fluorouridine, leucovorin and oxaliplatin [FOLFOX4] plan) was significantly
      increased compared with that in patients received chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, there was
      a trend toward superior progression-free survival time (PFS) in patients received CIK
      combined with chemotherapy compared with that in patients received chemotherapy alone. The
      investigators aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) combined with
      CIK in the treatment of postoperative colorectal cancer patients. And to provide useful
      reference for the clinical application of CIK in colorectal cancer patients.
