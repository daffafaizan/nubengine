    
      Prospective data collection of 25 Genotype 1 or 4 HCV-infected women from the San Francisco
      Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) site and 25 Genotype 1 or 4 HCV-infected men from the
      San Francisco VA Medical Center who are initiated on Zepatier for 12 weeks (Total n=50). For
      women and men with HCV genotype 1a infection, only those without baseline NS5A resistance
      mutations will be included. Blood/urine samples will be collected before initiation of
      treatment, 4 weeks after treatment initiation, 12 weeks after treatment initiation (end of
      treatment), 24 weeks after treatment initiation to determine Sustained Virological Response
      (SVR), and at 48 weeks after treatment initiation.
