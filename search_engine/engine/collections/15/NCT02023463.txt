    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      1) To assess the safety of the combination of neoadjuvant and concurrent enzalutamide with an
      luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist and radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the efficacy of the combination of enzalutamide with an LHRH agonist and
           radiation therapy using prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics.

        2. To determine the efficacy of the combination of enzalutamide with an LHRH agonist and
           radiation therapy using PSA nadir.

        3. To describe patient-reported outcomes including: Expanded Prostate Cancer Index
           Composite (EPIC), American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index, PROstate magnetic
           resonance (MR) Imaging Study (PROMIS) Fatigue Scale.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months. Beginning 2 weeks
      after start of enzalutamide, patients receive LHRH agonist therapy with goserelin acetate
      subcutaneously (SC) or leuprolide acetate intramuscularly (IM) or SC for 6 months
      (intermediate risk patients) or 24 months (high risk patients) post-radiation therapy.
      Beginning 8 weeks after the start of LHRH agonist therapy, patients undergo either intensity
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) daily five days a week
      for 8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
