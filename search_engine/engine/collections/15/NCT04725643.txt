      contraceptive implants. More detailed information on this topic will help clinicians counsel
      patients and help women decide if they would like to pursue contraceptive implant
      replacement.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study of (N=50) among women replacing
      their contraceptive implant. The primary outcome of the study is the difference in number of
      bleeding days between the 4-week periods before and after implant replacement. Secondary
      outcomes include satisfaction with bleeding. Additionally, a secondary outcome will be the
      number of bleeding days in month 2 and month 3 after replacement of the contraceptive
      implant. The outcomes will be measured in bleeding diaries and satisfaction surveys.

      Through a text messaging application, the investigators will send the participants hyperlinks
      to the diaries/surveys at the stated time points. Participants will report if they had
      bleeding and the amount based on the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (Higham). Participants
      will complete weekly surveys regarding their satisfaction with their bleeding utilizing a
      Likert scale. The investigators will also ask participants to complete a survey regarding
      their satisfaction with their bleeding at end of month 2 and at the end of month 3 after
      replacement of their contraceptive implant.
