    
      This is a prospective, randomized control, double-blinded, phase II clinical trial. Study
      hypothesis is that aprepitant is more effective than desloratadine in relieving pruritus
      caused by EGFR TKIs. Primary endpoint is the effective rate of pruritus, effective treatment
      defined as visual analogue scale (VAS) decrease ≥ 50% after treatment (1 week) compared to
      baseline score. The VAS inquiry will be taken once a week for 4 weeks. Quality of life
      investigation will be performed at baseline, 1 week and 4 weeks after treatment using
      SKINDEX-16 questionnaire. 130 NSCLC patients undertaken EGFR-TKI and suffer from moderate or
      severe pruritus (VAS score ≥ 4) will be enrolled in this study, and stratified (gender,and
      VAS 4-6 or 7-10, and 2nd generation TKI or non 2nd generation) randomized (1:1) into
      aprepitant or desloratadine treatment. Aprepitant arm will be administrated aprepitant 125mg
      d1, 80mg d3 and d5, along with placebo 5mg d1-d28; desloratadine arm will be administrated
      placebo 125mg d1, 80mg d3 and d5, along with desloratadine 5mg d1-d28. Tolerance evaluation
      will be taken according to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria (CTC)
      For Adverse Events (AE) V4.03.
