      Diabetes Center. With concealed randomization the patients were (in blocks of two according
      to the level of GFR) assigned to receive either a usual-protein diet or a low-protein diet.

      After randomization an iso-caloric low-protein diet of 0.6 g/kg/day was prescribed to
      patients in the low-protein diet group. The usual-pro tein diet consisted of the patients'
      pre-study diet.

      The planned duration of follow-up was four years, scheduled visits every three-months. All
      patients gave complete history of medication, underwent examination of weight, urinary
      albumin-, sodium- and urea excretion, serum albumin, serum urea, hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c,
      blood pressure, serum total-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

      GFR, serum triglycerides,calcium and phosphorous, anthropometric measurements, nutritional
      status and smoking habits were evaluated every six months.

      Dietary protein intake was estimated on the basis of three consecutive 24-hour urine samples
      completed before each visit, using urinary excretion of urea nitrogen.

      GFR was measured by plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA over a 4 hour period and standardized for
      1.73m2 body surface area using the same surface for each patient during the study.
