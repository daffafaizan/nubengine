      2.0 intervention results in decreased depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery
      Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and decreased manic symptoms as measured by the Young
      Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The three components of the MoodSwings 2.0 intervention are:

        -  Moderated peer discussion board

        -  Psychoeducation learning modules

        -  Interactive psychosocial tools

      This study will also examine whether there is an association between graduated levels of
      involvement and resulting improvement. These graduated levels are:

        -  Moderated peer discussion board only (Level 1)

        -  Moderated peer discussion board and psychoeducation learning modules (Level 2)

        -  Moderated peer discussion board, psychoeducation learning modules and interactive
           psychosocial tools (Level 3).

      We expect that those participants assigned to the control condition (Level 1), will have
      fewer positive outcomes than those in Level 2 or Level 3 conditions.
