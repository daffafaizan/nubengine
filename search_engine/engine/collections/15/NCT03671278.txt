      using modifiable prognostic indicators that are relevant in clinical decision making. The
      objective of this study will be to test the feasibility of the implementation of the SBST in
      the stratification of patients seeking care in emergency departments. Study design: A
      prospective longitudinal cohort study with a 6-month follow-up. Intervention: At 6-weeks
      after baseline consultation, patients will be targeted to the specific treatment according to
      their subclassification in the SBST tool: education about pain neurophysiology and physical
      therapy. This is the first study that will provide results about logistic processes of the
      implementation of the SBST in the emergency sector, present feasibility data for the
      conduction of a large randomized controlled trial of subgroups of low back pain.
