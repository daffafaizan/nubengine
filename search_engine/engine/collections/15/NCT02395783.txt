      is no preventive treatment approved to date. These effects are the result of a multifactorial
      brain damage occurring in developing prenatal and perinatal period. Melatonin, the principal
      hormone secreted by the pineal gland has neuroprotective properties in various experimental
      animal models of perinatal brain damage level. This hormone readily crosses the placental
      barrier, its antenatal administration would have a neuroprotective effect in the case of
      preventive preterm birth before 28 weeks of gestation.

      The objective of this study determine the dose of melatonin administered parenterally in
      prenatal maternal in preterm labor to reduce brain damage in the white matter detected by
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with statistical spatial analysis (TBSS) to the theoretical
      term of 40 weeks in children born prematurely.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of melatonin administered intravenously in two dosage
           regimens and after randomization in pregnant women under 28 weeks

        -  Assess the contribution of antenatal injection of melatonin on the incidence of white
           matter injury detected by conventional brain MRI

        -  Assess the contribution of antenatal injection of melatonin on the rate of neurological
           sequelae at 2 years corrected age, mortality at 28 days of life and at the end of
           hospitalization.

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of melatonin injection
