      chronic disease is characterized by healed white, atrophic scars named atrophie blanche. The
      histopathological exam on the lesion site reveals fibrin deposition within the vessel walls.
      It has been reported to be related to factor V Leiden mutation (heterozygous) (22.2%),
      prothrombin G20210A gene mutation (8.3%), PAI promotor 4G/4G genotype and
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation in about total 30% livedo
      vasculitis patients. This study is trying to find the correlation between Taiwanese patients
      and these four genes.
