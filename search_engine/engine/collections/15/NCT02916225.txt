      having superior cardiovascular effect when compared to moderate continuous training (MCT) in
      post-infarction patients (Wisloff et al.) Aerobic training also had shown positive effect on
      oxygen consumption and diastolic function in subjects with HFPEF when compared to usual care
      (Edelmann et al).

      However, the comparison of HIIT and MCT on improving functional capacity and diastolic
      function in HFPEF patients has not yet been study.
