      sympathetic blockade and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Prevention of hypotension is
      usually achieved through administration of fluids and vasopressors . Fluids are either
      administrated before initiation of spinal anesthesia which is defined as fluid pre-loading or
      at time of initiation of spinal anesthesia which is defined as fluid co-loading .There is an
      ongoing debate concerning both the proper fluid timing, pre-load against co-load and fluid
      type crystalloids against colloids. Fluid preloading with colloids appears to have superior
      effect on that of crystalloids as the later shows a shorter intravascular half-life. While
      both colloid and crystalloid co-loading show comparable results .Although crystalloid
      preloading has been the traditional regimen for long time, it failed to reduce the incidence
      of hypotension. This is because crystalloids rapidly distribute out of the intravascular
      compartment to the interstitial space. Superiority of fluid co-loading might be explained by
      decrease of the extravascular crystalloid redistribution secondary to the simultaneous
      vasodilatation response to sympathetic block.This study aims at comparing the effectiveness
      of co-loading of crystalloids versus colloids versus hypertonic saline 3% in preventing
      hypotension induced by spinal anesthesia.
