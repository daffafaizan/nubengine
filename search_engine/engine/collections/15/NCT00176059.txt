      various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders due to their immunomodulatory and
      antiinflammatory properties. It has been demonstrated that IVIG is effective in the treatment
      of acute vascular rejection and steroid resistant cellular rejection. Furthermore, IVIG has
      been used to inhibit production of lymphocytotoxic antibodies in highly sensitized patients
      so that successful cadaveric or living renal transplantation could be performed.

      The aim of this randomized prospective study in renal transplant recipients is to investigate
      immunological short and long-term effects of an IVIG induction therapy on Th1, Th2 and
      B-cell/monocyte responses, expression of adhesion molecules, costimulatory factors and
      cytokine receptors and on secretion of immunoregulatory autoantibodies (anti-F(ab)-,
      anti-F(ab')2G-, anti-hinge autoantibodies). These autoantibodies have been shown to
      significantly affect the risk of chronic rejection and graft loss.

      Furthermore, clinical endpoints (patient and gaft survival, incidence of acute and chronic
      rejection, infectious diseases and graft function) up to 3 years will be analyzed.
