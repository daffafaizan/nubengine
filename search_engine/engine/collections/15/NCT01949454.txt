      Surgery in Trachomatous Entropion and Trichiasis, Dose-varying Study

      Study Design: Randomized, double-masked, dose-ranging study of three dose levels of
      fluorometholone 0.1% or placebo in one eye of subjects with trachomatous trichiasis (TT)
      undergoing lid rotation surgery

      Primary Study Objective: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of three (3) doses of
      fluorometholone 0.1% in subjects with trachomatous trichiasis (TT) undergoing lid rotation
      surgery (Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation)

      Secondary Study Objective: Conduct a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of three (3)
      doses of fluorometholone 0.1% in subjects with trachomatous trichiasis (TT) undergoing lid
      rotation surgery (Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation)

      Number of Subjects: Up to 156 eyes of up to 156 subjects

      Study Population: Subjects with trachomatous trichiasis (TT) undergoing lid rotation surgery
      (Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation)

      Test Articles:

        1. Fluorometholone 0.1% one drop twice daily for four weeks

        2. Placebo one drop twice daily for four weeks

        3. Fluorometholone 0.1% one drop four times daily for four weeks

        4. Placebo one drop four times daily for four weeks

        5. Fluorometholone 0.1% one drop four times daily for eight weeks

        6. Placebo one drop four times daily for eight weeks

      Visit Schedule: Following trichiasis surgery on Day 0, subjects will return for study visits
      approximately on Days 14, 28, 56, 90, and 365

      Tolerability Parameters:

        -  Treatment-emergent ocular symptoms/signs

        -  Discontinuation of drug / treatment because of side effects

      Safety Parameters:

        -  Intraocular pressure elevation â‰¥30 mm Hg

        -  Cataract

        -  Adverse events

        -  Treatment emergent abnormal ophthalmic findings

        -  Treatment emergent external examination findings

        -  Visual acuity

      Efficacy Parameters:

        -  Trichiasis recurrence

        -  Entropion recurrence

        -  Trachoma activity grade (to the extent activity can be graded in eyes with severe
           trachomatous scarring)
