    
      After a screening period of up to 28 days, subjects with IgG4-RD at high risk of flare due to
      multi-organ disease and recent active disease will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      intravenous (IV) inebilizumab or placebo after premedication during the 52-week randomized
      control period (RCP). All subjects will receive an initial tapering dose of glucocorticoids
      (GCs) to complete treatment of their active disease. Flares occurring during study will be
      treated. The primary endpoint is time to a first adjudication committee-determined,
      investigator-treated disease flare during the RCP.. The primary analysis will be conducted
      when the last subject completes the RCP visit or discontinues the RCP. This study includes an
      optional 52-week open-label treatment period. The expected duration of each subject's
      participation in this study is up to 400 days (screening and RCP) or, for eligible subjects
      who enroll in the optional OLP, up to 813 days (screening, RCP, interval between RCP and OLP,
      and OLP).
