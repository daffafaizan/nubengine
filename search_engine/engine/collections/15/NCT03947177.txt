      intervention. GMIT is an evidence-based group intervention that has been shown to prevent
      substance use among adolescents. In this project, GMIT will be delivered virtually in a group
      setting to multiple Latina/o adolescents. In addition, some parents will virtually
      participate in a parent-only support group; the other parents will not participate in any
      group.

      In this study, participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive one
      of two versions of an alcohol, drug, and tobacco program. As part of the program teen
      participants will virtually attend six 30-min intervention sessions with other teens. Parents
      may also participate in virtual group sessions. Participants will be asked on three separate
      occasions (before, immediately after, and 3 months after the sessions) to complete forms
      (phone/online) that ask questions about teens behavior at home, school, and in the community.
