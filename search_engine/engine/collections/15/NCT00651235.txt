      inheritance1. The cardinal features are noted in the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal
      system. The most life-threatening complication of MFS is progressive aortic root dilation
      leading to aortic dissection or rupture. Losartan, an angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1)
      antagonist, is a drug already in clinical use for hypertension and type II diabetic
      nephropathy. A recent study showed that Losartan prevents aortic root dilation and lung
      problem in a mouse model of MFS. Therefore, the goals of this clinical trial are to examine
      the efficacy and safety of Losartan in patients with Marfan syndrome for aortic root dilation
      prevention.
