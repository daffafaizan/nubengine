    
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with
      previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC designed to compare
      IPI-504 plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel. All patients will have at least a 15
      pack year smoking history. Tumor samples will be assessed by a central pathology reviewer to
      confirm pathology that is documented at baseline; this review need not occur in advance of
      randomization.
