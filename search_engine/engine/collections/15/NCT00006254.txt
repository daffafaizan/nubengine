        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose or minimum effective dose and associated toxic
           effects of VNP20009 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine whether VNP20009 can be detected in tumors after treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive VNP20009 IV over 4 hours on day 1. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or partial or
      complete response (CR) may receive additional courses every 35 days for up to 12 total doses
      or 2 courses past a CR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP20009 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6-9 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-45 patients will be accrued for this study.
