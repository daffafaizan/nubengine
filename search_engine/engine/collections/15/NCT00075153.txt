      observational, longitudinal study of children and youth (n=1,993) from birth to 25 with HIV
      infection (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 219/219C) to develop knowledge about
      the quality of life (QOL) and the factors that affect it in order to be able to implement
      effective nursing interventions and clinical programs to support and improve QOL in this
      vulnerable population of children.
