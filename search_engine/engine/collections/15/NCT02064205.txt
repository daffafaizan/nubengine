      incorporated into various food applications to replace sugar and fat (Auerbach et al., 2007).
      Polydextrose is poorly digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract and therefore shows
      fiber-like properties. The addition of polydextrose to foods may increase the satiating
      properties of foods.

      Previous studies have shown that:

        -  Consuming polydextrose-containing preloads (6.25 - 25.0 g polydextrose) resulted in a
           significant lower energy intake at lunch compared to the control (Astbury et al., 2013;
           Ranawana et al., 2013; Hull et al., 2012; King et al., 2005).

        -  Polydextrose is able to modify appetite ratings at low (6.25 - 12.5 g polydextrose)
           (Hull et al., 2012) and high doses (56.7 g/d) (Konings et al., 2013).

        -  Polydextrose (15.0 g) induced enhanced GLP-1 response after a high-fat meal in obese
           participants (Tiihonen et al., 2012).

      Therefore, it is hypothesized that with the consumption of 12.5 g polydextrose as compared
      with the placebo, appetite will be suppressed, resulting in:

        -  a lower consumption at lunch (energy intake at lunch)

        -  change in appetite scores (VAS)

        -  change in satiety hormones (CCK, PYY, GLP-1, ghrelin)

        -  change in glucose and insulin

        -  change in stomach emptying rate

        -  change in gastric wellbeing
