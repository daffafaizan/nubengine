      effect of a locally-developed quality improvement toolkit for patients with acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS) in Kerala, India. Hospitals will be randomized after stratification for size
      to one of five cohorts. After a four-month baseline period, the quality improvement toolkit
      will be implemented in all hospitals in cohort 1. Through a one-way crossover design, these
      hospitals will continue to use the quality improvement toolkit through the end of the trial
      for all acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Cohorts 2 through 5 will implement the
      quality improvement toolkit at time points 8, 12, 16, and 20 months respectively, continuing
      the use of the toolkits from that time forward to the end of the study. The primary outcome
      is 30-day MACE rates, including death, reinfarction stroke, or major bleeding. Rates will be
      continuously collected and compared at one interim time point for safety and efficacy. Final
      analysis compares MACE rates before and after implementation of the quality improvement
      toolkits, accounting for cluster effects of hospital, cohort and time.
