      surgery.

      This observational study aims to evaluate the baroreceptor function during using a
      standardized evaluation protocol before, 6- and 24 hours after elective primary unilateral
      hip-arthroplasty.

      The study hypothesis is that baroreceptor function as expressed by the valsalva ratio is
      attenuated after surgery and related to surgical inflammation.
