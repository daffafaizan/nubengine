      that may be related to the development of the tumor, as well as changes that may influence
      how the tumor responds or doesn't respond to treatment. Normal blood cells will be studied to
      compare to the tumor cells. Investigators will also look at basic information about the
      treatment received and how the tumor responds, i.e. what kind of chemotherapy, surgery,
      radiation treatment, or other therapy the participant received, whether they had serious side
      effects, and how well the tumor responded to the treatment.

      As part of regular medical care, tumor will be obtained to determine the type of cancer. For
      participants who consent to this study, leftover tumor tissue not needed for diagnosis or
      regular medical care will be studied at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital where
      scientists will look for changes in the genes of the tumor cells. No additional surgeries or
      procedures are needed for this study. A small amount of blood (2-3 tablespoons) will be
      collected and analyzed to determine if the genetic changes in the tumor cells are also found
      in the blood cells. Small children (<42 lbs.) will have a smaller amount drawn (1-2
      tablespoons).
