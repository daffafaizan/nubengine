      after anthracycline treatment, however, this has not been tested in the human heart. The
      researchers hypothesize that cardiac energetic status is reduced in the human heart after
      administration of anthracycline therapy in breast cancer patients, inline with the evidence
      available from all other types of cardiomyopathies. The researchers propose to use in vivo
      31Phosphorus cardiac spectroscopy to measure the cardiac energetic status at the beginning
      and at the end of the cycles of chemotherapy in the hearts of breast cancer patients who are
      administered epirubicin (the most modern anthracycline to date) and compare this with the
      cardiac energetic status of age and gender matched healthy controls. Further, the researchers
      wish to explore if the myopathy-induced effect of anthracyclines extends to the skeletal
      muscle as well, by examining skeletal muscle biopsies in these patients.
