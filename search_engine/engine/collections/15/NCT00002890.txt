      antibody M195 (90Y-MOAB HuM195) in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies.
      II. Determine the pharmacology and dosimetry of 90Y-MOAB HuM195. III. Study the biological
      effects of 90Y-MOAB HuM195, including the ability to elicit human anti-human antibody
      responses and antileukemic responses.

      OUTLINE: This study seeks to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of yttrium-90-labeled
      humanized monoclonal antibody M195 (90Y-MOAB HuM195). All patients receive a single
      intravenous dose of 90Y-MOAB HuM195. Groups of 3 to 6 patients are treated at escalated doses
      of yttrium-90 until the MTD is determined. Patients with active leukemia who exhibit at least
      a 50% clearing of marrow blasts after the first dose may receive a second dose after 4-8
      weeks provided remaining blasts are CD33-positive, there is no evidence of human anti-human
      antibody response, and any toxicity has resolved. All patients are followed monthly for 4
      months after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 24 patients will be treated. The study is expected to require 12-18
      months to complete.
