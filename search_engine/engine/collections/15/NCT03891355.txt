    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the combination of Carfilzomib (K), Lenalidomide (R) and Dexamethasone
      (D) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant to
      BTK inhibitor (BTKi) monotherapy or BTKi containing regimens.

      The primary endpoint will be assessed 12 months after the start of treatment of the last
      patient. However, responsive patients (CR, PR, SD) may continue to receive K up to a maximum
      of 24 cycles and RD up to a maximum of 24 cycles. Patients who will interrupt therapy (for
      any reason) will be followed up to 12 months after the end of the treatment.
