      dysplasia of bone, cafe-au-lait skin pigmentation and precocious puberty. Other endocrine
      abnormalities have been identified in this disease. Growth hormone (GH) excess is associated
      with MAS and occurs in approximately 10% of the patients. Current therapies of MAS involve
      separate treatment for the bone and endocrine diseases. We propose to test the effectiveness
      of a novel GH receptor antagonist, pegvisomant at reducing the growth hormone excess in these
      patients. Secondarily we shall also assess the impact of pegvisomant therapy on the fibrous
      dysplastic bone lesions associated with the disease.

      The subjects will be patients with MAS and non-suppressible growth hormone as determined by
      standard oral glucose tolerant testing (OGTT) and an elevated insulin-like growth factor-1
      (IGF-I). It will be a randomized, blinded crossover design. The primary and secondary
      measures of efficacy will be: the normalization of serum (IGF-I), a reduction in signs and
      symptoms of growth hormone excess, and a net change in Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding
      Protein 3 (IGFBP-3). The effect of pegvisomant on the fibrous dysplastic bone activity in
      these patients will be determined by a net change in the levels of bone turnover markers.
