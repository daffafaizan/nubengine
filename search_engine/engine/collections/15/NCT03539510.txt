      understand and share their personal values, life goals and preferences in order to prepare
      for future decisions regarding medical care. Public awareness campaigns to promote ACP have
      been taking place for about 10 years without significant improvements in ACP completion
      rates. Content intended for use by the general public may be too vague for those living with
      a chronic illness. Framing ACP within the context of a specific disease may provide the
      impetus for a person to engage in ACP. The investigators believe the HF-ACP website will
      improve patient understanding of the life-limiting nature of HF, the ACP process and the need
      to plan ahead to help ensure the care they receive matches their treatment preferences.
