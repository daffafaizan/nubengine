      distribution of muscle weightings in stroke patients during gait. Although literature has
      suggested that merging of synergies occurs after stroke and that a larger number of is
      associated with increased motor function if compared with healthy adults. IIt is still
      unknown if this hypothesis is also relevant when comparing different functional levels within
      a stroke population and what functional impact of altered synergies on walking behavior is.
