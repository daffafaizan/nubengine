    
      -  To evaluate the safety and toxicity of IT Poly-ICLC, HiltonolÂ® prior to surgical
           resection for patients with MPM.

        -  To determine objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 using CT imaging.

        -  To determine recurrence free survival of subjects treated with IT Poly-ICLC followed by
           surgical resection defined as the time of injection until the first date that recurrent
           disease is confirmed or date of documented death.

        -  To evaluate IT Poly-ICLC induced immune changes in the tumor microenvironment by
           comparing pre-injection biopsy to surgically resected tissue for immune cell
           infiltration and T cell receptor (TCR) diversity.

        -  To characterize additional immune parameters in IT Poly-ICLC injected tumors including
           in-depth phenotypic and functional characterization of immune infiltrating cells.

        -  To evaluate IT Poly-ICLC induced serological changes and changes of circulating immune
           cells, including regulatory T cells and NK cells, by comparing pre-injection to
           post-surgical resection blood samples.
