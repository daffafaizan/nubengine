      current clinical outcome of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in subjects with MPS II, a
      recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from mutations in the gene encoding IDS.
      SB-913 is a therapeutic for ZFN-mediated genome editing which will be delivered by
      adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vectors. SB-913 is intended to function by placement of
      the corrective copy of IDS transgene into the genome of the subject's own hepatocytes, under
      the control of the highly expressed endogenous albumin locus, and is expected to provide
      permanent, liver-specific expression of Iduronate 2-Sulfatase for the lifetime of an MPS II
      patient.
