      undergo cardiovascular surgery with median sternotomy wounds in our hospital will be
      assessed. Those who have or will have diabetes, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and known history
      of allergy to silicone will be excluded. Altogether, about 75 patients will be recruited.
      Each patient's wound will be divided into two halves. One test dressing will be applied to a
      half, which is determined by random, and a different test dressing to the other half. The
      total 75 patients will thus be divided into 3 groups of 25 patients. One group will act to
      compare the effectiveness between silicone gel and silicone sheet, the second group between
      silicone sheet and paper tape, and the third group between silicone gel and paper tape. The
      dressings will be applied one week after surgery and at least 12 hours per day until 3 months
      after surgery. All patients will be followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and
      12 months. Three domains of outcomes will be measured. One is the appearance of the scars
      which will be rated with Vancouver scale, which has been proved to be a reliable scale.34 35
      When rating with the Vancouver scale, standardised photographs of the scars will be taken in
      a standardised photo studio using a single high-resolution digital camera in a standardised
      light condition and at a fixed distance because any difference in photographic conditions
      will make difference in the Vancouver scores. The other two domains are pain and itching of
      the scars, which will be evaluated with Visual Analog Ratings (VAR). Pain and itching are
      very subjective, so the rating method should be very easy to understand and applicable for
      our patients and that is why we chose VAR as a tool.
