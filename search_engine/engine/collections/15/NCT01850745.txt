      achieve sustained virological response (SVR). The aim of our study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of a multidisciplinary support program (MSP) in adherence to and efficacy of
      pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin compared to the conventional approach. We assessed
      447 patients with CHC receiving antiviral treatment distributed into 3 groups: control group
      (follow-up 2002-2004, n= 147), MSP-pilot group (follow-up 2005-2006, n=131), and
      MSP-validation group (follow-up 2007-2009, n=169).A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed
      using a Markov model.
