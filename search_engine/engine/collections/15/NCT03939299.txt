      myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade flow of 0 and present for more than 3 months. CTO is
      commonly recognized as the toughest lesion subset to be treated by percutaneous coronary
      interventions. With the remarkable progress in the technologies and techniques achieved in
      the PCI for CTO over the last decade, the rate of procedural success increased to 80-90%.
      Chronic total occlusion is associated with a higher incidence of malapposition and uncovered
      stent struts. At present, four strategies were used for CTO lesions, including: ante-grade
      wire escalation, ante-grade dissection reentry (ADR), retro-grade wire escalation, and
      retrograde dissection reentry (RDR). True-false-true occurred during wire penetration.
      Subintimal stenting influences vascular response. Intravenous ultrasound (IVUS) confirmed
      wire position in the procedure. Then stenting procedure was performed according to standard
      routine. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used for exploring long-term vascular
      response and healing profile after successful coronary stenting in CTO lesions.
