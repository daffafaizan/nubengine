      glycemic control (measured by HbA1c) in patients with DM1 treated with multiple daily doses
      of insulin (MDI) and regular metabolic control (HbA1c <8 %). It even saves costs and
      consumption of health resources, and improves the quality of life and satisfaction of
      subjects with DM1

      To evaluate the effect of a 6-month Diabetic platform on telemedicine in patients with DM1
      and regular metabolic control (HbA1c <8%) on MDI treatment in the following parameters:

      A) Glycemic control: Mean glycemia, number of mild hypoglycemia / week, number of severe
      hypoglycemia / 6 months, number of hyperglycemia greater than 250mg / dl / week, number of
      episodes of ketosis / 6 months, number of episodes of ketoacidosis / 6meses , Number of
      hospital admissions due to glycemic decompensation / 6 months.

      B) Glycemic variability: Standard deviation, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE).

      C) Fear of hypoglycemia: scale FH-15. D) Quality of life: Diabetes Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (DQoL). E) Stress: DDS questionnaire.

      F) Costs and consumption of health resources:

      -Cost-effectiveness (HbA1C)
