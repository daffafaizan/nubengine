      intralymphatic immunotherapy with allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells treated with interferon
      alfa plus low-dose adjuvant systemic sargramostim (GM-CSF) and cyclophosphamide in patients
      with incurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. II. Assess the immunologic and biologic correlates
      of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Cultured allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells are incubated with interferon alfa for
      72-96 hours. Autologous cell lines, if established, may be used as an alternative. The cells
      are irradiated immediately prior to use. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day -3 and
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 0-8. On day 0, patients receive viable tumor
      cells via dorsal pedal lymphatic cannulation. Treatment repeats every 2-4 weeks for a minimum
      of 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed every 2-4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients will be accrued for this study.
