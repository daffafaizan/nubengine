      virus (HIV) type 1 infection has become a chronic disease. The proportion of patients
      expected to survive 5, 10, and 15 years after conversion in the HAART era are 99%, 93% and
      89% respectively. With increased life expectancy and decreased morbidity from opportunistic
      infections, the importance of chronic complications associated with HIV-1 infection,
      including HF is becoming more evident. The advent of HAART has altered the epidemiology of
      HIV associated cardiomyopathy evolving from a primarily left ventricular systolic dysfunction
      to the growing recognition of left ventricular DD. DD is associated with the development of
      atrial fibrillation and heart failure (HF), and portends higher risk for all-cause mortality.
      Thus there is a widespread prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in HIV infected individuals
      that are associated with HF development and may represent a sub-clinical abnormality that may
      be potentially intervened upon to reduce the risk of subsequent HF. There are little data to
      understand the natural history and pathogenesis of cardiac abnormalities, specifically DD in
      HIV+ individuals, which may adversely affect the longevity and quality of life of these
      individuals.
