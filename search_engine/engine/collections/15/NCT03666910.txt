      abnormal immunologic reaction against own cells, tissues or organs.Many of these rheumatic
      diseases preferentially occur in women during the childbearing age.

      The transplacental passage of maternal antibody may result in a variety of adverse fetal
      effects including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hemolysis and thyroid disease. Both fetal
      hypo and hyper thyroidism may occur and maternal hypothyroidism particularly during the 1st
      trimester is associated with impaired fetal neurological development and delayed mental and
      motor development.

      Hydroxychloroquine (CQ), the hydroxyl derivative of chloroquine, is an antimalarial agent
      which is widely used, either alone or in combination with other agents, in the treatment of
      SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and various other autoimmune diseases.

      Hydroxychloroquine is safe during pregnancy, as it is not associated with an increased rate
      of congenital malformations. However, isolated cases of ocular (retinal pigment deposits) and
      auditory abnormalities were reported.

      An increase in high-frequency hearing threshold is the earliest change in the auditory
      function for most drug induced hearing losses, including the irreversible damage caused by
      antimalarials.

      The investigators therefore will use audiological methods for detection of hearing impairment
      in children delivered for mothers receiving antimalarials during pregnancy with rheumatic
      diseases.
