      that it provides superior visualization. There have been no clinical trials to determine if
      this "added" exposure offers any measurable significant benefits to justify the added cost.
      This study will determine if the Mobius™ retractor does provide a measurable difference in
      outcomes, compared to the traditional retraction instruments.
