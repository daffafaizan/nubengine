    
      This is a prospective study of epilepsy biomarkers in a total of 100 subjects of ages 4-18.
      Participants will spend about 5 hours at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Athinoula
      A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. They will undergo training on a memory task
      concurrent with EEG/MEG recordings. During the EEG, subjects will wear headphones that will
      deliver a quiet pink noise stimulus intermittently during a nap. The auditory stimulus will
      be calibrated in volume to not cause arousals. After napping, subjects will undergo cognitive
      testing and memory task testing.
