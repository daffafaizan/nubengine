        -  Determine the activity of pemetrexed disodium as salvage therapy in patients with
           persistent or recurrent low-risk post-molar gestational trophoblastic tumor that failed
           prior dactinomycin or methotrexate.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression or until tumor marker
      levels (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) become normal. Patients receive 2 additional
      courses beyond the attainment of a normal hCG.

      Beginning 7 days before and continuing until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed
      disodium, patients also receive oral folic acid daily and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B_12)
      intramuscularly every 9 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months and then monthly for 10 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 17-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 20-50
      months.
