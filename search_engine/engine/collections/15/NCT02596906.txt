      complaints of changes in memory or thinking in the absence of dementia, when combined with
      transcranial current stimulation (tDCS). The reasoning training being studied is a strategy
      based program where individuals are taught strategies designed to engage the frontal lobes.
      Participants will randomly be placed into one of two groups (1) reasoning training following
      transcranial current stimulation (tDCS) as compared to (2) reasoning training following sham
      tDCS. The study will be done with adults between the ages of 50 and 80 with consistent memory
      complaints or lower baseline performance on memory measures. The primary hypothesis is that
      individuals receiving tDCS prior to brain training will have a stronger response to brain
      training than those in the sham tDCS group. Response to training will be measured by improved
      cognitive function and neural changes as measured by neuropsychological testing, MRI, and
      EEG. MRI will be used to evaluate the impact of reasoning training on brain blood flow,
      structure and function, and to measure changes in brain energy metabolism and
      electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate intervention outcomes. The reasoning training program
      will be conducted in small groups at the Center for BrainHealth.
