    
      This is a multi-center, on label, prospective, randomized, two-arm feasibility study that
      plans to enroll 30 female subjects in the United States. In an effort to reduce potential
      exposure to COVID-19, all study assessments are intended to be performed in a contactless
      manner (i.e., telephone, video conference, etc). If a subject passes the initial screening
      requirements via medical history and expresses interest in the study an informed consent form
      will be provided to them. Once consent has been obtained they will undergo a baseline visit
      where they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: PASSIVE FT-CC (text messages
      reminders will not be sent to subjects) and ACTIVE FT-CC (text messages reminders will be
      sent if subject does not use the device for 2 consecutive days). Randomization was
      incorporated into the study to determine if ACTIVE FT-CC affects device use. A total of 2
      follow-up visits will be conducted over a 60-day period.
