      stage prostate cancer is greater than 10 years in more than 70% of cases, suggesting the
      existence of slowly progressive or non-progressive forms of prostate cancer that would never
      cause any impairment to quality or quantity of life if undetected. These forms represent
      currently 23% to 67% of all prostate cancers. Therefore, while men's lifetime risk of
      prostate cancer is high (16-18%), the corresponding risk of death is only about 3%. These
      observations gave the opportunity to consider, near the current standard and curative
      treatment, an active surveillance. This therapeutically choice offers the ability to delay or
      avoid definitive treatment, thereby minimizing patient morbidity. Studies to date have shown
      that this seems to be achieved without compromising long term outcomes (progression-free
      survival) in appropriately selected patients. Up to one third of them receive further
      treatment after a median of about 2,5 years of surveillance. However, even if active
      surveillance is associated with the highest quality-adjusted life expectancy when compared
      with local treatment, active surveillance is often experienced as a lack of care, some
      patients undergoing surveillance experience disutility related to anxiety which can
      significantly affect their quality of life.

      The introduction of new potent androgen receptor inhibitors able to block several steps in
      the androgen receptors signaling pathway, raise the question again of the benefit of early
      hormonal therapy in localized prostate cancers. The aim of this study is to assess whether
      treatment with an oral androgen receptor inhibitor could influence the progression of
      localized prostate cancer and delay the time to local treatment initiation.
