      obstruction were inversely related with ventricular telediastolic volume, with the ejection
      volume and the ejection fraction in patients with severe pulmonary disease. The mechanisms
      that are involved in the development of cor pulmonale are the increase of pulmonary vascular
      resistances, lung hyperinflation and hypoxic vascular constriction. All the mentioned
      contribute to the generation of right cardiac failure and consequently, left cardiac failure.
      The authors assessed lung hyperinflation by CT scan, pulmonary function by spirometry, and
      cardiac kinetic and mechanics by magnetic resonance. They concluded that the amount of
      emphysema and bronchial obstruction were related with a worse telediastolic left ventricular
      volume and stroke volume, no relation was found with ejection fraction. It was evident that
      patients with severe pulmonary disease and with no present cardiac diseases, had sub-clinic
      modifications that one day may lead them to the development of cor pulmonale.

      The effect of bronchodilation, with its effect on lung hyperinflation, may have a role in
      producing some modifications in this context. That's why that the aim of our study is
      centered on the evaluation of the effect of bronchodilation firstly on diastolic right
      ventricular function and also on interventricular septum motility, on the ejection fraction
      and on the kinetics of right cardiac chambers assessed by cardiac echocardiography
