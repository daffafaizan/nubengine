      effective antitumor response, immunotherapy needs to be combined with chemotherapy. Thus, the
      traditional perception that chemotherapy and immunotherapy act through unrelated mechanisms
      which may be antagonistic is challenged on the premises that a selected panel of drugs can
      induce an immunogenic cell death producing specific danger signals. Furthermore, chemotherapy
      combined to immunotherapy may affect antigen cross-presentation, induce a "cytokine storm",
      reduce the number of regulatory T cells and activate homeostatic lymphoid proliferation. Our
      previous results obtained in a mouse model, demonstrated that drug-induced cytokines can
      favour antitumor immunity. Based on this observation, we explored whether the administration
      of dacarbazine (DTIC) in disease-free melanoma patients in combination with peptide
      vaccination could result into an improved anti tumor immune response.

      Patients included in the study were assigned to two treatment arms either receiving
      anti-tumor vaccination with Melan-A and gp100 analog peptides alone (arm 1) or in combination
      with DTIC pre-treatment (arm 2).

      Arm 1, vaccine alone: patients received i.d. injections of Melan-A: 26-35 (A27L) and gp100:
      209-217 (210M) peptides (250 µg each) formulated in Montanide ISA-51 plus s.c. injection of
      3MU IFN-α, as an adjuvant on day 1 and 8 every 21 days for a total of 5 courses (10
      vaccinations). Both peptides and IFN-α were injected in close but separate sites next to
      local lymph nodes.

      Arm 2, DTIC plus vaccine: the same vaccination schedule was combined with DTIC (800 mg/mq
      i.v.) administered one day before each vaccine administration according to the standard
      treatment.
