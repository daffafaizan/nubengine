        1. To determine accuracy of SpO2 measurements by the novel sensor compared to 2 reference
           pulse oximeters in healthy subjects undergoing a normobaric hypoxic challenge provoking
           SpO2 desaturation.

        2. To determine accuracy of SpO2 measurements by the novel sensor compared to 2 reference
           pulse oximeters and to arterial blood gas analysis in patients qualifying for LTOT,
           breathing room air at rest (lying, sitting, standing position) and during exercise (slow
           walking, 6-MWT, ergometer cycle).
