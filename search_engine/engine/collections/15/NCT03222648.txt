      progressive exercise intolerance and breathlessness. In 2012 there were 32 500 people living
      in the United Kingdom (UK) with IPF. Average life expectancy from time of diagnosis is 2-3
      years (Ley et al. 2011). Despite recent advances in drug therapy, therapeutic options are
      limited and no medication has been found to halt progression of the disease. Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation (PR) is a structured exercise and education intervention that is well
      established as a core treatment intervention for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD). Current limited evidence shows that PR is safe in patients with IPF and can
      lead to short-term improvements in exercise tolerance, symptoms and quality of life (Dowman
      et al. 2014). However the optimal exercise protocol, the longer-term benefits and which group
      or patients (those with milder or more severe disease) benefit most is unclear. Further it is
      unknown what mechanisms underlie any improvement and whether exercise training influences the
      fibrotic process causing IPF.
