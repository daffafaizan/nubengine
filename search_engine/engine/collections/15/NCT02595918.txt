      I. To study the safety and feasibility of preoperative nivolumab administration in subjects
      with resectable, high-risk, non-metastatic and metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergoing
      planned cytoreductive nephrectomy or metastasectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall response rate in patients receiving preoperative nivolumab.

      II. To assess recurrence free survival at 2 years in patients receiving preoperative
      nivolumab in patients with high-risk, non-metastatic disease.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between baseline tumor mutational burden and both immune
      infiltration and radiographic tumor response to nivolumab.

      II. To explore predicted and expressed tumor neoantigens and their correlation with
      radiographic tumor response to nivolumab.

      III. To explore the association between the predicted immune signature (via ribonucleic acid
      sequencing [RNAseq]) in the tumor microenvironment with radiographic tumor response to
      nivolumab.

      IV. To determine whether changes in the tumor microenvironment before, during, and after
      therapy are associated with response.

      V. To assess the potential association between PD-L1 expression (by immunohistochemistry
      [IHC]) and radiographic tumor response to nivolumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -56, -42, -28, and -14
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      nephrectomy or metastasectomy on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14-28 days, at 90 days, and
      then at 24-28 months.
