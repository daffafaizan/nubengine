      is due to their ability to increase insulin sensitivity at the cellular level, which in turn
      improves the ability of endogenous insulin to regulate glucose utilization by the tissues.
      Compounds of the sulfonylurea (SU) class act to stimulate insulin production by the pancreas,
      overcoming insulin resistance by increasing circulating insulin levels. The mechanisms of two
      kind OADs may be viewed as complementary, offering the opportunity for improved efficacy and
      durability of effect through coadministration of a TZD and a sulfonylurea.

      Successful management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires aggressive glycemic control
      starting at the earliest stages of the disease. Rosiglitazone/glimepiride combination
      therapy, with complementary mechanisms of action, has the potential to provide significant
      benefits over monotherapy as first line therapy. Treatment with rosiglitazone/glimepiride at
      this early stage of diabetes is expected to provide better glycemic control and allow a
      greater proportion of patients to achieve target glycemic goals than oral monotherapy.

      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel, study to compare the effects of
      treatment with rosiglitazone/glimepiride combination or glimepiride in drug na√Øve T2 DM
      patients.
