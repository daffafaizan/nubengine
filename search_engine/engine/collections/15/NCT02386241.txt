      advances in genomic technology, much analysis is hindered by the lack of control samples that
      could better delineate genomic alterations leading to disease. The ideal genomic control
      would be the genetic material of the parents of afflicted individuals. The researchers
      propose to then compare the genomic material from parents of siblings, both of whom have a
      diagnosis of a high-grade glioma. Additionally, the researchers will then compare the genomic
      alterations between the parents and the patients. This analysis will provide an unprecedented
      insight into genomic level changes that take place between parents and patients that resulted
      in the formation of a high-grade glioma.
