        -  Determine the frequency and severity of decreases in CD4 counts as a function of therapy
           in patients with newly diagnosed malignant astrocytoma.

        -  Determine whether the decrease in CD4 counts is a significant predictor of infections or
           adverse outcomes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo monthly collection of blood for serial CD4 counts and heme-8 with
      differential for 1 year for quantitative analysis. Patients also complete a monthly
      questionnaire about infections and antibiotic use.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients (100 with high-grade disease and 25 with low-grade
      disease) will be accrued for this study.
