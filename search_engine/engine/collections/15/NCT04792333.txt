    
      It is planned to enroll a total of 28 subjects to receive a single oral dose of
      investigational medicinal product (IMP): 14 ESRD patients will be enrolled in three Hungarian
      centres (1st arm) and 14 Healthy volunteers will be enrolled by Eurofins Optimed in Gi√®res,
      France (2nd arm).

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 21 days prior to
      the first administration. For both arm, subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research
      Unit (CRU) on Day -3. On the morning of Day 1, subjects will receive a single 500 mg oral
      dose of firibastat following an overnight fast (i.e., at least 10 hours). Subjects will be
      confined to the CRU until discharge on Day 3 with PK blood sample draws for measurement of
      firibastat and its main metabolites being taken throughout the confinement.

      A follow-up post study visit will occur on Day 10 post-dose to ensure the ongoing wellbeing
      of the subjects.
