      system applied to patients undergoing repair of uncomplicated mandibular fracture(s). A total
      of 50 subjects involved in trauma events resulting in uncomplicated mandibular fracture(s)
      will be enrolled at up to 5 sites from 3 surgical subspecialties: maxillofacial surgery, ENT,
      and plastic surgery. Subjects considered for participation will receive OmniMax MMF system
      for maxillo-mandibular fixation for a period of 4 to 8 weeks. Incidence of root damage
      associated with screw insertion, time for implantation and removal of the device, oral
      hygiene during the maxillomandibular fixation period, mucosal overgrowth, gingival necrosis,
      post-operative pain, stability of the occlusion, fracture healing, patient overall
      satisfaction/compliance with length of treatment, incidence of glove perforation and
      accidental puncture, will be evaluated in all participants who remain in IMF
      post-operatively. Adverse Events associated with the use of OmniMax MMF system will also be
      collected.
