      patients aged 40-65 who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign pathology. The
      patients were divided into two groups according to a randomization scheme created by a
      computer: Group CD (cold-dry) patients were administered dry CO2 via insufflator at room
      temperature (21°C), while Group HH (heated-humidified) patients were administered 95%
      humidified CO2 insufflation at 37°C. The study was planned as a randomized and double-blind
      study, where patients were not informed of their group.During the operation and in the
      postoperative period, the patients were followed up by two different anesthetists. All
      patients were given information and training on the anesthesia method, the use of the
      patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) device and the visual analog scale (VAS) the day before
      the operation. The patients' demographic data (age, weight, height, etc.) and their basal
      systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures and heart rates were measured prior to the
      operation and recorded on the case report form.
