    
      This is a two-year, prospective, single-arm study examining the effects of deutetrabenazine
      on functional speech and gait impairment. Participants will undergo comprehensive evaluations
      of speech production, fine motor skills, gait, and balance both before and after the
      initiation of deutetrabenazine. The investigators will utilize a variety of standardized,
      well-validated assessments as well as 3D motion analysis of both speech and gait parameters
      to determine the functional impact of deutetrabenazine on speech and motor performance.
