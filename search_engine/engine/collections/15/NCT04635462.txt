      which causes a reduction of social interaction and physical activity. Therefore, this health
      crisis may have collateral effects on cognitive, physical, and psychological health,
      especially in elderly people who are more likely to be isolated, and for whom social
      distancing is of paramount importance. Physical exercise practice has been demonstrated to
      improve cognitive functioning, along with mobility and physical capacity, and to promote
      psychological well-being. This is the reason why governmental health authorities, as well as
      the scientific community recommend to stay physically active, especially in this pandemic
      period. However, in the current context full-time physical training in sport centres cannot
      be largely promoted. Effective solutions to help older adults in maintaining regular and
      efficient physical exercise while maintaining social distancing, are thus needed.
      Consequently, the current project proposes first to investigate the potential of a remote
      monitoring of physical activity to promote cognitive, physical and psychological health of
      older adults. Also, considering the added benefits of combining cognitive training to
      physical exercise to further enhance health and cognition in seniors, this project also
      addresses the added benefits of a multidomain intervention combining a physical exercise
      intervention with a home-based cognitive training.
