      for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Also several studies reported that
      ramosetron is effective treatment of irritable bowel syndrome because it inhibits the
      accelerated colonic transit, abnormal colonic water transport, defecation abnormality, and
      the lowered colonic perceptual threshold by corticotrophin-releasing hormone. There is no
      study about the effect of ramosetron used for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting on
      postoperative bowel motility. In this study, the investigators examine the effect of
      ramosetron on postoperative bowel motility.
