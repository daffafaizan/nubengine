      screening performance of PSA and DRE in men who are scheduled for prostate biopsy. Currently
      a higher PSA level leads to a recommendation for prostate biopsy, causing hundreds of
      thousands of unnecessary biopsies annually in the U.S. We will show that a three-month
      treatment with finasteride for men with high PSA levels will better predict the man who
      should have a prostate biopsy. PSA performance after finasteride 'challenge' will also be
      compared with new tests for prostate cancer. Finasteride is supplied by Merck and Company,
      Incorporated.
