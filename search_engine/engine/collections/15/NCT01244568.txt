    
      Potentially eligible men (age 45 and older who have localized prostate cancer with a Gleason
      score of 6 or less) will be identified and recruited to participate in the study before their
      next office visit. Patients who are interested and provide informed consent will be asked to
      complete a brief survey about background, medical history, knowledge of prostate cancer and
      health-related quality of life. Once the survey is completed the patient will be randomly
      assigned to one of 2 groups. Those assigned to the "Usual Care" group will not receive any
      additional information materials as part of their participation in the study. Those assigned
      to the "Patient Decision Support" group will receive a DVD program that contains information
      about treatment choices for prostate cancer.

      Participants will be asked to answer a brief telephone survey at 3 and 6 months from the day
      of their last office visit. Survey questions will ask about knowledge about prostate cancer,
      health-related quality of life, whether or not the DVD was viewed and what treatment decision
      was made.

      Research staff will also review medical records 6 months after enrollment to determine which
      treatment was received for prostate cancer, how many visits with health care providers were
      completed since enrollment and which medical services and procedures were received.
