      Prestige Healthcare Technologies Ltd. has developed a prosthesis that is easily and
      inexpensively fabricated. The prosthesis is similar to a fitting frame used by some
      prosthetists in trial fits to ensure proper length and angulation of the terminal device. The
      prosthesis consists of two pieces of aluminum bar stock running midline the length of the
      residual limb. One bar is located anteriorly, the other posteriorly. A terminal device will
      be placed in the receiver on the distal end of the prosthesis. An aluminum band will connect
      the anterior and posterior bar stock for structural stability. A finished figure of eight
      harness will be utilized for control and suspension of the prosthesis. The research performed
      will be noninvasive. The check out will be based on the New York University (NYU)
      trans-radial prosthesis checkout form. Prestige Healthcare Technologies has donated an adult
      size trans-radial prosthesis to be utilized for this study.

      Each patient will serve as their own control group. The control group will be considered
      using the same guidelines for testing function of the patient's current prosthesis, which we
      will refer to as alpha P. The patient will then be fitted with the inexpensive model, which
      we will refer to as beta P. The results will be compared to the NYU standard as well as
      comparing between the results of alpha P and beta P. Beta P will be the same prosthesis
      personalized for subjects with the harness adjusted to properly fit each individual.

      The benefit of this study may provide an inexpensive versatile alternative to the current
      below elbow prosthesis. This version may be utilized as a spare prosthesis while the patient
      is unable to use his primary prosthesis.
