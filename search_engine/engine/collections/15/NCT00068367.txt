        -  Determine response (confirmed, complete, and partial) in patients with unresectable or
           metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor when treated with erlotinib.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, indicators of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) function
           (e.g., expression, phosphorylation, or markers of signal transduction downstream of
           EGFR) with response and progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the feasibility of accruing these patients in the cooperative group setting.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve at least a confirmed partial response and become resectable undergo
      surgical resection (with or without radiotherapy) and then receive 2 additional courses of
      erlotinib. Patients with responding disease who do not become resectable continue erlotinib
      as above. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of
      erlotinib beyond the CR.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
