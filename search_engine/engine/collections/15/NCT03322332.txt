      adipokines [adiponectin, omenin-1, resistin and retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4)] secreted by
      the epicardial adipose tissue correlate with the degree of coronary atherosclerosis.
      Specifically, this study aims to investigate whether the expression and production of these
      adipokines is different between two sites of the heart, that are perfused by coronary
      arteries with different degrees of stenosis.
