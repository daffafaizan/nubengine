      osteogenic potential capacities which are essential to optimal fracture healing when bone
      grafts are implanted. It offers viable MAPC-class cells on a scaffold comprised of
      demineralize bone matrix (DBM) and cortical cancellous chips. map3® Cellular Allogeneic Bone
      Graft is considered an allograft, and as such, is indicated for bone repair for orthopaedic
      indications where autograft is employed. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the
      outcomes in bone grafts of the foot or ankle using a stem cell modified allograft (map3®
      Cellular Allogeneic Bone Graft). The study endpoints will be objectively determined via
      x-rays and CT scan to assess bony fusion, extremity evaluation using the AFAS and subjective
      patient scores for foot disabilities and quality of life.
