      more of moderate intensity physical activity on most days of the week. However, compliance
      with these guidelines requires considerable commitment in terms of time spent exercising per
      week (> 150 minutes) and this may deter individuals from starting an exercise programme.
      Accordingly, randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of smaller
      volumes of exercise on health.

      37 civil servants (24 women) aged 41.5 + 9.3 years, were randomly assigned to either two 45
      minute walks per week (walking group) or no training (control group). Aerobic fitness, body
      composition, blood pressure (BP), CRP and lipoprotein variables were measured at baseline and
      following 8 weeks. Steps counts were measured at baseline and during weeks 4 and 8 of the
      intervention
