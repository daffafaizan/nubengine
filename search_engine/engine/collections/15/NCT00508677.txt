      pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate (MPH). Effects of MPH on ADHD symptoms in
      children is extremely well-informed. Mazindol is a psychostimulant and a wake-promoter agent
      which may have similar actions to MPH in the central nervous system. However, there is no
      record of the effects, safety, tolerability of Mazindol in children with ADHD. Mazindol (dose
      0.5 or 1.0 mg/day) should prove to be useful in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in children.
      Based on clinical assessments and serum concentrations after oral administration of mazindol
      to children (6-12 years) with ADHD, this prospective pilot trial will evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of
      mazindol.
