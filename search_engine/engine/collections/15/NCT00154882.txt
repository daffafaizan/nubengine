      recently demonstrated that combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin, at conventional doses, is
      highly effective in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the acute and cumulative
      toxicities of paclitaxel have been troublesome to a significant portion of the patients.
      Several lines of evidence suggested that weekly paclitaxel, at a much lower dose range of 40
      to 50 mg/m2 per week, may be as effective as that of the conventional doses of paclitaxel (80
      to 90 mg/m2 per week) for patients with metastatic ovarian and lung cancers. The low-dose
      regimen of paclitaxel may significantly improve the compliance of the patients. This
      open-label phase II trial is designed to test this hypothesis.
