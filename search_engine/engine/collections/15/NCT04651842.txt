      myocardial perfusion in patients undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty and its
      reduction identifies patients at high risk. In this study we investigate the association of
      acute insulin resistance with myocardial blush grade and outcome in non-diabetic patients
      with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
