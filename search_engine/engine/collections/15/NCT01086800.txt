    
      This is a Phase II randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of supplemental
      nocturnal oxygen or Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, compared to optimal medical
      preventive therapy for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk, on biomarkers of CVD risk in
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients at high risk for CVD events. The study will focus on
      patients with moderate to severe OSA but only mild OSA symptoms.

      Eligible participants have a history or symptoms of heart disease AND have symptoms of sleep
      apnea or snoring. Participants will be contributing to medical knowledge about different
      options that can be used to improve heart disease in people with sleep apnea.
