      gradual, controlled separation.

      There are three treatment approaches by ilizarov ring external fixator according to number of
      bone osteotomies. First one is the monofocal approach with closure of defect without any
      osteotomies. Second one is the bifocal approach with a single osteotomy to create one
      transported bone segment between the osteotomy and the defect. Third one is the trifocal
      approach with two osteotomies creating two separate transported bone segments.

      Hypothetically, trifocal approach has shorter treatment time than bifocal one as it is a
      double level bone transport so closes the defect faster. However, there are other
      considerations as complications that may occur and the need of further surgical procedures
      and this is what will be discussed in this research.
