      50 enrolled subjects using competitive enrolment at two sites in the United States of America
      (USA). The study was conducted on subjects at risk of developing PIs according to
      investigators' judgment and facility protocol being treated in ICUs. The target subjects were
      male and female, 18 years and above, with an expected hospital stay of 4-6 days. An evaluable
      subject was defined as a subject that was enrolled and had data for at least one visit after
      the baseline visit. There were two parts to the study: Part A: Mepilex Border/Protect Sacrum;
      Part B: Mepilex Border/Protect Heel (on both left and right heels), used within intended use
      and according to IFU.
