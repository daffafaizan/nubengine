           bladder full for the second planned insertion of the brachytherapy applicator and empty
           for the third insertion. For phase 2, the effect of cylinder angle on normal tissue
           dosimetry will be investigated. Of the two bladder states assessed in phase 1 (empty or
           full), the one deemed to give the lower dose to the total amount of bladder tissue will
           be considered the standard and applied to all patients in phase 2.

        -  In phase 1, to standardize bladder filling, patients will be asked to empty their
           bladder, then to drink 32 oz of water one and a half hours before the CT scan. The
           patient will undergo a treatment-planning scan after the brachytherapy cylinder is
           inserted and before brachytherapy treatment.

        -  In phase 2, patients will be asked to fill or empty their bladder according to the
           results of phase 1. The vaginal cylinder will be placed horizontally for the second
           treatment. The cylinder will then be angled at a specific angle for the subsequent
           treatment.

        -  A history and physical exam will be performed within 2 weeks of study entry, then at 14
           days, 90 days, and 180 days following the completion of therapy.
