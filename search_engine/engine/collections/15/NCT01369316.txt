      effective technique for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Utilising the new method the
      investigators make small cuts around the polyp to isolate it. Subsequently the Gelofusine
      solution is injected beneath the polyp and provides greater elevation. This allows us to
      improve the chance of removal of the entire polyp with one attempt in one piece. It is
      preferable to remove the polyp in one piece as it minimises the chance of leaving residual
      polyp tissue behind. Our team has recently completed an animal study comparing our newly
      developed technique to conventional EMR. The investigators have found significant
      improvements in our ability to completely remove the polyp in one attempt. There have also
      been recent studies overseas that have shown this new technique to be quite effective.
