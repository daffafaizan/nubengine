      One of the challenges of recovery is muscle stiffness or excessive muscle tone that often
      limits exercise or therapy progress. Taking this into account, the investigators propose
      treating the wrist and forearm with a combination of a one-time Botox速 injection and a 6-week
      robotic therapy protocol to maximize recovery.

      Botox速 is a drug that is injected directly into a muscle to temporarily relax the muscle.
      Botox速 is commonly used to decrease muscle tone in tight muscles in the stroke population.
      Robotics therapy provides highly repetitive mass practice with visual and haptic feedback.

      Subjects will be randomized to two groups. Group A will receive the Botox速 injection and
      group B will receive a placebo saline injection. Both groups will receive the same robotics
      therapy protocol. Subjects and investigators will be blinded to group assignment. The
      investigators would like to know if there are trends between groups in a variety of outcome
      measures depending on what intervention they received. The investigators predict that the
      treatment group will have better results than the control group on the Fugl Meyer, our
      primary outcome measure. The investigators hope the results of this pilot study will guide
      development of a larger clinical trial.
