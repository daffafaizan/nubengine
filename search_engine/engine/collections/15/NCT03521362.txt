      adolescent users' glycemic control and adherence to blood glucose monitoring. The
      investigators' goal is to help families receive more social support, and to improve diabetes
      knowledge, self-efficacy, family communication, and quality of life. The investigators
      further seek to decrease family conflict among children with T1D and their parents. In a
      12-month RCT, investigators will randomize 166 adolescents and their parents to one of two
      groups: (1) attention control, or (2) the MyT1DHero app. Adolescents enrolled in the study
      will be 10-15 years old, and will have been living with T1D for <1 year or >5 years at the
      start of the study. The primary outcome will be a change in the participants' HbA1C from
      baseline levels at the start of the study, to levels measured after 12 months.
