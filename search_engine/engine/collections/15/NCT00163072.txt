    
      Study Population: Patients of any age who are already receiving oral Megace as an appetite
      stimulant. Patients must have an indwelling IV catheter in order to draw drug levels.

      Major Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria: Known hypersensitivity to the transdermal vehicle.
      Taking any other medicine that would interfere with the Megace assay. Weight less than 10 kg.

      Allocation to Groups: Patients will serve as their own controls.

      Summary of Procedures: Patients will be on a stable dose of oral Megace. To determine the
      steady state peak level and half-life for each patient, blood (2cc) will be drawn for a level
      in clinic 3 hours after an oral dose, then daily for 1-3 days. Patients may then resume their
      oral Megace, but must stop the medicine at least 5 half-lives prior to the transdermal dose.
      The transdermal dose will be applied as a gel under a transparent patch in clinic, and blood
      will be collected prior to, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and 4 hours after the dose. The
      patch will be removed after the 4 hour blood level. The patient will return the following day
      for a 24 hour level, and the patient will be examined briefly for any local effects of the
      drug or vehicle, and then may resume the oral dose.

      Major Risks & Discomforts: Patients will need to be in clinic for 3-5 separate days, one of
      which will last at least 4 hours, for drug levels to be drawn. There may be mild skin
      reaction to the transdermal vehicle or the Megace.
