      various naturalistic settings in adults. Group singing in particular seems to be associated
      with positive biopsychological outcomes. There is also an emerging view that MRA may play an
      important role for youth with mental disorders. However, longitudinal research on
      biopsychological responses to MRA in different clinical and healthy populations among
      children and adolescents is lacking.

      Method: Children and adolescents (age range 10-18) under psychiatric treatment at the
      Department of Child and Adolescents Psychiatry in Salzburg (n=45), healthy children and
      adolescents from a school in Salzburg (n=45), and members from the Vienna Boys Choir (n=45)
      in Austria will be recruited to take part in the study. Subjective measures (mood, stress
      experience) will be taken pre- and post singing sessions once a week throughout six months.
      Additionally, salivary biomarkers (cortisol, alpha amylase and IgA), social contacts, and
      quality of life are assessed. Emotional competence, social competence, self-esteem, and
      chronic stress levels are measured at the beginning, after three months, at the end, and in a
      follow-up of the study.

      Conclusion: Singing is suggested to benefit mental and physical health in children and
      adolescents. However, despite the current knowledge, the researchers must better understand
      the biopsychological mechanisms underlying choral singing in order to determine its full
      potential, particularly for vulnerable populations. This is the first study to investigate
      this issue in this population.
