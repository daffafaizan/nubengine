      months after transplantation in patients receiving a regimen of 'reduced' or 'standard' dose
      tacrolimus plus sirolimus and corticosteroids. Blood serum creatinine, the incidence of
      biopsy-confirmed acute graft rejection, and patient and graft survival were also evaluated at
      6 months post transplantation.
