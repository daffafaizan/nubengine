    
      To assess benefit and safety of lenalidomide in patients with refractory or relapsing primary
      cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma leg type (PCBCL-LT) after a first line treatment by Rituximab
      and polychemotherapy. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (complete response and
      partial response) at 6 months. Response will be assessed according to clinical and isotopic
      criteria.

      Optional biological study:

      A biological collection (skin and blood samples) will be established. Predictive biological
      markers of response or of aggressiveness and resistance to the treatment will be investigated
      on the skin biopsies by phenotypic and genetic analyses. The recent discovery of BLIMP1
      inactivation or deletion at 6q21 in activated B-cell like type of diffuse large B-cell
      systemic lymphoma points to the need of both a global genetic analysis by Array-CGH with
      Single Nucleotide Polymorphism study and a specific investigations of the status of genes
      such as CDKN2A, BCL2, BCL6 and BLIMP1 by FISH analysis and/or gene dosage. Xenograft will be
      performed from skin biopsies in order to develop animal models for PCLBCL-LT.

      Lenalidomide stimulates NK cells immunity and enhances anti-tumor responses. It also seems to
      modify the phenotype of NK cells through a decrease of the expression of Killer cell
      Immunoglobulin-like Receptors and NKp46. The expression of the NK receptors on blood cells
      will be analyzed in order to evidence modifications of the phenotypical and functional
      changes under treatment, and to search for a correlation with the clinical response to the
      treatment.
