      I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who
      have progressed on or following two prior chemotherapy regimens and are then treated with
      dasatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rates in patients treated with dasatinib. II. Determine
      the overall survival of patients treated with dasatinib. III. Determine the toxicity in
      patients treated with dasatinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the incidence of somatic mutations in c-src, c-yes, fyn, lck, hck, lyn, yrk and
      csk in archival primary and metastatic colorectal cancer tissues from these patients and to
      correlate this with clinical outcome.

      II. Determine the incidence of total c-src and phosphorylated c-src expression in archival
      primary and metastatic colorectal cancer specimens from these patients, and to correlate this
      with clinical outcome.

      III. Evaluate the effect of dasatinib on serum VEGF levels.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood is collected on days 1 (prior to the first dose of dasatinib) and 15 of course 1 for
      measurement of VEGF pre-and post-dasatinib administration. Archived tumor tissue (tumor or
      core biopsy; primary or metastatic lesion) is collected for identification of the incidence
      of somatic mutations and polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis and
      for measurement of total c-src and phosphorylated src expression by immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 8 weeks.
