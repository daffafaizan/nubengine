      cohorts. Additional cohort(s) may be added if dose escalation stopping criteria are not met
      after cohort 5. Participants will receive a single IV dose of either RO7126209 or placebo.
      RO7126209 doses will be administered in ascending order. After the starting dose, subsequent
      doses will be selected in an adaptive manner during study conduct based on emerging safety,
      tolerability and PK data.
