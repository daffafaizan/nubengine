    
      The principal goal of the research is to assess the prognostic factors of the progression
      toward severe forms of the COVID-19 infection.

      The secondary aims of the study are to contribute to answer some of the WHO research priority
      goals on COVID-19 infections:

        -  description of the natural history of the disease, its different forms, its clinical
           characterisation, its progression profile, the natural history of the disease linked to
           patient profiles

        -  evaluation and to comparison of different diagnostic methods, linked to the medical case

        -  description of the progression of the immune response during the infection and related
           to its outcome

        -  description of the replication and the excretion of the virus

        -  description of the progression of the biological markers during the infection and
           related to its outcome

        -  identification of the prognostic factors of the evolutive profile, especially if
           negative

        -  description of the patients care

        -  evaluation of the impact of the different therapeutic managements on the clinical
           outcome, the immune response, the viral load and the biomarkers.

        -  modeling of the epidemiologic impact

        -  identification of targets for treatment development

        -  analysis of cost data linked to the progression The population will include all patients
           infected with SARS-CoV2 ou suspected of being, who are taken care of at hospital.

      The research is based on the collection of clinical and biological data from routine cares
      and on the biological analysis of blood samples.

      The principal goal of the COVI-BIOME ancillary study is to identify gastrointestinal
      predictive factors for a severe form of the COVID-10 infection.

      The principal goal of the COVIDOG ancillary study is to evaluate the sensibility and the
      specificity of canine olfactory detection for the volatile organic compounds of SARS-CoV2.
