      complications. In 2005, in a subgroup analysis we showed that, among patients with HELLP 1,
      there were a shorter average time to platelet recovery and less duration of hospitalization
      in women who received dexamethasone therapy, however the importance of this finding is
      diminished because this was an unplanned analysis and the severity of the disease was not
      taken into account at randomization.
