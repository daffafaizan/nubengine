      residents physicians after a theoretical and practical training. They will be evaluated by 8
      experts. The primary endpoint will be the mean number of transcranial dopplers required to
      have an excellent concordance between resident and expert. The concordance between the
      Doppler findings of the resident and the expert would exceed 0.8 before 30 examinations. The
      learning curve assessed on the duration necessary to acquire good quality data should
      decrease rapidly with the repetition of the examinations. Validating the transcranial Doppler
      learning curve for junior emergency physician would allow them to perform this exam safely
      and efficiently. Transcranial Doppler may be easy and fast to learn but the persistence of
      its competency over time should be evaluated.
