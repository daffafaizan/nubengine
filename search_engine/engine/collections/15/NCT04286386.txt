      I. To assess reproducibility of quantitative spectroscopic and imaging parameters in
      hyperpolarized 13-C pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), including kpl,
      which assesses the rate of conversion of 13-C pyruvate to 13-C lactate in the tissue of
      interest, using a test-retest study design.

      II. To test the reproducibility of the normalized area under the lactate curve (nLac), a
      semi-quantitative biomarker for tumor metabolism.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide initial assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of hyperpolarized
      13-C-pyruvate MRSI performed pre-therapy for detecting high risk localized prostate cancer.

      II. To assess the correlation between kpl and tumor grade.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM Ia: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) and undergo
      MRSI at least 5 weeks after prostate cancer biopsy.

      ARM Ib: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRSI at least 5
      weeks after prostate cancer biopsy and at a second time 3-4 weeks after.

      ARM II: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRSI at least 5
      weeks after prostate cancer biopsy, followed by standard of care surgery within 6 months
      after.

      After the completion of study, patients in Arm Ia and Arm Ib are followed up once.
