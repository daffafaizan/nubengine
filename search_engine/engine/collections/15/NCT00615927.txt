    
      This is an open-label, single stage, uncontrolled, non-randomized Phase II study of
      continuous, daily doses of imatinib mesylate & hydroxyurea in adult patients with
      progressive/recurrent Grade II low-grade glioma (LGG). The treatment cycle is defined as
      imatinib mesylate & hydroxyurea administered daily for 28 days for purpose of scheduling
      evaluations. All patients who receive 1 or more doses of either imatinib mesylate or
      hydroxyurea will be evaluable for toxicity, whereas all patients who receive a minimum of 14
      consecutive days of study regimen will be evaluable for response. Patients who discontinue
      therapy prior to receiving 14 consecutive days of study regimen will be regarded as
      ineligible for evaluation of response and will be replaced.
