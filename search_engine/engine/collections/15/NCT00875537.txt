      others a recent clinically controlled study that has shown up-regulation of TRPV1-positive
      nerve fibres in tongue mucosa in patients with BMS. The vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1) is a
      voltage-dependent cation channel expressed by the unmyelinated C-nociceptive nerve fibres and
      the receptor may be activated by capsaicin (from chili peppers), heat and H+. Capsaicin binds
      to the TRPV1 receptor causing depolarization of the C-nociceptors. Prolonged activation of
      these neurons by capsaicin depletes pre-synaptic substance P and makes them unable to report
      pain.
