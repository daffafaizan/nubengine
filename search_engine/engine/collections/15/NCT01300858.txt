      design. The study will enroll up to 30 patients who had gone through cytoreductive surgery
      and HIPEC treatment 6-8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients will be treated with EGEN-001 24
      mg/m2 intra-peritoneally (IP) once every week for 12 weeks and then once every two weeks
      until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, but for no more than one year. Patients
      who develop progressive metastases will receive standard chemotherapy concomitant with
      EGEN-001. Hence, the initial EGEN-001 treatment period will be without chemotherapy. The
      standard chemotherapy regimen will be FOLFOX or FOLFIRI administered every 2-3 weeks. Patient
      with progressive disease a second time will be taken off-study. Those who remain
      progression-free will receive EGEN-001 for up to one year.
