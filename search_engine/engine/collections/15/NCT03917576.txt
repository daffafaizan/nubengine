      characterized as healthy normoglycaemic and others with disturbed glucose homeostasis
      subjects, all referred by a physician to the exercise programme of our research centre. The
      present study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was
      approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Universidad de La Frontera. All volunteers
      read and signed an informed consent. The inclusion criteria will be; a) aged 18-60 y; b)
      previously screened by physician professional; c) diagnosed with normoglycaemic, prediabetes
      or T2D state; d) and living in Temuco city. The exclusion criteria will be; a) low maximal
      cardiorespiratory fitness (defined as VO2max ≤21 ml/kg-1/min-1) below the expected value for
      the subject's sex and age 11; b) not receiving pharmacologic hypotensive treatment with
      β-blockers; and c) having no musculoskeletal limitations to perform exercise cycling. The
      total sample size will be divided in three groups according to the standard glycaemic
      classification 12; normoglycaemic (NG, n = 32), pre-diabetes (Pre-T2D, n = 30) and type 2
      diabetes (T2D, n = 13). The study considered three stages of measurements (enrollment,
      exercise test, single HIIT session).
