      prostate cancer (PrCa), earlier disease onset and increased disease aggressiveness.1,2
      Ascertaining family cancer history and hereditary risk in men diagnosed with PrCa can help
      inform medical management decisions. Recently published National Comprehensive Cancer Network
      (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Prostate Cancer (v3.2018)3 and
      Genetic/Familial High Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian (v2.2019)4 as well as the American
      Urological Association Guideline for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer (2017)5 recommend
      appropriate counseling and genetic testing for men who are at increased hereditary cancer
      risk, based upon personal or family history. Genetic testing for patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer is now standard of care per NCCN Genetic/Familial High Risk Assessment:
      Breast and Ovarian (v2.2019) guidelines4. NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines (v3.2018)3
      recommend obtaining a cancer-focused family history at diagnosis and consideration of
      germline genetic testing in multiple risk groups. Community urology practices can support
      guideline-aligned care by performing routine hereditary cancer risk assessment (HCRA),
      patient counseling and, when appropriate, genetic testing. This prospective registry will
      evaluate the feasibility and impact of implementing standard cancer family history review and
      guideline-aligned genetic testing for men diagnosed with PrCa in community urology practices
      nationwide.
