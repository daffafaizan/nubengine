      desaturation in operating rooms and other high-risk areas, improving outcomes in those
      settings. However, research suggests that overuse of continuous SpO2 monitoring in stable
      children with bronchiolitis who are unlikely to benefit from it is low-value care that places
      some children at risk of adverse outcomes. Despite national guidelines discouraging
      continuous pulse oximetry use in stable bronchiolitis patients, 46% of those infants and
      children are continuously monitored. This pragmatic, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm
      feasibility pilot will be performed on non-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospital units that care
      for bronchiolitis patients. The primary subjects are hospital staff who order or manage
      continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for bronchiolitis patients; secondary subjects are
      patients age 2 through 23 months with a primary diagnosis of bronchiolitis.
