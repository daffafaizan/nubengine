      brand AFOs) in OA subjects by measuring their mobility and pain during and after a multi-week
      trial period. The investigators will use a biplane fluoroscopy system to measure foot joint
      motion for each condition (RB shoe, AFO, control shoe). This will yield clinical and
      biomechanical measures of the effect of each orthotic on mobility, pain, and joint ROM in an
      ankle OA population. The investigators will also compare the clinical and biomechanics
      outcomes of OA subjects to those of control subjects. This information will provide evidence
      to support clinical decision making.

      Aim 1: Compare the daily sep count, self-selected walking speed, clinical outcome measures
      (PROMIS surveys) of a control shoe, RB shoe, and AFO worn over a multi-week trial period.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of a control shoe, RB shoe, and AFO on the foot and ankle joints
      range of motion.

      Aim 3: Compare the ankle OA clinical and biomechanical outcome measures for the control shoe,
      RB shoe, and AFO to a healthy control group wearing control shoes.

      The efficacy of conservative treatments such as RB shoes and AFOs for managing OA pain and
      discomfort is not well supported by clinical evidence. By using biplane fluoroscopy along
      with validated clinical measures of pain and mobility, this study will elucidate the
      mechanism by which RB shoes and AFOs biomechanically alter foot and ankle function.
      Identifying beneficial treatment strategies for people with ankle OA will help them regain
      their mobility and improve their quality of life.
