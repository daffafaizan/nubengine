    
      Background: it is known that the size and support of the breasts are a specific problem in
      post-operative women of cardiac surgery by means of medium sternotomy. There is little
      evidence of the therapeutic action of the bra as a measure to prevent dehiscence of the
      surgical wound.

      Aim: To assess the efficacy of bra application as a prevention of dehiscence in women with
      median sternotomy.

      Methods: Randomised clinical trial; post-test control group in women undergoing cardiac
      surgery by mean sternotomy. Groups: application of post-surgical or non-surgical breast bra.
      Endpoint: incidence of dehiscence. Other variables: sociodemographic, signs of infection,
      pain, related to assessment of the wound on admission. Assessment of the surgical wound
      daily, at discharge, at month, 3 months and 6 months post discharge.
