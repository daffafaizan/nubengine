      1200-1500 kcal/day, < 30% energy from fat dietary prescription, and a physical activity goal
      of 200 minutes/week. Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions differing in
      timing of energy consumed during eating bouts. Both conditions will limit the number of
      eating bouts/day to three. Participants will be instructed to eat their first eating bout
      within one hour of awakening and to consume their second and third eating bouts within five
      or six hours of their previous bout. Participants will be discouraged from eating at least
      one hour prior to going to sleep. During the intervention, participants will be instructed to
      self-monitor the time they wake up, the time of the start of each eating bout, and time they
      go to bed, as well as foods and beverages, and portion sizes, consumed. One condition will
      consume more energy earlier in the day (MORNING), thus energy intake will be split amongst
      the three eating bouts with 50% in the first bout, 30% in the second bout, and 20% in the
      last bout. The second condition will consume more energy later in the day (EVENING), thus
      energy intake will be split amongst the three eating bouts with 20% in the first bout, 30% in
      the second bout, and 50% in the last bout.
