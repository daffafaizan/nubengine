      surgery at a dose that allows the removed tumor tissue to be identified when imaged by the
      LUM imaging device.

      The first 6 subjects will receive an intravenous injection of LUM015 intraoperatively with a
      dose of either 1.0 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg. The first three subjects will receive a dose of 1.0
      mg/kg and if there are no adverse events the next three subject will receive the increased
      dose of 1.5 mg/kg. LUM015 will be given through a vein in the arm.

      When the final dose of LUM015 has been determined, 12 additional subjects will be given that
      final dose.

      The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the standard of care
      used by the surgeon. Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will
      continue their enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will
      continue to be followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is
      required. Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM
      Imaging System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
