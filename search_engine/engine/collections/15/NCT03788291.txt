      presence of certain cytogenetic abnormalities and high-risk mutational features predicts for
      a reduced response to treatment, and as a result, a shorter period of progression-free
      survival. The development of a well-tolerated more effective, easily administered and limited
      duration therapy would be a major contribution to the management of CLL and other B cell
      malignancies.

      Acalabrutinib is an imidazopyrazine analogue and a potent inhibitor of BTK in vitro and in
      vivo. Acalabrutinib shows improved selectivity for BTK compared with ibrutinib. Functional
      inhibition of non-target cells (eg, T cells, NK cells, platelets) was not observed for
      acalabrutinib at clinically relevant concentrations. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal
      antibody targeting CD20 FDA approved for the treatment of CLL/SLL using intravenous or
      subcutaneous formulations.

      Antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis may be optimized using high frequency subcutaneous
      administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Unlike ibrutinib, acalabrutinib does not
      cause significant in vitro inhibition of rituximab induced antibody dependent cellular
      phagocytosis in vitro. The investigator thus proposes that acalabrutinib would be an ideal
      partner drug with high frequency low dose SQ rituximab in the treatment of CLL and that the
      combination will increase the efficacy of therapy for CLL patients by decreasing the time to
      achievement of complete response and allowing for shorter and less toxic therapy.
