    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which trauma victims are randomized to
      receive a single intranasal administration of either Oxytocin (40IU) or placebo within the
      first six hours following trauma exposure. To provide a pre-treatment baseline, participants
      will receive a medical and psychological evaluation prior to treatment. After two weeks the
      research assistant or study psychiatrist will perform behavioral ratings and complete history
      details pertaining to PTSD risk factors. Participants will be assessed again by the study
      psychiatrist or research assistants at 1, 3, 6 and 13 months. Eligible subjects will include
      men and women over the age of 18, who have been exposed to an event meeting the DSM-IV "A.1"
      criterion for trauma exposure, and who provide written, informed consent to participate in
      the study. In order to recruit persons who are more likely to be at risk for the development
      of PTSD, we will only randomize persons expressing marked anxiety, emotional distress or
      dissociation, as assessed by the Visual Analog Scales. Potential participants will be
      recruited from trauma victims arriving at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center Emergency Room.
