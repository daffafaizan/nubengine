      change in cardiac fitness, that is a person's ability to use oxygen; and, if the program can
      help a person's memory, as measured by some standard tests. The researchers will also ask the
      participant to attend two sessions with researchers at the Bascom-Palmer Eye Institute so
      they can take pictures of the participants' eyes to see how training changes the number of
      blood vessels. This can be used by doctors and other clinicians to evaluate improvements
      blood flow to the brain due to training.
