      the timing of the memory processes in relation to the stressor. If stress occurs directly
      before or during the retrieval of information, the performance is impaired. Decreased
      performances using an acute stressor were also observed for other domains of cognitive
      functioning like working memory, interference control, cognitive flexibility and attention
      tasks.

      Glycine, the simplest of the amino acids, is an essential component of important biological
      molecules, a key substance in many metabolic reactions, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter
      in the spinal cord and brain stem, and an anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and immune
      modulating substance. Studies have found positive effects of Glycine on episodic memory
      retrieval and in a word retrieval task.

      To assess the effect of Glycine (MSG) on cognitive performance after an acute stressor,
      subjects perform baseline cognitive testing before intake of investigational products
      (Glycine (MSG), placebo or nothing) and participation in a stress test (Trier Social Stress
      Test - TSST). After the TSST stress-induced changes in cognitive performance are assessed. A
      second treatment intake takes place between the first and the remaining cognitive tests.
