      efforts to to extend the research on physical activity to the community setting; community
      volunteers will deliver the intervention, thereby making physical activity interventions much
      more accessible to survivors. In partnership with the National American Cancer Society office
      (Atlanta, GA) and Reach To Recovery (RTR) programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, and
      Georgia, researchers at the University of South Carolina's College of Nursing will share
      skills, experience and resources to examine the effects of RTR coaches offering a
      theoretically-based 3-month exercise program among 150 breast cancer survivors to increase
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) followed by self-monitoring (i.e. exercise
      logs) and feedback reports in Months 4-9 (Reach Plus), monthly phone calls from RTR coaches,
      self monitoring and feedback reports in Months 4-9 (Reach Plus Message) or weekly email/text
      messages, self-monitoring and feedback reports in Months 4-9 (Reach Plus Message). In this
      three group study, researchers will assess survivors' exercise, fatigue, mood, quality of
      life, and self-reported physical functioning at baseline, 3, 9 and 12 months. The costs of
      the methods vary and data on costs will be collected to guide the selection of maintenance
      strategies for dissemination. If the results are promising, researchers will proceed with a
      dissemination trial wherein the large network of RTR volunteers can expand the scope of their
      services to benefit breast cancer survivors.
