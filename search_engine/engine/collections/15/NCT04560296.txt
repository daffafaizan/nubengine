    
      Background:

      With increased aging population, there is a higher rate of having chronic diseases and
      cognitive impairment. In order to achieve successful aging, it is important for
      community-dwelling older adults to perform better self-management with improved health
      literacy and various kinds of support.

      Objectives:

      The study aims to develop a Nurse-Led E-Health program (NeLP), evaluate the effectiveness of
      NeLP, and refine the program based on the outcome measurement.

      Method:

      The research team will develop the Nurse-led e-Health program, and assess the effects of the
      program. A needs assessment will be carried out using focus group discussion with the older
      adults. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be adopted. A follow-up process evaluation
      will be conducted to assess the acceptability, strengths and limitations of Nurse-led
      e-Health program based on the participants' perspectives

      Discussion and conclusion:

      The proposed research contributes to engage and empower older adults living in the community
      to manage their chronic condition, and foster collaboration with the goal of translating
      evidence into action. This research will offer important insights into the need for educating
      and engaging older adults in managing chronic conditions to promote health and well-being,
      and therefore contribute to health and well-being of the elderly population.
