      repair for the fetus/neonate/child and is the standard of care for maternal/fetal dyads who
      meet the inclusion exclusion criteria. Investigators plan to maintain all inclusion exclusion
      criteria for open fetal repair surgery of myelomeningocele with one exception, the expansion
      of the maternal BMI to 40.0. This population of mothers with a BMI of 35.0 to 40.0 have not
      been studied. The morbidities of these mothers will be compared to morbidities of mothers
      with a BMI less than or equal to 34.9 currently in the scientific literature.
