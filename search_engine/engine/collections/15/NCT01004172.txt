      Central Nervous System (CNS) response. The null and alternative therapy response rates are 5%
      versus 20%. If 1 or more participants assessable in the stage one cohort (n=12 assessable
      participants) achieve CNS response then accrual proceeds to stage two (n=25 additional
      assessable participants). If at least 4 participants in the final set of 37 assessable
      participants achieve CNS response then this regimen would be deemed worthy of further study.
      The probability of stopping early is 0.54 if the true CNS response rate is 5% and 0.07 if the
      true CNS response rate is 20%. The probability of deeming the treatment worthy of further
      study is 0.10 and 0.90 if the true CNS response rate is 5% and 20%, respectively.
