      Primary

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with unresectable
           locally advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of the duodenum/pancreas treated
           with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan hydrochloride as first-line
           chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine tumor and biologic response at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response of the primary tumor in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
