      correlations with outcome as well as to discover new molecular biomarkers through correlating
      molecular data with clinical outcome. Study of tissue samples and cells from biopsies of your
      lesion and blood sample. We hope to learn the role genes and proteins may play in the
      development of anal cancer. Experiments will be performed using this tissue and blood,
      include analysis of DNA, analysis of RNA expression levels, analysis of protein levels of
      important gene products, and development of tissue culture cell lines.
