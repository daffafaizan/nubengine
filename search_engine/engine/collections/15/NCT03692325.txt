      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether it
      works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug/s is being
      studied.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug works) of nivolumab
      in treating OPVL and or prolonging the onset of possible malignancy.

      Nivolumab is a type of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the body's own
      immune system to attack cancer cells. Nivolumab has been demonstrated to activate the immune
      system to attack cancer cells in participants with different types of cancers. OPVL has a
      high risk for turning into cancer and the investigators are testing if nivolumab may help to
      shrink the white lesions in the participant's mouth and reduce cancer risk.

      In November 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nivolumab for the treatment
      of participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (SCCHN). Squamous cell carcinoma is the kind of cancer that OPVL can transform into.
