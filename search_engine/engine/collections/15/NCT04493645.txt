      with the greatest rates in people who are physically active or service members. Approximately
      40% of lateral ankle sprain patients develop chronic ankle instability (CAI) characterized by
      recurrent lateral ankle sprains, repetitive sensations of ankle "giving way", residual ankle
      sprain symptoms, and self-reported disability. Factors related to the development and
      progression of CAI has been thoroughly studied. However, few interventions have been
      developed which have successfully created long term reductions in re-injury rates, physical
      function, or health-related quality of life. Recent work by our research team has uncovered
      several novel motor and sensory deficits in the foot in patients with CAI. Deficits in foot
      function may contribute to the high re-injury rates, deficits in balance and strength, and
      diminished health-related quality of life commonly experienced by individuals with CAI. The
      investigators expect the additive effect of FIRE with components of the standard of care
      (balance training, strength training, and range of motion) will create the synergy needed to
      reduce future injuries (Aim 1), enhance physical function (Aim 2), and reduce self-reported
      disability in CAI patients (Aim 3).
