      movement-2-music (eM2M) intervention with 108 adults with physical/mobility disabilities who
      are randomized into one of two groups: a) eM2M or b) waitlist control. The primary aim is to
      determine the effects of a 12-week eM2M intervention on physical and psychosocial health
      outcomes in participants with physical/mobility disabilities who are classified into three
      functional mobility groups: 1) Group I - only able to exercise while sitting, 2) Group II -
      able to exercise sitting and standing with/without support, and 3) Group III - able to
      exercise one side of the body more than the other side. The secondary aim is to compare
      effect sizes of the physical health outcomes including cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle
      strength and lower extremity function obtained in the current study to a previous M2M trial
      that grouped participants based on disability type. The tertiary aim of this study is to
      explore whether adherence (defined in terms of attendance to the 12-week intervention)
      moderates effects of eM2M in participants with physical/mobility disabilities. The
      heterogeneity of treatment effect across the physical health outcomes will also be examined
      using functional mobility and disability groups as moderators.

      Participants will complete a set of assessments at baseline and after the 12-week
      intervention period remotely through videoconferencing technology. They will also be asked to
      complete the questionnaire portion of the assessments every 6 months and the entire set of
      assessments every year for up to 5 years. The assessments include cardiorespiratory fitness
      measured using a heart rate recovery test, grip strength measured using hand-held
      dynamometer, lower extremity function measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery
      and the Timed Up and Go test as well as questionnaires that assess health-related quality of
      life (NIH PROMIS 10 Global Health Items, NIH PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles
      and Activities), physical activity (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire), exercise
      self-efficacy (Exercise Self-efficacy Scale), exercise goal-setting (Exercise Goal-setting
      Scale), outcome expectation for exercise (Multidimensional Outcomes Expectations for Exercise
      Scale), social support (Social Provision Scale) and barriers in physical activity (Barriers
      in Physical Activity Questionnaire). In addition, at the end of the 12-week intervention,
      participants will be interviewed about their study experience and perceived impact of eM2M on
      their fitness and health.
