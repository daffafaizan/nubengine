      complex relationships among fluoride intakes, fluoride exposures, dental fluorosis, and
      dental caries. Detailed questionnaires were sent every 1.5-6 months concerning water sources,
      fluoride exposures, dietary intakes, etc. Standardized dental exams were conducted at ~ages
      5, 9, 13, 17, and 23. At about age 5, participants were invited to join the offshoot Iowa
      Bone Development Study. Bone densitometry assessments were conducted at ages 5, 8, 11, 13,
      15, 17, 19, and 23. These included Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) of hip, lumbar
      spine, and whole body from age 5; peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) of the
      radius and tibia from age 11; and Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) of the tibia from
      age 19. Physical activity and other factors also were assessed longitudinally.
