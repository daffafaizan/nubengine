      effects of tDCS on pain among Veterans receiving unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and
      unilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA). Further, this study will examine dose-dependency of
      the tDCS analgesic effects. 120 patients undergoing TKA will be randomly assigned to one of
      four groups: . Group 1 will have 4 sessions of real tDCS, Group 2 - 2 sessions of real tDCS
      (+ 2 sham-sessions), and Group 3 - 1 session of real tDCS (+ 3 sham-sessions). Group 4 is
      "Sham" tDCS, which does not involve any real stimulation. The participants will receive 2
      tDCS treatments on the day of their surgery, and 2 tDCS treatments the day after their
      surgery.
