      steadily in recent years. This has resulted in the increasing incidence of contrast-induced
      nephropathy (CIN). Major risk factors for CIN include older age, diabetes mellitus (DM),
      chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to investigate the effect of
      pretreatment with intravenous Alprostadil on the incidence of CIN in a high-risk population
      of patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and CKD undergoing coronary
      angiography, and evaluate the influence of such potential benefit on short-term outcome.
