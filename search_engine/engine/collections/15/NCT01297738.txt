      after the dietary intervention, the investigators will perform a SPECT-scan for serotonin and
      dopamine transporters with the radioligand [123I]FP-CIT, administered intravenously. The
      investigators will also perform a structural MRI for localization. Furthermore the
      investigators will perform a liver MRS and abdominal MRI for liver fat- and abdominal
      visceral fat measurement. The investigators will also perform a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic
      clamp to measure insulin sensitivity and muscle- and fat biopsies to examine changes in
      insulin signaling pathways and fat metabolism. After the hypercaloric diet subjects will
      follow a hypocaloric diet until their weight is back to baseline.
