      "registered" onto an electronic roadmap located on the dashboard. As the automobile moves,
      its position is updated on this roadmap. The driver can use the GPS as a guide to determine
      where the vehicle has been and where it is headed. This same concept is applied during
      image-guided surgery, as the current surgical position of instruments in the operating room
      is registered onto medical images of the patient acquired preoperatively. These images are
      used as a guide by the surgeon for more accurate localization of tumors and other surrounding
      anatomic structures. This clinical trial is designed to determine the effectiveness of using
      image-guided techniques for the treatment of liver tumors.
