    
      A subject who is identified for study participation will participate in the screening and
      enrollment visit which determines the migraine treatment arm to which the subject will be
      randomized first. The subject will have a physical exam, vital signs recorded, health and
      medication questions asked, questionnaires completed and a headache diary explained and
      dispensed to the subject. If the subject is randomized to the Treximet treatment arm during
      the first part of the study, Treximet will be dispensed for use in treating workday
      migraines.

      The subject will call the study coordinator after treating a workday migraine and will report
      information about the migraine to the coordinator. When the subject has treated and reported
      on 3 migraines, the interim visit will be scheduled. The subject will bring the study diary
      and Treximet containers (if this was the arm the subject completed)to this visit. The subject
      will be asked about adverse events and medication changes as well as confirmation and review
      of the completed questionnaires and diaries from the prior weeks of study participation. The
      subject will be given new diaries and questionnaires (and Treximet to use if usual prescribed
      triptan was the treatment in the first arm) and repeat the activities to treat 3 more workday
      migraines.

      When the subject has notified the study coordinator about treating the 3rd workday migraine
      in this part of the study, the subject will be scheduled for the final study visit. The
      subject will bring the completed migraine diaries, completed questionnaires (and Treximet
      bottles if used during this arm) to the study visit. The subject will have the diaries and
      questionnaires reviewed, be asked about adverse events and medication changes and complete
      the final study questionnaires at this visit.
