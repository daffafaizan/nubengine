      inhibitor, on glucose-lowering effect with 100mg of sitagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose HbA1c level is â‰¥ 7.5% with sulfonylurea and metformin.

      We are also going to investigate changes of other metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors
      such as triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, uric acid, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers.

      Changes of body composition including fat and muscle mass with volume status will be also
      examined.
