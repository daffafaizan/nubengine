      most common indications for cesarean delivery. Attempting an external cephalic version (ECV)
      significantly increases the chance of cephalic presentation at time of delivery and reduces
      the chance of cesarean section. Since ECV does in fact reduce the rate of cesarean section,
      many studies have sought to determine the best method to perform the procedure to optimize
      the chance of success. A recent meta-analysis concluded that administration of neuraxial
      analgesia significantly increases the success rate of ECV and also increases the incidence of
      vaginal delivery. However, there have been only 2 prospective studies and no randomized
      trials that evaluated the success of ECV using neuraxial analgesia only when initial attempt
      without it has failed. Therefore, the study team designed a randomized controlled trial with
      two groups: Group 1- patients receiving spinal anesthesia immediately versus Group 2-
      patients attempting ECV without spinal anesthesia with reattempt using a spinal if first
      attempt fails. This study will be conducted on labor and delivery at Mount Sinai West
      hospital. Patients who present to labor and delivery at term for ECV will be approached for
      enrollment and those who consent to be part of the study would be randomized into a group.
      ECV will then be attempted and delivery and neonatal outcomes will be collected. Patients
      will likely be enrolled in the study from time of version (approximately 37 weeks) until
      postpartum. This study will take approximately 1-2 years given the ECV rate.
