      from a dysfunctional regulatory pathway involving prefrontal cortical governance over limbic
      activity. Repeated daily non-invasive stimulation of the prefrontal cortex with TMS would
      theoretically strengthen and reset this cortical control pathway and reduce suicidal ideation
      and restore healthy circuit behavior.

      The aim of the current study is to assess the efficacy of TMS therapy in the treatment of
      suicidal ideation in patients with depressive episode(s) and either PTSD or mild TBI or both.
      It is hypothesized that participants who receive repetitive TMS (Group 1) relative to sham
      treatment (Group 2) three times daily over three days will evidence more improvement in
      suicidal ideation from baseline to the end of day 3. Participants will be followed for six
      months following treatment to assess safety and long-term efficacy of TMS.
