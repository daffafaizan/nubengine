    
      This trial includes a phase I dose-escalation study and a double-blind randomized phase II
      trial for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Phase I will be a
      cohort of 3 dose-escalation trial of dasatinib in combination with radiation and concomitant
      temozolomide. Patients receive concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cycle one.
      Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy 28-42 days post cycle one treatment. Patients receive
      only dasatinib post cycle 8 treatment until progressive disease, unacceptable adverse events
      or refusal.

      Phase II will be a randomized trial with two treatment arms. Patients will be randomized at
      the time of registration at a ratio of 1:2 respectively to either standard therapy arm
      (continuous daily placebo prior, during and after standard radiotherapy/temozolomide followed
      by temozolomide. For more information please see the Arms section. The primary objectives are
      listed below.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To establish a maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib combined with radiation and
           temozolomide in this patient population (Phase I)

        2. To determine the efficacy of dasatinib in combination with radiotherapy and concomitant
           and adjuvant temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and compare it
           with the standard of care approach in the treatment of these patients consisting of
           radiotherapy and temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide (Phase II)

      Patients are followed for 5 years post treatment. The study permanently closed to accrual on
      January 31, 2014.
