      refractory HTLV 1 associated Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma. Efficacy will be assessed by
      measuring the response rate, tumor control rate, duration of response, time to progression
      and progression free survival.

      The Secondary Objective is to evaluate the safety of lenalidomide monotherapy as treatment
      for subjects with relapsed or refractory HTLV 1 associated Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma.
