      antigen (PSA) has only a limited role in the diagnosis and characterization of prostate
      cancer. The diagnosis of prostate cancer is still most commonly done by transrectal
      ultrasonography (TRUS) guided biopsy. However, TRUS guided biopsy carries a risk of increase
      in complications. There is an increasing interest in developing more accurate non-invasive
      imaging modalities which could potentially detect prostate cancer aggressiveness.

      Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and rotating frame relaxation measurements have shown to be
      particularly promising in prostate cancer detection and characterization. This study which
      focuses on further development and validation of DWI and rotating frame relaxation
      measurements will enroll 200 men with histologically diagnosed prostate cancer who will
      undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before prostatectomy. Anatomical MRI and novel
      acquisition methods focusing on DWI and rotating frame relaxation measurements will be
      performed using surface coils to non-invasively detect and characterize prostate cancer.
