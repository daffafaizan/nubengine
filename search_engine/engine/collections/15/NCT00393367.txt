      hospitalizations. Although standard therapy for acute asthma includes systemic
      corticosteroids (SCS), these drugs take many hours to have an effect. Recent studies
      demonstrate that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may improve patients' asthma severity more
      rapidly than SCS and may decrease hospitalizations. Only a few small studies have evaluated
      ICS added to standard therapy for acute asthma in children.

      Objective: To determine if adding the nebulized steroid budesonide to standard therapy
      including SCS improves patients' asthma severity faster than standard therapy alone and leads
      to fewer hospitalizations.

      Study Design/Setting/Participants: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of budesonide
      inhalation suspension (BIS) versus placebo for children 2 to 18 years of age who present to a
      tertiary care, urban pediatric ED with a moderate to severe asthma flare.

      Intervention: Participants will receive standard therapy including SCS, albuterol, and
      ipratropium bromide and will be randomly assigned to also receive either nebulized BIS or
      saline.

      Study Measures: Differences in asthma scores, vital signs, and the need for hospitalization
      will be compared between treatment groups.
