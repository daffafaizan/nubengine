    
      This is a multicenter, dose-escalating, Phase 1b trial in patients with relapsed or
      relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will be dosed on Days 1 and 8 of each 21
      day cycle.

      This study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, the MTD determining portion of the
      study, patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients at each dose level. At least 3
      patients will complete 21 days at each dose level and will be evaluated for safety and
      tolerability before additional patients are treated at higher doses. Doses will be increased
      following a modified Fibonacci scheme.

      In Part 2, twelve additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD determined in Part 1 (or
      the dose for the highest dose cohort completed if the MTD has not been reached) to further
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of this dose regimen.

      Serum fluphenazine pharmacokinetic studies will be performed during the first cycle of the
      therapy in all Part 1 and Part 2 consenting patients.
