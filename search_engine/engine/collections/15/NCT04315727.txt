      molecularly undiagnosed diseases will diagnostically be analyzed by means of omics
      technologies or re-analyzed using existing datasets. The following questions will be leading
      the study:

      Primary:

      • Identification of the molecular causes of unclear rare diseases

      Secondary:

        -  Improve number of diagnoses for patients with rare diseases

        -  Further characterization of the identified putative disease causes

        -  Increase number of patients receiving appropriate therapy after successful diagnosis.

      In addition, healthy parents of the subjects may be included in the study to perform
      parent-child (trio) analyses.

      In addition, phenotype and omics data will be shared within the University Hospital Tübingen,
      Germany and with external collaborators to improve the diagnostic rate of the patients
      included in the study.

      Storage of blood or tissue samples is not primary goal of this project, but may be necessary
      for further analyses.
