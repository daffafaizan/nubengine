      be randomized into one of two groups:The study group will have soft tissue balance performed
      with the use of IOS. Control group patients will have soft tissue balance performed manually,
      with final soft tissue balance values measured using IOS, while the surgeon will remain
      blinded to those values. Intra-operative compartment loads will be measured in 10, 45, and 90
      degrees of flexion.

      Additionally, long leg limb alignment, passive range of motion, use of opioids, daily
      activity, and PROMS will be evaluated post-operatively to determine which group has better
      outcomes.
