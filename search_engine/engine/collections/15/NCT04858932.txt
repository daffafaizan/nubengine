      and nutritional scale in healthy adults. Subjects, age 65 to 85 years will be recruited.

      The proposed study will consist of an initial (in-clinic) intake visit on Day 1 where the
      subject will be screened and enrolled in the study after signing an informed consent
      document, followed by an at-home phase where the subject will wear a watch like device on one
      wrist. After training, the subject will return for their Day 8 in-clinic visit, where the
      subject will repeat some intake assessments and activities, as well as some additional
      standing and walking activities. The subject will then be asked to perform at-home activities
      and assessments with the use of a smart phone, digital food scale, smart body weight scale,
      and continuous glucose monitor, while continuing to wear the watch-like device and a movement
      measurement device around their waist (Days 8-21). A final in-clinic visit will take place on
      Day 21 for final assessments and device collection. A +/- 4 days will be allocated for the
      scheduling of all visits to accommodate subject's schedules and commitments. All
      in-laboratory activities will take place in the Laboratory for Human Neurobiology while
      in-home activities will be completed in the subject's home. The study procedures will be
      identical for all subjects for the three groups.
