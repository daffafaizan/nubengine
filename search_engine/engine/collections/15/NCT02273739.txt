      receive ascending oral doses of enasidenib to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose. The second portion of the study is a planned dose
      expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive enasidenib to further evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity. Anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      Enrollment into the AG221-C-003 study was closed following enrollment of the dose escalation
      Cohort 4 (650 mg QD) in order to focus resources on the development of other pipeline IDH
      inhibitors in solid tumors, gliomas, and lymphoma; it was not due to safety reasons.
      Participants receiving enasidenib at the time of study closure were to be allowed to continue
      treatment until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity, as outlined
      in the study protocol.
