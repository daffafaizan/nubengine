      development of brain metastases tends to be poor (6-8 months). Over-expression of Human
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER-2/neu), negative estrogen receptor, and young age at
      diagnosis seem to be indicators of high risk for brain metastases. Temozolomide may be a good
      candidate for prophylactic chemotherapy because of its ability to cross the
      blood-brain-barrier, achieving high concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS).
