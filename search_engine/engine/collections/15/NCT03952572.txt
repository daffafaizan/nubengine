    
      This is a open-label, multi-center, randomized, non-inferiority study to compare efficacy and
      safety of CDOP with standard CHOP regimen in patients with previously untreated PTCL. Study
      subjects are patients with histologically proven newly diagnosed PTCL. Patients are
      randomized 1:1 to receive either cyclophosphamide, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin,
      vincristine and prednisone (CDOP) administered in 3 week cycles for 6 cycles or
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) administered in 3 week
      cycles for 6 cycles.This study is divided into three phases: screening phase, treatment phase
      and follow-up phase. Patients will receive study drug(s) for up to 6 cycles, or until
      unacceptable toxicity will develop or progression or voluntary withdrawal.Adverse event of
      every treatment cycle will be recorded.Therapy efficacy will be evaluated after finishing 2
      cycles, 4cycles and finishing 6 cycles therapy. Patients will be followed until disease
      progression, died or 2 years from the last patient randomized.
