      fertile chip in unexplained infertile couples on intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
      cycles. On study arm sperm selection will be performed by using special microchannel system
      which is called fertile chip (FC) without using sperm wash procedure. This FC system leads to
      select lineer motile progressive sperm selection. In control group, sperm selection will be
      performed by classical way which sperm will be undertaken to sperm wash by gradient method.

      After selection of sperm in both arms, ICSI will be performed. The outcomes of ICSI schedule
      will be assesed by fertilization and clinical pregnancy rates.
