      (smart-phone rather than PC) to make access more widespread, focus on new patients (alcohol
      dependent patients leaving residential care), offer optional audio delivery to improve access
      for those who have literacy challenges and be enhanced with services tailored to relapse
      prevention. ACHESS will offer: 1) communication with peer support groups and addiction
      experts; 2) timely monitoring to assess risk of relapse, 3) reminders and alerts to encourage
      adherence to therapeutic goals; 4) addiction-related educational material and tools tailored
      to the needs of the particular patient, 5) access to selected Internet based resources and 6)
      communication with a care manager. Patients randomly assigned to ACHESS will learn to use it
      prior to discharge from residential care.
