    
      This is a prospective observational study. The planned sample size is 34 pregnant women per
      group with 90% power and 0.05 alpha error.

      VAS score systems and Salmon's item list were used to evaluate the satisfaction level.

      The inclusion criteria are age between 18 and 40, singleton pregnancy, vertex presentation,
      bishop score <6, using a foley catheter cook balloon catheter or modified double-balloon
      Foley catheter for cervical ripening and high-risk pregnancy (Oligohydramnios,
      polyhydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, pregestational or gestational diabetes,
      hypertensive disorders).

      The exclusion criteria are being younger than 18 or over 40, communication problems, bishop
      score >6, being at active labor, multifetal pregnancy, non-vertex presentation, scarred
      uterus (cesarean or myomectomy), known fetal structural or chromosomal anomaly, presence of
      non-reassuring fetal cardiotocography before cervical ripening, regional anesthesia during
      the first stage, operative delivery, presence of maternal, fetal or neonatal complication.

      The primary outcomes are the differences in satisfaction level between methods with using
      either the VAS score system or Salmon's item list and pain scores.

      The secondary outcomes are the effects of giving birth within 24 hours, parity status, the
      length of the first stage of labor education level and cesarean section due to failed
      induction on the satisfaction level.
