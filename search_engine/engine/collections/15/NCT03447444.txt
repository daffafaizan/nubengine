      activity and music therapy could reduce restlessness, irritability, and aggression among
      institutionalized people with severe dementia. An exploratory design was used to evaluate a
      combined intervention of physical activity, music therapy, and in- or outdoors walking daily,
      systematically implemented for eight weeks for persons with severe dementia in institutional
      care.
