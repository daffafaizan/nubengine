      osteoarthritis, a significant number of patients take longer to recover in the hospital or
      have a non-optimal quality of life after the surgery. These patients often have difficulties
      in accomplishing basic essential everyday tasks such as walking and stair climbing, both
      shortly and long after surgery. It has been previously shown through research that
      difficulties to do basic tasks before surgery delays recovery and negatively affects
      long-term function. It has also been shown that these difficulties are associated with
      reduced strength in hip or knee muscles present before surgery, caused by lack of activity of
      patients. This study will determine if a hip or knee muscle strengthening exercise program
      accomplished before surgery can improve hospital recovery, capacity to accomplish basic
      activities, and quality of life two days, six weeks and six months after joint replacement
      surgery. If this exercise program is shown to be beneficial, it will be easily used by
      patients when waiting for their surgery.
