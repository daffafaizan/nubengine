      participants. This study will look at the relative BA of different TAK-994 test formulations
      relative to the currently used formulation (T1) and the effect of food on the test
      formulations in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 54 participants. The study consists of three parallel
      groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3). In each group, one test TAK-994 formulation (T2
      formulations in Group 1; T3 formulations in Group 2; and T4 and T5 formulations in Group 3)
      will be evaluated under fed and fasting condition compared to reference T1 formulation under
      fasting conditions in a cross-over design. Participants will be randomly assigned into 6
      sequences within each group.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 57 days. Participants will be followed up for up to 14 days
      after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
