      forms of migraine have a multifactorial and polygenic pattern of inheritance and genetics
      research is crucial for a deeper understanding of migraine mechanisms. Recently, 12 genetic
      loci have been identified to be associated with migraine with (MA) and without aura (MA) in
      four large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The functional consequences of this
      genetic variant in humans are yet unknown.

      PACAP is a neuropeptide which plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of migraine and is
      present in migraine relevant structures. PACAP can induce migraine attacks in MO patients via
      an adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent pathway. Also, a recent study has showed that
      intracellular accumulation of cAMP is crucial for the induction of migraine attacks.

      The phenotype of the migraine inducing effects of PACAP might therefore be linked to some of
      the 12 genetic susceptibility loci that have been identified.
