    
      -  There were 32 children who were randomly assigned

        -  Recovery times were markedly shorter in the N2O group compared with those in the
           ketamine group (median, 0.0 min (interquartile range [IQR], 0.0-4.0 min) vs. median,
           21.5 min (IQR, 12.5-37.5 min), N2O vs. ketamine, respectively, p < 0.05)

        -  Sedation levels were deeper in the ketamine group than in the N2O group, but pain scales
           were comparable between groups

        -  No difference was observed in the satisfaction scores by physicians, parents, or nurses.

        -  N2O inhalation was preferable to injectable ketamine for pediatric patients because it
           is safe, allows for a faster recovery, maintains sufficient sedation time, and does not
           induce unnecessarily deep sedation
