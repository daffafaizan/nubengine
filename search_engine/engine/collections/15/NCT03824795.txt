      efficacy of incremental doses of MGB-BP-3 with 3 sequential groups of 10 patients with CDAD.
      Patients will be administered an oral dose of MGB-BP-3 for 10 days (Day 1 to Day 10). At the
      end of the treatment period, patients will be followed for up to 8 weeks to assess the
      incidence of disease recurrence.
