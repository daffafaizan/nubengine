      micronutrient bioavailability. The second objective consists in studying food disintegration
      at oral phase (in the mouth) and the consequences on the bioaccessibility of hydrophilic
      vitamins in saliva.

      The clinical study is open, monocentric, controled and randomized, in a cross experimental
      design.

      The included volunteers (n=12) will participate in the whole two protocols. The first
      protocol is related to the study of vitamins B9, B12, D and lutein bioavailability during 8h
      kinetics, after ingestion of a food matrix (custard, biscuit, flan or sponge cake). The
      second protocol is related to the study of hydrophilic vitamin release during mastication of
      two of these matrices (biscuit and sponge cake).

      The study is not performed in a double blind way. However, the measure bias will be limited
      because of the standardized and objective characteristic of the main criteria. Moreover,
      biological samples will be analysed by the same partners of the project. Each subject will be
      his own control, so that confusion factors related to individual variability will be
      eliminated.

      The monocentric characteristic of the study, the low number of subjects and the expertise of
      the involved staff will enable to limit the number of missing data.

      The randomization (latin square) has been established by a bio-statistician of the project
      before the study started. A document describing the randomization proceeding is
      confidentially kept.
