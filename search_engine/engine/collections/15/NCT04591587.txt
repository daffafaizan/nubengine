      The purpose of our study is to investigate the feasibility and effect of fresh lenticule
      implantation as allogenic graft that will be taken from myopic patients, in order to implant
      in patients with keratocouns disease using VisuMax Femtosecond laser - Smile module surgery
      which primary objective in to increase central corneal thickness and secondary objective is
      to improve visual acuity and reducing K-values.

      Methods:

      All the patients were clinically diagnosed with progressive keratoconus. Twenty (20) patients
      underwent SMILE surgery (first group), and twenty (20) patients underwent lenticule
      implantation (second group). Visual acuity, corneal topography, anterior segment optical
      coherence tomography, were analyzed.

      Outcome:

      Central corneal thickness were improved at the same day of surgery and vision started to
      improve at first week postoperatively in the second group (lenticule implant group). Corneal
      topography showed a statistically significant decrease in the anterior K1 and K2. All the
      grafts from both groups were clearly visible by anterior segment optical coherence tomography
      observation. The central corneal thickness was stable during the 6-month study period. No
      complications were observed during short term follow-up.

      Opinion:

      In our opinion, the present study may suggest that this procedure, using fresh lenticule with
      stromal stem cells and live keratocites is safe, reliable, and effectively increases corneal
      thickness and improves visual acuity with no adverse effects, which may provide new avenues
      in the treatment of corneal ectasia.
