      difficulty in resection due to acute inflammation, no improvement after supportive therapy,
      or early inability to tolerate cholecystectomy. In this setting, gallbladder drainage was
      needed. Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD)was used as a first-line
      mitigation method, whose restrictions are contraindications and strong pain caused by
      puncture. Endoscopic technique based on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
      had been made another alternative management for drainage. Endoscopic drainage expanded the
      indications for drainage without reducing the technical success rate and clinical remission
      rate, especially less uncomfortable, which greatly improved the quality of life for patients.
      Unfortunately, because of the difficult procedures and long learning curve, endoscopic
      gallbladder drainage can only be performed in some large endoscopic centers. Despite a few
      prospective comparison of PTGBD and endoscopic ultrasound EUS drainage studies so far, there
      is no prospective study comparing endoscopic naso-gallbladder drainage （ENGBD） and PTGBD,
      especially in its impacts while cholecystectomy. This study aim to observe clinical effects
      of ENGBD and PTGBD during the all stage of peri-cholecystectomy.
