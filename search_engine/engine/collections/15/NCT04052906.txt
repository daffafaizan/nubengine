      of COPD is dyspnea. Since dyspnea leads to activity limitation and inadequate self-care
      skills among individuals, it is often associated with major psychological comorbidity, social
      isolation and poor perceived quality of life. COPD patients with high self-efficacy are high
      enough to level of treatment adherence. On the other hand, the most preferred treatment
      method for the management and mitigation of COPD symptoms is by the use of inhaler
      medication. However, incorrect use of the inhaler would lead to failure in the control of
      COPD patients. Also, it fails to provide COPD patients with self-care agency and
      self-efficacy levels. In COPD, planned inhaler medication training has been shown in many
      studies to reduce dyspnoea, increase self-care and self-efficacy levels. Therefore, planned
      inhaler medication training increases quality of life in COPD patients.
