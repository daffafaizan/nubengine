      right ventricular dysfunction and fluid overload can impair kidney perfusion resulting in the
      cardio-renal syndrome.

      An increase in the variation of blood flow velocity in the portal vein during the cardiac
      cycle called portal pulsatility is a sign of congestive heart failure. Portal pulsatility
      occurs when increased central venous pressure results liver venous congestion. The presence
      of abnormal portal pulsatility could be used as a marker of venous congestions in other
      organs such as the kidneys. Discontinuous intra-renal vein flow is a risk factor for death or
      re-hospitalization in heart failure patients and could be seen in patients with portal
      pulsatility.
