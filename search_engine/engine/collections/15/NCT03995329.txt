      Wurzburg, Germany) and total respiratory resistances measurement with an impulse oscillometry
      system (IOS)( (Viasys Jaeger MasterScreen IOS system).From the basic pulmonary measurements
      (flows and dynamic lung volumes), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital
      Capacity (FVC), Tiffenau index (FEV1/FVC, FEV1%), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Maximal
      Expiratory Flow (MEF) at 25%, 50%, and 75% of vital capacity, Functional Residual Capacity
      (FRC), Total Lung Capacity (TLC), Residual Volume (RV), Diffusion Capacity (DLCO) were
      measured. Each manoeuvre was repeated for at least three technically acceptable forced
      expiratory flow curves in order to attain the best results. Respiratory impedance at 5 Hz
      (Z5Hz) and respiratory resistance at 5, 10, and 20 Hz (R5Hz, R10Hz, and R20Hz, respectively),
      reactance at 5, 10, and 20 Hz and resonant frequency were assessed with IOS. Heart rate,
      saturation of O2 (oxymetry) and arterial blood pressure were also measured. Exhaled CO
      measurement (piCO Smokerlyzer,Bedfont Scientific Ltd, Kent, U.K.) was performed After smoking
      heated tobacco (IQOS): 5 minutes after smoking IQOS , they repeated again PFTs, IOS, exhaled
      CO heart rate, saturation of O2 (oximetry) and arterial blood pressure measurements.
