      I. Establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the
      combination of ABT-888 and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of ABT-888 and gemcitabine in
      patients with solid tumors.

      II. Determine the effects of ABT-888 and gemcitabine treatment on DNA damage response by
      analysis of markers such as Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 and gemcitabine when administered in
      combination.

      IV. Determine the generation of gemcitabine triphosphate in PBMCs. V. Document any evidence
      of antitumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral ABT-888 twice daily on days 1-14 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21* days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.

      NOTE: *Patients previously enrolled on a 4-week schedule (ABT-888 twice daily on days 1-21
      with gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly on days 1, 8, and 15, and courses repeating
      every 28 days) will continue on the 4-week schedule.
