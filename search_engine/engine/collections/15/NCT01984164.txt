           dementia. To date, no specific treatment is available for this pattern of mild cognitive
           impairment related to hypertension.

        -  Objectives or purpose: The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of
           candesartan on executive function decline and on changes in cerebral perfusion,
           cerebrovascular reserve and microvascular brain injury. The study also intends to
           identify potential underlying mechanisms related to vascular structure and function,
           including atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation, vascular stiffness, and endothelial
           progenitor cells, by which candesartan may affect the cognitive and cerebrovascular
           outcomes.

        -  Study methodology:This is a double blind randomized clinical trial that will be
           conducted in 140 individuals (70 in the candesartan group, 70 in the lisinopril group).
           Our target population is subjects: 55 years or older with hypertension and Executive
           Mild Cognitive Impairment.

        -  Endpoints to be measured:Our measures include cognitive function, cerebral perfusion and
           reserve, markers of vascular brain damage, atherosclerosis, stiffness, vascular
           inflammation and endothelial function.

        -  Description of intervention, follow-up, and duration of study: Eligible participants
           will undergo randomization into 2 groups and will be seen frequently until their blood
           pressure is controlled (<140/90 mmHg). Participants will be seen at 3, 6 and 12 months
           afterwards.
