      China. Complete surgical resection with systemic lymph node dissection remains the most
      effective treatment method for this malignancy. Although tree-field lymph node dissection was
      reported to be effective in improving long-term survival in Japan,there is no enough
      evidences yet to demonstrate that three field lymph node dissection is superior to two field
      lymph node dissection in reducing postoperative recurrence and improving long-term survival.
      In this study, the dissection of lymph node adjacent to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve
      would be performed and examined routinely by intraoperative frozen-section. If the lymph node
      is positive, three field lymph node dissection(Cervical-thoracic-upper abdominal
      lymphadenectomy) will be performed, if negative, the patients will be randomly assigned
      either to three-field lymphadenectomy group or two-field lymphadenectomy group. The purpose
      of this large scale multi-center trial is to compare the lymph node dissection results and
      prognosis in thoracic esophageal carcinoma without cervical lymph node involvement treated by
      three-field lymphadenectomy or two-field lymphadenectomy and clarify whether the lymph node
      along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve could be taken as sentinel lymph node indicating
      neck lymph node metastasis and necessity of three-field lymphadenectomy.
