      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Subjects will receive durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks (1 cycle) for a maximum 13 doses
      (12 months), or until unacceptable toxicities or disease recurrence.

      The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for
      protocol therapy:

      Hematopoietic:

        -  White blood cell count (WBC) > 3 K/mm^3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) > 9 g/dL. Transfusion is allowed, if needed, since patients are post
           esophagectomy.

        -  Platelets > 100 K/mm^3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm^3

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of >/= 40 cc/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by
           24-hour urine collection.

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) </= 2.5 x ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) </= 2.5 x ULN
