      defibrillators for patients with cardiac disorders affecting their heart rhythm. Previously,
      cIEDs have been regarded as a contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans,
      with concerns that the magnetic fields of the MRI may cause problems with the patient's cIED.
      However, this is a major healthcare issue, as approximately 50-75% of patients with implanted
      cIEDs are expected to need a future MRI as part of their clinical care. The inability to get
      such a test may negatively impact the ability to diagnose and treat future diseases.

      However, many of the initial concerns regarding the capability of performing MRI in patients
      with cIED have likely been overstated. There is peer-reviewed literature dating back to the
      1990s regarding the ability to safely perform MRI in patients with cIEDs, if certain
      protocols are followed regarding patient selection and monitoring. In 2011, Nazarian et al
      from Johns Hopkins University published a study on 438 patients with cIED that received MRI.
      There were no adverse clinical effects from this study. In fact, the American College of
      Radiology updated it's guidance document for Safe MR Practices, and cIEDs are no longer
      listed as a relative contraindication to obtaining an MRI. However, the presence of cIEDs are
      still regarded as a relative contraindication to performing MRI at some centers. In addition,
      performance of MRI in the setting of cIED is denied by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services. Continued accrual of data regarding the safety of performing MRI in patients with
      cIEDs is needed, including outcomes studies that document the clinical impact of improved
      diagnostics provided by the MRI on patient care.
