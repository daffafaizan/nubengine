      many cases can be determined and corrected, in a number of individuals there is no
      correctable cause found and the patient must live with their anemia. This is known as
      idiopathic anemia, and can have serious consequences for the individual. Numerous studies
      have demonstrated that anemia is associated with loss of energy and stamina, causing
      individuals to decrease their activities, which adversely affects both their sense of
      well-being as well as their physical strength. Losses in these areas are associated with the
      clinical manifestations of frailty.

      The current pilot study will examine whether or not administration of Epoetin Alfa, a hormone
      stimulating production of red blood cells, can reverse this type of anemia. We will examine
      the consequences of reversing the anemia in terms of physical strength and function,
      cardiovascular function and sense of well-being and mental function.

      In this study, individuals with anemia will be treated for six months with Epoetin Alfa
      following the correction of their anemia and measurements done to evaluate physical strength,
      performance, cardiac, mental and kidney function. At the end of treatment, individuals will
      be followed for an additional six months to determine whether the anemia recurs and physical
      function decreases.

      Participation in this study is voluntary. All testing and medication received are free to the
      participant.
