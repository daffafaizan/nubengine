    
      Tryptophan (TRP), an essential aminoacid, is metabolized in the serotonin (5-HT) or in the
      kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Serotonin is catabolized to 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindole amino acid) by
      monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). The TRP to KYN transformation is regulated by indoleamine
      2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).

      The primary objective was the measurements of serotonin and kynurenine pathways parameters
      which were performed in blood and urine samples using different HPLC techniques and of
      serotonin transporters and receptors which were determined in blood platelets. The results in
      patients were compared to those measured in controls matched for age, gender, tobacco
      consumption and season of inclusion.

      The secondary objective was to evaluate the potential relationships between these 5-HT and
      Kyn pathways biomarkers concentrations, MAOA and IDO enzymatic activations and clinical
      outcome and criteria.
