      combination with a general anesthetic. The thoracic epidural is routine for this operation
      and allows administration of local anesthetics and painkillers in the epidural space which
      results in profound pain relief in the area of surgery. The epidural is routinely used for
      pain control during the surgery and after the surgery when the patient is awake.

      The general anesthetic used may be a volatile agent (gas for example Desflurane), which is
      administered through the anesthesia machine, or an intravenous anesthetic agent, which is
      administered into a vein through an intravenous line as a continuous infusion (example
      Propofol). The use of an anesthetic agent and an epidural often causes a decrease in blood
      pressure which is treated with medication. The investigators are comparing the two anesthetic
      techniques regarding their effect on blood pressure and the amount of medication needed to
      treat it.
