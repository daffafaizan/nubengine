      utilization in children with DS and OSAS. It is being hypothesized that, irrespective of
      study arm, increased PAP adherence will be associated with better quality of life,
      neurobehavioral, and healthcare utilization outcomes.

      Evaluate the effect of PAP adherence in children with DS and OSAS on patient-centered
      outcomes and family-relevant outcomes identified during the R61 phase of this research. It is
      being hypothesized that irrespective of study arm, increased PAP adherence will be associated
      with better patient-centered outcomes, and family-relevant outcomes identified during the
      first year of this research.

      Determine the efficacy of INT vs. CON in promoting PAP adherence. It is being hypothesized
      that that children receiving INT will show significantly increased objectively-measured PAP
      adherence at 6 months compared with those receiving CON (Aim 4A). As a secondary aim (4B), it
      will be evaluated whether the improved adherence is maintained over 12 months. It is being
      hypothesized that participants initially randomized to the INT arm will have better adherence
      at 12 months compared to those in the CON arm.

      Use mixed methods during the randomized controlled trial to identify family perceptions, such
      as empowerment and self-efficacy, regarding PAP use in youth with OSAS and DS. It is being
      hypothesized that INT-PAP will be associated with more positive perceptions compared to CON.
