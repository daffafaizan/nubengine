    
      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment cohorts (Cohorts A
      or B) in which the Marqibo formulation and the 1-vial VSLI-RTU formulation of vincristine are
      administered in a 2-way crossover design over 2 treatment cycles (21 days each):

        -  Cohort A: Marqibo formulation given at a dose of 2.25 mg/m2 with no dose cap during
           Cycle 1, and VSLI-RTU formulation given at 2.25 mg/m2 with no dose cap during Cycle 2.

        -  Cohort B: VSLI-RTU formulation given at a dose of 2.25 mg/m2 with no dose cap during
           Cycle 1 and Marqibo formulation given at 2.25 mg/m2 with no dose cap during Cycle 2.

      Both formulations of vincristine sulfate LIPOSOME injection will be administered via a 60
      (Â±10) minute IV infusion.

      Blood samples for PK evaluation will be drawn at the following time points: immediately
      before infusion, 0.5 hour after the start of the infusion, 0.5 hour after the end of infusion
      (EOI), and 3, 8, 15, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-EOI.

      In addition to Marqibo or VSLI-RTU, all patients will receive standard doses (per
      institutional or regional guidelines) of cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and doxorubicin, (and
      rituximab if patient is on the R-CHOP regimen), on Day 1 and prednisone (or prednisolone if
      consistent with institutional or regional guidelines) on Days 2 to 5.
