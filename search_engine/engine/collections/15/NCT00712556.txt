        -  To determine if a fluorine 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan,
           performed as early as day 30 after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
           transplantation, may be useful in identifying patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who may
           benefit from early interventions, including reduced intensity stem cell transplantation
           or additional therapy, to preempt disease relapse and improve overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Conventional imaging, biopsy, and clinical examination findings are reviewed to
      determine patient clinical outcome (e.g., complete remission, disease progression/relapse, or
      death related to the primary disease).
