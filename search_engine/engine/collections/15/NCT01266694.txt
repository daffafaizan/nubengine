      of 50 % to 85 % a few days after surgery Cardiac tamponade occurs in about 1-2 % of patients
      who undergo cardiac surgery and may develop slowly without clear-cut clinical signs. Most
      tamponade occurs more than 7 days after surgery which is a concern because, at that time,
      patients often have already been discharged from the hospital.

      No study has ever shown the efficacy any drug for this condition.In particular, we published
      a study demonstrating the absence of efficacy of a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug
      (Meurin P, Tabet JY, Thabut G, et al.French Society of Cardiology. Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug treatment for postoperative pericardial effusion: a multicenter
      randomized, double-blind trial. Ann Intern Med. 2010 Feb2;152(3):137-43) Cochicine is widely
      used to treat inflammatory pericarditis ; is it efficient to treat post operative pericardial
      effusions ? this is the question we want to answer to.

      Design: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Intervention :
      colchicine 1mg vs placebo, once daily for 14 days Setting :10 post operative cardiac
      rehabilitation centers. Patients: 200 patients at high risk of tamponade because of moderate
      to large persistent pericardial effusion (grade 2, 3 or 4 on a scale of 0 to 4 measured by
      echocardiography) more than 7 days after cardiac surgery.

      Measurements: The main end point will be change in effusion grade after 14 days of treatment.
      Secondary endpoints include frequency of late cardiac tamponade.
