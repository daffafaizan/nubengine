      In 10 to 30 % of patients, the cause of the infertility is unknown. An emerging practice in
      unexplained infertility has been to cause a uterine trauma prior to treatment. This is done
      by doing a small endometrial scratch with a pipelle. This intervention has been study in IVF
      and has been shown beneficial. Theoretically, the uterine scratching could increase the
      immune response and the vascularization of the endometrium which could help in embryo
      implantation. However, there is very few data concerning scratching in intrauterine
      insemination. The studies are mostly small studies and the results are often contradictory.
      In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will evaluate the effect of uterine
      scratching during the follicular phase of an insemination cycle on the pregnancy rate of a
      large cohort of unexplained infertile couples.
