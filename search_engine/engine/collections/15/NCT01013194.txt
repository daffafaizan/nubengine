      growing number of liver chronic disease patients and the lack of organs. Research and
      development of new liver failure treatments thus have a high clinical significance.
      Regenerative medicine and results recently achieved in the field of stem cell biology may
      provide a remedy to this emerging problem.

      Our project aims at developing new generation cell transplantation methodologies through an
      interdisciplinary research project created from a collaboration between ISMETT, Palermo and
      the University of Pittsburgh (UPMC-USA).

      Adult hepatocyte transplantation has been in use for several years already and has proved to
      be safe for patients and able, especially in pediatric patients, to improve liver function
      indices and delay the need for liver transplantation. Studies have been limited until now by
      the use of already differentiated hepatocytes and therefore unable to proliferate and develop
      a suitable liver mass to support a decompensated liver.

      The hypothesis of our project, supported by in vitro studies and studies on experimental
      animal models, is based on the possibility to generate an ectopic liver system in the spleen
      through the experimental use of hepatic cell progenitors obtained from human fetal liver
      tissues. Human fetal liver cell transplantation will be performed in the spleen through
      arterial injection.

      The final endpoint of the project is to develop an innovative and safe treatment for patients
      with end-stage chronic liver failure
