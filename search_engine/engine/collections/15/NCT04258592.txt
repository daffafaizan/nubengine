      123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG imaging) (planar + single photon emission tomography
      (SPECT)) performed in the previous six months or scheduled within three months, will undergo
      a dynamic PET scan for the first 30 minutes, followed by 3 static whole-body PET/CTs up to
      three hours post injection for a pharmacokinetics study and efficacy assessment of 18F-MFBG
      in humans. Furthermore, a comparison with 123I-MIBG imaging will be performed.
