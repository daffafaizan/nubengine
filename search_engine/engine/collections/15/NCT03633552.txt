      cycles and 12 cycles adjuvant Temozolomide regimens in patients with brain glioblastoma and
      anaplastic astrocytoma. The main inclusion criterion includes patients newly diagnosed with
      glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma whose diagnosis is confirmed by histologic
      evaluation. The main exclusion criteria involve chronic renal, hepatic or cardiac failure.
      The patients will initially undergo surgery. Within 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, all patients
      will receive chemoradiation. After completion of chemoradiation, the cases will receive 12
      cycles of adjuvant Temozolomide (prescribed as 150 to 200 milligram per square meter body
      surface per day for the first 5 days of every 28 days). In the control group, the patients
      will receive 6 cycles of adjuvant Temozolomide (in the same dosage). This is a phase III,
      non-blinded, blocked randomized clinical trial. The study is conducted on 62 newly diagnosed
      patients with brain glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma referring to the
      oncology clinics during March 2018 and March 2019. The patients will be randomized to 6-cycle
      and 12-cycle adjuvant Temozolomide groups using block randomization method (1:1). This study
      will be conducted in the oncology clinic of Omid Hospital and Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad.
      Blinding is not observed in this study. The primary endpoints of study are overall survival
      and progression free survival.
