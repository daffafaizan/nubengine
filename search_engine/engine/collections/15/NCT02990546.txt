      shock in a randomized control trial. The investigators hypothesize that midodrine use
      initiated after stabilization or improving intravenous vasopressor requirement will lead to
      decreased length of ICU stay and length of time that intravenous vasopressors are required.

      The investigators plan to enroll and consent patients at the onset of septic shock. Once IV
      vasopressor requirement is stabilized or decreasing, males and females will be randomized in
      1:1 fashion to receive either standard clinical care or standard clinical care plus oral
      midodrine. The investigators will analyze length of stay in the ICU, time on vasopressors,
      time needing a central line, and hospital length of stay.
