      crisis stabilization unit (CSU) or to an inpatient unit (IPU) for a behavioral crisis.
      Subjects will be included at random, as assigned to Dr. Laddis according to his routine
      duties at those units.

      Subjects in the control group will receive treatment for behavioral crisis according to the
      preference of the clinical staff at other comparable units. That treatment will constitute
      "treatment as usual". Clinicians in the control settings will not be informed about the
      experimental hypothesis, the clinical intervention and the contingent outcomes.

      The subjects will be tested for the results of treatment 12-24 hours after composition of a
      treatment plan. The testing will be done with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), as
      well as with a set of criteria devised by Dr. Laddis to measure the outward behavior and the
      mental events during behavioral crisis. The patients and the attending frontline staff will
      be interviewed also about their beliefs in regard to what, among the clinicians'
      interventions, made a difference for the course of the behavioral crisis, for better or for
      worse. The raters will be trained for interrater reliability and they will not be informed
      about the hypothesis.
