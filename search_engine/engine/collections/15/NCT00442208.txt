      food on the intragastric pH profile of PN 200. PN 200 contains immediate release omeprazole,
      which may be subject to acid degradation in the stomach. Food is known to have a buffering
      effect on acid and therefore may result in less degradation of immediate release omeprazole.
      Alternatively, food may decrease the absorption of omeprazole in the duodenum. The relative
      magnitude of these effects is unknown. The data from this study will aid in choosing the
      optimal timing of PN dosing relative to food in future studies. The study is not blinded
      because the primary endpoint (intragastric pH) is a physiological variable not believed to be
      readily influenced by conscious or subconscious subject control.
