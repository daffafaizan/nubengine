      I. To determine the effect of maintenance obinutuzumab on duration of complete response (CR)
      in patients with CD20+ B-cell primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) who attain CR
      to first-line treatment with high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival after CR (overall survival [OS]-CR). II. To evaluate
      neurocognitive function, quality of life, and neuroimaging as indicators of neurotoxicity.

      III. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be calculated.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (MAINTENANCE THERAPY): Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 2
      for the first cycle, and on day 1 for the subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 60 days for
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (OBSERVATION): Patients undergo observation for a total of 3 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
