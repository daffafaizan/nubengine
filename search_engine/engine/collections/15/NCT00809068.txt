      consistent with a pro-atherogenic effect. The mechanism of tibolone on HDL cholesterol has
      been suggested to result from an acceleration of the catabolism of HDL by stimulation of
      hepatic lipase with no effect on cellular cholesterol efflux.

      PPAR-a agonists, in particular fenofibrate, improve HDL metabolism by increasing the
      expression and hepatic secretion of HDL apoAI and apoAII.

      We hypothesise that fenofibrate will rectify the perturbations on HDL metabolism wrought by
      tibolone.
