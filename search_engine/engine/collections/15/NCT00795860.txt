      prevention and management of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms
      responsible for the improvements in metabolic health are not completely understood. Mounting
      evidence suggests that abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism in persons with abdominal
      obesity are associated with insulin resistance. Alterations in fatty acid mobilization and
      oxidation may be primary adaptations responsible for the improvements in metabolic health
      after weight-loss and endurance exercise training. We hypothesize that a disparity between
      muscle fatty acid uptake and oxidation is regulated by the expression of genes and proteins
      that participate in intracellular transport, trafficking, and metabolism of fatty acids. We
      believe that alterations in the expression of these factors in response to weight-loss and
      endurance exercise training will underlie changes in the non-oxidative disposal of fatty
      acids, and thereby improve insulin sensitivity. We will determine the effects of weight-loss
      and exercise training on whole-body fatty acid mobilization and oxidation and the expression
      of factors that regulate these processes in skeletal muscle. In addition, we will evaluate
      how these alterations are associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity. These studies
      will provide insight into how cellular alterations with weight-loss and exercise training and
      the accompanying changes in whole-body fatty acid metabolism may lead to improvements in
      metabolic health.
