      focusing on or avoiding aversive stimuli (such as judging facial expressions) and thereby
      reinforcing the bias. Computerized training programs have been developed to implicitly direct
      the users attention. In this study, such a program -- combined with an established,
      well-researched and proven effective form of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy
      (iCBT) -- will be provided to 128 participants that meet the diagnostic criteria for social
      phobia, and the pre/post-measurements will be compared. Participants will be randomized to
      one of two groups, receiving one of two variants of the cognitive bias modification program
      (both receive iCBT).
