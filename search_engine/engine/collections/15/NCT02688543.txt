      randomized controlled trial. Because of the blinding patients were allowed to continue
      pre-intervention pharmacological treatment, which may have interfered with the outcome. The
      short follow-up (12 weeks) does not allow drawing conclusion on the duration of the effect.

      We aimed at assessing the pain reducing effect of RF of the genicular nerves and the duration
      of the effect.
