      A root surface with new caries experience was recorded when a root surface which was sound at
      baseline was found to have a carious lesion or a filling at a follow-up examination. Arrested
      root caries was recorded when the active root caries found at baseline changed into inactive
      root caries at follow-up. The status of each root surface was recorded using the codes
      recommended by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS Ⅱ)
      Coordinating Committee in 2009. Color of the arrested root caries lesion was classified into
      one of four types according to PANTONE® color plates placed next to the lesion (Fig 1),
      namely yellow (7401U), light brown (1245U), dark brown (4635U), and black (Black U).

      A mean root caries increment of around 0.8 root surface per year of control group was
      reported in a previous clinical trial conducted in Hong Kong. Thus, in this study, a 30-month
      increment of 2 new decayed root surfaces was anticipated. The ratio of the mean to the
      standard deviation of the root caries increment was expected to be around 1:1.5. In order to
      show that a 50% difference in mean caries increment between the highest and the lowest values
      in the three groups was statistically significant at a 5% significance level and at an 80%
      power, 80 subjects in each group was required. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 25% over 30
      months, a total of 300 subjects (100 in each group) were needed.
