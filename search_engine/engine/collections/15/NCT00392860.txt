      The first part will include completing propulsion and braking tasks with the subject's
      original handrims. After the initial testing, new handrims (NaturalFit, PalmRim, and a new
      standard handrim) will be installed on the subject's wheelchair and subjects will again be
      asked to complete another set of propulsion and braking tasks. Subjects will also be asked to
      complete a questionnaire to assess wrist and shoulder pain and undergo an examination of the
      condition of the palm of their hand.

      For the second part of the study, subjects will be asked to participate in a 4-month trial
      use period of the new handrims on their wheelchair.

      In the third part of the study, subjects will complete the final set of propulsion and
      braking tasks and complete a follow-up questionnaire.
