    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the complete remission rate of relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients with Mutated Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) gene.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of remission in these patients. II. Determine the in vivo
      biological effect of arsenic trioxide in AML with mutated NPM1.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours daily for up to 45 days.
      Patients achieving complete remission, receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours daily 5
      days a week for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
