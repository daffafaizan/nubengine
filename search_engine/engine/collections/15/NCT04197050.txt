      Heart failure, one of the leading causes of CTD mortality, has attracted increasing
      attention. Mostly, patients with CTD present with nonspecific cardiac symptoms, normal ECG,
      and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and therefore do not receive an early
      cardiac diagnosis and treatment. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), right ventricular
      (RV) dilatation and hypertrophy might become the first and the most frequent cardiac
      findings. Sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, is a
      "superstar" which inhibits both neprilysin and renin-angiotensin aldosterone system that
      closely related to the heart failure mechanism. It has been strongly recommended as class I
      drug in treating the patient with chronic HFrEF from 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA heart failure
      guideline for the ability of dramatically reduce the cardiovascular mortality rate.

      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is able to depict myocardial characteristics from
      structure to tissue properties using cine and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences.
      Newly developed imaging studies to date include T1 mapping and T1-derived extracellular
      volume estimation. All the previous studies in CTD have been restricted to patients with
      advanced cardiac involvement.

      Together with clinical assessment and multi-imaging tests, the aim of the present study is
      going to observe the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on primary endpoints (6 minutes walking
      test and myocardial fibrosis) in CTD patients with RV-HFrEF.
