      leading to multiple vertebral collapses. This causes spinal deformity, leading to
      incapacitating back pain and reduced quality of life. In spite of advances in medical
      therapy, some patients are left with disabling back pain, sometimes requiring surgical
      intervention. University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust have observed on an audit of
      our own practice that application of an external spinal brace as early in the disease process
      as is possible appears to maintain the overall alignment of the spine, thus minimising risk
      of spinal deformity and consequent back pain.

      The ultimate aim is to undertake an RCT to determine whether the use of an external spinal
      brace can reduce back pain and spine-related disability in patients suffering from back pain
      due to multiple myeloma, in comparison to conventional management without a brace.

      However, prior to this, a feasibility study is required. The feasibility study is needed to
      see if the trial processes (providing patient information, consent process, conducting the
      baseline investigations and outcome measures) can be accommodated without causing too much
      delay to the application of the brace.

      Suitable patients will be consented by the research team and randomised to receive a brace or
      no brace in addition to their routine Myeloma treatment. After baseline data collection and
      questionnaires, the participant would be followed up for data collection at 6 weeks and 3
      months.
