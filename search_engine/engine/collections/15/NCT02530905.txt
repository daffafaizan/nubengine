    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-titration study to assess safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of 4 dose levels of SRP-4045 in genotypically confirmed advanced-stage
      DMD patients with deletions amenable to exon 45 skipping.

      After completion of the dose-titration portion of the study and SRP-4045 is determined to be
      safe, all patients will be evaluated on open-label SRP-4045 for the duration of the study.

      Safety, including adverse event monitoring, routine laboratory assessments, and cardiac
      testing will be monitored through the duration of the dose-titration and open-label portions
      of the study.

      Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits via quality of life
      questionnaires and tests of pulmonary and upper extremity function through the duration of
      the dose-titration and open-label portions of the trial.
