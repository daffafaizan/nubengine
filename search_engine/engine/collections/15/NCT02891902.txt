      including bacteremia is a serious form. Compliance with hygiene measures and recommendations
      in the use of invasive devices can reduce the incidence. The advantage of simple
      recommendations type "bundle" could, however, be insufficient because not associated with
      training and monitoring compliance with the recommendations. The aim of this study is to show
      that the daily intervention of a public health nurse on the basis of a half full-time
      equivalent, allows these actions and therefore a reduction in the bloodstream of the attack
      rate acquired in the ICU compared dissemination of simple recommendations.
