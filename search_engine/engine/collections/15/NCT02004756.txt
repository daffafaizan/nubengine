      intolerance by examining cardiac and musculoskeletal metabolism in a unique cohort of
      children with congenital heart disease. Study findings may more importantly lead to
      evidence-based exercise interventions that promote improvements in overall physical health,
      quality of life, and functional status for Fontan children. Furthermore, this pilot study
      will lead to the development of a novel research protocol which may be applied to larger
      Fontan and other congenital heart disease cohorts. This study will also provide preliminary
      data to develop and conduct a larger clinical research project.
