      two weeks or matching placebo, to be administered for 12 months. After 12 months of
      treatment, patients will remain in follow-up for a further 12 months.

      High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to serially monitor the impact
      of Evolocumab on carotid plaque morphology and composition in patients with significant
      carotid stenosis who do not meet clinical criteria for carotid endarterectomy. This approach
      will reveal if clinically beneficial plaque regression occurs, without requiring the large
      patient cohorts or long follow-up needed for cardiovascular outcome trials.

      Results from this study will establish whether treatment with Evolocumab is likely to be
      beneficial to patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
