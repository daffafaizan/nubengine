    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of CAD/CAM single-retainer
      monolithic zirconia ceramic RBFDs which cemented with two different resin cements.

      The project includes 20 patients. Most of the patients have been recruited from the Istanbul
      Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. The patients were selected from individuals
      who have unilateral or bilateral congenitally missing maxillary lateral teeth and wanted to
      be treated a restoration or undergoing orthodontic treatment.

      After giving their consent to take part in the study no preparations were made on abutment
      teeth for RBFDs. Digital impressions were taken with an intraoral digital scanner. The RBFDs
      were designed using a CAD software, milled and presintered zirconia blocks (KatanaTM Zirconia
      HT, Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc, Tokyo, Japan). RBFD was adhesively bonded to abutment teeth
      with one of the two different resin cements (Panavia F2.0 or Panavia V5).

      The control procedure is:

      The restoration is evaluated according to presence of mobility or debonding and fracture at
      the connector area. Gingival harmony and periodontal tissues around the restorations were
      also examined. Mobility of the abutment tooth was checked in the clinical examination and
      alveolar bone was examined with periapical x-ray. The controls will take place after two
      weeks, one year, two years, three years and five years.
