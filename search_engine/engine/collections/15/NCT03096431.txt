      treatment arms. All treatment arms will undergo physical & cognitive testing prior to
      whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Arm 3 will receive
      cognitive rehabilitation intervention sessions prior to, and concurrent with, WBRT/SRS.
      Approximately 14 days following WBRT/SRS: all arms will undergo physical and cognitive
      testing, and: Arm 1 will begin physical activity intervention. Arm 2 will begin physical
      activity intervention and cognitive intervention. Arm 3 will continue with cognitive
      intervention and begin physical activity intervention. All Arms will undergo physical and
      cognitive testing approximately 2.5 months post WBRT/SRS.
