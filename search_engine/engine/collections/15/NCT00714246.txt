      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Platinum-based two-drug combination is considered
      the current standard of care for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. There is a need to develop
      novel regimens to improve the outcome for patients with advanced NSCLC. The combination of
      carboplatin and docetaxel is effective for therapy of advanced NSCLC. This combination
      results in improved survival and quality of life for patients with advanced NSCLC. Docetaxel
      exhibits preclinical synergy with bortezomib.

      The trial was intended to be a phase I/II study to define the maximum tolerated dose of
      bortezomib that can be administered in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin and
      subsequently evaluate the efficacy of the regimen for patients with advanced NSCLC. However,
      the trial never moved past the phase I portion of the study and was terminated early.
