      self-calibrating, non-invasive, intracranial pressure measuring (ICP) device based on
      trans-cranial Doppler technology. The ophthalmic artery is utilized as a natural ICP sensor.
      Up to 80 subjects will be recruited in 4 centers to achieve a power of 90% and a p<0.05
      compared to the values obtained from (a) patients in an ICU whose meet standard clinical
      indications for ICP measurement and whose ICP is measured using gold-standard implanted
      intracranial instrumentation and in (b) ambulatory subjects who meet clinical indications for
      lumbar puncture. At least two comparative readings, separated by an hour or more, will be
      obtained from each subject.
