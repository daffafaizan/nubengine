      deterioration. To achieve these goals, treatment adherence (i.e. taking medication as
      prescribed) is important. However, non-adherence (not taking medication as prescribed) is
      common in COPD and can be affected by lifestyle changes or use of multiple inhalers.

      The effects of Trimbow® on patients' health related quality of life, adherence and clinical
      outcomes have not been assessed in a UK real-world setting. This non-interventional trial
      aims to collect data from COPD patients under routine care over a 6 month period, for whom
      their doctors has decided to prescribe Trimbow® as per the authorised indication. We plan to
      investigate any changes in quality of life, as well as changes in lung function and the need
      for any additional therapy over 6 months. We also plan to investigate the adherence or
      reasons for non-adherence to Trimbow® as used in everyday routine.
