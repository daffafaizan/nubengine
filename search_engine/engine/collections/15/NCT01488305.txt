      households year round access to nutritious food as a platform to deliver a proven essential
      nutrition actions (ENA) related messages to household with children less than 2 years old.
      The AAMA project seeks to examine the effects of household level HFP on malnutrition. So the
      recipient and other partners wishes to undertake a study to explore a plausible delivery
      mechanism for MNPs along with HFP and intensive community level IYCF-BCC and their impact on
      infant/child growth and anemia.

      The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial with a three arm factorial design. The
      trial involve 330 randomly selected children aged 6-9 months at the time of enrollment (n=110
      per each of the three study arms). MNPs distributed through FCHVs to 110 children selected
      from communities that already have the HFP and IYCF-BCC intervention. This group of children
      will be compared on outcome parameters for anemia, growth (stunting, underweight and wasting)
      and infections (diarrhea, fever and cough) to a similar sub-set of children (n=110) who
      receive only the HFP and IYCF-BCC intervention and to a third sub-set of control children of
      similar age (n=110) who are not receiving either of these interventions. Children aged 6-9
      months were chosen for the study because this age range captures the recommended age for
      introduction of complementary foods to children and our chosen age group also falls within
      the 0-24 month age range which is considered the period of rapid growth and development and
      therefore period of highest nutrient requirements in children.
