    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify response related factors predictive of relapse among children with
      previously untreated standard risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). II. Determine the
      prognostic significance of residual leukemic blasts at specific times during induction
      therapy: M3 marrow status (greater than 25% blasts) at day 7; M2 status (5%-25% blasts) at
      day 14; and residual circulating leukemic blasts at days 7 and 14. III. Determine the
      prognostic significance of residual leukemic burden, as measured by fluorescence activated
      cell sorting/leukemic progenitor cell assay, on marrow aspirates acquired at the end of
      induction therapy, at the beginning of maintenance therapy, and at the completion of all
      therapy in patients with B precursor ALL. IV. Determine the prognostic significance of
      residual t(1;19) detected in marrow aspirates by PCR-based analyses of the fusion transcript
      E2A-PBX1 at the end of induction therapy, at the beginning of maintenance therapy, and at the
      completion of all therapy. V. Examine the interrelationships among these response-related
      prognostic factors and their correlation with ploidy, karyotype, and immunophenotype. VI.
      Determine, in a randomized study, whether substitution of oral thioguanine (TG) for oral
      mercaptopurine (MP) during consolidation, interim maintenance, and maintenance therapy
      improves event-free survival for patients with standard-risk ALL. VII. Study and compare the
      cellular pharmacokinetics of oral MP and oral TG during interim maintenance and maintenance
      therapy in selected patients. VIII. Compare the concentrations of MP and TG red blood cell
      metabolites (i.e., nucleotides, nucleosides, free bases, and methylated metabolites) during
      interim maintenance and maintenance therapy, and determine whether low levels of metabolites
      predict relapse in selected patients. IX. Determine the activities of thiopurine
      methyltransferase and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase several times during
      interim maintenance and maintenance treatment, and compare the activities between the two
      thiopurine treatment groups in selected patients. X. Compare the incidence of central nervous
      system (CNS) relapse and event-free survival in patients receiving intrathecal methotrexate
      (MTX) vs. triple intrathecal chemotherapy (MTX/cytarabine/hydrocortisone) for presymptomatic
      CNS treatment. XI. Determine whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase (TdT) positivity predicts for CNS or marrow relapse by measuring TdT activity on
      CSF cytospins in cases with low white blood cell count (less than 5 cells per cubic
      millimeter) and suspected or questionable "blasts" during maintenance therapy. XII. Determine
      event-free survival in patients with standard-risk ALL and M3 marrow at day 14 when treated
      with intensive therapy designed for higher-risk ALL.
