      obesity and/or hyperinsulinemia. Roughening of the skin is related with histological
      papillomatosis and the skin darkening is due to hyperkeratosis. Biochemical mechanisms for
      developing this hyperplastic lesion involve local cutaneous growth factors. Nearly 40% of
      Native American teenagers have acanthosis nigricans, whereas about 13% of African American,
      6% of Hispanic, and less than 1% of white, non-Hispanic children aged 10-19 have clinically
      apparent acanthosis nigricans. AN is a clinical surrogate of laboratory-documented
      hyperinsulinemia.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of metformin versus placebo on AN lesions of
      the neck as well as their effects on metabolic (HOMA, triglycerides, cholesterol) and
      anthropometric variables (BMI, waist) in a sample of obese children. This is a 12-week
      randomized, double-blind randomized trial involving obese children with AN to receive either
      metformin or placebo.

      Evaluations will be performed every three weeks. Clinical, histological and colorimetric
      assessments of AN lesions will be compared initially and at the conclusion of the study.
      BurkeÂ´s scale, papillomatosis and hyperkeratosis, and the L* axis of will be used to measure
      the AN improvement.
