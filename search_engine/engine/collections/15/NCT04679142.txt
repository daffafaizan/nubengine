      safety study (PASS) conducted in France. There will be no experimental intervention utilized.
      Enrolled patients will receive treatment and evaluations for their disease as determined by
      their physicians in accordance with local standard of care. Visits will be scheduled by their
      physician according to patient-specific needs and national clinical practice.

      For purposes of this study, physicians will be requested to record information on enrolled
      patients at the time of study enrolment (baseline), and then to conduct follow-up patient
      visits based on their usual practice for a period of 12 months following Baclocur®
      initiation.

      At study end, further investigations on patients confirmed as lost to follow-up (LFU) will be
      performed through the use of the French medico-administrative database called the Système
      National des Données de Santé (SNDS). The goal will be to determine their vital status and
      collect relevant treatment and safety data over the studied period to further assess the
      safety of Baclocur®. A probabilistic approach using relevant matching variables (e.g. gender,
      year of birth, date of Baclocur prescription, department of care) will be used to retrieve
      these SNDS data of interest.

      The patient study enrolment period is expected to be approximately of 3 years. Accounting for
      the 12 months follow-up period per patient, the full study field duration is expected to be
      approximately of 4 years. One additional year will be needed before the SNDS matching is
      performed, taken into account the delay required for the SNDS to be updated. With the final
      analysis and final clinical study report, this will lead to a total study duration of
      approximately 6 years.
