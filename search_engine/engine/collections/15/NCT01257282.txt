      myocardial damage can be recognized afterwards e g by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This
      study includes patients with stable coronary artery disease without previously known
      myocardial infarction, and investigates the prevalence of clinically unrecognised myocardial
      damage (UMI), and the prognostic value of UMI regarding new cardiac events.

      In a subset of the patients, the biologic intra-individual variability of troponin and other
      biochemical markers will be investigated (substudy protocol).
