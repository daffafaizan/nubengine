      consecutive nights will result in increased markers of inflammation compared to sleeping in
      darkness (< 1 lux) during the night in patients with OSA. A secondary aim is to examine the
      effects on insulin sensitivity, adipokines, and RNA molecules.

      The risks associated with this study are minimal compared to the potential benefits.
      Knowledge about the effects of sleeping with dim light on inflammation in patients with OSA
      is important and would guide future recommendations about proper sleep hygiene. This research
      may also guide future recommendations about light conditions in other environments such as
      hospital bedrooms.
