      achieved, followed by a 4 week outpatient phase (phase 2). A single infusion of ketamine or
      midazolam will occur on day 3 of Phase 1. In addition to measures of mindfulness and
      impulsivity, stress sensitivity tests are incorporated into the design in order to elucidate
      mechanisms of action. The study hypotheses are:

        1. ketamine and MBRP will significantly increase the time to first use compared to placebo
           and MBRP in cocaine-dependent individuals.

        2. ketamine and MBRP is significantly more likely to lead to abstinence from cocaine (no
           use over one week) as compared to placebo and MBRP.

        3. ketamine and MBRP will significantly reduce subjective, endocrine, and physiological
           responses to stress (including cue exposure) as compared to placebo and MBRP.

        4. ketamine and MBRP will significantly increase mindfulness, as assessed by the Five Facet
           Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), as compared to placebo and MBRP.
