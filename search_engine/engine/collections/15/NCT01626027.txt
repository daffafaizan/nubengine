      than in the general population and increases the risk for coronary events and mortality,
      higher health care consumption and decreased quality of life. Most hospitals in Germany have
      a unique infrastructure of psychiatric, psychosomatic and psychosocial services for CHD
      patients (psychiatric/psychosomatic consultation liaison services and a wide network of
      inpatient or outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centers). However, as of today, little is
      known about the current use and acceptability of depression health care from the perspective
      of CHD patients.

      This project has two main aims:

        1. to assess the current use of depression care in CHD patients who are hospitalized or
           receive ambulatory care at a cardiology clinic

        2. to provide estimates for the resources needed to implement guideline-oriented depression
           health care acceptable to CHD patients with comorbid depression.

      Specifically, the investigators will assess

        -  rates of and satisfaction with depression health care use in hospitalized CHD patients
           within one year after hospitalization

        -  perceived need for depression care and patient preferences for different types, settings
           and providers of these services

        -  correlates of depression health care use and patient preferences

        -  the amount of patients in need for depression health care according to existing
           recommendations

      The secondary objective is to assess direct and indirect costs associated with depressive
      symptoms and depression care use across 1 year (as indicated by quality of life, event-free
      survival, productivity, and health care costs).
