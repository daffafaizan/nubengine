      rivastigmine capsules, with markedly improved tolerability profile. We hypothesized that
      combination of memantine and rivastigmine patch will be safe and well tolerated and result in
      more clinical benefit in patients with AD in comparison with rivastigmine patch monotherapy,
      for the mechanisms of the drugs are different.
