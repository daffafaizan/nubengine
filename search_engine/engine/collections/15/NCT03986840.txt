    
      This will be a experimental, randomized controlled intervention study in frail. Subjects will
      be recruited at the Albertia Care Center, Madrid. The exercise training group will developed
      a concurrent training 3 days per week during 6 weeks. The control group will follow an usual
      care also for 6 weeks.

      The main variables will be as follows:

        -  Ultrasound imaging measurements for the lower limb: core muscles, vastus medialis,
           rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, gastrocnemius, soleus. We will employed a General
           Electric (GE) Ultrasound device in B mode to assess the thickness of the muscles.

        -  Heart rate variability with a Suunto smart bell.

        -  Activities of daily living with the Bartel index.

        -  Force-velocity profile and muscle power.

        -  Frailty with the LindaÂ´s frailty criteria.

      The exercise program was applied for 6 weeks. A total of 18 sessions were distributed in 3
      weekly sessions. The participants performed a resistance exercises: leg press at an intensity
      of 40%-60% with 10 repetitions, 12 repetitions of steps with their bodyweight and a plantar
      flexion followed by a cardiovascular high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise walking
      on a treadmill.

      One measurements will be taken (pre), the second (post) measurements will be performed at 6
      weeks.
