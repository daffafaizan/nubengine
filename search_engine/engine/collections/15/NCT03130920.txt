      remote ischemic precondition group - RIPC (3 intervals of 5 minute right upper limb ischemia
      with 3 intervals of 5 minute reperfusion), local ischemic precondition group - LIPC (15
      minutes of inflow liver occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion before liver
      transection), control group - CG (group without ischemic preconditioning before liver
      transection). Patients were also stratified according to the extent of the hepatectomy.
      Hepatoprotective effect was evaluated by comparing serum transaminase levels, bilirubin
      levels, albumin, and protein levels, coagulograms and pathohistological exams. We also
      measured flow rate by Doppler ultrasound of hepatic artery and portal vein before and after
      preconditioning.
