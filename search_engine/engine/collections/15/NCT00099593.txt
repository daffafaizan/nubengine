      play an important role.

      Dendritic Cell (DC)-tumor cell vaccines have several features that suggest applications for
      the immunotherapy of human tumors. Importantly, DC-tumor cell immunization has the potential
      to simultaneously stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity against multiple tumor
      antigens.

      The vaccine will be prepared from the subject's own blood, obtained during leukapheresis.
      From leukapheresed blood, monocyte-derived DCs and malignant lymphocytes will be isolated.
      The DCs will then be loaded with lymphocyte-derived tumor antigens. Formulations and release
      criteria must be met before vaccine can be administered.
