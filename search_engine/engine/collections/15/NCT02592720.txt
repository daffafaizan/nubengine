      before fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement when guiding percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients with ACS will be
      randomized into the cocktail plus FFR guided group or the QCA guided group. The primary
      outcome of the cocktail II study is the composite of death, myocardial infarction, class IV
      heart failure and target vessel revascularization within 1 year. The secondary outcome of the
      cocktail II study include left ventricular function, quality of life, stroke or
      life-threatening bleeding within 1 year.
