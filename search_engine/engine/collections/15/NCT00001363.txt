      cognitive components of planning using the [150] water PET blood flow technique. We will
      administer perception, motor, simple decision, and planning tasks using the game of chess and
      the Tower of Hanoi Test as paradigms. Utilizing a "subtraction technique" we hope to identify
      those areas of cerebral cortex which are most activated by planning processes. It is
      predicted that the dorsolateral frontal areas will be most prominently activated. It is also
      predicted that the essential components of the planning process will be the same regardless
      of the type of plans being executed. The data we collect will be of value in determining 1)
      the neural representation of planning processes and 2) in guiding cognitive models of the
      planning system.
