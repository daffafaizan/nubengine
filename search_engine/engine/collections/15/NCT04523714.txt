    
      Specific Aims Aim #1: Determine the effectiveness of a web-based CBT-CP program and virtual
      coach-led (telephonic/video) CBT-CP on achieving clinically meaningful improvements in
      patients' pain severity (pain intensity + pain-related interference) relative to those
      receiving usual care at 3 months.

      1a. Examine the impact of the active interventions on secondary pain outcomes and related
      quality of life outcomes (social role functioning, physical functioning, and patient global
      impression of change); as well as exploratory outcomes, which include long-term opioid use;
      comorbid symptomology (depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance); and high impact chronic
      pain and graded chronic pain.

      1b. Conduct subgroup analyses to determine the impact of the active interventions on specific
      populations and explore for potential heterogeneity of treatment effects by sex;
      rural/medically underserved residency; multiple pain conditions; mental health mood
      disorders; and negative social determinants of health.

      1c. Examine the role of theory-based mediators, pain catastrophizing, pain-related
      self-efficacy, and perceived support, on pain-severity.

      Aim #2: Assess the cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of the web-based and virtual
      coach-led CBT-CP interventions compared to each other and usual care.

      Aim #3: Conduct a qualitative evaluation to understand: 1) patient experiences of the
      interventions, including how they relate to treatment response, variability by site, and
      rural/medically underserved residency status; and 2) health system issues, including
      adaptations and contextual factors at the site and external levels, barriers and facilitators
      to intervention success and potential for adoption, sustainability and dissemination.
