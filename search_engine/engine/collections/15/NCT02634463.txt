    
      This is a Phase 0, multicenter (when more than one hospital work on a medical research study)
      study including participants taking aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone or risperidone.
      Participants will provide blood samples to be used in development of antipsychotic
      immunoassays. At different times, assay development will require venous, capillary, or both
      types of blood samples. Overall, at a single study visit, a minimum of approximately 0.1
      milliliter (mL) to a maximum of approximately 15 mL of blood will be collected from all
      sources. Across all study visits, a maximum of 450 mL of blood will be collected from a
      participant. The frequency of collections (study visits) will depend on the needs of assay
      development. A particular participant may participate for only 1 sample collection or
      multiple sample collections (study visits). This study will continue for an indefinite period
      of time. The participant's direct involvement in the study will be continued until the study
      is ended, the participant has given 450 mL of blood, or the participant withdraws consent or
      is excluded from participation for medical and/or inclusion/exclusion criteria reasons.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
