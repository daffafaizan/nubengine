      targeting vascular endothelial factor (VEGF). One potential advantage of a dexamethasone
      implant over specific VEGF antagonists is that steroids suppress production of multiple
      pro-permeability factors.

      Our primary objective is to measure the pro-permeability factors in the aqueous humor of
      patients with persistent/recurrent macular edema despite prior treatment with anti-VEGF
      agents at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after intraocular injection of a
      dexamethasone implant.
