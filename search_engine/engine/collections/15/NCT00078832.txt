      Primary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of anastrozole in preventing breast cancer in postmenopausal
           women at increased risk for the disease.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the role of this drug in preventing estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
           in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on breast cancer mortality in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on other cancers, cardiovascular disease, fracture
           rates, and non-breast cancer deaths in these participants.

        -  Determine the tolerability and acceptability of side effects of this drug in these
           participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.
      Participants are stratified according to participating center. Participants are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral anastrozole daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive an oral placebo daily for 5 years. In both arms, treatment
           continues in the absence of the development of breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma
           in situ), a drop in the T-score below minus 4, or the occurrence of a new fragility
           fracture.

      Participants are followed for at least a further 5 years.
