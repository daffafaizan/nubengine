      inhibitor, either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. The introduction of calcineurin inhibitors led
      to a significant improvement in graft and patient outcomes post solid organ transplantation.
      However, one of the severe limitations of this class of drugs, is its associated
      nephrotoxicity. Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients reveal that the
      incidence of stage 4 chronic kidney disease or stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) after
      Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) at 1, 3, and 5 years is 8%, 14%, and 18%,
      respectively, increasing to approximately 25% by 10 years after transplantation.Furthermore,
      renal dysfunction is associated with a four-fold increase in patient mortality post solid
      organ transplantation.

      Several calcineurin inhibitor sparing and minimizing regimens have been studied. Most
      recently, in the phase III, randomized study in de novo liver transplant
      recipients,demonstrated significantly improved renal function in the tacrolimus minimization
      arm (everolimus plus tacrolimus one year post transplant.In fact superior renal function was
      achieved with the tacrolimus minimization arm one month after randomization and was
      maintained to Month 12. With this pilot study, we aim to compare the efficacy of the standard
      immunosupression post liver transplant with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic)with
      calcineurin sparing regimen using the combination of everolimus and enteric coated
      mycophenolic acid, as determined by the estimated Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at one
      year post transplant, with acceptable rates of biopsy proven rejection.
