      MI is a complex and cognitive process involving the use of sensory and perceptual memories
      related to motor movements.Various studies using brain imaging techniques have found that
      during motor imagery, brain areas similar to voluntary movement are activated or the motor
      cortex can be stimulated. These findings suggest that stroke patients who cannot physically
      move their limbs can stimulate brain regions responsible for motor movements using motor
      imagery. The Kinesthetic and Visual Imaginery Questionnaire (KVIQ) is a motor imagery
      questionnaire developed for people who need to be guided for different reasons and cannot
      perform complex movements. Evaluate both visual and kinesthetic dimensions of motor images.
      This study was planned because of the need for evaluation of motor imagery for stroke
      patients, who mostly have motor and sensory problems.
