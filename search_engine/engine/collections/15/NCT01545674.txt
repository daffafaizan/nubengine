      States. Women with a high screening risk for trisomy then have invasive testing, which
      carries a risk of miscarriage, to definitively determine if the fetus has trisomy. Because of
      the high false negative rate of the first trimester screening, an unacceptable number of
      trisomic fetuses are not detected. Moreover, because of the high false positive rate, an
      unacceptable number of women undergo invasive follow up testing. Additional screening tests
      are needed that combine a high sensitivity, a low false positive rate, and minimal or no risk
      to the fetus.
