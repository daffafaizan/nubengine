    
      Outpatient Phase: Participants will be outpatients and must come to the Jefferson Avenue
      Research Program three times a week (Mon-Wed-Fri). This phase will last two weeks. At each
      visit participants will be asked to provide a urine sample and to complete questionnaires
      that ask about substance use.

      Inpatient Phase: Participants will live on an inpatient research unit at least 2 consecutive
      nights and possibly up to 20 consecutive nights. Participants cannot have visitors and will
      not be allowed to leave the inpatient unit (except with a staff escort) unless they drop out
      of the study. We will collect daily urine samples to make sure participants are not using any
      drugs except those in the study.

      Participants will take part in multiple trials (up to 11 experimental sessions) where they
      will be given a standard amount of powder (identified as Drug A or Drug B) to inhale through
      a straw into their nose. The powder will contain placebo (a powder containing no drug) or
      different doses of cocaine. We will measure how participants are feeling using questionnaires
      and we will record vital signs-including breathing rate, blood oxygen level, heart rate, and
      blood pressure.

      Participants will also be asked to perform a 3-hour computer task that allows them to work
      for Drug A, Drug B, or money. At the end of the computer task participants will receive the
      amount of drug they earned and a receipt for the amount of money they earned.

      To complete the study, a minimum stay of 16 inpatient nights is required. The maximum stay is
      20 inpatient nights.
