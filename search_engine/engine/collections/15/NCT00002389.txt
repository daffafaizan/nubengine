      control therapy with 3TC and ZDV alone. If a patient has two consecutive HIV-1 RNA
      measurements of >= 400 copies/ml (performed at least one week apart) he or she has the option
      to switch to open-label therapy with 1592U89/3TC/ZDV, to receive the remaining randomized
      treatment, or to discontinue study medication. If this criterion is not met, patients
      continue their randomly assigned therapy until the last patient has completed 48 weeks of
      therapy. Once patients enter the open-label phase, investigators may add or substitute
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,
      or protease inhibitors for 3TC and/or ZDV according to their standard practice once patients
      enter the open-label phase.
