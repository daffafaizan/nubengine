      ensured the reliability of their use, so the implant has become a common practice among
      dental surgeons, as the use of implants has increased its complications as well. Accompany
      the same development, especially when they are installed in aesthetic areas, where deficiency
      of periimplant gingival tissue is insufficient.

      The objective of this randomized controlled clinical study was to evaluate the increase in
      the volume of periimplant gingival tissue in implants installed in the aesthetic areas with
      the use of subepithelial conjunctive tissue graft, and a sample of 40 individuals with
      implants aesthetics where the test group (n = 20) will receive tec graft. (N = 20) will
      receive only the dental implant without the placement of a tec graft epithelial conjunctival.

      In order to analyze the increase of gingival periimplant tissue, pre, trans and postoperative
      clinical measurements, aesthetic evaluation, patient satisfaction assessment and improvement
      of the quality of life will be performed and the radiographic measurements will be performed
      to evaluate the periimplant bone structures and their influence on the results.

      These measurements will be performed in the pre-operative (baseline), 6 months
      postoperatively and 6 months after installation of the definitive crown on the implant, the
      study will have a power of 80% (p = 0.05).
