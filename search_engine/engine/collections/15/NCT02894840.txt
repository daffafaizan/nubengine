      same vaccine, a seasonal trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine
      [A/California/7/2009, reassortant virus NYMC X-181 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/2009, reassortant
      virus NYMC X-187 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008, reassortant virus NYMC BX-35 virus strains]
      will be given in both Phase I and Phase II of the study.

      The vaccine will be administered via the intramuscular route; the preferred injection site
      will be the deltoid of the non-dominant arm. After vaccination volunteers will remain at the
      clinic for at least 30 minutes to observe for any reactogenicity after immunization. Total
      follow-up is 90 days.

      Blood specimens will be collected on Day 0 prior to vaccination, Day 21, Day 60, and day 90.
