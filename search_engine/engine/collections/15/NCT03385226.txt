      infusion of pembrolizumab (200mg) every 3 weeks. At week 12, patients will be planned to
      start radiotherapy at a dose of 12 Gray (Gy) in 3 fractions which will be given concomitantly
      with pembrolizumab. Patients who progress on pembrolizumab before week 12 will start
      radiotherapy as soon as possible after progression. Following completion of radiotherapy,
      patients will continue receiving pembrolizumab at 3 weekly intervals for a maximum of 2 years
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity develops. Patients on pembrolizumab will
      be seen every 3 weeks until 2 years after study entry, while Patients who progressed/ stopped
      pembrolizumab will be seen annually for survival/disease status only. Patients completing 2
      years of treatment will then be followed up annually for survival and disease status until
      the end of trial is declared (2 years after the last patient is registered).
