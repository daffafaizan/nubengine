      treatment, develop hearing loss. The purpose of this study is to determine if some degree of
      hearing loss can be prevented by use of Lactated Ringer's solution in the middle ear. To
      study this, patients will use drops in their ears; Lactated Ringer's will be placed in one
      ear and an inactive saline solution will be placed in the other. Ofloxacin, an eardrop
      antibiotic will be placed in each ear at the same time. Each participant will receive a
      hearing evaluation before each dose of Cisplatin and another evaluation 2 to 4 weeks after
      the final treatment.
