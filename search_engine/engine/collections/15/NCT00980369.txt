      treatment for chronic anal fissures (CAFs); however, questions remain regarding the best
      technique. The present study investigated whether the type of anoderm incision (vertical or
      parallel to the anus) affected wound healing, wound-related complications, incontinence and
      recurrence rates in CAF patients undergoing open LIS.
