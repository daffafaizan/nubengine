      records for patients who have had a TLIF utilizing the CALIBER® expandable interbody spacer
      in conjunction with the REVOLVE® or REVERE® posterior stabilization systems and subsequent
      follow-up visits.

      The study aims to collect both pre-operative and post-operative data at the 6, 12 and 24
      month time points according to existing standard of care and the surgeon's custom and
      practice.
