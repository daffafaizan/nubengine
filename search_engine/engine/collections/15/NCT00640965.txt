      design and will be carried out in Israel. Approximately 40 adult subjects with migraine will
      be randomly assigned (1:1) to either DP-VPA (maximum of 900mg/day) or placebo. Active and
      placebo will be administered orally and once-daily on an add-on basis, i.e. other permissible
      ongoing medications will be continued. Total study duration per subject will be 18 weeks.
      Subjects will report on their migraine attacks frequency and other attack characteristics
      using weekly diaries.
