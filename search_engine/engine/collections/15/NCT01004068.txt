      were randomized in three arms (group A, B, and C). Group A underwent SET program plus
      hypocaloric diet for two months, group B had one month of observation followed by one-cycle
      of CC therapy, and group C underwent SET program plus hypocaloric diet for two months and
      received one-cycle of CC for one cycle. CC was always given at the maximal dose previously
      used. Clinical, hormonal and metabolic data were assessed at baseline and after intervention.
      Ovulation was monitored by ultrasound and confirmed by plasma progesterone assay.
