      invasive brain temperature monitor (either Licox or Temperature sensing intracranial pressure
      device) will be enrolled after consent. The Excel Cryo Cooling System collar will be placed
      around neck in up to 20 patients for two hours. The goal is to determine the effectiveness of
      this device in cooling the brain. The collar is a standard neck collar used for patients
      after neck surgery with a modification that allows for the placement of a cooling pack in the
      collar that delivers the cold. During the study and for two hours after, the investigators
      will collect data concerning the brain temperature, body temperature, brain oxygen level and
      pressure both in the head and in the blood (blood pressure). The investigators will also
      collect demographic information about you (i.e. age, gender, medical risk factors) and
      information regarding your current disease process.
