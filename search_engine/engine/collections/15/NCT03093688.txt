      Efficacy of conventional treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is
      limited. AS novel therapy, immunotherapy shows great prospects.

      Human iNKT cells can directly lysis tumor cells by a perforin-dependent mechanism,and
      intracellular granzyme B expression may also potentiate cell killing. Tumor cells expressing
      CD1d may be especially susceptible to direct NKT cell lysis. iNKT cells play important role
      in immune regulation by secreting various cytokines. PD-1+CD8+T cells are most likely
      tumor-specific in patient with advanced tumor. Expansion method of iNKT cells and PD-1+CD8+T
      cells in vitro is developed as published in our patent. Infusions of iNKT cells and CD8+T
      cell have been proved safe in mice.

      In this clinical trial, the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapy of infusion of iNKT
      cells and CD8+T cells are assessed.
