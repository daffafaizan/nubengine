    
      To determine the feasibility of 1) randomizing patients to step-ladder versus buttonhole
      cannulation techniques, and 2) coordinating the multiple Canadian sites that are required for
      the definitive study.

      Secondary Objectives: To determine 1) if buttonhole cannulation, compared to step-ladder
      cannulation is associated with reduced training time for high dose home hemodialysis
      patients, 2) if buttonhole cannulation, compared to step-ladder cannulation is associated
      with reduced overall cost, 3) if buttonhole cannulation, compared to step-ladder cannulation
      is associated with reduced complications (infection - local and systemic, radiologic/surgical
      interventions, re-trains for needle insertion difficulties, hematoma formation, aneurysm
      formation, missed insertions), and 4) if buttonhole cannulation, compared to step-ladder
      cannulation is associated with reduced patient discomfort with needling for intensive home
      hemodialysis patients
