      while on a very low-sodium (10 mEq/day) diet compared with a very high-sodium diet. These
      acute dietary interventions will be part of the parent study ("Dietary Salt in Postural
      Tachcyardia Syndrome" funded by R01 HL102387) for 4-5 days at the time of the study. Dietary
      success will be assessed using a 24h urine for sodium and creatinine as a part of the parent
      study.

      Blood will be drawn and collected in a fasting state for future assay and analysis of the
      following tests:

        -  Glucose, Insulin (glucose impairment, insulin resistance)

        -  Fasting lipid profile

        -  C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) (inflammatory state)

        -  Inflammatory cytokines (inflammatory state)

        -  aliquots (future analysis)
