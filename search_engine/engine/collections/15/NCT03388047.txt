      device, the PolyScope disposable endoscope (PolyDiagnost). This is a combined sterile
      catheter and fibre optic device designed to optimize light delivery to the anatomy and to
      acquire and transmit endoscopic images back to a camera. This CE marked system can be used to
      endoscope luminal organs such as the oesophagus, but also biliary tract, the bladder and the
      oro-pharynx.

      The PolyScope can be inserted thought the accessory channel of commercial endoscopes. The
      design of the fibre optic device is durable and re-useable; it is inserted within the
      disposable sterile catheter channel, which is able to flex and bend to orient the device to
      the region of interest for imaging. The fibre optic device never comes into contact with the
      patient. The sterile catheter, which shields the fibre optic device, is disposed following a
      procedure.

      The use of the PolyScope provides the advantage of building on a known system. The commercial
      PolyScope probe is coupled outside of the patient to a custom multispectral detection and
      illumination system. No modified part of the device comes into contact with the patient.

      The patients recruited to this study will have a clinical indication to an endoscopic
      examination for Barrett's oesophagus or early oesophageal adenocarcinoma. There will not be
      extra procedures involved. The experimental part of the procedure, using Polyscope
      multispectral endoscope will prolong the procedure in most cases by approximately 5-10
      minutes
