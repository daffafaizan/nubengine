    
      This is a 48-week, multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention), non-controlled, arbitrary-dose study. The patients included in this study are
      those who participated in the preceding double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the
      treatment that the patient receives) comparative trial (study JNS007ER-JPN-S31) of JNS007ER
      and completed the study, or those who remained in the study up to the evaluation at 2 weeks
      and discontinued the study after that for insufficient treatment efficacy. The study will
      assess the safety of JNS007ER in the clinical recommended dose range in a long term
      treatment. The dosage will be started at 6 mg/day, and it can be increased or decreased 3 mg
      at a time depending on the patient's symptom within the range of 3 mg/day to 12 mg/day. For
      dose adjustments, the investigator will evaluate the psychiatric symptoms before defining the
      dose change.
