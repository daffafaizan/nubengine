      prescribed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or inflammatory myositis, is associated
      with subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD). Surrogate markers for interstitial lung
      diseases are a decrease of the forced vital capacity (FVC) and/or the diffusing capacity of
      the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). However, the measurement of these lung function
      parameters is indicated as regular follow-up examinations during the treatment with RTX
      according to the principles of "good clinical practice". We will perform pulmonary function
      testing (spirometry) including measurement of the DLCO in patients with RA, who are going to
      be treated with RTX. A baseline lung function measurement will be performed immediately
      before RTX therapy is started. Follow-up measurements will be performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks,
      8 weeks and 6 months after initiation of RTX therapy. A reduction in forced vital capacity
      (FVC) of >10% or a fall of >15% in DLCO will be defined as indicative for ILD.
