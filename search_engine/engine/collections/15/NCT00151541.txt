      efficacy of DTG 5% twice daily plus vehicle control once daily vs. DTG 5% twice daily plus
      adapalene gel 0.1% once daily vs. DTG 5% twice daily plus 4% benzoyl peroxide gel once daily
      in subjects with acne vulgaris. Approximately 300 male and female subjects, 12 years of age
      and older, with acne vulgaris and > 20 inflammatory lesions (papules and/or pustules) and >
      20 non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) above the mandibular line at Baseline will be
      enrolled. Follow-up visits will occur at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12. Global Acne Assessments, Lesion
      Counts and Local Adverse Reaction Assessments will be conducted at each visit. A physical
      exam will be done at Baseline and Week 12. Plasma Dapsone Level samples will be drawn at
      Baseline, Week 2 and Week 12/ET for dapsone plasma level assessments. Adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be assessed throughout the study.
