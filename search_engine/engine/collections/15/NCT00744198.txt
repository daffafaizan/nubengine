      groups (arm 1, arm 2, arm 3). All patients will be treated with a transobturatory approach,
      in patients of arm 1 will be used an autologous tissue and reusable introductory needles, in
      patients of arm 2 will be used a synthetic kit whereas in arm 3 will be a biological kit .

      All eligible patients will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      clinical, hormonal, urodynamic, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the
      surgical outcomes, the clinical subjective and objective efficacy data, and the adverse
      experiences will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
