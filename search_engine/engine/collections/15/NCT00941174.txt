      of folate across the colon after an infusion during colonoscopy and a pre-trial with the
      purpose of determining dissolution characteristics of two placebo caplet formulations. Using
      a dual route oral/intravenous, folate (pharmaceutical name Calcium Leucovorin), labeled with
      a stable isotope will be used to quantitatively measure total folate levels, as well as the
      uptake of (13C) labeled folate. A pH dependent caplet targeted to the colon and fluoroscopy
      will determine dissolution characteristics. Labeled and unlabelled folate in blood and urine
      samples will be used to quantitatively measure the uptake of folate. This will further our
      understanding of the kinetics (caplet transit times), colonic folate absorption (metabolism)
      and impact on folate status (bioavailability) in healthy adults.
