    
      Given the lack of consistency in hyperkalemia treatment in the ED and the high cost of
      emergent dialysis, there is a need for the development and systematic evaluation of a
      treatment protocol to shift potassium into the cells followed by the removal of potassium
      from the body with a potassium binder.. The present study will use a systematic approach to
      shifting potassium into the cells followed by binding potassium in the gastrointestinal tract
      in hyperkalemic patients presenting to the ED. Study subjects will receive patiromer or
      placebo to determine if patiromer reduces the need for additional medical intervention for
      the management of hyperkalemia in patients initially treated with IV and inhaled therapy in
      the ED.

      Upon enrollment, patiromer will be administered at a dose selected because of its safety and
      efficacy shown in a pilot study named REDUCE.

      Up to 300 patients will be enrolled and followed for up to 14 days, and potassium levels will
      be measured at pre-determined intervals to assess drug's impact. concomitant medications will
      be recorded to help determine if study drug helped, not just lower hyperkalemia, but also
      decrease the number of total interventions needed to reach a normal potassium level.
