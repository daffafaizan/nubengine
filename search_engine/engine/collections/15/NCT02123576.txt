      and physical exam from the day of enrollment and safety assessment to ensure no
      contraindication to use of PTX. Type I HRS will be defined according to the criteria put
      forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease as (1) cirrhosis with
      ascites; (2) serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL; (3) no improvement of serum creatinine
      (decrease to a level of 1.5 mg/dL or less) after at least two days with diuretic withdrawal
      and volume expansion with albumin; (4) absence of shock; (5) no current or recent treatment
      with nephrotoxic drugs; and (6) absence of parenchymal kidney disease as indicated by
      proteinuria >500 mg/day, microhematuria (>50 red blood cells per high power field), and/or
      abnormal renal ultrasonography. Baseline testing will be obtained from hospitalization
      records, including but not limited to chemistry panel, liver function testing, urinalysis,
      urine electrolytes, coagulation studies, blood cultures, chest x-ray, diagnostic
      paracentesis, abdominal ultrasound with Doppler.

      Subjects will take either placebo three times a day or pentoxyfylline 400mg three times a day
      or 400mg twice a day for eGFR 10-50 and 400mg once a day for eGFR <10 for 90 days in addition
      to standard AMO therapy. Treatment will be continued for 14 days unless a study endpoint has
      been reached at which time either PTX or placebo will be stopped
