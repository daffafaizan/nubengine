    
      This exploratory project is a prospective and multicenter study designed to evaluate the
      mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to Kadcyla in a cohort of 50
      progressive/recurrent HER2+ BC patients planned to be treated with Kadcyla within the
      approved indication in Spain.

      This study will collect high quality molecular data derived from the analysis of serial
      biological samples (primary tumor and/or metastatic tissue, plasma, serum and whole blood
      samples), together with annotated clinical follow up, to reach a better understanding of the
      biological events that drive breast cancer progression and response/resistance to Kadcyla in
      ABC patients.
