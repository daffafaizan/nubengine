      randomized, controlled, single blind trial using a modified Zelen design .It concerns
      children with ASD aged 18 to 36 months without severe neurological or physical disorder and
      living in the proximity of one the early intervention units. After diagnostic, Children will
      be included in a longitudinal cohort with the consent of the parents. Sixty children will be
      drawn lots among 180 children of the cohort and will be included in a ESDM intervention with
      the consent of the parents. Two groups will be compared: an experimental group of 60 children
      receiving 12 hours a week of ESDM intervention delivered by trained therapists during 2 years
      and a control group of 120 children receiving typical heterogeneous 'as-usual' intervention
      proposed by professionals and public services over the same period. Global developmental
      profiles of all the children will be measured at different time points over the two years
      through standardized tests such as the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL), the ADOS-2 and
      the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Cost of each intervention will be calculated.

      The primary outcome is global development of the child, measured by the developmental
      quotient with the Mullen after 24 months of intervention.
