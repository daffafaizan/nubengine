      symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinitis, and etc.

      Nasal septoplasty is a surgery performed to improve above symptoms of nasal obstruction and
      so far, many surgical technique have been studied. All surgical techniques aimed to improve
      breathing through the nasal cavity by supporting the end of nose using surgical materials
      such as autologous bone or nonabsorbable material.

      In the case of autologous bone transplantation, safety is ensured, but there is a limitation
      since it causes deficiency of the donor site, and the nasal septum may be altered by a
      modification of the implanted tissue.

      In the case of nonabsorbable materials, there is a high risk of side effects such as
      hyposmia, septal perforation, and occurrence of boil.

      TnR mesh, as a surgical material for nasal septoplasty has a sufficient flexural strength to
      support the nasal septum and to overcome the force of returning to a deviated state prior to
      surgery.

      Animal tests have shown that TnR mesh well supports the nasal septum after surgery and the
      surrounding tissue is well fused between the pores without inflammatory responses. Based on
      above results, a clinical trial was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TnR mesh
      as a material for nasal septoplasty.
