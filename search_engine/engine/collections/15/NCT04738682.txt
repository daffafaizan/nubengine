      precision using digital registration units (mobile devices), rather than conventional paper
      based dietary registers.

      These mobile devices have been equipped with a dietary registration app, developed by the
      company Movesca ApS, specializing in digital healthcare solutions.

      Nurses, and other relevant staff members at the M3 rehabilitation unit at Hobro hospital,
      will be testing this alternative registration method, as they engage in their day-to-day
      dietary registration for in-house patients. The data collection requires 6 full-day dietary
      registrations from each individual patient (40 patients in total). Of these 6 registrations,
      3 will be gathered using mobile devices and 3 using conventional paper based registers.

      The study primary endpoint is precision. The golden standard is dietary recall. The two
      methods will be assessed in accordance with their uniformity to the dietary recalls, which
      will be performed by the investigators following the meals.

      As a preemptive measure, an internal retrospective audit was performed, with dietary
      registration as the objective. This audit was completed to retrieve baseline data on dietary
      registration, and determine whether the rehabilitation unit conforms to the regulations set
      by the region.
