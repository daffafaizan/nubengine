      powerful biomarker of longevity, makes it an attractive target as an anti-aging therapy
      against functional decline, sarcopenic obesity, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases,
      osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative disorders. Physical exercise and physical fitness, could
      be α-Klotho protein activators through biochemical process. FIT-AGING will determine the
      effect of different exercise modalities on α-Klotho protein (primary outcome) in sedentary
      healthy adults. FIT-AGING also investigate the physiological consequences of activating
      Klotho gene (secondary outcomes).

      Methods: FIT-AGING will recruit 60 sedentary, healthy, adults (50% women) aged 40-65 years.
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a non-exercise group to the usual control
      group (n=15), physical activity recommendation from American College of Sport Medicine, World
      Health Organization and American Heart Association group (n=15), High Intensity Interval
      Training group (n=15)) and Whole-Body Electromyostimulation group (n=15). Laboratory measures
      completed at baseline and 12 weeks later, include α-Klotho protein concentration, physical
      fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength), body composition, resting metabolic
      rate, hearth rate variability (HRV), health blood biomarkers, free-living physical activity,
      sleep habits reaction time, cognitive variables and health-related questionnaires. The
      investigators will also obtain dietary habits data and cardiovascular disease risk factors.
