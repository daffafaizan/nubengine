      total of 16 cycles or 1 year. The end point is that the patient has been taking the drug for
      16 cycles or 1 year, or the patient dies or develops intolerable toxicity or confirmed
      disease recurrence or distant metastasis or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever comes
      first.

      In this study, after a screening period of no more than 28 days, qualified subjects will be
      given ZKAB001 or placebo and test visits. Imaging examination will be performed every 12
      weeks after the first dose until the local or distant recurrence of the disease, or the
      initiation of other systematic anti-tumor therapy or death, whichever come first.

      The survival follow-up period starts from the last treatment to a maximum of 4 years, or to
      the death or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of informed consent or the sponsor terminates
      the study every 3 months.
