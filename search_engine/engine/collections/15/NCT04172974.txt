      delivered to patients in the active intervention via a platform or app. Psychologists will
      provide asynchronous guidance via the platform. Motivational interviewing will be used during
      the intervention to prevent dropout. The psychologist may contact patients via telephone
      during the intervention if needed. All patients will have access to the intervention up to 6
      months' post intervention so that they can revisit the material and reuse it on a
      need-to-basis. Patients will be recommended to use this option and to note specific time
      points in their agenda where they will access the intervention. A brief purpose-designed
      interview protocol that includes elements from the SCAN interview will be carried out by
      psychologists trained in conducting the interview.
