      procedures for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. The present study will use the
      NAVVUS RXi catheter to document changes in translesional hemodynamics obtained with and
      without hyperemia in patients undergoing directional atherectomy, angioplasty, and/or
      stenting of femoropopliteal and infrapoplieal lesions.
