      procedure, demographic data are collected and all patients are asked to complete the
      Spielberger State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-I and STAI-II) in an isolated, calm room
      before being transferred to the procedure room.

      All patients are monitored with electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure
      and bispectral index measurement at 5-min intervals.

      Oxygen is administered at 4 L/min via a face mask, Propofol 2% infusion is started via an
      effect-site target controlled infusion system (Marsh model).

      Once the patient reaches the desired level of sedation as determined by BIS value of 60, the
      procedure is started.

      This monitorization and sedation protocol is the routine management of outpatient
      colonoscopies and gastroscopies in our institution.

      For this study the patients' anxiety levels are evaluated with the STAI score. This is not an
      intervention but an evaluation of the patients. Drug dosing or sedation management are not
      adjusted according to the anxiety scores but are calculated with the patients' weight.

      During the procedure:

        -  hemodynamic parameters

        -  the total propofol dosage

        -  the number of TCI interventions

        -  complications (respiratory depression, need for ventilation, nausea, vomiting,
           laryngospasm, and agitation)

        -  the procedure duration

        -  surgeon satisfaction with sedation instrument scores are recorded.

      These collected data are studies to determine a correlation between the propofol dose and the
      pre-procedural anxiety of the patients.
