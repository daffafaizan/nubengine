    
      Exercise capacity is a strong predictor for mortality, exacerbations and health-related
      quality of life (HRQL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
      1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-min STS test) is a promising exercise capacity test that is
      simple to conduct and requires few resources.

      This study will provide an in-depth validation of the 1-min STS test, specifically evaluating
      the tests reliability, validity, responsiveness to change and minimal clinically important
      difference. The study will also assess the predictive properties of the 1-min STS test with
      regards to detecting exacerbations, as well as identify patterns of physical activity and
      patient-reported symptoms of exacerbations.
