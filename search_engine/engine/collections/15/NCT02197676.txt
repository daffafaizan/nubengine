      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be administered subcutaneous SGI-110 at 60mg/m²/d
      one time daily for 5 days. Each cycle will last 28 days with SGI-110 starting on day 1 of
      each cycle. Patients will receive at least 9 cycles unless overt progression is documented.
      (Overt progression will be defined by the presence of more than 30% marrow blasts and
      doubling of marrow blast percentage from onset of SGI-110). Dose reduction to 45 and even 30
      mg/m²/d will be made in case of toxicity.

      Patients with Complete Remission (CR), Partial Remission (PR), marrow CR, Hematological
      Improvement (HI) or stable disease (SD) after 6 Cycles of therapy (IWG 2006 criteria) may
      receive 3 additional cycles. Response will be re-evaluated after 9 cycles. Patients with no
      response (NR) to treatment after 9 cycles will be withdrawn from the protocol. Patients with
      progression at any time will be withdrawn from the protocol after the last treatment Cycle.
