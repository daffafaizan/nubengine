      subject know that the subject is taking the experimental drut), pilot study to evaluate the
      effects of sildenafil on pulmonary artery pressures in patients with portopulmonary
      hypertension.

      Patients who are diagnosed with PTPH after having routine care right heart catheterization
      will be asked if they are interested in participating. Approximately ten subjects will be
      enrolled. Subjects will undergo the following experimental procedures as part of their
      participation in this study: blood laboratory tests, medical history, physical exam, inhaled
      nitric oxide test, study drug (sildenafil) administration, and a pill count.

      Sildenafil will be given to these patients 3 times a day for a 12 week period to see if the
      study drug can lower their pulmonary artery pressures by at least 25%.
