        -  Determine the incidence of venous thromboembolic events (i.e., deep vein thrombosis
           and/or pulmonary embolism) in patients undergoing chemotherapy for solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter survey.

      Patients undergo observation beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy and continuing for up to 3
      months in the absence of symptomatic, confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism;
      use of anticoagulant therapy for more than 5 days as curative treatment; or initiation of
      thromboprophylaxis for any reason. Patients undergo bilateral compression ultrasound of the
      lower limbs at baseline and at 3 months (or at an earlier timepoint, if indicated).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
