      expended. It is hypothesized that regular amounts of physical activity may be important in
      helping individuals more accurately regulate energy balance. More research is needed to
      understand the impact of a physically active lifestyle on energy regulation capabilities
      Therefore, this study looks at sedentary college aged males compared to active college aged
      males when looking at two different sessions of energy expenditure, one exercise session and
      one resting session, and their energy and macronutrient intake after these sessions. The
      sessions will take place in the morning where each participant will exercise or rest and then
      be allowed to eat from a buffet ad libitum, where acute energy and macronutrient intake will
      be assessed.

      The following hypotheses are proposed:

        -  Individuals who regularly engage in physical activity will more accurately respond to an
           energy deficit caused by an acute period of physical activity by increasing intake at a
           subsequent meal.

        -  Individuals who do not regularly engage in physical activity (sedentary individuals)
           will be less sensitive to accurately regulate energy balance and will not respond to an
           energy deficit caused by a period of acute physical activity.
