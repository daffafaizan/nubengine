    
      Up to 1000 patients 12 to 40 years of age inclusive will be enrolled to have 870 patients in
      the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and 579 patients in the per-protocol (PP)
      population. The primary inclusion criteria are the presence of ≥ 20 inflammatory lesions
      (papules and pustules) and ≥ 25 non-inflammatory lesions (opened and closed comedones) and ≤
      2 nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and cysts) on the face and an Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or 4.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatments (Test,
      Reference or Placebo) on Visit 1. Patients will be instructed to apply the first treatment on
      the evening of enrollment into the study and then continue to apply once daily for the next
      83 days (for a total 84 days). Patients will attend the following scheduled clinic visits:

        -  Visit 1 - Screening/Baseline: Day 1

        -  Visit 2 - Interim Visit: Day 28 ± 4

        -  Visit 3 - Interim Visit: Day 56 ± 4

        -  Visit 4 - End of Study: Day 85 ± 4 Efficacy evaluations will be based on dermatological
           assessments in the clinic. The primary statistical analyses of interest are (1) the
           percent change from baseline to Week 12 in the number of inflamed (papules/pustules)
           lesions and non-inflamed (open and closed comedones) lesions. In addition, patients will
           also be evaluated by the Investigator to determine "Clinical Success" or "Clinical
           Failure" at Week 12
