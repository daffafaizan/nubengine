      vulnerability to stressors. It is associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.
      Within the geriatric population, frailty is common and a known predictor of adverse outcomes.
      The usefulness of a frailty assessment as an outcome measure in critically ill patients of
      all ages needs to be evaluated. This study evaluates whether frailty has an effect on outcome
      of critically ill patients.

      Muscle weakness predicts outcome of ICU patients but is hard to determine in the ICU since
      the measurement is volition dependent. Muscle mass correlates with muscle weakness and can be
      assessed objectively. This study evaluates the consequences of reduced muscle mass or
      sarcopenia on the outcome of critically ill patients.

      In addition, muscle wasting in the ICU may predict persistent functional disability. This
      study aims to examine muscle wasting of critically ill patients on the surgical ICU.
