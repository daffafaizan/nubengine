      individuals with chronic SCI. The primary aim is to study whether different dosages (24'000
      IU/month or 48'000 IU/month) of vitamin D supplementation over 12 months will lead to
      differences in vitamin D status as well as differences in several other outcomes. The use of
      both a placebo group and a natural time course group as reference groups supports the
      evaluation of dose-response effects of vitamin D supplementation on the primary outcome
      (vitamin D status) and secondary outcomes (including bone density and mood) that are not only
      supported by randomized controlled trial standards but also informative in clinical practice.
