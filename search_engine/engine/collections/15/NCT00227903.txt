      clinics, comparing a manualized brief advice (closely approximating "treatment as usual") to
      manualized motivationally enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy. Treatment providers are
      obstetrical nurses. Therapy patients are taught skill sets designed to enhance motivation to
      abstain from drugs of abuse, as well as designed to prevent relapse during the perinatal
      period. It is our hypothesis that therapy patients will be more successful at achieving
      stated study aims than those receiving brief advice.
