      age-related macular degeneration (AMD), precise characterization of the disease phenotype
      remains elusive. In both diseases, much of the focus has necessarily been on the loss of cone
      function, since visual fields, acuity and contrast sensitivity are typically measured under
      photopic conditions. In RP, we need a greater understanding of patterns of rod loss since
      most disease-causing mutations affect primarily rods. In AMD, recent findings have shown that
      scotopic sensitivity can be much more affected than conventional photopic measurements such
      as visual acuity. For patients, however, it is difficult to maintain stable fixation,
      especially when central vision is compromised. A new fundus-guided microperimeter, the MP-3S,
      has been developed by Nidek, Inc. to circumvent this problem. The investigators will evaluate
      the value of this device for following rod and cone loss in patients with either RP or AMD.
