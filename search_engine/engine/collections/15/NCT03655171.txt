      unmarked motion feature identification and quantitative analysis based on the video were
      conducted.

      The investigators have collected standardized motor function videos of patients with
      Parkinson's disease from outpatient clinics and follow-up since August 2017. Based on the
      UPDRS III motor function test, the investigators screened five pattern actions that are both
      disease-characteristic and easy to visualize, including finger tapping, hand movements,
      pronation-supination movements of hands and gait test. With the assistance of the artificial
      intelligence team, the characteristic value quantification (frequency, distance, angle, etc.)
      of the above pattern actions has been initially implemented. Considering that the
      characteristic values of the pattern action under the identification of video are all
      continuous variables and cannot be directly compared with the discrete UPDRS rating scale,
      the investigators initially explored the construction of deep learning algorithm based on
      UPDRS rating in the previous work to verify the effectiveness of video analysis in motor
      function evaluation.

      In this study, the investigators plan to include patients with Parkinson's disease with
      different disease severity and analyse the consistency between UPDRS scores evaluated by
      specialists of movement disorders and video quantification score. The results of this study
      will hopefully lay a good foundation for launching a large-scale, multi-centre clinical trial
      in the future.
