    
      This is an open prospective study of a single, low dose (0.5 mg/kg) intravenous (IV) Ketamine
      in 10 adolescent subjects admitted to Nationwide Childrens Hospital following a serious
      suicide attempt and who meet criteria for major depression or bipolar disorder I, current
      episode depressed. Subjects will be recruited via the psychiatry consult service, evaluated
      on the floor and if eligible and consent is obtained, transferred to the PACU for IV Ketamine
      infusion. Following infusion and when PACU discharge criteria are met, subjects will be
      transferred back to their floor for medical and psychiatric monitoring until they can be
      transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for additional care. Subjects will be
      transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for continued psychiatric care as part of their
      routine psychiatric care via the consult team. The research team will follow-up by telephone
      one week and four weeks after Ketamine injection to collect additional information about the
      patient's overall course and response.
