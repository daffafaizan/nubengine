      enrollment coupled with contemporaneous biosamples within 90 days prior to enrollment and up
      to 90 days before or 4-90 days after the biopsy. We estimate that at least 50 of the
      continuing pediatric participants will be due for a standard of care liver biopsy at the time
      of their enrollment into the pediatric Database 2 study, and will, as a result, also have a
      liver biopsy and contemporaneous biosamples.
