      (children show an increase, adolescents a decrease in synapse density) larger diurnal changes
      in children are expected compared to adolescents concerning brain metabolites and structural
      markers. These cortical changes in synapse density are thought to be reflected in
      electrophysiological markers in the sleep EEG (children show a higher slow wave activity,
      adolescents a reduced slow wave activity). With the modulation of the deep (slow wave) sleep
      by playing short, low volume tones, the investigators want to test if there is a causal
      relationship between slow wave sleep and markers of cortical plasticity.
