      functional domain and disruptions in this domain have been associated with a range of
      psychiatric disorders. Saccadic eye movement tasks have been used to assess individual
      differences in the cognitive control of attention and alterations in psychiatric disorders.
      Recent evidence suggests that the hypothalamic neuropeptide Oxytocin (OXT) may modulate
      attention allocation and regulation. To this end the present randomized between-subject
      placebo-controlled experiment examined whether intranasal OXT modulates behavior in an
      eye-tracking saccade / anti-saccade paradigm in healthy male subjects. The paradigm used
      non-social (neutral shape) as well as social (happy, sad, angry, fear, and neutral faces)
      stimuli to explore emotion-specific effects of OXT.
