      potent anti-cancer agents for solid and hematologic malignancies. Several pre-clinical
      reports have shown a good anti-tumor activity in different HCC models and first reports from
      clinical trials in HCC promise a good efficacy in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell
      growth. mTOR inhibition has also been shown to enhance the activity of other cytotoxic
      agents.

      Sorafenib also interferes with tumor cell survival, proliferation and angiogenesis by
      inhibiting molecular pathways independent of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. We therefore expect
      an at least additive effect by inhibiting two parallel but independent intracellular pathways
      in HCC tumor cells that will prolong overall survival and time to progression.
