    
      This is an open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the treatment,
      participants are receiving), single-dose, single-center, parallel group (a medical research
      study comparing the response in 2 or more groups of participants receiving different
      interventions) study. This study consists of a Screening Period (within 21 days prior to
      admission into the study center on Day -1), followed by 2 treatment periods for ESRD
      participants (Group A) (Treatment Period 1: rivaroxaban will be administered 2 hours before
      the start of a 4-hour hemodialysis session on Day 1; Treatment Period 2: rivaroxaban will be
      administered 3 hours after the completion of a 4-hour hemodialysis session on Day 1), or 1
      treatment period for healthy participants (Group B) (single oral dose of rivaroxaban will be
      administered on Day 1). Each treatment period will have duration of 4 days. For ESRD
      participants, the 2 treatments periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 7
      days and a maximum of 14 days. The total study duration for ESRD participants is
      approximately 43 days. The total study duration for healthy participants is approximately 25
      days. Blood samples will be collected to assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
