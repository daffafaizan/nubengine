      cancer, and even eye-sparing therapy with radiation treatment often leads to significant loss
      of vision. Major challenges to providing care to patients with uveal melanoma include the
      inability to accurately predict long-term vision in an eye treated with radiation, due to a
      poor understanding of the nature of radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy. Optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) is a commonly used ophthalmic imaging modality that provides
      precise, real-time data in vivo in a non-invasive manner. Our research group has recently
      developed two novel functional OCT technologies: (1) Doppler OCT to quantitatively measure
      total retinal flow and (2) OCT angiography technology to map optic nerve head, retinal, and
      choroidal blood flow with unprecedented accuracy. The investigators believe this technology
      can be utilized to improve understanding of radiation-induced vascular changes in the optic
      nerve and retina that cause vision loss in patients treated with radiation, as well as
      provide a tool to monitor tumor response to treatment.

      In this study, the investigators intend to utilize these novel functional OCT technologies to
      describe the changes over time in optic nerve head and retinal blood flow after I-125
      radiation therapy, and to evaluate the relationship between changes in flow and decreased
      vision. The investigators will also study the association between changes in flow and the
      total radiation doses received by the optic nerve head and macula, which varies based upon
      tumor location and size.
