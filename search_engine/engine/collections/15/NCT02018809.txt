    
      We propose to complete a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 200 subjects with medication
      treated diabetes and evidence of poor adherence to a statin medication (<70% medication
      possession ratio determined through pharmacy records; no combination meds). Study subjects
      will use an electronic pill bottle (GlowCap) to store their statin medication. Study subjects
      will identify potential Medication Adherence Partners (MAPs) who can receive information
      about their adherence patterns at enrollment. For the 90-day trial, subjects will be
      randomized to: 1) the subject's MAP receives daily notification about whether subject took
      statin; 2) the subject's MAP receives weekly about how often the subject took statin during
      previous week; 3) the subject's MAP receives notification if the subject missed >2
      consecutive daily doses of statin; and 4) usual care (GlowCaps without any notifications).
      The primary outcome will be the percent of statin doses taken during the study as measured by
      the GlowCaps. The secondary outcome will be subjects' statin medication possession ratio
      (MPR) during the study.
