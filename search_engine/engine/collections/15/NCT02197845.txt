      centers and one federally qualified health center, plans a two-phase demonstration, first of
      improvement in the percentage of adults with SCD who are in SCD specialty care (Phase I),
      then of improvement in adherence to HU of eligible SCD adults (Phase II). Both phases will
      use existing academic SCD providers, and an innovative, multimodal strategy, featuring
      specially trained SCD patient navigators (PNs), that addresses barriers to care and to HU
      use. In Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing PNs to overcome patient
      access barriers to SCD care. In Phase II we will test the efficacy of PNs for overcoming
      barriers to acceptance of and adherence with HU therapy. Patients will be randomized to a PN
      arm or to a usual care arm. Providers will implement NIH guidelines for HU eligibility and
      prescribing in both arms. All HU eligible patients will be offered HU at each clinical visit.
      Among patients prescribed HU, if a maximum tolerated dose (MTD, defined in end points) has
      not been reached, providers will dose escalate every 8-12 weeks to MTD, rather than to
      clinical effect, before declaring treatment success or failure.

      This project will be critically important and impactful by demonstrating the feasibility of a
      statewide community-based strategy to assist vulnerable SCD adults in obtaining SCD specialty
      care and likely prolonging life, a model that other states could adopt.
