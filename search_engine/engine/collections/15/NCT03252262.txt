      system and wellness coaching program was effective in promoting and sustaining increased
      physical activity and improved mood, health status and quality of life. A repeated measures,
      secondary analysis design was the selected approach Data from 161 participants were used to
      test the hypotheses. After one year, the sample had improvement with increased socialization
      while physical activity level fluctuated over time suggestive of a seasonality effect. Paired
      t-tests and repeated measures analysis revealed no statistically significant improvement in
      physical activity level, mood, health status or quality of life. Vitalize 360 provides a
      unique opportunity to guide elders in selecting personal goals that align with their
      assessment results and develop an action plan for goal achievement. When used among
      vulnerable and frail elders, some modifications are needed to provide sustained, favorable
      outcomes.
