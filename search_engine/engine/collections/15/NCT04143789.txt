      AP-002 in humans, defined as the dose at which the plasma concentration of AP-002, as
      measured by Ga, is 300-500 ng/mL and which is at or below the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD),
      to use in the clinical setting of advanced or recurrent solid tumors. This will be followed
      by a Phase 2 expanded cohort treated at the PAD, to estimate the efficacy of AP-002 in
      patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer, NSCLC and prostate cancer.

      Patients will receive AP-002 orally, once daily for 14 days of a 21 day cycle.
