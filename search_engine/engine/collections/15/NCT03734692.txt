      use an IP neoadjuvant approach (IP chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP rintatolimod and
      IV infusion of pembrolizumab), followed by interval cytoreduction (usually laparoscopically)
      of residual tumor. Cytoreduction will occur approximately 4 weeks after the fourth treatment
      cycle. Post-surgery the investigators will consolidate with 2 additional courses of same
      chemo-immunotherapy regimen. Catheter will be removed 12 weeks after the last treatment. All
      surgical procedures, if done laparoscopically, are outpatient and will yield up to three
      serial biopsies of the tumor sites: 1) at catheter placement; 2) at interval cytoreduction
      which consists of removal of any visible tumor sites and the site biopsied initially whether
      tumor is present or not; 3) at catheter removal, when site of first tumor biopsy will be
      re-biopsied for pathologic response.
