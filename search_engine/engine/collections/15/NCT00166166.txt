      oxide (NO), prostacyclin, carbon monoxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor
      (EDHF) that contribute to vasodilator tone, and to inhibition of platelet activation and
      inflammation. EDHF release is stimulated by receptor-dependent agonists such as acetylcholine
      and bradykinin (BK), and leads to hyperpolarization of the underlying smooth muscle cells
      presumably by opening Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Indirect pharmacological evidence suggests
      that EDHF is a cytochrome P450-derived arachidonic acid metabolite, presumably an epoxide.
      Although the pivotal role of NO to conduit vessel dilation in response to acute increases in
      shear stress is well known, its' contribution to dilation with sustained increases in flow
      are minimal, and may be due to EDHF release.
