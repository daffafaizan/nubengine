    
      Design: A three-arm partially blinded randomized controlled trial of VOA training versus
      remote-based expert instruction versus control.

      Setting: Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre, Montreal
      Neurological Institute.

      Participants: Eligible first- and second-year medical students from across the province of
      Quebec.

      Task: Complete removal of a simulated tumour - distinguishable by colour and haptic
      properties - with minimal bleeding and damage to surrounding healthy brain using two surgical
      instruments (Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator and Bipolar pincers) of the NeuroVR (CAE
      Healthcare) surgical simulator.

      Intervention: A single 75-minute training session, including six virtual subpial tumour
      resection attempts (five simple practice scenarios and one complex realistic scenario) with
      assessment and feedback from either:

        1. the VOA intelligent tutoring system (Group 2) or

        2. a remote-based expert instructor (Group 3)

           Both compared to:

        3. control group (Group 1) that receives no assessment or performance feedback.

      To our knowledge this will be the first study to compare the effectiveness of an AI-powered
      intelligent tutoring system to expert instruction in the context of medical and surgical
      virtual reality simulation and assess the emotional response to such instruction. This study
      aims to begin to identify successful approaches to use this innovative technology in the
      medical educational curriculum and improve patient outcomes by augmenting safety, efficiency
      and competency of surgeons and other healthcare providers.
