      to a translational or rotational movement of our head. The post-rotational nystagmus test
      (PRN) assesses the integrity of this reflex, thus assessing the perception of the vestibular
      system. This system has an important role in our balance, stabilization of the visual field
      when our head moves, awareness of the position of our head in space, postural control and
      functions of the Autonomous Nervous System.

      The duration of this reflex after administering this test has been widely studied in children
      from 2 months to 12 years and 11 months of age. However, there is a knowledge gap from that
      age that the present study seeks to address. This article aims to explore the use of the PRN
      test for adolescent and adults, to prove if the duration of the VOR is longer in these
      population than in children. It will be also recollected personal data to study whether
      exposure to vestibular input influences its reactivity and perception.
