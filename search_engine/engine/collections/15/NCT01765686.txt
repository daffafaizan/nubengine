      haemostasis. The newer generation energy devices have several advantages over older machines.
      First, the newer devices deliver more focussed thermal application and thus are less likely
      to cause collateral injury to surrounding healthy tissue. This is particularly relevant in
      thyroid surgery because the thyroid gland is in close proximity to vital nerves that control
      our airway and glands that regulate calcium metabolism. Secondly, the newer energy devices
      have multifunctional properties and are capable of sealing, blunt dissection, grasping and
      dividing tissue. This is advantageous in thyroid surgery as the operating field has many
      narrow areas within and the potential reduction in the exchange of instruments facilitates
      surgery.

      Currently, two of these newer generation energy devices are available for use in Singapore
      General Hospital and National Cancer Centre Singapore. Both devices are similarly priced; one
      is based on an ultrasonic vibrating blade (UCSD) to cut and coagulate tissue while the other
      uses bipolar electrical energy and pressure to form a seal and a micro blade to divide the
      sealed tissue (EBVS). To date, clinical studies comparing both devices have only been done on
      animal models and focus on sealing times in animal blood vessels.

      We aim to compare the effectiveness of these two newer generation energy devices in thyroid
      surgery by looking at the incidence of post surgical complications, post operative drainage
      as well as the ease of use as reflected in the operating time.
