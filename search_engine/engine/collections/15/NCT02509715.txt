      intraoperative nerve monitoring(IONM) is a widely used intervention. In this study
      investigators will compare conventional surgery with IONM used surgery. Randomly chosen half
      of the patients will be operated with IONM. Vagus, recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves
      will be monitored during surgery and measured for nerve integrity . Rest of the patients will
      be operated with standard conventional method. All participants will be analyzed with a
      computer program for their voice quality preoperatively and postoperatively at 14th day of
      surgery.
