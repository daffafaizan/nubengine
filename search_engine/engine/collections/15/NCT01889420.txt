      myeloma, and everolimus has been shown to have single agent activity in relapsed myeloma, it
      seems reasonable to combine these two active drugs in patients with relapsed/refractory
      disease. Given that low dose dexamethasone dramatically improved the response rate of
      pomalidomide, this drug will be added to the combination.
