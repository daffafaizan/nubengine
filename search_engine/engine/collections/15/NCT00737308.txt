      advantages are high fracture resistance, excellent biocompatibility, moderate opacity, etc.
      Because the increase in demand for more esthetic restoration, zirconia becomes more popular
      for use as a core material for all-ceramic systems. Its properties have been investigated
      extensively in many in vitro studies. However, clinical performance of zirconia-based
      restorations would require a period of time before the results can be assessed. Currently,
      there are not much results regarding clinical performance of zirconia-based prosthesis and
      more information are required for future research.
