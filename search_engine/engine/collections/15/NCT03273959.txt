      the functional capacity of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, hospitalized, in
      the stage of exacerbation of the disease.

      In the first 48 hours of hospitalization patients and their caregivers will be invited to
      participate in the study. We will start with the following evaluations: Six-minute walk test,
      spirometry, physical fitness and health test (includes: walking, abdominal, flexibility and
      abdominal circumference), clinical score of shwachman kulczycki and Collected data from
      medical records.

      After the initial evaluation the patient will be randomized to control group or intervention
      group. The control group will receive the conventional physiotherapy by the assistance team
      and the recreation service by the physical education. The intervention group will receive the
      same assistance plus the intervention with the exercise protocol five times a week supervised
      by a health professional. The exercise protocol includes: Punching, climbing and descending
      steps, sit and stand, push-ups on the wall, stationary gait, abdominal, physiotherapy bridge,
      jumping on the floor ladder, cycling on the cycle ergometer and stretching.

      At hospital discharge both groups will repeat the initial tests. The hypothesis is that the
      intervention group showed an improvement in functional capacity compared to the control
      group.
