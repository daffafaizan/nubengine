           followed up until discharge from hospital or death (for a maximum of 28 days). A minimal
           neonatal sepsis dataset will determine (i) clinical presentations, associated features
           and risk factors (for example prematurity, SGA (small for gestational age)), (ii) rates
           of culture-positivity among babies with sepsis, (iii) current empirical treatment
           approaches (antimicrobials selected, dose, etc) (iv) outcomes of sepsis, including
           death, need for intensive care interventions and recurrence of sepsis during the
           follow-up period. Microbiological samples will be taken from sterile sites, blood and
           CSF, as clinically indicated and will be processed locally.

        2. NeoBSI: Consecutive babies with positive blood/CSF cultures and sepsis will be
           recruited. Patient inclusion will be based on identification of relevant specified
           bacteria from blood / CSF cultures. In addition to the data collected for NeoSEPSIS,
           information will be collected on the isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility
           patterns.
