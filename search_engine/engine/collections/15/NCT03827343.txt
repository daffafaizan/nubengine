      immunotherapy is the toxicity profile, which differs from chemotherapy-based strategies and
      can be associated with inflammatory responses and/or autoimmune type reactions resulting from
      activation of the immune system. Referred to as immune related adverse events (irAEs), these
      adverse events may require systemic immunosuppression or have other consequences and present
      unique management challenges. Specific to CAR T-cell and other adoptive cell therapies is the
      constellation of symptoms referred to as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can range in
      severity from mild to severe, and can require both cytokine directed blockade and/or systemic
      immunosuppression to ameliorate the side effects. While side effects may be unique to each
      individual immunotherapy, and may also be patient specific, cumulative experience will help
      to inform toxicity profiles and improve management of side effect and overall outcomes.

      Given the number of immunotherapeutic approaches at the NCI, the primary goal of this
      protocol is to facilitate retrospective chart review of various immunotherapy trials at the
      NCI used in the treatment of cancer to comprehensively study toxicity profiles. This study
      will not involve the use of specimens or participant contact. All data that is needed has
      already been collected on the individual treatment protocols and is available in CRIS records
      or protocol specific databases.

      Data will only be collected from treatment protocols where the PI has given permission for
      use of the data on the trial the subject was enrolled on. This protocol will be amended to
      incorporate new research objectives and new protocols as necessary.
