    
      The purpose of this research study is to test an experimental treatment method for recurrent
      or progressive brain tumors in children aged from 0-22 years. The use of methotrexate and
      chemotherapy (topotecan and cyclophosphamide) is experimental in this study. This means that
      their use by themselves or together has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration for this usage. This study will attempt to determine via serial MRI scans if
      methotrexate administration into the lateral or fourth ventricle in combination with systemic
      intravenous topotecan and cyclophosphamide is effective in reducing tumor burden in the brain
      and spine for patients with recurrent or progressive brain tumors, including medulloblastoma,
      ependymoma, PNET (Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT),
      and other malignant embryonal tumors. In addition, the study will evaluate the toxicity of
      the above mentioned experimental treatment during a two-year progression-free survival and
      survival of children with recurrent malignant brain tumors.
