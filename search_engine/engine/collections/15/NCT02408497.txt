      primarily compare prostate motion between different treatment duration for IMRT and VMAT. The
      radiation therapy is to be delivered using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or
      Volumetric Modulated Arc therapy (VMAT) with the aid of volumetric image guidance to ensure
      accuracy and real-time 3D ultrasound images as observational record of the prostate motion.
      All the recruited patients are prescribed and treated with either VMAT or IMRT treatment. In
      order to simulate the behaviour of prostate motion in an IMRT scenario, the group of VMAT
      patients will be required to remain in treatment position for an additional 7 minutes
      depending on techniques used (once a week).

      In order to assess the level of acceptance of the treatment position, responses to the same
      comfort survey for the current treatment position (i.e. using leg immobiliser) by a cohort of
      60 patients treated in another IGRT treatment room will be used as the baseline. In addition,
      RTT satisfaction questionnaire will also be administered to assess the handling of the new
      immobilizer.

      Acute toxicity will be measured at preset intervals using CTCAE version 3.0 and as will
      International prostate symptom score (IPSS) questionnaire which focuses on urinary symptoms.
      Symptoms or toxicities reported from this study is relevant for patients treated with IMRT or
      VMAT with full bladder protocol.
