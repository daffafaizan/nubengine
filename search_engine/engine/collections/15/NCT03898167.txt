      and/or unacceptable to many women. Using mailed self-sampling kits to test for high-risk
      human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes cervical cancer, may overcome multiple
      barriers to clinic-based screening. This study is a randomized controlled trial to compare
      the effectiveness of three outreach interventions to increase primary screening participation
      and clinical follow-up among underscreened women a in a safety net health system. The three
      strategies that will be evaluated are: 1) telephone recall; 2) telephone recall with mailed
      self-sample HPV testing kits; and 3) telephone recall with mailed self-sample HPV testing
      kits and patient navigation.
