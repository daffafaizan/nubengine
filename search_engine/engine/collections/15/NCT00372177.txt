      ensure a fast distribution within the body. The study will be performed as an open clinical
      trial due to the fact that the applied radiation has to be documented; the use of "placebo"
      radiation would be unethical.

      It is expected, that the new antibody fragment with its radioactive linkage will display an
      image of the activity distribution of the disease. Due to the fact that only patients with
      active disease have to be imaged and, to allow for comparison of the activity and the
      clinical distribution of the disease, this proof of concept study (phase I study) will be
      performed in patients with active disease. Healthy volunteers could not display an activity
      pattern of the disease. Furthermore, it seems to be unethical to use volunteers for studies
      with radioactivity with such a risk/benefit ratio (radiation risks vs. missing chance of
      display of tissue distribution) in a proof of concept study.
