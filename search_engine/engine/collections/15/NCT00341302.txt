      HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-exposed, uninfected children at participating clinical
      sites in Latin America where the following are available: 1) antiretrovirals (ARVs) for
      treatment of HIV-infected women and for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of
      HIV; and 2) infant formula. We will describe the utilization of interventions related to
      decreasing the risk of MTCT, including ARV prophylaxis, cesarean section before labor and
      before ruptured membranes, and complete avoidance of breastfeeding. We will describe receipt
      of maternal ARV regimens and determine rates of MTCT of HIV. This study will describe
      maternal adverse events during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition, the study
      will describe child outcomes potentially related to in utero and early postnatal exposure to
      ARVs. HIV-infected women will be evaluated antepartum, intrapartum, 6 months postpartum and
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years after delivery. HIV-exposed, uninfected children will
      be evaluated for up to 5 years of follow-up.
