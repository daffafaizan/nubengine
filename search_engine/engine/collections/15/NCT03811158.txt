      between heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) versus unheated high-flow oxygen
      mask (UHFOM) in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients
      with post-extubation respiratory support. This is the first clinical trial to investigate and
      analysis the variations of cardiopulmonary parameters and Edi level between HHHFNC and UHFOM
      in adult patients.
