      after the final infant vaccinations at approximately 13 months of age, and secondary
      objectives include antibody response following meningococcal B and C vaccines, tetanus,
      diphtheria and pertussis vaccines. In addition, the effect of maternal pertussis vaccination
      in pregnancy on infant immune response to vaccines, the prevalence of carriage of
      pneumococcal serotypes at 12 and 18 months of age and reactogenecity following each vaccine
      will be assessed.

      200 healthy children who have not yet received their routine infant immunisations will be
      enrolled between 8 and 12 weeks old. Participants will be randomised into one of two groups
      with differing vaccine schedules. Children in both groups will receive their routine
      immunisations with the following changes: the addition of 3 doses of a meningococcal B
      vaccine at 2, 4 and 12 months and a meningococcal C vaccine at 12 months only (instead of a
      dose at 3 and 12 months). The 2 groups will differ by the number of doses of the 13-valent
      pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13); to be given either at 2, 4, and 12 months of age (as currently
      given in the routine schedule) or at 3 and 12 months of age.

      Each participant will have 2 blood tests: at 5 and 13 months of age, and 2 nose swabs: at 12
      and 18 months of age to address the objectives of the study. Parents will be asked to
      complete a health diary to record any adverse events in the 7 days following vaccinations and
      a continuous thermometer (ibutton) will be used to record the temperature for 24 hours after
      each vaccination.

      If the blood samples at 13 months reveal antibody titres that are below the level indicative
      of protection, a recommendation will be made for booster vaccinations.
