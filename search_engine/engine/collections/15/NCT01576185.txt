      I. To determine the rate of engraftment of pediatric FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase-3
      (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples in NOD scid
      gamma (NSG) mice.

      II. To determine the efficacy of treatment of FLT3-ITD xenografts with tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors.

      OUTLINE:

      Human acute myeloid leukemia cells are injected into NSG mice. Mice are then treated with
      sorafenib or quizartinib via gavage once daily for 28 days. Peripheral blood and tissue
      samples are collected biweekly or weekly and analyzed for the presence of human CD45+ and
      CD33+ cells by quantitative flow cytometry.
