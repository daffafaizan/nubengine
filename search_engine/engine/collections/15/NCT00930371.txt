      liver and associated inflammation. This condition is strongly associated with obesity,
      insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Diets high in saturated fat result in fatty liver,
      insulin resistance and liver injury in animal models. Dietary composition may contribute not
      only to hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance but may also promote inflammation
      leading to chronic liver disease in humans. This study will test the hypothesis that a diet
      high in fat and saturated fat contributes to liver fat accumulation, insulin resistance and
      inflammation by comparing the effects of a four-week, weight stable high fat/high saturated
      fat diet (55% calories from fat/25% saturated fat) with a four-week, weight stable low
      fat/low saturated fat diet (20% fat/8% saturated fat) in overweight and obese subjects.
