    
      This clinical investigation is a controlled, open label, prospective Post Market Clinical
      Follow-Up, single-center clinical study whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery
      that previously underwent refractive surgery prior to being screened will have bilateral
      implantation of trifocal intraocular lens FineVision POD L GF (PhysIOL, Li√®ge, Belgium).

      The study purpose is to collect clinical data on visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and
      patient reported outcomes obtained on patients with cataracts and/or suffering from
      presbyopia that underwent refractive surgery prior to the IOL implantation.

      The device under investigation (FineVision POD L GF) is a trifocal glistening-free
      hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL
      sa/nv. The IOL will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients
      suffering from cataract development.

      In total 28 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and receive a bilateral
      implantation of FineVision POD L GF intraocular lens.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 9 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 6 postoperative) over a period of 6 months.
