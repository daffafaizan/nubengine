      activity of choroidal neovascularization in AMD, while the therapeutic use of antiangiogenic
      agents is almost systematically in the form of intraocular injections.

      The therapeutic response is observed anatomically and functionally only after 6 months of
      treatment. Several arguments in the literature suggest that the therapeutic response occurs
      earlier at the molecular level, as soon as the induction phase is complete (after 3 months of
      treatment). The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the ability of
      68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET imaging to demonstrate, in patients with unilateral AMD, a molecular
      therapeutic response to intraocular antiangiogenic injections at the end of the first phase.
      induction (after 3 months of treatment).
