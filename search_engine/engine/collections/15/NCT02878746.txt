      robot for 30 min per day for two weeks (10 sessions). For the conventional mirror therapy
      group, the investigators prepared the tasks for fine motor training. These tasks included
      more complicated tasks so that the participants would be interested in the tasks without the
      robot system.

      Before and after 10 sessions of the therapy, the investigators conduct functional
      evaluations: the Fugl-Meyer assessment scale of the upper extremity (FMA-UE), the modified
      Ashworth scale, the modified Barthel index of upper extremity (MBI-UE: personal hygiene,
      bathing, feeding, and dressing), and the Jebsen hand function test, hand power measurement,
      and hemispatial neglect test (line bisection test and Albert's test) with the same
      occupational therapist. The motor evoked potential was measured for the patients without the
      history of brain surgery or seizure.

      The investigators selected a thumb finding test (TFT) among various tools for assessing
      proprioception, because TFT is widely used and reliable. The TFT can be assessed, after
      confirming normal proprioception in the unaffected arm, by the patient touching the nose with
      their eyes closed while the examiner lifts the affected arm to eye level. The patient is then
      asked to grasp the thumb of the affected hand with the unaffected hand, and this is repeated.
      The examiner then places a hand over the patient's eyes and raises the patient's affected
      hand to well above the patient's head. The patient is then asked to grasp the thumb as
      before.
