      usage of massive endoprosthetic bone implants. The incidence of aseptic loosening is a major
      cause of prosthesis failure in these patients, exploring ways to reduce such failures would
      allow extending longevity of massive implants in a relatively young population.

      Current published literature stipulates that osteointegration could improve longevity of
      massive implants. Evidence suggests that usage of osteointegrated hydroxyapatite (HA) coated
      collar would reduce the incidence of aseptic loosening around the cemented intramedullary
      stem in distal femoral bone prosthesis
