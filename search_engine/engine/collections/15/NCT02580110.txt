      effects of 3 commonly used sweeteners on cardiometabolic risk markers, cognitive functions,
      and influences on gut microbiota composition. The subjects will consume each test product for
      14 days in a random order, separated by at least a two-week washout period. On the last day
      in each intervention period, i.e. at day fifteen, the last test portion will be consumed
      together with a standardized evening meal at 9.00 pm. Thereafter the subjects are fasting
      until arriving to the experimental unit. Upon arrival, test variables in blood will be
      determined at fasting and repeatedly for 3h postprandial a standardised breakfast served
      approximately at 8.00 am. Cognitive performance will be determined in the postprandial period
      with tests evaluating working memory capacity, selective attention, psychomotor reaction
      time, and executive functions. After each intervention period, faecal samples will be
      collected for characterization of gut microflora.
