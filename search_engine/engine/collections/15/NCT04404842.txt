      questions useful for the purpose of the study to all patients who belong to the clinic of the
      Dietetics and Clinical Nutrition, Internal Medicine and Endocrinology Unit, ICS Maugeri di

      subject to the execution of diagnostic-therapeutic procedures that are beneficial to the
      patient or performed for routine diagnostic procedures or previously prescribed by the
      general practitioner. The collected data will be entered in the Data Collected Form together
      with the laboratory tests.

      Therefore, all patients will receive the EVIDENCE Questionnaire which includes 19 items that
      investigate those factors that influence the production, absorption and intake of vitamin D:

        -  anthropometric data (weight, height, waist circumference, BMI),

        -  demographic information, such as latitude and phototype,

        -  dietary intake of vitamin D,

        -  health status and therapies,

        -  multivitamin or vitamin D supplementation,

        -  sun exposure habits according to the season, frequency and time of exposure, the body
           parts exposed, the sunscreens use and outdoor activities.

      The aim of the study is to develop a questionnaire useful in screening the adequacy of
      vitamin D concentration in the adult population and to produce evidence of construct validity
      and concurrent validity of the questionnaire itself.

      SAMPLE SIZE: Psychometric literature suggests enrolling around 5-10 subjects for each item.
      Considering the number of items in the questionnaire, equal to 19, the number of subjects to
      be enrolled will be approximately 190.
