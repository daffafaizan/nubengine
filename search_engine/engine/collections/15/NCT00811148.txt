    
      The mission of the Florida Center for Brain Tumor Research is to discover cures for brain
      tumors and develop innovative brain tumor treatment modalities by providing a central
      repository for brain tumor biopsies and clinical information from individuals throughout the
      state of Florida, improving brain tumor biomedical research programs within the state of
      Florida, facilitating funding opportunities, fostering collaboration with brain tumor
      research organizations and other institutions, and fostering improved technology transfer of
      brain tumor research findings into clinical trials and widespread public use.

      The Florida Center for Brain Tumor Research will collect and store left-over tissue that is
      not needed for medical care or diagnosis in a tissue bank in the Evelyn F. and William L.
      McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida. Tissue, medical information,
      cerebrospinal fluid, blood and answers to Quality of Life questionnaires will be stored and
      made available to researchers. Although developed for Florida, tumor tissue from all other
      states would be accepted.
