      of smartphones has opened up new possibilities which surpass the normal audio-only telephony.
      High quality and real-time video-telephony is now feasible. However until now this technology
      hasn't been deployed in the emergency respond service.

      In the hope of helping the detection of the cardiac arrest, offer the possibility to evaluate
      and correct via a video-instructed CPR (V-CPR) and to facilitate a fast localization of the
      emergency site, a new software (EmergencyEye®/RAMSES®) was developed which enables the
      dispatcher a video-telephony with the callers mobile terminal (smartphone) if suitable.

      This technology hasn't been tested in a randomized controlled trail yet and no data exists
      that shows if V-CPR in comparison to T-CPR and non-instructed CPR leads to a better bystander
      CPR-performance.
