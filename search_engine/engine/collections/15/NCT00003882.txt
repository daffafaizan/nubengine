      anhydrovinblastine in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. II. Assess the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive anhydrovinblastine IV over 1 hour
      on day 1. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of anhydrovinblastine is escalated in cohorts
      of 1-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose that at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
      Patients are followed at 1 month after treatment, and then monthly until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
