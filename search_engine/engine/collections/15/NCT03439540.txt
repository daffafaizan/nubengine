      cardiometabolic risk factors, mineral content, and lifestyle in obese women.

      In previous research it was found that the Plantago maxima extract counteracts the
      development of adipose tissue in rats on a high-fat diet. In addition, antioxidative,
      anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic action of Plantago has been demonstrated. Moreover, it has
      been shown that Plantago influences lipolysis in obese mice and ameliorates metabolic
      processess in obese rats.

      The project is due to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation with selected Plantago
      species - Plantago major in obese patients on:

        -  the content of minerals in blood, hair and urine

        -  total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides blood concentration,

        -  blood glucose and insulin concentration,

        -  blood pressure,

        -  anthropometric parameters: body mass, body height, waist and hip circumferences

        -  body content measured by bioimpedance: % of fat tissue and % of muscle tissue

        -  quality of life

           70 subjects will be randomized into two groups and receive oral Plantago major extract
           (the first group) or oral placebo (the second group) once daily for 12 weeks. At
           baseline and at completion (after 12 weeks) fasting blood, urine and hair samples will
           be collected and abovementioned parameters will be measured.
