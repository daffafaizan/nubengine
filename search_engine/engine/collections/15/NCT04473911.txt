    
      -  This is a pilot study in subjects undergoing reduced-intensity haploidentical peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation who will receive graft-versus-host disease prevention
           with post-transplant cyclophosphamide, followed by sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and
           RGI-2001.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including evaluations and follow up visits.

        -  The standard of care drugs of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, radiation,
           sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil are all FDA approved.

             -  Eligible Participants will be placed in 1 of 2 groups, per physicians discretion:

             -  Regimen #1 :

                  -  Before stem cell transplant:Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + Radiation

                  -  After stem cell transplant: Cyclophosphamide + Sirolimus +Mycophenolate
                     mofetil + RGI-2001

             -  Regimen #2

                  -  Before stem cell transplant: fludarabine + melphalan + radiation

                  -  After stem cell transplant: cyclophosphamide + sirolimus +Mycophenolate
                     mofetil + RGI-2001

        -  A total of 20 participants will be enrolled to this trial

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved RGI-2001 as a treatment for
           any disease.
