      will be started after completion of detoxification, which will be done with Lorazepam using a
      front-loading regimen and a drug washout period of 5 half-lives (approx. 3 days) will be
      given so as not to interfere with the stimulation. Amitriptyline 12.5-25mg will be used as
      rescue medication for sleep difficulty. All subjects will receive psychosocial interventions
      related to craving management and relapse prevention as per treatment as usual but will not
      be prescribed any anti-craving agents during the period of the study.The Drug Relief V 2.0
      device will be installed after the detoxification and baseline fMRI scan. After installation,
      it will automatically provide neurostimulation at regular interval. It will be in situ for
      the next 15 days. After that, it will be removed temporarily for follow-up fMRI
      scanning.After completion of scanning a new device will be provided. The current research
      study will follow standard auricular PENFS procedures with established safety. The battery of
      the device will last for 15 days. Study subjects will be required to visit NIMHANS (National
      Institute of mental health and neurosciences) every 15 days to replace the old device for a
      new one. Till 3 months, all the devices will be provided free of costPatients will be
      followed up as usual on an outpatient basis, and the recent pattern of alcohol use will be
      inquired into. The follow-up will be done until the patient has a relapse or a maximum period
      of three months, whichever is earlier.
