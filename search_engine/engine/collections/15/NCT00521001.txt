      Primary

        -  Estimate the 9-week progression-free survival rate for patients with stage IV malignant
           melanoma treated with everolimus and temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate overall survival time.

        -  Evaluate time to disease progression.

        -  Evaluate confirmed response rate.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once a day on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33 and
      oral temozolomide once a day on days 8-12 for course 1 only. For course 2 and all subsequent
      courses, patients receive oral everolimus once a day on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26 and
      oral temozolomide once a day on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples
      are analyzed for relative numbers of T, B, and NK cells via flow cytometry, quantitative
      immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM, and IgA), Tetramer/ELISPOT CTL frequencies to CMV/EBV
      immunodominant antigens, V beta T cell spectratyping, and VEGF levels via ELISA.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.
