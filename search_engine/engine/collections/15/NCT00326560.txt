    
      This is a prospective, randomised, control trial of 40 participants. Twenty patients in each
      arm. Twenty patients undergo standard pterygium excision with the conjunctival autograft
      sutured. Twenty patients undergo pterygium surgery with Tisseel glue replacing sutures as a
      method of attaching the conjunctival autograft. Participants will be reviewed, selected, and
      consented on a pre-assessment day. Surgery will be performed 10 at a time on an all day
      surgery operating list. Randomisation of the surgery type will be done at the time of surgery
      after the pterygium has been excised and the autograft taken. One surgeon (R. Hall) will
      perform all of the procedures. Follow-up will occur at week 1, 2, 4, 26, 52. A questionnaire
      answered by participants will indicate their pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, and
      discomfort. There will be observation of any complications such as graft failure and
      recurrence rate. Photographs will be taken pre-op and post-op.
