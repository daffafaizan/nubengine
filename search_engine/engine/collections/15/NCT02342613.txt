    
      Primary Objectives:

        1. Feasibility of generating activated PTCy-MILs in patients with relapsed disease
           involving the bone marrow.

        2. Toxicity of PTCy-MILs, specifically the rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD within the first
           90 days after PTCy-MIL infusion.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Determination of an optimal safe dose for PTCy-MILs.

        2. Immunologic characterization of the PTCy-MIL product before and after expansion.

        3. Immune reconstitution after treatment with PTCy-MILs.

        4. Incidence and severity of chronic GVHD.

        5. Clinical responses (complete remissions, partial remissions, stable disease) as measured
           by criteria specific for the particular disease type.

        6. Progression-free and overall survival.
