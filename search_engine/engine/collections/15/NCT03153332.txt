      hepatic pathology. The secondary objective was to investigate whether 3D printing can improve
      the precision of surgical proposal.

      The dataset of patients were prepared and stratified into MDCT, 3D visualization system and
      3D printed liver model groups. The process started from MDCT scan image acquisition and moved
      through image segmentation and 3D rendering to end up with 3D printing.

      Surgical residents were assigned to three different groups to study different modes of
      patients' data. Residents were ask to state the liver segment in which the tumor resides and
      make a minimal resection proposal, including the tumor, the safety margin (1cm) and the
      dependent liver tissue. Residents were recommended to proceed in a classic way by resecting
      the whole liver segment. The time spent by each resident was also recorded in order to assess
      the quickness of comprehension and information transfer of the three different modes of
      presentation.
