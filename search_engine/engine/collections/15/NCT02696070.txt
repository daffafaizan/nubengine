    
      The study is multi-site, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study of the safety and
      efficacy of multi-dose Provant therapy to evaluate neuronal and vascular response in the
      treatment of subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive therapy with an active device or an identical inactive
      sham device. Subjects will treat at home twice daily for 60 days after which they will return
      to the clinic for final evaluations. Subjects will be evaluated at the research center for a
      Baseline/Enrollment visit and again at Day 61 where assessments for safety, concomitant
      medications, Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR), Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV), Skin Perfusion
      Pressures (SPP), and Skin Biopsy will be completed. Subjects will be contacted via telephone
      at Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42 to assess adherence, safety, and concomitant medications.
      Subjects will also complete a Response to Study Device form which will capture their daily
      pain score.
