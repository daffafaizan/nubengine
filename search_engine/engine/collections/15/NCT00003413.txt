      survival of patients with recently diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer
      receiving carmustine plus melphalan followed by consolidation therapy after having undergone
      surgical debulking. II. Evaluate the therapy related mortality associated with the
      autotransplant and the consolidation therapy in these patients. III. Evaluate the quality of
      life in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by stage (III vs IV) and volume of residual disease (less
      than 3 cm vs at least 3 cm). Approximately 10-15 days after surgery, patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until all peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      collections have been completed. Patients then receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2
      and melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -1. Peripheral blood stem cells are infused 24 hours
      after melphalan on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and
      continuing until granulocytes have recovered. Three months after the PBSC infusion, patients
      receive consolidation therapy with paclitaxel IV over 6 hours on day 2 and cisplatin IV over
      24 hours on day 3. Consolidation treatment is repeated every 3 months for a total of 4
      courses. Quality of life questionnaires are completed prior to PBSC transplant, before
      discharge after transplant, before each consolidation treatment, and 3 months after the last
      consolidation course. Patients are followed at least every 3 months for the first 2 years,
      and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 32 patients will be accrued into this study over 3-4 years.
