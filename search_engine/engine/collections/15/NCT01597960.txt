      this is particularly true of the beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. It
      is hoped that a better understanding of the value of this therapy will provide a sound
      scientific basis for including yoga in mainstream clinical practice. The investigators
      propose to study a group of 80 participants (40 Indian Asians and 40 Europeans) recruited
      from a cardiac rehabilitation programme in West London post-angioplasty as treatment for an
      acute coronary syndrome. Those who agree will undergo a series of baseline and follow-up
      measurements. 20 Indian Asians and 20 Europeans will be randomized to the yoga intervention
      plus their standard cardiac rehabilitation programme (usual care), and the remaining 20
      Indian Asians and 20 Europeans will be randomized to usual care alone. Baseline and follow-up
      measurements will be performed on all participants; these include: Demographic & health
      questionnaire, Lifestyle questionnaires focusing on diet and exercise, Fasting bloods
      sampling (for cardiovascular risk factors and markers), Saliva sampling (x 5 samples for
      salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase), Anthropometrics - height, weight and waist and hip
      circumference, Bioimpedence - measurement of total body fat, 3D and Doppler echocardiography,
      Carotid IMT, Resting brachial blood pressure, Central blood pressure (tonometery at the
      radial artery), Pulse Wave Velocity, 12 lead ECG, Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Combined
      24hr BP & ECG monitor, Accelerometer (3 days). In order to determine the acute effects of
      yoga the group randomised to the yoga intervention will also undergo a series of acute tests
      before and after their first yoga session. These include: Exercise capacity, Saliva sampling
      (x 5 samples for salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase) and combined 24hr BP & ECG monitor.
