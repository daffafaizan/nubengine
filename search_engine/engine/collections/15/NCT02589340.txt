    
      Plan: We will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period cross-over
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a novel treatment combination for
      LID in PD.

      Methods: Eligible subjects who consent to participate in this study will be randomized to one
      of two sequences of treatment interventions during the baseline visit. Each treatment
      sequence includes placebo and buspirone interventions. After randomization, each participant
      will titrate up on study drug for two weeks ending in 30 mg/day. At the end of each two week
      study drug period, the participant will then have a study visit at the VA Portland Health
      Care System that includes safety monitoring, adverse event monitoring, drug compliance, and
      several measurements of LID.
