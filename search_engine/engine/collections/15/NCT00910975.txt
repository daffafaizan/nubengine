      i.e., 48 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, needs to be further improved because of
      high costs and side-effects; in addition, the treatment is curative in only 50% of patients
      with genotype 1 of HCV. According to the current guidelines treatment with pegylated
      interferon and ribavirin is given for 24, 48 or 72 weeks depending on the time point when
      HCV-RNA becomes undetectable (week 4, 12 or 24). Patients with a very poor response may also
      be identified by applying a stopping rule at week 12 and 24. Still, most patients are treated
      for 48 weeks and a substantial number of those relapse after discontinuation.

      In this study, standard treatment is compared with "tailored treatment", when the treatment
      duration is based on the time point when HCV RNA level is calculated to be 1 copy/mL,
      according measurements of HCV RNA on day 14, 21, 28 and 49. This arm also includes an earlier
      stopping rule: If the HCV RNA does not decline significantly between day 14 and 28, treatment
      is stopped after 5 weeks.

      The advantage of tailored treatment is hypothesised to be that unnecessary side-effects and
      costs are avoided by an earlier identification of non-response and a treatment duration that
      is optimised for each patient.
