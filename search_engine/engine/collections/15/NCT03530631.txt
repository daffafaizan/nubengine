      each of the four conditions during four sequential weeks. Medication administered (Adderall
      vs. placebo) is crossed with instructional set (truth vs. deception) and participants'
      performance on neurocognitive tasks is compared across these groups. For example,
      participants are either given stimulant medication or placebo, and are either accurately told
      or inaccurately told that they received stimulant medication or placebo. Neuroimaging is
      being utilized to investigate whether participants' expectations regarding the benefits of
      stimulant medication affects their performance on neurocognitive tasks. The hypothesis of the
      study is that participants' expectations regarding stimulant medication will affect their
      performance on neurocognitive tasks, rather than the actual effect of the medication.
