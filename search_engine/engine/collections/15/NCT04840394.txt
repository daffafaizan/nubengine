    
      This clinical trial is a study of an experimental drug called BDB018. BDB018 is a
      next-generation Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist that activates the immune system.

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BDB018 in
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in subjects with unresectable or
      metastatic solid tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to standard treatment or for
      which there is no approved therapy.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1 study of BDB018 in
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.

      The study will be conducted in two separate but independent parts: a dose escalation part
      with BDB018 in monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab and a dose expansion part of
      BDB018 in combination with pembrolizumab.
