      valve positioning and does also provide information on the anatomy of the valve complex.
      However, BAV has been shown to have a number of potentially detrimental effects, such as:

        -  Functional cardiac arrest induced by rapid pacing leads to transient coronary, cerebral,
           and renal ischemia.

        -  In patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), prolonged cardiac
           depression after rapid pacing is observed and may result in hemodynamic failure and
           systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both are associated with a high
           periprocedural mortality.

        -  BAV has been identified as a major source of thrombotic and valvular material, thus
           increasing the risk for coronary obstruction with subsequent myocardial infarction
           and/or stroke.

        -  The local trauma in the left-ventricular outflow tract caused by BAV may potentially
           contribute to aortic root rupture.

      The investigators aim to document the incidence of cerebrovascular complications,
      paravalvular leakage and operative outcomes in a large, multicenter registry / prospective
      controlled cohort study to identify associations between patient related variables and
      outcomes.
