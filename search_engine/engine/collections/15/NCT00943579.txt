      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sapropterin in children with autism. During this
      protocol, all subjects will be receiving brand-name Kuvan 20 mg/kg/day for 16 weeks; subject
      who complete the first 16 weeks will have the option of continuing on Kuvan at the same dose
      for up to 90 days after the last subject has completed the first 16 weeks of this protocol.
      The purpose of the study primarily is to gather additional information on safety and efficacy
      in this population.
