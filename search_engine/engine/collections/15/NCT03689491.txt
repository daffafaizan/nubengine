      improve movements in the paretic lower limb and gait performance.

      Methods: Thirty patients with monohemispheric after ischemic stroke will recruited and
      randomized into 3 groups. The group 1 received a 10-minute rTMS intervention then a 30-minute
      visual feedback training. The group 2 received a 10-minute sham rTMS intervention then a
      30-minute visual feedback training. The group 3 received a 10-minute sham rTMS intervention
      then a 30-minute traditional rehabilitation training. All subjects received treatments 3
      times a week for 4 weeks. The performance was assessed by a blinded assessor for two times
      (baseline and after 4 weeks). The outcome measures included Motor evoked potential (MEP),
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Lower Limb section(FMA-LE),Motor Assessment Score(MAS), Berg Balance
      Test (BBS),Time Up and Go (TUG), and Modified Barthel Index for ADL ability. Collected data
      will be analyzed with ANOVA test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha level was set at 0.05. The
      hypothesis is combining rTMS with visual feedback training has positive effects on lower limb
      and gait performance among patients with stroke.
