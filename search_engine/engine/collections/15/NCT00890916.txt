      individuals with cervical-level spinal cord injury through the use of an advanced wireless
      myoelectrically controlled battery-powered implanted neuroprosthetic system known as the
      "FIRSTHAND" System. This restored function can enable the individual to achieve greater
      independence in activities of daily living and an improved quality of life. Electrical
      stimulation of paralyzed muscles will be used to generate functional movements. The movements
      will be controlled using myoelectric signals generated from muscles under the subject's
      voluntary control. The specific hypotheses of this study are: 1) at least 75% of all subjects
      will be able to manipulate at least one more object in the Grasp-Release Test when using the
      advanced neuroprosthesis compared to without the neuroprosthesis. 2) At least 75% of all
      subjects will demonstrate an increased level of independence in at least one functional
      activity when using the advanced neuroprosthesis. 3) At least 75% of all subjects will
      demonstrate an average neuroprosthesis usage of at least three days/week.
