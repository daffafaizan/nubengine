    
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into
      three groups: Concentrated Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMC), Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) or
      Placebo. BMC subjects will have bone marrow aspirated from the subjects iliac crests and the
      cellular rich portion will be concentrated and subsequently injected into the subjects'
      symptomatic knee during ACL reconstruction surgery. PRP subjects will have a venous blood
      draw and the resulting PRP will be injected into the symptomatic knee during ACL
      reconstruction surgery. Follow-up visits in person will take place at 2 weeks, 6 months and
      12 months after the ACL reconstruction surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate potential beneficial effects of leukocyte-poor
      platelet-rich plasma (LP-PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) on the healing and health of
      all critical joint tissues (grafts/ligaments, meniscus and cartilage) in the knee following
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Key aspects of this proposal include our
      well-developed methodologies to quantify and correlate cytokines, chemokines, growth factors
      in PRP and progenitor cells in BMC, clinical outcomes and imaging following ACLR. The
      overarching goal of this randomized control trial is to establish a biological signature of
      PRP and BMC that will be indicative for optimal recovery after ACLR. The long-term goal of
      our research is to better understand the efficacy of orthobiologic approaches to improve
      clinical outcomes, enhance graft healing and mitigate post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in
      a cohort of patients that have undergone ACLR.
