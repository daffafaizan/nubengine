      to 100 %. The primary outcome is relapse rate. The power of the study depends on the number
      of observed relapses. If the relapse rate in the adjuvant carboplatin group, the reference
      group, is lower than the anticipated 9 %, we need to include more patients to the study.
      Based on all previous published material on adjuvant treatment in clinical stage I seminoma
      it is not possible to precisely estimate the correct relapse rate until the median follow-up
      is four years. Consequently, we will estimate the relapse rate in the reference group close
      to the end of accrual. If the estimated relapse rate, and thus the number of relapses, is
      lower than the anticipated we will increase the sample size to make sure that the study meets
      the minimum required number of relapses in the reference group. A possible inclusion of more
      study participants does not compromise the Type I error rate of the study.
