      during your participation in the 2014-0112 study.

      During your first treatment visit, you will be asked to complete the QUALMS-1 questionnaire
      and another questionnaire that asks about your well-being.

      After your 4th cycle of treatment or when you stop receiving treatment, you will be asked to
      complete the QUALMS-1 questionnaire again and another questionnaire to rate any changes in
      your health since you started the study.

      It should take about 20 minutes total to complete the questionnaires each time.

      Information will also be collected from your medical record. This information will include
      the results of lab tests and other information relating to your health.
