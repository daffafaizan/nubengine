      increasing CRC screening rates among the at-risk patient community and to reduce racial and
      geographic (rural vs. urban) disparities in CRC screening and mortality rates. To accomplish
      this long-term goal, this study aims to develop and test precision messaging tailored to
      target audiences through development and evaluation of culturally sensitive, interactive
      messages about CRC screening delivered using VHT. The study will investigate whether
      interactive, tailored messages contribute to an overall enhancement of knowledge of CRC and
      screening options by eliciting positive attitudes and behaviors toward FIT screening.

      To date, there is no other study that has looked to partner specific message strategies and
      colorectal cancer screening with an emphasis on racial concordance and modality. As such, the
      researchers hope to shed new light on how, as health communicators, to more successfully
      engage target audiences to change attitudes and/or behaviors towards getting screened for
      colorectal cancer.
