      I. To determine response to Gleevec (Imatinib Mesylate) in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer and with c-Kit, Arg, Abl, or PDGF-R expression.

      II. To determine the side effects of Imatinib Mesylate in patients with colorectal cancer.

      III. To study the biologic effects of Imatinib Mesylate on the c-Kit and PDGF-R system and
      downstream signaling in metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily. Treatment continues for 8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or
      better continue therapy until disease progression or 1 year after complete response.
