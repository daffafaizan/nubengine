      purchases. However, little is known about how specific groups, such as overweight/obese and
      those with lower incomes, change their food purchasing decisions depending on food price
      changes. Evidence has shown that these groups have lower quality diets and worse health
      outcomes than their normal weight and higher income counterparts. Therefore, it is important
      to gain a better understanding of how food price changes affect purchasing decisions among
      these populations in order to develop targeted nutrition interventions to improve their diet
      quality. To investigate this, the researchers will create a laboratory-based grocery store,
      in which pictures of foods will be used to substitute actual food. Food prices will be
      indicated on each picture. Participants will be given play money and a budget, and ask them
      to "purchase" foods in the mock grocery store. The price of food will be changed throughout
      the study to investigate how participants change their purchasing decisions based on these
      price changes.
