    
      The main objectives of the study are to assess (1) patterns of brain activity/connectivity
      that confers greater cardio-autonomic/emotion regulation, (e.g., heart rate variability,
      blood pressure reactivity, inflammatory-immune activation, etc.), during rest, mental stress,
      and anger-related distress, (2) whether changes in breathing pace mitigate task-based effects
      on cardio-autonomic-immune regulation, and (3) whether these patterns vary as a function of
      HIV or pre-hypertensive (HTN) status-related changes to the brain structures underlying
      cardioautonomic and emotion regulation.
