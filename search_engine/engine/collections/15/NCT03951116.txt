      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating a new drug, FCN-437c, as a potential
      new treatment for cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved FCN-437c as a treatment for
      any disease.

      FCN-437c is a new generation CDK4/6 inhibitor. The CDK 4/6 inhibitors play a key role in
      regulating the transition from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle.

      The cyclin D-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitor of CDK4 (INK4)-retinoblastoma (Rb)
      pathway controls cell cycle progression by regulating the G1-S checkpoint. Dysregulation of
      the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently
      observed in many types of cancer. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells,
      CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment.

      FCN-437c is a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of CDK4/6 exhibiting cellular potency
      against a number of human tumor cell lines.

      Laboratory experiments show that FNC-437c may stop tumor growth.

      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FCN-437c when administered orally to subjects
           with advanced solid tumors

        -  To determine the MTD and/or the Phase 2 Dose for FCN-437c
