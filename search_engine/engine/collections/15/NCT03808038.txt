      measuring patient-reported health for patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD).
      The primary purpose of this resource, known as the LURN PRO Battery, is to comprehensively
      characterize the self-reported experiences of patients with LUTD for the purpose of enhancing
      efforts to characterize and explain important subtypes of patients with LUTD (phenotypes).
      Secondary purposes of the LURN PRO Battery, for which additional development work will be
      required, include developing better patient-reported endpoints for clinical trials,
      monitoring symptoms in the course of clinical care, and screening patients into important
      subgroups for purposes of tailored interventions.

      Incorporating methods the investigators have used successfully in prior measure validation
      work, the investigators propose to conduct a diary study in which patients record their
      symptoms at various time points - at the end of each day, or across multiple days. The
      investigators also ask them to complete self-report measures with different recall periods
      (i.e., 3-day, 7-day, and 30-day recall), and will determine how well each of these correspond
      to daily experiences recorded in more frequent assessments (i.e., end-of-day and 3-day
      patient bladder diaries). These data will help LURN investigators to determine the most
      appropriate reporting period for specific symptoms. This study can also help to identify
      causes of differences that exist between shorter and longer recall periods.
