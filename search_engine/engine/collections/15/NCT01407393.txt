      decisively meaningful for the regulation of bodyweight or obesity. Hence, Glucosanol™ may be
      used as a tool for the treatment of obesity and weight management through reduced
      carbohydrate absorption.

      The rationale for this study is to confirm that Glucosanol™ ingestion will reduce body
      weight. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design has been chosen to assess the
      efficacy and safety of Glucosanol™ in subjects who are overweight and mildly obese.

      The specific hypotheses to be accepted or rejected by statistical data from the clinical
      investigation are beneficial effects of the device on weight loss (kg) and body fat content.
