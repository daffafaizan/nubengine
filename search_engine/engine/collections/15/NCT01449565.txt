      1:1 to receive monthly injections of extended-release naltrexone (n=50) or placebo (n=50) for
      12 weeks at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Study participants will be seen weekly at our site at the HIV
      Prevention Section of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, where they will provide
      urine for drug testing and participate in substance use counseling. All participants will
      receive HIV risk-reduction counseling. Behavior will be assessed using standardized measures
      via audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI).
