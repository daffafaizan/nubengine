      were randomly assigned into one of two equally sized groups; a non- intervention and an
      intervention group in which patients received 4 manual techniques. Outcome measures included
      systolic- and diastolic BP pre-treatment and post-treatment 1-,5-, and 10-minutes. Two-way
      mixed ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
