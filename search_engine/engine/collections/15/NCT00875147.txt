    
      Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) increasingly added to other drugs in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Bev is
      typically used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin,
      irinotecan, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for treatment of patients with CRLM. The
      objective of this study was to assess the impact of neoadjuvant bevacizumab on clinical
      outcome after hepatectomy of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).

      Patients, who underwent liver resection due to colorectal liver metastases after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, operated between 2005 and 2007 will be evaluated retrospectively. The patients
      will be distributed in two groups, either with or without bevacicumab. Outcome parameters are
      mortality, complications, hospital stay and ICU stay. To increase the power of the study the
      total number of patients will be increased by adding patients from other centers. Results
      will be adjusted for the propensity of developing complications.
