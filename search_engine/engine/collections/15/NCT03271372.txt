      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once every 15 days for the
      first 120 days (Induction Phase 1), once every 30 days for the next 120 days (Induction Phase
      2), and then once every 120 days (Maintenance Phase) for a maximum of 720 days (approximately
      24 months or 2 years total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IV over 1 hour once every 15 days for the first 120 days
      (Induction Phase 1), once every 30 days for the next 120 days (Induction Phase 2), and then
      once every 120 days (Maintenance Phase) for a maximum of 720 days (approximately 24 months or
      2 years total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years for
      a minimum of 5 years from randomization.
