      and followed monthly for 12 months. Standard ophthalmologic exams will be performed, along
      with ETDRS visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT). A blood sample will be
      obtained for DNA analysis. The primary outcome measure is change in visual acuity at 4 months
      after initial Lucentis treatment. Secondary outcomes are change in visual acuity and retinal
      thickness at 12 months.
