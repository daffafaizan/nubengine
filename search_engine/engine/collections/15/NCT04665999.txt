      will be provided a study continuous glucose monitor (CGM) in order to collect 3 full
      menstrual cycle data within 180 days. Enrollment may last from 3-5 months. Study participants
      will include free-cycling females and females following oral contraceptive therapy. Study
      CGMs and activity trackers will be provided for the entire data collection period. During
      data collection, all participants will be asked to record meals consumed and free-cycling
      females will be asked to confirm ovulation by means of study-provided ovulation kits. The
      Clue app will be recommended to study participants to record dates of beginning of menses and
      ovulation (if applicable).
