      undergo two 68Ga-Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen- Positron Emission Tomography (PSMA-PET)
      scans within 24-48 hours. The difference between the two scans is that the radiotracer used
      in each scan will be produced with a different method (68Ga-PSMA-cyclotron and
      68Ga-PSMA-generator produced). The first scan will occur after a baseline clinical
      evaluation, which will include a history, physical, and baseline lab draw. After each scan,
      blood draws will be obtained.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate equivalence of two processes to create
      68Ga-HBED-PSMA and compare dosimetry, biodistribution and whole body excretion/ metabolism.
      Furthermore, the research team will perform dynamic analysis of the PET scans to investigate
      repeatability of whole-body 68Ga-PSMA-generator Ki Patlak imaging against that of
      conventional whole-body 68Ga-PSMA- SUV imaging and evaluate equivalence of whole-body
      68Ga-PSMA Ki Patlak imaging between the two processes to create 68Ga-HBED-PSMA
      (68GA-PSMA-cyclotron vs. 68Ga-PSMA-generator). Patients will afterwards receive standard of
      care treatment and follow up imaging.
