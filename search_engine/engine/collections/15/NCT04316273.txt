      Which affect all gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) from the mouth to the anus.

      ATD more common in with no familial or racial predilection. The ileum is the most common site
      (30%-35%) and the colon is the least common site (7%-20%).

      The transverse colon is the most common site for colonic duplication. The duplicated part of
      GIT maybe in the mesenteric or anti-mesenteric side. It may has same vascular supply and
      mesentry or not(reported only in small bowel)..

      Communication between the anomalous and actual enteric lumens may or may not be present.

      Here in, two cases of colonic and anal duplication add to the knowledge with review of
      literature of duplicated colon in children.
