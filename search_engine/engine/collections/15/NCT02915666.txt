      originates in the skin, uvea, acral tissues and mucosal tissues. Melanoma incidence and
      mortality are increasing in the U.S. with over 80,000 cases/year and 9,000 deaths/year.
      Advanced melanoma occurs either after treatment for localized melanoma or de novo and is
      associated with chemo-resistance and a median survival of 9 months.

      The study is a prospective, single-arm, one-site therapeutic trial of the combination of
      Dabrafenib + Trametinib + Digoxin for advanced V600 mutant melanoma.
