      with the pulmonary and systemic inmune response in COPD patients with frequent (FE) and non
      frequent exacerbations (NE).

        1. The pulmonary immune response.

           -The role of mucins, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
           Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as lung defense mechanisms and their possible relationship
           with the microbiome in COPD and FE patients.

        2. The systemic immune response. -The pulmonary and blood inflammatory response and
           circulating bacterial products as markers of the systemic immune response.
