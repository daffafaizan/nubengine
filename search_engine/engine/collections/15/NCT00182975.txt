    
      DHEA and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) plasma concentrations peak at about 20 years of age and decline
      rapidly and markedly after age 25 yr. DHEA is a PPAR-alpha activator. PPAR-alpha plays major
      roles in regulating lipid metabolism and controlling inflammation. DHEA also appears to have
      anabolic effects on muscle and bone. The study is designed to determine the effects of 12
      months of DHEA replacement in 65-75 year old women and men on (a) truncal and visceral fat,
      (b) insulin resistance and serum triglycerides, (c) muscle mass and strength, (d) bone
      mineral density, (e) chronic inflammation, (f) arterial-endothelium-dependent vasodilation,
      and (g) sense of well being.

      The specific aims of this study are to test the hypotheses that 12 months of DHEA replacement
      will (a) Result in significant decreases in truncal and visceral fat by shifting metabolism
      to fat oxidation and increasing energy wastage; (b) Decrease insulin resistance and decrease
      serum triglycerides; (c) Increase muscle mass and strength, by decreasing catabolic stimuli
      and increasing anabolic stimuli; (d) Increase bone mineral density by increasing anabolic
      stimuli and decreasing catabolic stimuli; (e) Reduce chronic inflammation and decrease
      pro-inflammatory cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells; (f) Improve
      arterial endothelium dependent vasodilation; and (g) Improve general sense of well being.
