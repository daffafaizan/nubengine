      causes of cancer death. While treatment options for AGC have expanded in recent years to
      include newer agents such as taxanes, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, myelosuppression remains a
      problem. Recently, weekly schedule of docetaxel is appealing due to limited incidence of
      severe myelosuppression compared with standard 3-weekly regimen. This altered toxicity
      profile suggests a potential for better tolerance and increased dose intensity.
