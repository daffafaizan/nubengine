      the grade of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with visilizumab, or Anti-thymocyte
      Globulin (ATG) in combination with tacrolimus + methotrexate in patients at high risk of GVHD
      after transplant from unrelated donors mismatched for 1-2 alleles of any type at human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) A, B, C and DRB1.

      The study design included two stages. The first stage of the trial was to enroll 15 patients
      on a single arm to be treated with "study treatment" (visilizumab, tacrolimus and
      methotrexate) to assess for treatment safety and exclude intolerable GVHD. The second stage
      of the trial was to include a random control group of patients treated with the current
      "standard treatment" (ATG, tacrolimus, and methotrexate) or "study treatment". The purpose of
      this comparison was to determine if the "study treatment" visilizumab causes less severe side
      effects and if it is more potent in reducing graft-versus-host disease symptoms than the
      "standard treatment".
