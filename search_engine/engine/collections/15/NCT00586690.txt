      induce antitumor response) following nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      (ASCT) is also complicated by the risk of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) with 30-40%
      of patients experiencing grade III-IV aGVHD. Data suggests that the use of natural killer
      (NK) cells (instead of nonselected DLIs) in this setting may mediate a graft versus tumor
      (GVT) effect independently of aGVHD.

      This pilot study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of donor natural killer
      (NK) cell selection and infusion following nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) from matched donors.
