    
      The primary aim was to determine the infectious titre of an Influenza A (H1N1) (A/New
      Caledonia/20/99) virus for use in other Influenza challenge studies for the development of
      Influenza vaccines, antiviral agents and to better understand the host response to Influenza
      infection.

      In addition, the safety of the inoculum, the virus shedding from the nasal mucosa following
      challenge with Influenza., changes in mRNA and protein expression from blood and nasal brush
      samples. were assessed Self reported symptoms following challenge were recorded. Samples were
      taken to facilitate validation of CMI and other immunologically relevant assays in
      development

      Overall Trial Design:

      For each group of subjects, quarantine, challenge phase, release from quarantine and
      decontamination occured concurrently at the designated study site throughout the challenge
      phase of the study.

      The volunteers were be stratified into four groups depending on their intended challenge
      titre of virus:

      High titre Medium-high titre Medium-low titre Low titre Influenza inoculation (nasal drops)
