      haematological malignancies.1-2 Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have replaced bone
      marrow cells as the preferred source for transplantation due to faster blood cell
      recovery.3-4 One variable of major impact for posttransplant care is the number of PBPC
      harvested.5-8 Therefore, several clinical studies have aimed to identify priming regimens
      that improve progenitor and stem cell mobilizations and collections without increased
      toxicity. Frequently, Filgrastim (r-met HuG-CSF) is administrated alone; however, Filgrastim
      combined with chemotherapy has proven more effective in context of CD34+ cell numbers
      harvested9-11 and this combination is considered the gold standard for priming and stem cell
      mobilization in relapsed malignant lymphoma.

      Stem cell factor (SCF) is a glycoprotein growth factor that acts on haematopoietic blood cell
      progenitors.12 Whereas SCF alone exerts little colony-stimulating activity on normal human
      bone marrow cells in vitro, combination of SCF with other recombinant haematopoietic
      cytokines results in a synergistic increase in numbers of colonies.13 In vivo, the addition
      of SCF to G-CSF (Filgrastim) synergistically increases PBPC mobilization compared to
      Filgrastim alone.14-17 Several clinical trials have reported the ability of the combination
      of SCF with Filgrastim to mobilize PBPC in patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast
      and ovarian cancers even in heavily pretreated patients.18-26 Priming using chemotherapy is
      toxic and costly11 and new priming procedures need to be established, which is the background
      for this randomized pilot study. The hypothesis is that elimination of chemotherapy from the
      priming regimen may decrease the overall toxicity and the ability to collect a sufficient
      autograft which, however, may be circumvented by adding r-metHuSCF (Ancestim) to the priming
      regimen. The aim of this randomized phase II trial was to evaluate safety, toxicity and
      efficacy of growth factors in lymphoma patients considered candidates for high dose
      chemotherapy.
