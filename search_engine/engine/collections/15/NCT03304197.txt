      which of three drinks is most effective at re-hydrating cyclists and if this affects
      performance. Subjects will undertake 4 tests: once dehydrated, once hydrated with water, once
      hydrated with a sports-specific drink, and once with an altered sports drink. Blood samples
      will be taken and expired gasses will be sampled at various time points throughout the tests
      for later analysis. A small amount of labelled water will be consumed with each drink, a
      technique which will allow us to quantify the absorption of each of the drinks.
