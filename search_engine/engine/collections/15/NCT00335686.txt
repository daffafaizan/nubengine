      toxicity associated with nucleoside analogues, including lipoatrophy, which at facial level
      is a stigmatising factor for patients with HIV infection.

      The primary outcome measure of the design of an "NTRI-sparing" bitherapy is to retard the
      onset of mitochondrial toxicity or reverse it, mainly with regard to the loss of subcutaneous
      fat or lipoatrophy.

      Lopinavir/ritonavir and nevirapine are two antiretrovirals with different mutation patterns
      and with high antiviral potency. Their combination therefore guarantees antiviral success.
      The NEKA study endorses efficacy immunologically and virologically (Negredo E. et al,
      NRTI-sparing regimen. XIV International AIDS Conference. Barcelona 2002. LB PeB9021).

      Similarly, the protective effect of nevirapine on lipid metabolism would counteract the
      negative impact attributed to lopinavir/ritonavir, reducing cardiovascular risk in these
      patients.
