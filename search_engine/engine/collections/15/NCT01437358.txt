      Epidural analgesia (EA) has been mainly investigated during the perioperative period. In the
      intensive care unit settings, EA should be proposed in critically ill patients, such as
      postoperative or trauma patients, typically. Recent findings also support anti-inflammatory,
      vascular or respiratory effects for EA, beyond its analgesic effects. However, data on EA
      safety and feasibility in the intensive care unit settings are still lacking.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This observational multicenter prospective clinical study will report the incidence of
      EA-related complications, such as infectious or neurologic complications, and the mean
      duration of EA in the ICU settings.

      Patients admitted in three intensive care units (two from an University Hospital and one from
      a local hospital) and receiving EA will be included in the study, whether the EA catheter is
      inserted in the ICU or outside the ICU, e.g. in the operating room. Demographics, clinical
      and biological data will be recorded prospectively. The main goal is to evaluate the safety
      and feasibility of EA in critically ill patients, being assumed this technique is currently
      and routinely used in our intensive care units, in accordance with national and international
      guidelines on epidural analgesia practice.
