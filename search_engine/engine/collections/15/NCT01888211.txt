      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
      (2g/day for 6-weeks). Peripheral blood was taken for analysis of platelet and monocyte
      activation, and forearm blood flow was assessed in a subset of 12 patients during
      intrabrachial infusions of acetylcholine, substance P and sodium nitroprusside. Stimulated
      plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentrations were measured during substance P
      infusion.
