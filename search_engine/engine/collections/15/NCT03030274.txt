    
      This study will enroll subjects with HFrEF or HFpEF, until a maximum of 100 patients have
      undergone implantation with the OcclutechÂ® AFR device.

      Enrolled patients will be stratified according to their ejection fraction as either HFrEF
      (ejection fraction > 15% and <40 %) or HFpEF ( ejection Fraktion > 40 % to 70 %). It is
      planned to enroll at least 100 patients per stratification subgroup.
