      follow-up study. Both clinical and neurophysiological evaluations (electrophysiological and
      eye tracking) will be completed at different times of the follow-up. This integrative
      approach, combining clinical and biological markers, will allow the identification of
      different developmental trajectories and then a better individuation of treatment in autism
      spectrum disorders.
