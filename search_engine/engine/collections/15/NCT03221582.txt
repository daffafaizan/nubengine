      fractures among HIV-infected patients and the general population. While HIV significantly
      increases cardiovascular risk, the contribution of HCV to cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
      less certain. Increased inflammation could potentially underlie the effect of HCV on CVD,
      bone health, and other extra-hepatic complications. HCV appears to remain an independent
      predictor of osteoporotic fractures even after controlling for severity of liver disease. The
      impact of HCV therapy on inflammation, CVD and bone health is unclear. Our previous studies
      suggest a beneficial impact of interferon therapy on bone turnover and some CVD markers,
      while others studies have found on-treatment increases in bone mineral density with
      interferon-based therapy. Whether these are related to the interferon itself or the virologic
      response, and whether changes in biomarkers lead to improved fracture risk or CVD morbidity
      is uncertain. Investigator propose to conduct a prospective analysis of markers of
      inflammation, immune activation, and bone turnover as well as bone mineral density (BMD)
      among both HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected patients undergoing treatment with the
      novel direct-acting antiviral elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR). Should EBR/GZR therapy
      significantly improve CV risk and bone health, it would be an additional benefit and
      indication for its use in HCV therapy.
