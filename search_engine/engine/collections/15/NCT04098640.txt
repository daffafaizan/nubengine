        1. To evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of tumor mutation burden.

        2. To reveal the correlation between genetic characteristics and immunohistochemical
           expression of selected proteins (including DNA damage repair (DDR) molecules and various
           immune modulating molecules including PD-L1, PD-1, IDO, and OX40).

        3. Compare molecular characteristics of breast cancer according to age groups (<35 years
           vs. 35-50 years).

        4. To offer genomic profiling guided therapy to patients as early as possible (preferably,
           1st- or 2nd-line of treatment). In addition, to explore how genomic profiling guided
           therapy could improve patient outcome as an ad-hoc if sufficient number of patients can
           be followed up (compared to historic data).
