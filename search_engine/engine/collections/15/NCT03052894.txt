      optimal surgical conditions. The extent of paralysis typically assessed during routine
      clinical care by examining the muscle response of the thumb ("twitch") following delivery of
      a series of the "train-of-four".

      Quantitative assessment of neuromuscular block can be assessed using electromyography (EMG)
      This technique measures action potential in the muscles of the thumb.

      The proposed method is a simple technique that can constructed with equipment that is readily
      available in most operating rooms. If validated, it would provide a simple method to assess
      quantitatively the extent of neuromuscular blockade and recovery of muscle strength.
