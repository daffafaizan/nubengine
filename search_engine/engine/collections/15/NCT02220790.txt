      concern for infection while in the hospital. Sites used are part of the International
      Pediatric Fungal Network (ipfn.org). The study plans to prospectively enroll pediatric
      patients at high-risk of developing invasive candidiasis over a four year period. The study
      duration per subject will be up to 14 days for blood collection and 30 days for data
      collection from the medical record.

      For the first aim, this study will assemble a prospective cohort of pediatric patients at
      high-risk for developing invasive candidiasis. Blood samples for biomarker testing will be
      obtained within 24-hours of a patient having a clinical indication for blood culture
      attainment. To accomplish the second aim, additional blood sampling will be performed in the
      sub-set of patients that are found to have invasive candidiasis. For the third aim, remnant
      blood samples following biomarker testing from all consenting participants will be stored in
      a biobank. This biobank will be used to examine future, currently undeveloped, biomarker
      assays in an effort to further reduce the time to diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.
