      phosphate intake may acute impair microvascular blood flow. However, this has never been
      directly tested using imaging techniques that directly measure microvascular flow. The
      end-stage renal disease population on hemodialysis at the VA San Diego is an ideal population
      to evaluate this effect.

      Project Question: Does reduction of serum phosphate through the use of a phosphate binder
      (lanthanum carbonate) increase microvascular blood flow in persons with ESRD? Project
      Methods: The investigators propose a 4 week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled,
      single-center, crossover trial. Participants will have their microvascular function assessed
      at the baseline of the study using laser-Doppler flowmetry and nail-fold capillaroscopy. They
      will then be randomized to either lanthanum carbonate or placebo for 2 weeks. Microvascular
      measurements will be repeated at the end of the 2 week period. Participants will then
      cross-over to the other study arm. After 2 weeks in the other study arm, they will have
      microvascular measurements repeated and the trial will then be complete. The primary outcome
      of the study will be the % change in skin blood flow after heating from 31 degrees Celsius to
      44 degrees Celsius. This will be compared within each individual after they complete each arm
      of the study. Changes seen on nail-fold capillaroscopy, acceptability, safety, and adherence
      will be key secondary outcomes.
