      type of CP being spastic CP which negatively affects physical function. Specifically it is
      reported that there is an increase in energy expenditure and oxygen consumption in children
      with CP. Single event multi level chemoneurolysis with abobotulinumtoxinA has been found to
      be an effective treatment for patients with spasticity to reduce energy expenditure by
      increasing walking efficiency; however many of these studies have conflicting methodological
      approaches. Therefore this study aims to evaluate the single event multilevel chemoneurolysis
      with DysportÂ® on energy expenditure and gait in children with spastic diplegia CP.
