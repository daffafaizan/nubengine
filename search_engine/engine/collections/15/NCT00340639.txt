      activities, problem-solving, and decision-making. It is particularly challenging during
      adolescence when youth are experiencing a variety of physiological, social, and psychological
      changes at the same time that they are taking increased responsibility for their own diabetes
      care. This study examines the influence of family, social, and adolescent developmental
      transitions. Over the course of 12 months, a sample of 135 parent-child dyads will provide
      information on individual efficacy, maturity, family and social support, attitudes toward
      diabetes management, and diabetes management behaviors. One goal of this pilot study is to
      identify factors that predict the adherence of individual youth and parents during this
      transition period.
