      cost-effectiveness of different service delivery models for prevention and treatment of
      postpartum hemorrhage with misoprostol, prompting a discussion of whether resources are best
      spent on misoprostol for primary prevention at lower levels (with treatment carried out at
      higher levels via referral) or whether immediate proactive treatment strategies should be
      considered. As the training and policy implications of universal prevention versus selective
      treatment approaches vary, simple and effective service delivery models are urgently needed
      to help governments and organizations decide how to best focus their limited resources. This
      study proposes to study the efficacy of a hybrid strategy (i.e., secondary prevention) that
      combines elements of prevention and treatment. Results of this study could provide a new
      model of care that will medicate fewer women, save costs and address the clinical conundrum
      of guessing at the safety of administering a prevention dose of misoprostol followed quickly
      by a larger treatment dose.

      Study design: This randomized cluster trial will recruit women with deliveries attended by
      auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) that occur at homes or at health sub-centers. ANMs will be
      randomized to administer the intervention as described in the primary or secondary prevention
      arm.
