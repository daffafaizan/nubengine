      young children with persistent respiratory symptoms. This study was a prospective,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 6 to 24 months old children, who had at least one
      physician-diagnosed wheezing episode and persistent asthmatic symptoms. Patients were
      randomised to placebo or montelukast 4 mg / day for 8 weeks period. The clinical response to
      treatment was determined, the functional residual capacity (FRC) and specific air-way
      conductance (sGaw) was measured using an infant whole-body pletys-mograph, the maximal flow
      at functional residual capacity (VÂ´maxFRC) was re-corded using the squeeze technique and
      airway responsiveness was evaluated by performing a dosimetric methacholine challenge test.
