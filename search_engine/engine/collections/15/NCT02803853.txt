      evaluating a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to improve diet and physical
      activity-related risk factors of obesity. A previous iteration of the intervention trial,
      called Obesity Prevention Research and Evaluation of InterVention Effectiveness in NaTive
      North Americans (OPREVENT) was implemented in five American Indian communities in Michigan
      and New Mexico. OPREVENT was a multi-level, multi-component intervention functioning at the
      community, institution, household, and individual levels and was implemented in schools, food
      stores, and worksites. Prior to OPREVENT, the research team has run multi-level interventions
      by working with schools and food stores in Native North American (NNA) communities1-6. For
      this new trial, named OPREVENT2, the research team will expand on the collective experience
      working on obesity prevention interventions in American Indian (AI) settings by developing
      complementary policy and social media components to support long-term sustainability of the
      OPREVENT intervention. OPREVENT2 will be implemented in six new AI communities.
