      interleukin-2 by randomizing the patients being not allogeneic transplanted in complete
      remission after induction and consolidation chemotherapy concerning the event free survival.
      A total of 580 patients will be accrued over 7 years. Treatment consists in subcutaneous
      application of interleukin-2 in treating patients with complete remission by a monthly
      regimen of 5 days during 1 year after having received a chemotherapy consisting of 1
      induction and 3 consolidation treatments.
