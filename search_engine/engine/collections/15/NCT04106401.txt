      termed "space flight anemia" and characterized by a decrease in total red blood cell volume
      (RCV) and plasma volume (PV). This haematological alteration is likely to persist during a
      long-term space mission and impact the astronauts' health, however this question remains
      unexplored. During a long-term space mission, the use of hypobaric hypoxia is considered for
      technical reasons, however the safety of hypoxia must first be verified because this
      environmental condition causes substantial physiological changes, in particular changes in
      blood volumes that may interact with the haematological effects of microgravity.

      OBJECTIVE: using the Antarctic confinement model as a high-fidelity terrestrial analogue for
      long-duration space missions, the investigators hypothesize that 1) sea level confinement
      reduces blood volume by simultaneously decreasing RCV and PV, and 2) chronic hypoxia offsets
      the decrease in RCV and exacerbates the decrease in PV induced by confinement.

      METHODS: blood volumes will be measured via the carbon-monoxide rebreathing method,
      repeatedly in two groups of participants, overwintering either at Dumont d'Urville (sea
      level) or Concordia (altitude 3200 m). The blood viscosity will also be measured, as well as
      the markers of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism.

      PERSPECTIVE: Documenting if some degree of hypoxia during long-duration confinement may be
      beneficial or unfavorable in terms of blood volume regulation is potentially relevant
      information for the astronauts' health and safety during long-duration space missions.
