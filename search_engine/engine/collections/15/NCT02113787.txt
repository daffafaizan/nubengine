      However, controversies exist about efficacy and safety of substituting generic AEDs. Because
      even minor absorption and kinetic differences can elicit a breakthrough seizure in patients
      who are changed to a generic AED from brand AED. Therefore, more ideal evaluation of
      interchangeability from the brand AEDs to generic formulation of the same drug is three-way
      or four-way crossover study, which can evaluate within-subject variability in pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic. Investigator designed four-way crossover study aimed to assess
      bioequivalence of brand and generic topiramate, to measure trough serum level , and to
      evaluate efficacy, tolerability and side effect of generic topiramate.
