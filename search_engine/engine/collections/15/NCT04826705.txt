      femoropopliteal arteries include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with an uncoated
      balloon and implantation of a bare metal stent. Recently, drug-eluting stents (DES) and
      drug-coated balloons (DCB) that transfer paclitaxel to the vessel wall during
      revascularization have been added to the suite of tools available to interventionists,
      helping to prevent restenosis after treatment.

      There have been a number of randomized controlled studies (RCT) showing the efficacy of the
      endovascular treatment with drug-coated balloons (DCB) in the femoropopliteal artery lesions.
      However, these studies have been carefully designed, and most of them have excluded
      long-length lesions and severely calcified lesions. In addition to being used alone in the
      real word, drug-coated balloons (DCB) are also used in combination with stents or debulking
      devices, but in these randomized controlled studies (RCT) they are only compared with
      standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).

      Therefore, we initiated this study, which is a prospective, multicenter, observational
      real-world study of short and long-term outcome in endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal
      arterial occlusive lesions with DCB. It is estimated that 1200 patients with chronic femoral
      popliteal artery occlusion were enrolled in the group at 8 centers in China in two years. The
      follow-up would be conducted at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months after the operation to
      assess the efficacy and safety of the endovascular treatment with drug-coated balloons (DCB)
      in the femoropopliteal artery lesions.
