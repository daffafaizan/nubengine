      observational phase, subjects will attend a total of 8 visits at approximately 1, 2, 4, and 8
      weeks after kidney transplantation and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after kidney
      transplantation. During these visits, subjects will have a review of medication history,
      blood tests, and a kidney function test. The blood will be used to test the level of certain
      components of you blood to see if your HPT has resolved, stabilized, or advanced. At selected
      visits throughout the study, you will have a urine sample collected and a health
      questionnaire that will ask about your health. Information regarding transplant kidney biopsy
      (if performed) also will be collected.
