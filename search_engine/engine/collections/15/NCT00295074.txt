      post-traumatic amnesia; Glasgow Coma Score 13-15; admitted within 24 hours of injury; able to
      read, speak, and understand English) who do not have pre-injury dementia or significant
      cognitive impairment will undergo computerized neuropsychologic testing using a previously
      validated tool that has been effective in sports-related mild TBI. Sequential testing will be
      performed during recovery and patients who report disabling symptoms and/or functional
      impairment will be compared to patients who recover uneventfully. Goal is to identify those
      parameters that predict early who may suffer long term sequelae or functional impairment and
      therefore benefit from early cognitive rehabilitation. Secondary goals are to establish
      objective parameters for functional recovery after mild TBI.
