    
      This is a phase 2 double-blind, randomized, single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      12-week study of Bio-K+ probiotic 50B® in subjects diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
      suboptimal glycemic control.

      After providing informed consent and completion of screening baseline assessments,
      approximately 130 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Bio-K+50B®
      probiotic or matching placebo. Subjects will take investigational product or placebo once
      daily orally for 12 weeks.

      During the double-blind treatment period, subjects will complete a daily diary and will be
      contacted via telephone (at Week 4 and Week 8) for an assessment of adverse events,
      concomitant medications, diabetes management habits, collection of stool sample at home,
      diary revision and study product compliance. At visit 3 (Week 12; end of study visit)
      subjects will return to the study site for laboratory tests and clinical assessment.
