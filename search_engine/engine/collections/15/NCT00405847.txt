      mechanically ventilated patients, despite sedative infusions, sleep is severely disrupted.
      Sleep disruption, in turn, can lead to activation of sympathetic nervous system and elevated
      inflammatory cytokines. Both sympathetic hyperactivity and elevated cytokines have been
      associated with delirium, which, in turn, is associated with increased mortality and higher
      healthcare costs. Currently, however, there is very little understanding of the
      inter-relationship between critical illness, sleep, and neuropsychological well-being. The
      purpose of this study is to collect preliminary data on the short-term effects of sedation
      with and without sympatholysis on sleep and inflammation in critically ill patients receiving
      mechanical ventilation. This pilot study will be accomplished by performing sleep studies and
      circulating cytokine measurements in critically ill patients randomized to receive two
      different sedation strategies: Dexmedetomidine versus Midazolam and Fentanyl. The ultimate
      goal of this program of research is to identify sedation practices that are least associated
      with adverse short- and long-term consequences, and thereby ultimately help improve sleep
      quality and quality of life in patients surviving critical illness.
