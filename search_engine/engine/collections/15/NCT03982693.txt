    
      TACT3a is a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to test a novel therapy,
      edetate disodium-based chelation of environmentally acquired toxic metals, to reduce
      cardiovascular events including amputation in high-risk diabetic patients.

      The study plans to enroll 50 patients with diabetes and critical limb ischemia (CLI) to
      prevent the major cardiovascular endpoints of major amputation, coronary revascularization,
      stroke, Myocardial Infarction (MI), or death (all-cause) during an average 1.25 years of
      follow-up. Patients will be randomly assigned to chelation or placebo with a 3:2 (30 active,
      20 placebo) allocation ratio. Treatment will consist of 40 active or placebo infusions over
      30 weeks. Active therapy will be the same edetate disodium-based infusion used safely and
      successfully in a previous published study, Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT).
      Baseline and post infusion urine metals will be collected. Following the final infusion,
      patients will be contacted quarterly until the end of the study.
