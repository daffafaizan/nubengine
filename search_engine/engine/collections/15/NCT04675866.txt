      in China accounts for about half of the world's total, the incidence rate ranks second, and
      the mortality rate ranks second.Moreover, the proportion of early gastric cancer in China is
      very low, only about 20%. Most of them are in advanced stage at the time of discovery. The
      overall 5-year survival rate is less than 15%, which seriously threatens the health and life
      of Chinese people.For nearly 90% of HER2 negative patients with advanced gastric and
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (g / GEJ), the current first-line treatment option
      is chemotherapy, and the efficacy of available drugs is very limited.The ORR of the
      first-line chemotherapy is about 40%, and the OS is about 10 months. New therapeutic drugs
      are urgently needed to improve the efficacy of advanced G/GEJ.The purpose of this study was
      to investigate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab combined with paclitaxel (albumin
      binding type) and S-1 for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
