      ratio to experimental group (VR-based training with dual-tDCS; VR-Dual) or the control group
      (VR-based training with dual sham tDCS; VR-Sham) . For both conditions, VR-Dual and VR-Sham
      group commenced at the same time (20 minutes). The therapist and patients were blinded as to
      whether the patients received real or sham tDCS. The study was approved by the Ethics

      informed consent before enrollment.
