      practice of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity endurance activities or at least 75
      minutes of activity. endurance of sustained intensity, or an equivalent combination of
      moderate and sustained activity. However, the attractiveness for physical activity fades over
      the years limiting the practice of physical activity. Several types of unconventional
      approaches have already shown their effectiveness in the prevention of falls in the elderly
      but these practices find their limits in the lack of adherence to this type of exercise,
      especially in nursing homes. New virtual reality and gaming technologies have recently
      emerged and are being used as tools to prevent the risk of falling. The use of these new
      tools has advantages over conventional exercises: motivating.

      The investigators aimed to test the interest of a virtual environment with cycling to
      increase the motivation of physical activity practice in institutionalized older adults.
