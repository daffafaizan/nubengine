      increased carotid IMT as maximal IMT ≥ 1.0 mm. Multidetector CT (MDCT) and pulse wave
      velocity (PWV) were taken to evaluate carotid artery stenosis (CS), coronary artery disease
      (CAD), intracranial arterial lesion (ICA), and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We compared
      prevalence of large artery stenosis according to carotid IMT group and evaluated whether
      maximal IMT ≥ 1.0 mm could predict for significant CAD by MDCT. We performed invasive
      coronary angiography in some patients (N=14) and analyzed association for degrees of CAD
      between two angiographic methods.
