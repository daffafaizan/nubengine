      To investigate the effect of high-intensity strength training on quality of life, muscle
      strength, physical function, and disease activity in patients with myositis

      Study design:

      60 myositis patients will be included in a 16-week high-intensity strength training study.
      Patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups (strength training and control) in a 1:1
      ratio.

      User involvement:

      Myositis patients has been recruited to a patient advisory board. The advisory board's
      objective is to give patient-oriented project feedback, thus improving the overall research
      project.

      Intervention:

      Two training session per week for 16 weeks. Sessions consists of 3 sets of each exercise
      corresponding to 10 RM. Training progression will be accounted for and training loads will be
      adjusted weekly. The training protocol will be a full-body protocol, i.e. all major muscle
      groups will be engaged during each training session.

      Outcomes:

      The primary outcome is the Physical Component Summary Measure from the quality of life
      questionnaire (SF-36). Secondary outcomes include strength measures, functional tests,
      disease activity measures, questionnaires (e.g. International physical activity
      questionnaire), DEXA whole body scans, blood samples and muscle biopsies.
