      patients' clinical and neurological outcome. Furthermore silent brain lesions are not well
      documented after endovascular and surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
      Therefore, the investigators investigate the incidence and influence of treatment-related
      ischemic lesions in magnetic resonance / diffusion-weighted-imaging after endovascular and
      surgical treatment of UIA.
