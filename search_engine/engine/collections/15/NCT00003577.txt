        -  Compare disease-free and overall survival of women with early stage breast cancer
           treated with adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with or without
           epirubicin.

        -  Compare the quality of life in a subgroup of these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy timing
      (concurrent versus sequential), nodal status (negative versus 1-3 versus at least 4), age (50
      and under versus over 50), grade, and tumor size. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide on days 1-14 and methotrexate IV and
           fluorouracil IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive epirubicin IV on day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 courses followed by
           cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, as in arm I, for 4 courses.

      Some patients may receive radiotherapy during or after chemotherapy. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed in a subset of patients (N=500) before chemotherapy starts, at 3
      months of treatment, at the end of chemotherapy, and at 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment.

      Patients are followed annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 4
      years.
