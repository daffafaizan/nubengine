        -  to assess whether a clinical and kinematic effect might be induced providing a
           closed-loop control by sEMG signal for robot (i.e. Amadeo Â®) assisted therapy of hand
           function

        -  to determine safety and feasibility of including robotic therapy into daily
           rehabilitation programs after stroke.

      A total of 20 patients has been recruited, all of them received on daily basis 1 hour of
      robot therapy in adjunction to 1 hour of standard therapy. Overall the hour of robotic
      therapy include both subject preparation (15 minutes to place surface electrodes on the
      forearm and set the right position of sitting and upper limb) and delivery of exercises. The
      treatment protocol includes passive and active training of flexion and extension movements of
      the fingers. The passive part lasts 5 minutes, while the active one provides 25 total minutes
      divided into 5 exercises. The robot therapy lasts 15 consecutive sessions, 5 times a week,
      for 3 weeks.
