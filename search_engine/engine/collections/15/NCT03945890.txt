      team resource management (TRM) method on the adequacy of bowel preparation.

      Investigators collected a total of 2,104 (884 female, 1,220 male) healthy subjects who
      underwent a health check-up colonoscopy screening were enrolled before and after the
      application of the TRM program intervention. The efficacy of the TRM intervention and the
      factors affecting bowel preparation were estimated using multivariate logistic regression in
      this study.

      Enrollment of study subjects and data collection: The subjects enrolled in this study were
      those who received a health check-up colonoscopy screening in a tertiary center, Far Eastern
      Memorial Hospital (FEMH), in Taiwan from March 2013 to August 2014. A total of 2,104 healthy
      subjects who underwent check-up colonoscopy screening were enrolled during the
      pre-intervention, post-intervention, and validation periods. Investigators need to collect
      each subject's demographic characteristics (Age & Gender) and the types of purgative
      treatments used were collected to analyze. According to the Aronchick Bowel Preparation
      Scale, this study divided the degree of bowel cleansing into four levels, namely,
      "Excellent", "Good", "Fair" and "Poor". Investigators also need to collect the results of
      bowel preparation to calculate of the adequate bowel cleansing rate was defined further as
      the percentage of the participants with "Excellent" or "Good" cleansing in our analysis.
