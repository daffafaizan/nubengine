      occurring in 20-30% of patients post-operatively. Historically, Vitamin K antagonist therapy
      with Warfarin has been the treatment of choice for prophylaxis against stroke and systemic
      arterial thromboembolism in NOAF. Warfarin inhibits the Vitamin K dependent factors involved
      in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades, thus decreasing systemic clotting.
      However, Warfarin therapy comes with many challenges including prolonged titration, tedious
      monitoring requirements and in some cases, increased bleeding risk.

      The limitations associated with Warfarin may be mitigated by using new oral anticoagulants
      (NOACs) like Rivaroxaban which have no routine monitoring requirements. Rivaroxaban is a
      direct inhibitor of Factor Xa, a central reactant in both the intrinsic and extrinsic
      coagulation cascades. Studies in non-operative patients with atrial fibrillation have shown
      that Rivaroxaban is non-inferior to Warfarin for stroke prophylaxis with similar risk
      profiles. This study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and financial cost of these two
      drugs when used for the management of new onset atrial fibrillation that occurs after cardiac
      operations.
