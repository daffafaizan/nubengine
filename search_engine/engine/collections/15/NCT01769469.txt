    
      This is a prospective observational cohort sub-study of subjects enrolled in the ATN 110
      (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) study. All subjects will be followed for at least 48
      weeks. Subjects who meet specific bone or renal criteria at Week 48 of the ATN 110
      (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) study will be followed for an additional 48 weeks in
      the Extension Phase of ATN 110 (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) and ATN 117
      (NCT01769469). The maximum duration of participation will be 96 weeks.

      There is no therapeutic intervention specific to this sub-study, and there are no extra study
      visits required for participation in this sub-study. Questionnaires will be administered and
      blood and urine samples for laboratory evaluation of potential emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir
      (TDF) (TruvadaÂ®) toxicities will be obtained for this sub-study at visits that are required
      by the ATN 110 (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) study. Measurement of bone mineral
      density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan
      are planned as a part of the ATN 110 (NCT01772823) and ATN 113 (NCT01769456) studies, and
      results will be utilized for the analysis in this study. This study does not require extra
      BMD or BMC measurements.
