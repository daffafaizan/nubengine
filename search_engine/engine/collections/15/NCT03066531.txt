      and psychological intervention, in particular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The effects
      of these programs are frequently not stable, and usually the maintenance of achieved
      weight-loss lasts only for a short period of time. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT,
      keeps on gaining recognition in obesity treatment. The purpose of the study is to compare
      weight loss and indicator of psychological functioning in a population of obese subjects
      belonging to three different diagnostic categories: without ED, with ED NAS and with BED.
      Participants were exposed respectively to a CBT or an ACT treatment and were assessed three
      times: pre intervention, post intervention and follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that
      CBT and ACT are both effective in the post-intervention. ACT intervention should be more
      effective in the follow-up both for weight and psychological functioning, due to its focus on
      the flexible managing of the global context instead of the focus on the pathology itself,
      more typical in standard CBT treatment.
