      more and more relevant as a cause of ACS. Its management is currently a matter of debate due
      to the absence of RCT and even the trigger events related to this kind of infarction are
      still unclear. Notably, the benefits from the use of the antiplatelet medications that
      prolong bleeding time for a condition whose primary pathophysiology may be an intramural
      bleed are under discussion.

      Hence, the targets pursued by our study may be essentially distinguished in five main points:

        1. To assess the characteristics of SCAD patients highlighting the predisposing and
           precipitating factors related to the acute event

        2. To analyze clinical presentation and management of spontaneous coronary dissections in
           terms of therapeutic approach in the acute phase (conservative therapy vs
           revascularization)

        3. To evaluate the incidence of SCAD recurrence and of major adverse cardiovascular events
           (MACEs) at follow-up

        4. To analyze the impact of a single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) over the dual one (DAPT)
           along with the impact of different P2Y12i regimens on acute and long-term prognosis

        5. To evaluate impact of different angiographic SCAD type on outcome
