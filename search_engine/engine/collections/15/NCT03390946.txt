      regimen using four-drugs in newly-diagnosed osteosarcoma patients. Four drugs will be
      adriamycin, high-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, ifosfamide. All these drugs will be given
      preoperatively in an interval-compressed schedule, but postoperatively at a regular interval.
      Neoadjuvant therapy will be composed of two courses, and adjuvant therapy of two or three
      courses depending on necrosis rates following neoadjuvant therapy.
