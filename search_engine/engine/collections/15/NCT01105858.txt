      complications, but most of the specific genetic determinants remain unidentified. The
      molecular pathways by which diabetes-susceptibility genes influence risk for diabetes and
      related conditions are also largely unknown. This project will seek to identify, and quantify
      the effects of, the genetic determinants of type 2 diabetes, its risk factors and
      complications in a multiethnic sample. Diabetes and glycemic status will be assessed from
      clinical interviews, an oral glucose tolerance test and glycated hemoglobin. Insulin
      sensitivity and insulin secretion will be assessed from indices derived from the oral glucose
      tolerance test. Other potential risk factors for type 2 diabetes (e.g., obesity) and its
      complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy) will be measured. DNA will be collected and
      analyzed to identify genetic variants associated with or linked to diabetes or other traits.
      Studies of gene transcription, protein expression and metabolic profiling will be performed,
      and the resulting patterns will be analyzed for their relationships with diabetes, related
      traits and variants in diabetes susceptibility genes. Individuals will be studied
      longitudinally to determine if gene transcription, protein expression and metabolic profiles
      predict development of diabetes or its complications. These studies will help to determine
      the molecular pathways between genetic variants and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and its
      complications.
