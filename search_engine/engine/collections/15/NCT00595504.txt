    
      This is an 8-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study with 4- week
      follow up assessment, of ramelteon 8 mg/day, administered to subjects for 8 consecutive weeks
      as an adjunctive therapy in 40 non-diabetic schizophrenia subjects to examine ramelteon
      effects on body composition, glucose and lipid metabolism, sleep quality and symptoms of
      tardive dyskinesia using the Massachusetts General Hospital General Clinical Research Center.
      As far as we know, no previous study has been done to explore the potential role of ramelteon
      in improving metabolic, sleep, and movement disturbances in schizophrenia subjects. The novel
      approach of adjunctive ramelteon treatment in the schizophrenia population is promising.
