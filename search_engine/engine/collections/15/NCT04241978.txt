      values regarding the benefits and risks of the different treatment options. In this sense,
      patient decision aids (PtDA) can play an important role in helping patients to incorporate
      their values, needs and preferences into the decision-making process, thus improving
      Person-Centred Care (PCC). Previous research has focused almost exclusively on knee OA, and
      therefore the aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a PtDA for
      patients with hip OA.

      Methods: The general design consists of two phases: 1) design a web-based PtDA for patients
      with hip OA, following the recommended procedures: systematic review of safety/effectiveness
      of treatments, and an iterative process of development with the help of an Advisory Committee
      composed of health professionals and patients; 2) To evaluate the impact of the PtDA on hip
      OA patients' decision-making process related with their treatment. For that aim, a
      multicenter randomized controlled trial will be carried out with 124 patients with hip OA in
      Tenerife (Spain) comparing intervention or usual care.

      Discussion: PtDAs have been recommended as a useful and effective resource for improving PCC
      in many health conditions. The intervention is intended to empower patients by fostering
      their active participation during the decision-making process about their treatment, and by
      ensuring they make informed decisions congruent with their values and preferences. This study
      will contribute to the scientific knowledge about effectiveness of PtDAs in hip OA, in order
      to improve the quality of health care offered to these patients.
