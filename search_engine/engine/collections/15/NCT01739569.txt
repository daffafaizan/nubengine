    
      The study is designed as a randomised controlled 2 x 4 weeks cross-over trial, initiated with
      a 1-week run-in period. The study sample will consist of 60 volunteer physicians, nurses and
      nursing assistants from Herlev University Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. A healthy lunch
      and snack meal meeting the current danish diet recommendations will be delivered daily during
      all working days in the intervention period. During the control period, the participants are
      requested to maintain their habitual dietary intake at work. Reaction time will be assessed
      by reaction time test Go/No-Go, a subtest of Test-battery for Attention Performance. Changes
      in mood will be measured by the Profile of Mood State questionnaire. In addition, dietary
      intake, level of physical activity and palatability of the intervention diet will be
      registered.
