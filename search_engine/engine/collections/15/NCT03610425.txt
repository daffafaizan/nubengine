    
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether there is a difference in outcome measures
      (length of stay, occurrence of readmission, and patient satisfaction) with the addition of a
      post-operative evidence-based bundle/standard pre-operative education compared to standard
      pre-operative education alone that is given to patients prior to a hysterectomy (open,
      vaginal, or laparoscopic).
