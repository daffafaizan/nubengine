        -  To compare miRNA expression in distinctive diagnostic groups: transient
           myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), Down syndrome (DS) acute megakaryocytic leukemia
           (AMkL), non-DS AMkL, and in remission DS samples (representing germline, non-malignant
           samples).

      OUTLINE: Archived RNA samples are analyzed for mature micro (mi)RNA expression by real-time
      RT-PCR. Results are then compared with miRNA expression of non-Down syndrome patients with
      acute megakaryocytic leukemia.
