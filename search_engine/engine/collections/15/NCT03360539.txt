    
      This study is an individual-level randomized controlled trial, with randomization
      post-consent. The study will enroll pregnant women who are income-eligible for Medicaid, less
      than 28 weeks pregnant, and have not had a previous live birth. All eligible applicants who
      provide written consent will be randomly assigned either to a treatment group that is offered
      access to NFP or to a control group that is not. Two-thirds of those recruited will be
      randomized to the treatment group and one-third to the control group. Control group members
      will have access to the standard of care and whatever other programs and services are
      available in the community.

      The investigators will assess the effect of NFP on a range of short- and long-run maternal
      and child outcomes using administrative data that will be available for all members of both
      treatment and control groups. Several of the outcomes the investigators will evaluate are
      required as part of the Medicaid waiver and pay-for-success financing model.
