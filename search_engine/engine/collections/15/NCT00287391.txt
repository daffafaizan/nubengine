      be eligible after the first sleep study (those with significantly poor sleep quality and no
      significant sleep apnea) will be started on 2 weeks 20 mgs, twice-a-day, rabeprazole. Upon
      completion of the 2 week course of rabeprazole, subjects will repeat the overnight pH and
      sleep studies. Upon completion of these studies, participation is complete.
