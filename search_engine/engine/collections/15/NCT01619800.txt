    
      Objective: The goal of this trial is to test the impact of individualized blended sensor
      optimization on chronotropic response, compared with accelerometer use alone, in patients
      with chronotropic incompetence who are planned to undergo permanent pacemaker (PPM)
      implantation.

      Study Population: The study population will consist of patients who suffer from the heart's
      inability to increase its heart rate according to increased physical activity or demand
      (chronotropic incompetence). These patients are planned to undergo permanent pacemaker (PPM)
      implantation.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Improvement in chronotropic competence as defined as an increase in
      age-predicted maximum heart rate (APMHR) which is defined as 220 beats per minute (bpm) minus
      patient's age in years. Age-predicted heart rate reserve (APMHR) defined as APMHR minus
      patient's heart rate at rest. Observe the maximal heart rate during exercise test with
      decrease in oxygen consumption at each stage and also at peak effort.

      SECONDARY ENDPOINT:

        1. Quality of life.

        2. Procedural safety as defined by the number of complications within 1week associated with
           the procedure.
