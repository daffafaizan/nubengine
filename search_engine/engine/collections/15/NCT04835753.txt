      strengthening exercises, neurodevelopmental techniques, proprioceptive training, and balance
      and gait training for three months (3 days/week ,1 hour/day).

      Study group Subjects in this group received the traditional physical therapy treatment plus
      true radial ESWT.A rESW pneumatic device (SHOCK MED, Italy) was used to provide one session
      per week (for a total of 12-week) of shock wave intervention. The pressure pulses were
      focused on the muscle belly of the planter flexor hypertonic muscles. Standard ultrasonic gel
      was used as a contact medium. A total of 1500 shots with a pressure of 1.5 bar and an energy
      flux density (EFD) of 0.030 mJ/mm2 were applied with the repetition frequency of shock wave
      irradiation of 4 pulses per second (Hz). The rESW session lasted about 6 minutes and was
      painless; thus, local anesthesia was not required.
