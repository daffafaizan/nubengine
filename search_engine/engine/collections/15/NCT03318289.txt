      To evaluate the effects of a Ving Tsun (VT) martial exercise programme on reactive balance
      control, lower limb muscle strength, balance confidence and falls in community-dwelling older
      adults.

      Study design:

      This will be a prospective, non-randomised and controlled intervention trial.

      Subjects:

      Approximately 40 healthy older adults will be recruited from elderly community centres by
      convenience sampling through poster advertising. Eligible subjects will be allocated to
      either the VT group (n ≈ 20) or control group (n ≈ 20).

      Outcome measurements:

      All subjects will be assessed before the intervention (baseline tests) and shortly after the
      3-month intervention (post-tests). All subjects, regardless of group assignment, will undergo
      the following baseline tests and post-tests in random order.

      Primary outcome measures Reactive balance control including lower extremity muscle activation
      onset latency and centre of pressure movement in standing.

      Secondary outcome measures Lower extremity (knee) muscle strength, balance confidence and
      fall history.

      Data analysis:

      Data will be analysed using repeated-measures analysis of (co)variance followed by post-hoc
      tests, as appropriate (alpha = 0.05).
