      identify COVID-19 positive individuals.

      The study will address what fraction of outpatients truly have a loss-of-smell (including a
      partial loss) and is expected to outperform the current question that is used to identify
      COVID-19 related anosmia "Do you have a new loss of smell or taste?" (yes/no) in terms of
      sensitivity and specificity.

      The study will address if high-risk asymptomatic people whom are SARS-CoV-2 positive have a
      partial (or perhaps transitory) loss of smell.

      The primary objective of this study is to validate the utility (sensitivity, specificity and
      accuracy) of a quantitative non-biased olfactory device for the rapid identification of
      SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects (as identified by PCR). The performance of the device will also
      be compared to the standard CDC patient query for 'new loss of smell or taste'.

      The secondary objective is to test if SARS-CoV-2 positive 'asymptomatic' COVID-19 subjects
      may actually present with a mild or transitory defect in smell (hyposmia), which is revealed
      through our quantitative olfactory smell test.
