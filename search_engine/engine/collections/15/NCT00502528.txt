      at the epicardial and microvascular levels. We have previously shown that thrombectomy in
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) accelerates ST-segment resolution, possibly by
      preventing distal embolization. Therefore, we analyzed the vasoconstrictor concentration of
      acute coronary thrombi, and found high concentrations of endothelin (ET) which correlated
      with the magnitude of ST-segment resolution within one hour of percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI). Furthermore, ET-receptor blockade by tezosentan significantly repressed
      vasoconstriction in an in-vitro model using porcine coronary artery rings incubated with
      coronary thrombus homogenates extracted from STEMI patients.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of ET-receptor blockade by BQ-123
      on myocardial perfusion and infarct size as an adjunct to PCI-reperfusion therapy in patients
      with STEMI.

      Methods: Fifty eligible patients will be randomized to receive periinterventional intravenous
      BQ-123 or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study will be microvascular function evaluated
      by cardiac magnetic resonance tomography.
