      one of the following treatment groups for the first 12 weeks of dosing: 150 mg elagolix once
      daily (q.d.); 250 mg elagolix q.d.; placebo; or leuprorelin acetate depot injection 3.75 mg
      (monthly). Blinding was achieved using a double-dummy design. Following 12 weeks of dosing,
      participants continued in the study for an additional 12 weeks; participants randomized to
      elagolix continued to receive their assigned dose and participants randomized to placebo or
      leuprorelin acetate were re-randomized to receive one of the two doses of elagolix (150 mg
      q.d. or 250 mg q.d.) for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. Six weeks after the last dose of
      the study drug at the end of Week 24, a follow-up visit was performed (end of Week 30).

      There was no pre-specified primary efficacy end point as there was no single key efficacy
      outcome measure in this exploratory Phase 2 study. For purposes of results reported here,
      Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Numerical Rating Score (NRS) for Endometriosis Pain
      is designated as the primary outcome measure.
