      the efficacy of PriMatrix MWT versus Standard of Care MWT in achieving complete wound closure
      of chronic diabetic foot ulcers by 12 weeks (84 days). To measure wound recidivism and
      changes in functional quality of life, each subject will complete the Cardiff Wound Impact
      Schedule and the SF-36v2™ at three time points during the study i) at initial screening, ii)
      at completion of treatment phase, and iii)at 24 weeks (post-randomization). Additionally, the
      data obtained from the SF-36v2™ will be used in an economic evaluation of the treatment arms.
