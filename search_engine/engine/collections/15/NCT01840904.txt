      disturbances in sleep architecture, mediated by cytokines. some studies showed that cytokines
      also induce daytime fatigue. In this study the investigators aim to describe the patient
      experiences of sleep and fatigue during the acute inflammation and the recovery, and the
      investigators seek to exam the correlation of fatigue with Polysomnography-measured night
      sleep and cytokine levels in plasma.
