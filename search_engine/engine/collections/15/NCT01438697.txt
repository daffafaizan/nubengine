      maintaining sleep more than 3 nights/week for more than 6 months. Insomnia may contribute to
      daytime fatigue, impaired performance, confused thinking and judgment, and difficulty with
      work and personal tasks. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to have
      significant short- and long-term benefits for people with insomnia. Access to CBT for many
      people, however, is limited, due to the high cost of treatment and a limited number of
      trained professionals. Delivering CBT for insomnia via the Internet could help make it more
      widely available. This study will compare the effectiveness of an online CBT intervention in
      improving sleep, mood, and quality of life in people with insomnia to that of a static
      educational website.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive the online CBT intervention
      or the static patient education website. The intervention period will last for 9 weeks.
      During the intervention period, participants assigned to the patient education website will
      be given content addressing strategies for dealing with insomnia. Those assigned to use the
      Internet intervention will review interactive, tailored content specific to the user's
      difficulties. Participants will complete questionnaires and two weeks of daily sleep diaries
      about their symptoms at four time points - at the beginning of the study, immediately after
      completing the 9 week program, 6 months later, and 12 months later.
