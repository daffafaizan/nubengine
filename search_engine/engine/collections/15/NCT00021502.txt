    
      This Phase 3, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center study is designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of continuous IV infusion of PHP plus conventional vasopressor treatment,
      as compared to continuous IV infusion of Plasma-Lyte A plus conventional vasopressor, as a
      treatment for restoring hemodynamic stability in SIRS patients with shock. Conventional
      vasopressors include dopamine > 5 mcg/kg/min; or norepinephrine, phenylephrine or epinephrine
      at any dose.

      The study consists of a Screening period, a Pre-Treatment period, and a 28-day Treatment
      period. Efficacy will be determined by evaluating objective clinical measures of mortality
      and organ function over the 28-day treatment period.

      The safety and tolerability of PHP will be evaluated over the continuous 28 days using a
      number of measures including an evaluation of:

        -  all cause mortality,

        -  median patient survival time and

        -  adverse event rates and duration.
