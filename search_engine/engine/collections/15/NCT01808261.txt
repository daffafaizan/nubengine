    
      Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is one of the key proteins known to inhibit neuronal
      regeneration when released from oligodendrocytes in conditions of neuronal injury, such as
      stroke. GSK249320 is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high specificity
      to MAG and antagonises or neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition and has been shown to improve
      functional recovery after stroke in pre-clinical models, possibly by promoting
      neuroregeneration and plasticity. The present study (MAG104615) is designed to establish
      Proof of Concept (PoC) for GSK249320 in ischemic stroke patients. MAG104615 will be a
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, repeat dose, Bayesian design
      study. PoC will be achieved by demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in lower
      limb motor recovery, specifically by evaluating changes in gait velocity from baseline to Day
      90/Month 3. Subjects will also be followed out to Day 180/Month 6 to further evaluate longer
      term motor recovery and safety. Additional secondary efficacy measures of motor recovery will
      be evaluated to further demonstrate and characterize the extent and duration of overall motor
      recovery after treatment with GSK249320. Changes in disability and neurological impairment
      will be characterized after treatment with GSK249320 and explored for how they relate to
      motor recovery. This PoC study will also further characterize the safety, PK, and
      immunogenicity of GSK249320 will explore pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, and will explore use
      of actigraphy to measure motor recovery. Subjects will be stratified by gait velocity at
      baseline for randomization (1:1 allocation) into one of two treatment groups: 15mg/kg
      GSK249320, or placebo. Each subject will receive 2 repeat IV doses of GSK249320 or placebo.
