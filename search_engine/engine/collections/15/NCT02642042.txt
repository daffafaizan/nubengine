    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed) to trametinib plus docetaxel in
      the entire study population of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation
      positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients following one or two prior systemic
      therapies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if trametinib plus docetaxel is consistent with promise of activity measured
      by the response rate in G12C KRAS mutation positive NSCLC patients following one or two prior
      systemic therapies.

      II. To assess the response rate of this combination in non-G12C KRAS mutation positive NSCLC
      patients.

      III. To assess progression-free survival within the G12C and non-G12C KRAS positive subgroups
      and the entire study population.

      IV. To evaluate the toxicity of the regimen. V. To assess overall survival within G12C
      positive patients, non-G12C positive patients, and the entire study population.

      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rates in the presence of comutations p53 and LKB1. II. To bank
      specimens for future research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) on days 1-21. Patients also receive docetaxel
      intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
