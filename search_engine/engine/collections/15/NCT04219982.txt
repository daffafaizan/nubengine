    
      Each subject eligible for the study on Day 0 will be assigned a subject number (starting with
      101 for male subjects and 201 for female subjects) in consecutive order which will randomize
      the subject to one of the three study arms: double-blind DPI-386 Nasal Gel; double-blind
      placebo nasal gel; or Transderm ScopÂ® (TDS). The subject number will link the nasal gel
      (active or placebo) treatment arms (double-blind) to a multi digit random number (study drug
      kit number) different from the subject number. The nasal gel vials, contained in the study
      drug kit, will be labelled with the same study drug kit number. Each 0.12 gram of the gel
      contains 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr as the active ingredient along with the excipients sodium
      citrate, citric acid, sodium metabisulfite, glycerin, benzalkonium chloride, polyvinyl
      alcohol, and purified water.
