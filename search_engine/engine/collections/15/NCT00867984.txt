      risk for death and hospitalization. Over 25% of patients with systolic HF have dyssynchronous
      ventricular contraction that impairs left ventricular (LV) function and results in HF
      progression. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is designed to synchronize ventricular
      mechanical activity, improving cardiac output and reducing HF symptoms. As shown in our pilot
      data, at least 40% of patients do not respond to CRT despite pre-screening for the presence
      of longitudinal (long axis) mechanical (velocity) dyssynchrony and targeting LV lead
      placement to the latest site of latest velocity. Methods to improve the rates of response to
      CRT are required. Torsion imaging guided optimization of CRT timing is a promising approach
      and will be tested in this study.

      Primary hypothesis: Optimization of inter-ventricular (VV) timing, guided by torsion imaging,
      will increase functional capacity and reduce LV end systolic volume [ESV] in CRT in patients
      who have not responded after ≥ 6 months. CRT response will be defined by a ≥ 1 functional
      class improvement and either a ≥ 10% reduction in LV ESV or a ≥ 5% increase in EF at
      follow-up versus baseline.

      Secondary aims: To compare the following in torsion-guided vs usual care patients: a) echo
      parameters (intra-LV and VV dyssynchrony and torsion, and mitral regurgitation), b)
      N-terminal BNP levels, and c) generic / disease-specific quality of life.

      Methods: Randomized study of patients who have not responded to CRT after ≥ 6 months.
