    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the 48-hour trough serum asparaginase activity is ? 0.1 IU/mL in young
      patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with Erwinia asparaginase after allergy to
      PEG-asparaginase.

      II. To determine the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicity in these patients.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of Erwinia asparaginase in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare serum asparaginase activity and serum asparagine concentration between patients
      treated with Erwinia asparaginase on this trial and historical controls treated with
      PEG-asparaginase on CCG-1961 and CCG-1962.

      II. To determine the 72-hour serum asparaginase activity on days 8 or 11 or 13 based on the
      starting date of Erwinia asparaginase therapy.

      III. To determine the presence of anti-Erwinia asparaginase antibodies in patients treated
      with a course(s) of Erwinia asparaginase following clinical allergy to PEG-asparaginase (PEG,
      pegaspargase).

      IV. To determine if serum asparagine is adequately depleted on days 12 or 13 in a subset of
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 6 doses of Erwinia asparaginase intramuscularly (IM) on a
      Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule as a replacement for each scheduled dose of PEG-asparaginase
      remaining on the original treatment protocol. All other chemotherapy continues according to
      the original treatment protocol.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and antibody
      studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
