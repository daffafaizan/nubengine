           treatment options and a lack of available resources. Their physicians were likewise
           perplexed, despite the endless acquisition of negative laboratory and imaging data as
           well as inconclusive consultations obtained. In the last 10 years, improved scientiﬁc
           understanding and increased physician awareness have lessened the confusion surrounding
           this condition and its distinct association with pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).
           Furthermore, reﬁnements of medical and minimally invasive surgical solutions give
           affected patients more therapeutic choices today.

        -  Since anatomical venous variations in the pelvis are common, it is important to know the
           anatomy of these vessels for treatment planning. Imaging is critical in the evaluation
           of pelvic varices, both to differentiate them from other condition and also because
           pelvic varices may be secondary to serious underlying pathology, such as inferior vena
           caval obstruction, portal hypertension, increased pelvic blood flow, and vascular
           malformations.

      Sonographic findings of pelvic congestion syndrome were dilated left ovarian vein with
      reversed caudal flow, presence of varicocele, dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine
      myometrium, polycystic changes of the ovary, and variable duplex waveform during the
      Valsalva's maneuver. Combined transabdominal and transvaginal sonography are potentially
      useful as a noninvasive screening & grading tool for determining which patients with chronic
      pelvic pain may benefit from selective ovarian venography and transcatheter embolization
