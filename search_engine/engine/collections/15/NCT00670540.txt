      outpatients clinically suspected of thromboembolic disease. Deep vein thrombosis is diagnosed
      using a duplex ultrasound examination, whereas pulmonary embolism is investigated by lung
      scan scintigraphy or computed helical tomodensitometry and/or duplex ultrasound examination.
      Initial data on medical history, clinical symptoms, presence of transient and chronic risk
      factors, diagnosis at the end of the medical examination, diagnostic tests results, treatment
      (type and duration) are collected by the physician into an electronic medical record. Other
      general medical considerations are collected (particularly on cardiovascular diseases). A
      phone follow up at 3 months, 1, 2 and 3 years is realised by the Centre for Clinical Research
      of Grenoble. All Venous ThromboEmbolism (VTE) positive patients (including superficial vein
      thrombosis) are contacted. For each VTE positive a negative one is selected (same site, same
      season). Data on mortality, development or recurrence of VTE, treatments prescribed (type +
      duration), major bleeding, cancer onset, cardiovascular events and venous insufficiency (leg
      ulcer) are collected. All these serious adverse events are documented and reviewed by an
      independent critical events committee.
