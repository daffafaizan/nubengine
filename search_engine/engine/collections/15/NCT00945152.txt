      of treatment and have had microbiological studies establishing the same MIC zones in culture
      media greater than 15mm over a 33 month time frame. The microbiological and HPLC studies are
      completed at present and approved. I have started the phase 2 studies on August 1,2011 as
      authorized by the FDA on June 22,2011.
