      psychiatric, social and economic consequences. It is generally accepted that the euphoria
      associated with cocaine use is a result of its action on reward pathways via antagonist
      properties at the dopamine transporter site; cocaine also inhibits reuptake of serotonin and
      norepinephrine. These actions are thought to underlie cocaine's potent reinforcing
      properties. With prolonged use, cocaine may deplete these neurotransmitters, affect
      postsynaptic receptor density, and elicit an overall dysregulation of these neurotransmitter
      systems. These longer term consequences may account for the post-cocaine depressive symptoms
      often claimed by cocaine users to contribute to relapse. Treatment for cocaine dependence at
      the present is primarily psychosocial/behavioral. Currently there is no pharmacological agent
      approved for treatment of cocaine dependence in conjunction with psychosocial interventions.
      Several drugs currently approved for other indications are presently under consideration for
      treatment of cocaine dependence based on their known mechanisms and sites of action. Current
      approaches include strategies to (1) block the effects of cocaine, (2) substitutes for
      cocaine, (3) reduce craving or enhance the addict's ability to manage his/her response to
      craving, and (4) treat underlying conditions (or consequences of cocaine use) that may
      predispose toward dependence.
