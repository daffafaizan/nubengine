    
      In Part A, escalating doses of DKN-01 will be administered to different cohorts of patients
      to evaluate safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to establish the maximum tolerated
      dose of DKN-01 when administered in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

      Part B is an expansion cohort in which patients are treated at the MTD of DKN-01 (or highest
      dose tested if the MTD is not defined) to further characterize safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy within the defined patient population.
