    
      This Phase 2b multicenter study, which is being conducted solely in the United States,
      consists of a randomized, double-blind, monotherapy period, where patients will receive
      either viramidine or placebo for 4 weeks. After the monotherapy period, all patients will
      receive viramidine plus peginterferon alfa-2b combination therapy for 48 weeks in an
      open-label fashion and will then participate in a 24-week follow-up period after completion
      of combination therapy. The RVR at CT Week 4 between groups receiving a standard combination
      peginterferon alfa-2b/viramidine dosing regimen versus a cohort that receives 4 weeks of
      viramidine monotherapy prior to the start of peginterferon alfa-2b/viramidine combination
      therapy will be examined. The differences in virological response during treatment and end of
      follow-up between African-Americans and Caucasians (non-Hispanics), as well as a correlation
      between duration of viral negativity (DVN) and sustained virologic response (SVR) based on
      race and dosing regimen, will also be assessed.
