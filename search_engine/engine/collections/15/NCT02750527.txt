    
      The Fr1dolin-Study will be presented to the parents of ca. 320,000 children living in Lower
      Saxony, Germany. The recruitment of subjects, collection of written consent, the capillary
      blood sample and the screening questionnaire will be done by the registered pediatricians in
      their local medical practices.

      After study enrolment 200 Âµl of capillary blood are be taken from the subject and are sent
      pseudo-anonymized to the lab. LDL-C and the diabetes-associated antibodies are identified.
      Based on the results a second blood sample will be required. In case of pre-type-1 diabetes
      or signs for a familial hypercholesterolemia the pediatrician will be informed. He will
      contact the parents and discuss the further procedure in cooperation with the study center.

      In case of a positive result by measuring diabetes-related antibodies and LDL-C the goal of
      this trial is to advise and educate the families appropriate and to treat them if necessary.
      In addition families should have the possibility to participate in prevention trials.

      All data will be registered in a study database.
