      imagination to a relaxed and focused state. In clinical settings, it was originally found
      effective in treating patients suffering primarily from emotional or psychological issues by
      using descriptive language and the five senses to help the patient visualize their desired
      change or outcome (1, 2). More recently, GIM has been incorporated into chemotherapy and
      surgical settings. While it has not been conclusively found to improve outcomes, patients who
      received GIM reported feeling less anxious, less nausea following chemotherapy, slightly
      shorter surgical recovery times and a higher quality of life (3-8). While these studies
      suggest exciting prospects for the incorporation of GIM into the normal pre-op routine, we
      believe that they have left out one integral piece of the puzzle. We have previously found
      that patients who feel "unprepared" for surgery have less post-operative satisfaction (9). We
      propose that the stress and anxiety of the unknown during a patient's surgical experience can
      make them feel unprepared for surgery. Therefore, the same techniques that have been
      previously shown to decrease these symptoms in chemotherapy treatment and surgery should help
      patients feel more prepared, and therefore more satisfied with their surgical experience.
      This key finding would give sufficient support for the incorporation of GIM into the pre-op
      routine of any surgical patient, and may prove to be a successful vehicle for increasing the
      overall satisfaction of any hospital's patient population.
