      conduct in 1995 to 2015 (87.1% 1995, 76.2% 2005 and 71.3% 2015) [NOHPS 2015], yet the
      difference is just 15.8% in a period of 20 years. One of the factors which contribute to the
      development of ECC in children in prolonged bottle-feeding. Many literatures had mentioned
      association of bottle feeding and ECC however there are no controlled studies done on the
      effect of bottle feeding and ECC. Despite antenatal oral health promotion program done by
      Ministry of Health Malaysia and incorporation of oral hygiene education and oral hygiene
      instruction during dental visit, the prevalence of ECC remains high. This study will provide
      evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral health promotion in preventing early childhood
      caries by early termination of bottle feeding in toddlers.
