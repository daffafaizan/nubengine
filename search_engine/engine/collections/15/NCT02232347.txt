      the effects of ketamine versus sufentanil on brain glutamate concentrations measured with
      microdialysis.

      Ketamine is an anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) medication. It is supposed to limit
      excitotoxicity of amino-acids, especially glutamate. Glutamate is known to be elevated in
      more than 60% of the severe head trauma patients. It induces cortical spreading depression
      which can aggravate prognosis. It's a daily used medication in anesthesia and intensive care
      units for sedation and induction of anesthesia. It's the recommended medication for induction
      of unstable wounded soldiers on the field because of its neutrality on haemodynamic state.

      Sufentanil is the reference opioid for sedation in ICU in Europe. It can induce hypotension
      which is deleterious for cerebral perfusion pressure after brain trauma.

      In our unit, patients with severe head injury are monitored by a triple lumen access device
      including ICP (IntraCerebral Pressure), PtiO2 (oxygen pressure in the brain) and
      microdialysis. This last monitoring allows measurement of brain parenchymal concentrations of
      small molecules : glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, glycerol,.... It's a tool to
      evaluate the metabolic state of the brain divided into 4 categories : normal,
      hyperglycolysis, ischemia and metabolic crisis.

      Then, we will detail the effects of ketamine on metabolic state of the brain, especially
      glutamate concentration. Normal values are below 10 micromol/ml. After head trauma it can
      dramatically increase to values up to 50 or even 100 micromol/ml, with normalization after 24
      hours. Ketamine is expected to decrease these high values faster than described in
      observational studies.
