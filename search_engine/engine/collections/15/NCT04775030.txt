      molecules will be released from the occlusal appliance during nighttime, in population of
      patients suffering from TMD. The effectiveness of the myorelaxation (sEMG of mastcatory
      muscles activity) and analgesic effect( VAS analysis) of occlusal appliance with the CBD
      molecules will be compared to the traditional acrylic-resin material used so far for occlusal
      appliance manufacture. The aim of the research is the evaluation of the innovative material
      effectiveness, used for the production of the occlusal appliance.
