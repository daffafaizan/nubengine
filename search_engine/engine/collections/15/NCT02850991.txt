      I. To determine if high-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy increases overall
      survival for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if high-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy increased progression-free
      survival for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma II.To evaluate if high-dose
      radiation with concurrent chemotherapy increased local control for thoracic esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms

      ARM 1:Patients receive high-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy.High-dose RT:59.4 Gy
      in 33 fractions, 1.8 Gy per fraction, 5days/week.concurrent chemotherapy: Paclitaxel 50mg/m2
      D1+carboplatin AUC (area under curve) =2 D1, weekly for 6 weeks. After that, patients receive
      consolidative platinum-based 3-week chemotherapy for 2 cycles.

      ARM 2:Patients receive standard-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy.Standard-dose
      RT:59.4 Gy in 33 fractions, 1.8 Gy per fraction, 5days/week . Concurrent chemotherapy:
      Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 D1+carboplatin AUC (area under curve) =2 D1, weekly for 6 weeks. After
      that, patients receive consolidative platinum-based 3-week chemotherapy for 2 cycles.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
