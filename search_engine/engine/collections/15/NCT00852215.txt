      bare metal stent (BMS). However, the long-term safety of DES is still uncertain. Recent
      meta-analysis showed that very late stent thrombosis rate was higher in DES group although
      overall mortality was similar between 2 groups.

      The safety issue of DES was first suggested in the BASKET-LATE study, which compared cobalt
      chromium alloy BMS (VISIONÂ®, Guidant, USA) with sirolimus- or paclitaxel-coated DES. The
      study showed a significantly higher rate of death or myocardial infarction in the DES group
      between 7 and 18 month after the procedure (BMS 1.3%, DES 4.9%, p=0.01). Moreover, benefit to
      reduce target vessel revascularization was not found and there was even the possibility of
      late harm in patients treated with DES in large native vessels.

      We perform a multicenter prospective randomized study comparing paclitaxel-eluting stent with
      cobalt chromium stent several years, originally to see whether major adverse cardiac event is
      significantly lower in DES compared to thin-strut BMS in the non-complex lesion subset. In
      this article, we would like to investigate the 2-year clinical events in DES and BMS groups.
