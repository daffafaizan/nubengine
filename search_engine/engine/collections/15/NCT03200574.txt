    
      This is a prospective, interventional, multi-center trial to report the overall incidence of
      reduced leaflet motion identified by CT imaging in patients receiving a commercially approved
      LivaNova bioprosthetic aortic heart valve up to 1 year post implant, on patients that are off
      anticoagulation for at least 30 days. A minimum of 75 subjects with evaluable 4D CT scans
      will be enrolled at approximately 11 investigational sites where the devices are commercially
      available. For asymptomatic subjects, PIs and subjects will be blinded from the CT imaging
      results and from the Core Lab findings.
