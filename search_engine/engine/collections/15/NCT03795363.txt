      fibrosis (CF) who are 2 to 5 years of age and homozygous for F508del mutations in the CFTR
      gene. It is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor that addresses both the processing and
      gating defects of the F508del mutation. This investigator-initiated study is designed to
      evaluate the nutritional, growth and GI impact of Orkambi treatment for this unique younger
      (2 to 5 years) patient cohort. This proposal extends previous highly informative nutrition
      and weight gain investigation of ivacaftor treatment in people with CF gating mutations to
      another CFTR modulator treatment (Orkambi) in people homozygous for F508del mutations. The
      primary aims of the study are to evaluate the impact of 24 weeks of Orkambi treatment in 2 to
      5 year old subjects with CF homozygous for F508del mutations on sleeping or resting energy
      expenditure, growth status and gut health and function in n=32 children ages 2.0 to 5.9 years
      of age. Protocol evaluations will occur at baseline (pre-treatment) and 12 and 24 weeks after
      clinically prescribed Orkambi treatment has begun. Other outcomes of significant clinical
      interest in young subjects with CF will be explored. All subjects will be evaluated as
      outpatient at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and will be recruited both regionally
      and nationally to ensure timely enrollment.
