    
      Subjects with non-neurogenic over-active bladder and urge predominant incontinence who are
      intolerant to medical therapy or have persistence of symptoms despite medical therapy and
      require augmentation cystoplasty will be enrolled. The hypothesis is that augmentation
      cystoplasty using an autologous neo-bladder construct will increase functional capacity and
      thereby reduce the number of micturition episodes per day in subjects with non-neurogenic
      over active bladder and urge predominant incontinence.
