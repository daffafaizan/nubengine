      process. It is important to inspect data for outliers, wild code, and consistency to maintain
      the data quality in the pre-analysis data phase. We will assess the amount and pattern of
      missing values by using descriptive statistics, such as frequency and percentage. The pattern
      of missing data will be identified and decide whether the missing completely at random or
      not. The appropriate corresponding method will be adopted for the subsequent statistical
      analyses. For example, the mean imputation is considered when the percentage of items missing
      at a given questionnaire is less than 10 %. The mean imputation will be used to replaces a
      missing value with the item mean when applicable. The comparison between complete case
      analysis and imputation data will be performed to assess the reliability and validity of the
      results.
