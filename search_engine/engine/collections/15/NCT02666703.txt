    
      Patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery with CPB (eg: combined valve and coronary bypass
      grafting surgery, concomitant valve surgery, surgery of the ascending aorta and aortic arch,
      as well as re-operations of the same type) will be enrolled in the study after giving the
      signed informed consent. They will be randomized into 3 groups: 1. study (CytoSorb) group, 2.
      control group, and 3. corticosteroid group. Immune response [TNF-alfa (tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha), IL(interleukin)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, complement C5a, lymphocyte cellular
      markers (CD64, CD163), miRNA (micro RNA), PON1 activity, as well as lipid status, hs-CRP
      (high sensitivity C-reactive protein), PCT (procalcitonin) and acute phase proteins, will be
      determined before CPB, during CPB, immediately after, 24h, 48h and 5 days after CPB. We will
      document demographic characteristics of patients, their preoperative medical status, as well
      as intraoperative data (type and duration of surgery, duration of CPB, period of ischemia,
      hemodynamic parameters, usage of inotropic/vasoactive therapy, insulin, fluids, blood and
      blood components); duration of mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU), duration
      of ICU stay, 30-day mortality and morbidity, as well as postoperative complications
      (bleeding, hemodynamic instability, impaired respiratory function, infection, worsening of
      renal, liver and cognitive function).
