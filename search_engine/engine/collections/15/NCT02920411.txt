      formulated to serve as adjuvants in the management of Atopic Dermatitis. Both products
      contain Dermosense complex®, a complex that includes 3 products: Bodyfensine peptide®
      (inductor of dephensine synthesis against microbial aggressions), Unimoist® (the mimetizing
      complex of the skin's natural hydration factor), and Ramnosoft® (polysaccharide that inhibits
      the adhesion of pro-inflammatory drugs and bacteria, while limiting the spread of
      inflammatory reactions in skin cells). They also contain Bisabolol, (plant extract with
      anti-inflammatory, anti-irritant and antimicrobial properties) and Panthenol (Pro vitamin B5
      that accelerates the skin's natural regeneration process).
