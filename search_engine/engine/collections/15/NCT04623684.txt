      mydriatic efficacy and safety of microdrops (6-7 μL) compared with standard drops (28-34 μL)
      for retinopathy of prematurity screening. A random number table was used to allocate
      participants into either a) receiving standard drop on their first and microdrop on their
      second screening examination a week later, or b) receiving microdrop first and standard drop
      a week later. The mydriatic agent contains phenylephrine 1.67% and tropicamide 0.33%, which
      derives from compounding the commercial phenylephrine 5% with the commercial tropicamide 0.5%
      in volume ratio 1:2.
