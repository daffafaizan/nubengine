      adult age, can take medium-high quantity of oat (50-100 g/day), without any negative clinical
      effects.

      In a small number of cases intestinal dyspeptic disorders, especially meteorism, can be
      observed, particularly during the first weeks of oat intake. They are generally without
      clinical significance because they are a consequence of the increased fibre intake.

      There are only few cases of "true" oats intolerance. The addition of oat improves the
      nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet, particularly due to the increased intake of
      fibre and some oligoelements (iron, zinc, tiamin, pholates) and expands the spectrum of food
      choices.

      In many Northern European countries oat-based products have been used in the dieto-therapy of
      coeliac disease for many years.

      For the oat-based product to be considered suitable in the dieto-therapy of coeliac disease,
      the absence of gluten contamination and possibly the origin from a variety of oat which is
      without traces of gluten cross-reactive peptides must be guaranteed.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical tolerance and liking of gluten-free
      products containing oatmeal from a specific oat variety (not contaminated with gluten) in a
      sample of Italian celiac patients in pediatric age.
