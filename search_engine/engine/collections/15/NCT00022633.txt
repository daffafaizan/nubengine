        -  Determine the feasibility of enrolling patients aged 70 years and older with advanced or
           recurrent urothelial cancer to a structured phase II study.

        -  Determine the anticancer efficacy of gemcitabine and paclitaxel, in terms of objective
           response rate and 2-year survival, in these elderly patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these elderly patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of using standardized self-report measures of comorbidity,
           depression, and functional status in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these elderly patients and validate
           this data against similar parameters in patients aged under 60 years.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (70 and over
      vs under 60).

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (60 age 70 and over and 20 under age 60) will be
      accrued for this study.
