      bronchodilator on the small and central airways and thereby increasing ventilated lung
      volume, gas exchange, and ventilation-perfusion deficits.

      The study investigated the effect of QVA149 on global and regional lung ventilation using MRI
      lung imaging to enhance the understanding of QVA pharmacology in COPD patients.
