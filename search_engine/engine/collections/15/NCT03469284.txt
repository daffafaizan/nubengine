      I. To evaluate the efficacy of methylene blue (MB) in reducing the severity of
      mucositis-related pain, measured by numeric rating scale (NRS), in cancer patients who
      underwent or are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP 1: Patients receive lower dose methylene blue orally (PO) to swish and spit for 5
      minutes every 6 hours then receive standard of care therapy.

      GROUP 2: Patients receive medium dose methylene blue PO to swish and spit for 5 minutes every
      6 hours then receive standard of care therapy.

      GROUP 3: Patients receive higher dose methylene blue PO to swish and spit for 5 minutes every
      6 hours then receive standard of care therapy.

      GROUP 4: Patients receive standard of care therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 7, and 30 days.
