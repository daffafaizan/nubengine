      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of methoxyamine given in conjunction with
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) in subjects with relapsed or refractory hematologic
      malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities of the combination of methoxyamine and
      fludarabine.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of methoxyamine when given in combination with
      fludarabine.

      III. To evaluate pharmacodynamic endpoints including apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites and
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks in blood mononuclear cells to explore the in vivo
      mechanism of action of methoxyamine and identify the biologically optimal dose to be combined
      with fludarabine.

      VI. To determine the disease specific toxicity and biologic activity in a cohort of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of methoxyamine.

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and
      methoxyamine IV over 1 hour on day 1 (day 2 of course 1). Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.
