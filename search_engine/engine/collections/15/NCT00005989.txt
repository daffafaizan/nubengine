        -  Assess the response rate of patients with recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung
           cancer when treated with tipifarnib.

        -  Determine the clinical toxicities of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Assess the overall survival and time to progression of this patient population when
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the inhibition of protein farnesylation in vivo and correlate such inhibition
           to plasma levels of tipifarnib.

        -  Evaluate the occurrence of CYP450 polymorphisms and relate these to drug toxicity,
           pharmacokinetics, and response to this treatment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
