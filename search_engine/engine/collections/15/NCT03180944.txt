      detection of early esophageal squamous neoplasia. However, this modality may cause severe
      chest pain and discomfort owing to mucosal irritation. The conventional concentration of
      Lugol's solution is in the range of 1.2% to 2.5% . Image quality can be guaranteed with this
      range of Lugol's solution. However, lead to retrosternal pain and discomfort, and can even
      induce erosion or ulceration in the esophagus and stomach. This study was to test whether a
      lower concentration of Lugol's solution, which has minimal mucosal irritation, can provide
      satisfied image quality by a randomized blinded controlled trial.
