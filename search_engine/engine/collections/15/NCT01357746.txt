      echo-doppler equipment are fraught with uncertainty. So much so that patients being screened
      and followed for pulmonary arterial hypertension require right heart catheterization. An
      invasive and uncomfortable and potentially dangerous procedure.

      This study is designed to confirm our preliminary observation that there is good correlation
      between Valsalva maneuver pressure and pulmonary arterial blood pressure.

      Sixty patients undergoing right heart catheterization for clinical reasons will be studied.

      The study itself is short, about 30 minutes, painless and done with the patient either
      sitting up in bed or semi-reclining. The probe is positioned over the right chest wall and
      the patient is requested to successively blow into a mouthpiece at rising pressures, to
      tolerance.

      The results obtained using TPD to asses pulmonary arterial pressure will be compared to the
      results obtained at catheterization.

      This is part of the development phase of the technology.
