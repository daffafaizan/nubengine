      normal elderly control subjects will receive both [18F]-AV-45 and [11C]PIB to compare the
      diagnostic performance characteristics of each amyloid ligand to distinguish AD from normal
      subjects. In addition to clinical diagnostic category, ligand retention will be evaluated
      with respect to measures of symptom severity and cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid and
      tau.
