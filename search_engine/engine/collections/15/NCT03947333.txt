      will be assigned to receive access to the intervention (My Diabetes Care) embedded within an
      existing patient web portal (My Health at Vanderbilt) at Vanderbilt University Medical
      Center. 150 will be assigned to a usual care comparison arm with access currently available
      version of My Health at Vanderbilt without the My Diabetes Care. Patients will be invited by
      mail (or email) to be screened for enrollment in the study. Eligible and interested patients
      will be emailed a link to a secure study website where they will complete a web consent form.
      At enrollment, participants will complete a baseline questionnaire and diabetes health data
      will be abstracted from the patients' electronic health record (EHR) before being randomized
      to the intervention or control arm. Participants will receive additional follow-up
      questionnaires and diabetes health data will be abstracted from the EHR at 3-month and
      6-month follow-ups to assess outcomes. In addition, system usage data (My Health at
      Vanderbilt and My Diabetes Dashboard user analytics) will be collected throughout the study
      period.
