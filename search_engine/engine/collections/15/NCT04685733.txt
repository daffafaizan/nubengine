    
      Comparison studies comparing hemodynamic parameters provided by the Caretaker against
      respective Gold Standard references.

      Specifically, continuous beat-by-beat blood pressure readings against arterial catheter
      readings, continuous beat-by-beat left ventricular ejection times (LVET) against matching
      LVETs obtained from central catheters, cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) measures
      against thermo-dilution and Fick measurements, and standard HRV parameters based on
      Caretaker-provided inter-beat intervals (IBI) against the same HRV parameters obtained from
      ECG-based IBIs.
