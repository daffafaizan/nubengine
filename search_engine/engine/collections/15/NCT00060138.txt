        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody CAL vs zoledronate in women
           with breast cancer and bone metastases.

        -  Compare, preliminarily, the potential effects of these drugs on skeletal
           events/manifestations related to bone metastases, including hypercalcemia, bone pain,
           bone metastatic lesions, complications (e.g., pathologic fracture and spinal cord
           compression), and interventions (e.g., surgery and radiotherapy) in these patients.

        -  Compare changes in ECOG performance status in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibody CAL in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to average prestudy pain score on question 3 of a daily electronic telephone pain
      diary (less than 3 vs 3 or more) and prior bisphosphonate therapy (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody CAL IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a lower dose of monoclonal antibody CAL as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive a lower dose (lower than arm II) of monoclonal antibody CAL as
           in arm I.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment in all
           arms repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients keep a pain diary throughout study participation.

      Patients are followed at 24 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (18 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
