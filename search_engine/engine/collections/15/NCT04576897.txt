    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the severity of portal hypertension in people with
      compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) who have not undergone liver transplant by
      measuring liver stiffness with the Liver Incytes device and to compare the performance of LSM
      (liver stiffness measurement) by Liver Incytes for predicting clinically significant portal
      hypertension CSPH, esophageal and gastric varices to that of FibroScanÂ® and other
      non-invasive blood markers such as MELD, CPT, platelets count, splenomegaly (enlarged
      spleen), APRI and FIB4.
