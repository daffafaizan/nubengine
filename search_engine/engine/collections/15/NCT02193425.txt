    
      Objectives: The overarching goal of this study is to quantify the reproducibility of multiple
      measures of brain functional connectivity (FC) during resting conditions and during task
      performance. Secondary objectives are to assess the dynamic properties and energy
      requirements of the human brain connectome as well as the effects of physiologic noise,
      gender and aging on measures of brain functional connectivity at rest and during task
      performance.

      Study population: 60 healthy males and 60 healthy females 18 years or older will be included.

      Design: Participants will undergo two MRI/MRS sessions to evaluate test-retest reliability of
      FC at rest as well as during task performance, and one 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET
      session to assess the association between FC and glucose metabolism in the human brain.

      Outcome parameters: The variability of the gender and aging effects on FC measures (lFCD, L,
      C, and S) collected in RS and TS conditions , which will be quantified using volxelwise ICC.
      The variability of brain metabolite concentrations in precuneus.
