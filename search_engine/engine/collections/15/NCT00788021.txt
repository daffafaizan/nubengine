      of immunosuppressed recipients poses a unique challenge in development of immunization and
      containment strategies to protect the population from communicable pathogens and weaponized
      infectious agents. The immunosuppressive regimens that have allowed the emergence of
      successful transplant therapy not only inhibit T cell-dependent rejection but also cause
      systemic immunosuppression, which attenuates the response to vaccines in general and
      precludes the use of live attenuated vaccines. To date, there has been relatively little
      detailed systematic study of the immune alterations that accompany either the short- or
      long-term immunosuppressive regimens used in clinical organ transplantation. Despite the
      recent development of increasingly effective, but also increasingly complex, regimens using
      drugs with very distinct molecular targets, current policies on vaccination of transplant
      recipients are generic and remain based on old concepts rather than on any new understanding
      of the cellular and molecular effects of these therapies on the human immune system. This
      proposal seeks to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the
      distinct immunosuppressive regimens in practice today (calcineurin-inhibitor, or CNI, and
      sirolimus-based regimens) and in emerging regimens that employ agents with novel mechanisms
      of action, such as the CD28 costimulation blockers, and/or JAK3 kinase inhibitors. Such
      knowledge will be critical to strategies for enhancing desirable immune responses while not
      precipitating rejection.
