      The purpose of the current study is to determine whether:

        1. Surface electrical stimulation at rest using various electrode placements produces
           different hyo-laryngeal movements of in healthy adult humans.

        2. One surface electrical stimulation array (placement 3b) reduces hyo-larynegeal movement
           in healthy humans during swallowing.

      Study Population: healthy adults

      Design: This study will employ a repeated measures design. Surface electrodes will be used to
      stimulate submental and laryngeal muscles either alone or in combination both at rest and
      during swallowing while using videofluoroscopy and nasolaryngoscopy to record hyo-laryngeal
      movement.

      Outcome Measures: Kinematic analyses of hyo-laryngeal movements using image processing and
      marking from video-recordings will quantify movement with stimulation.
