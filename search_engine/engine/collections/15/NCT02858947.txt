      placed in 37 patients. In all cavities, Adper Single Bond 2 was used. In one of the cavities
      of each pair, a conventional flowable composite, Aelite Flo, was applied in approximately 2mm
      thick, and the remaining cavity was restored incrementally with GrandioSO. In the second
      cavity, a bulk-fill flowable composite, x-tra base, was applied in approximately 4 mm thick
      in bulk increments and the remaining 2mm occlusal part of the cavity was restored with
      GrandioSO. All cavities were restored with open-sandwich technique by the same operator. At
      baseline and after 6-month, 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-up visits, restorations were evaluated
      by Modified USPHS criteria.
