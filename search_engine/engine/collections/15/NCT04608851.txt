      children, we aim to conduct randomized, placebo controlled and double blinded clinical trial.
      We are going to recruit children who are suffering the first urinary tract infection of their
      life. The UTI will be treated by normal clinical recommendations decided by treating
      physician. Intervention will start on the day following the last day of the antimicrobial
      course.

      The intervention will last for 15 days and the study participants will receive either
      intervention drug or placebo. Intervention drug contains 10 E8 CFU/ml of E. coli Nissle
      strain and will be administered as dose of 1 ml of oral suspension once daily for children
      aged under one year and twice daily for children aged more than one year.

      The study patients will be monitored by monthly electronic surveys for six months after the
      intervention in order to measure proportion of the children who will have a new UTI during
      the follow up. We are also going to record possible adverse effects in both study groups.
      Also use of antimicrobial medication due to any reason will be recorded.
