      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The investigators are looking to see if combining the standard therapy, PLD, and the study
      drug, Pembrolizumab, will be better than PLD alone. Pembrolizumab is a drug called a
      monoclonal antibody. Pembrolizumab blocks and interferes with a protein called PD-1; PD-1 can
      help the cancer cell evade the immune system, and thereby blocking PD-1 may help the immune
      system recognize and kill cancer cells.

      This will be the first time this combination will be tested for participants with Ovarian,
      Fallopian Tube or Peritoneal Cancer. Therefore, a group of 6 participants will be treated in
      a "safety lead in" portion of the trial. This lead in will determine the safest dose of PLD
      when given in combination with the study drug Pembrolizumab. These 6 participants will be
      treated with Pembrolizumab and PLD at the FDA approved dose to see if the combination is well
      tolerated or too severe. If the combination is well tolerated, 20 additional participants
      will be added. If the side effects are too severe, the dose of PLD will be lowered.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved PLD as a treatment option for
      this disease, but has not approved Pembrolizumab.
