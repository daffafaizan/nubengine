      identified prior to surgical resection actually harbor DCIS, and whether these imaging
      features correlate with pathologic markers of proliferation (Ki-67) and inflammation (cox-2)
      within DCIS lesions.

      The investigators will also explore whether quantitative MRI features in the peri-tumoral
      region correlate with prognostic microenvironment markers of inflammation (TNFÎ±) and
      angiogenesis (VEGF). Finally, investigators will assess whether a multivariate model using
      these markers can accurately predict risk of recurrence based on a multi-gene assay (Oncotype
      DX DCIS score).
