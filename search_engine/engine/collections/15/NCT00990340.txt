      between the two injection methods as recorded on a 5-point FIS immediately before
      administration. A higher score denoted greater anxiety.

      The injection anxiety score was to be reported by the subject from a row of five faces with
      values ranging from 5 (the face with the most negative affect) to 1 (the face with the most
      positive affect).
