      sulphate and anti-hypertensives reduce morbidity, but delivery is the only cure. Low dose
      oral misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is a highly effective method for labour
      induction. Usually, once active labour has commenced, the misoprostol is replaced with an
      intravenous oxytocin infusion. However, some studies have shown that oral misoprostol can be
      continued into active labour. In the Cochrane review on labour induction, those whose
      augmentation was continued with misoprostol (M/M protocol) had 42% less CSs than those who
      changed to oxytocin (M/Ox protocol; 15% vs 26%). This misoprostol-only protocol would be
      simpler and probably more acceptable to women. However, these two protocols have never been
      directly compared. We propose a pragmatic, open-label, randomised trial to compare an M/M
      labour induction protocol with the standard M/Ox protocol.
