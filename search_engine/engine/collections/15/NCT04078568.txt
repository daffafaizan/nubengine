    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, blind-endpoints, randomized controlled trial at more than
      10 hospitals in China. The investigators enrolled KD children diagnosed within 10 days of
      onset. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the control group (receiving
      2g/kg IVIG and 30 mg/kg aspirin) or the intervention group (receiving 2 g/kg IVIG, 30 mg/kg
      aspirin and additional 2 mg/kg prednisolone). Baseline characteristics of each participant
      will be collected, including sex, age of onset, height, body weight, subtype of KD, fever
      days before initial IVIG, echocardiographic findings at enrolment, and a series of pre-IVIG
      laboratory tests. Two-dimensional echocardiography will be performed at admission, 2 weeks, 1
      month, 3 months, 6 monthsï¼Œand 12 months after onset of KD to assess the coronary artery
      lesions.
