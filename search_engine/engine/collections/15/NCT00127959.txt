    
      This is a randomized multicentre trial of FTC vs TDF/FTC in antiretroviral naive subjects
      with HIV/HBV co-infection over 48 weeks (Clinical Trial A).

      Plus, a 12 week viral kinetic substudy comparing a subgroup of patients on Clinical Trial A
      is being conducted. (Substudy A1)

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To compare the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA levels below the limit of detection
           (<400 copies/ml) by week 48 in each treatment group

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the emergence of HBV resistance at 48 weeks

        -  To compare the proportion of patients with undetectable HBV DNA at weeks 12 and 24 in
           each treatment group

        -  To compare the proportion of patients who achieve HBeAg and HBsAg seroconversion at
           weeks 12, 24 and 48 during the study

        -  To compare changes in ALT from baseline and the rate of hepatic cytolysis (ALT>5x ULN)

        -  To compare suppression of HIV-1 RNA and changes in CD4/CD8 counts over 48 weeks

        -  To compare the effect of therapy on histological changes in the liver and the presence
           of ccc-DNA

      Enrollment:

        -  24 patients in Clinical trial A (of whom 16 enter substudy A1).

      Clinical Trial A:

        -  Patients with HIV/HBV co-infection who are naive to HIV/HBV therapy, have detectable HBV
           viraemia and are willing to start antiretroviral therapy.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Written informed consent

        -  Documented HIV infection

        -  Age 18 - 70 years

        -  HBV DNA > 106 copies/ml

      Randomization:

        -  Arm 1: Zidovudine (AZT), emtricitabine (FTC), efavirenz (EFV)

        -  Arm 2: Tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), efavirenz (EFV)
