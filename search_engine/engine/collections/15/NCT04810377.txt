      25% of patients with gastric, duodenal, ampullary, pancreatic, or bile duct cancer and
      worsens their prognosis. Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is considered the gold standard
      treatment with technical success of 98.6% (97-3% -99.9%) and clinical success of 80.1% with
      patency of 169.2 (136.8-201.7) days. On the other hand, the technical success reported for
      self-expanding metal stents is 96.2% (94.1% vs. 98.4%), technical success is 79.4%, and
      patency at 6 months was only 57%. However, complications occur in a similar way in both forms
      of treatment (major complications in 6% and late complications in 17% in both, but mortality
      is higher in the group treated with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (29% vs. 17%). , p <0.001)
      Recently, the creation of endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastroenterostomy has shown success
      rates of over 90% in case series, but prospective studies evaluating the safety and efficacy
      of the procedure are lacking. The aim of this research to determine the safety and efficacy
      of EUS-guided gastro-enterostomy in the treatment of patients with malignant gastric outlet
      obstruction.
