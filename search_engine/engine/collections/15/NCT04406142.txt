    
      In this study the investigators intend to assess the feasibility of surfactant administration
      via a thin catheter using a specially adapted video laryngoscope, with a groove designed to
      allow insertion of an endovascular catheter without the use of other instruments in the oral
      cavity (forceps ect.).

      The laryngoscope is manufactured by Peak Medic Ltd, Natania, Israel.

      Primary Endpoints

        1. - Number of attempts until surfactant is administrated

        2. - Assessment of the infants' stability during the procedure - saturation, bradycardia,
           tachycardia.

        3. - Duration of the entire procedure, form laryngoscope insertion to surfactants
           administration.

      4. Secondary Endpoints

        1. - Need of invasive mechanical ventilation in the next 24 hours.

        2. - Complications reports

        3. - Subjective procedure scale of assessment

        4. - Unexpected pitfalls reports

        5. - Safety assessment of the procedure
