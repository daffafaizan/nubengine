      keratinized tissue around teeth/dental implants and vestibular deepening. However, patient
      discomfort during the healing time is a major disadvantage of this procedure. Several methods
      have been introduced to accelerate the healing time and reduction of patient's pain during
      first days after surgery. Low-level lasers have shown promising results in biostimulation of
      cell growth and differentiation in cultures. However, there are lack of well designed double
      blind placebo controlled randomized controlled clinical studies evaluating the effects of
      Low-level laser therapy in acceleration of wound healing and pain relief of patients
      undergoing free gingival grafts.
