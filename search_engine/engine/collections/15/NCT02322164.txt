      Sequences of heat stimuli will be applied to the participants arms and participants will be
      asked to judge the intensity of the temperatures they perceive. There are two study sessions.
      Session 1 involves eligibility screening and baseline sensory testing with and without the
      analgesic (pain-relieving) cream. Session 2 involves more sensory testing with the analgesic
      cream. The study population is 40 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50.
