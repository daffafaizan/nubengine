      conflicting reports on its accuracy to diagnose CAD in this setting. Moreover, there are no
      studies examining whether SPECT imaging provides any incremental prognostic value beyond
      functional testing in this high-risk cohort. We sought to determine the relative importance
      of CV risk factors, functional capacity and SPECT perfusion results as independent predictors
      of cardiovascular mortality in OLT candidates.
