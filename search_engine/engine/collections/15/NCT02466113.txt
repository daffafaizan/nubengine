      features(control group) or the miRNA tool(experimental group). Pathological features include
      poorly differentiated histology(exclusive of those cancers that are MSI-H),lymphatic/vascular
      invasion,bowel obstruction and <12 lymph nodes examined.MicroRNA tool contains miRNA of
      miR-21、miR-20a-5p、miR-103a-3p、miR-106b-5p、miR-143-5p and miR-215. Investigators evaluate
      these miRNA status of surgical specimens using qRT-PCR and calculate their risk score(risk
      score =(0.108×status of miR-21-5p)+(0.086×status of miR-20a-5p)+(0.240×status of
      miR-103a-3p)+(0.095×status of miR-106b-5p)-(0.238×status of miR-143-5p)-(0.237×status of
      miR-215),low expression status equals 0 and high expression status equals 1). Investigators
      defined high risk patient if had any pathological features in control group or the score
      larger than 1 in the experimental group ,the others as low risk patient.The high risk group
      should receive adjuvant chemotherapy while the low risk group deserve observation. Primary
      endpoint is the disease free survival and overall survival.
