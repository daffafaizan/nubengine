      dose, e.g. 10 U, or a weight-based formulas, 0.1-0.2 U/kg. The estimate of eventual titration
      dose to attempt to reach a fasting glucose goal is 0.49 U/kg. Those many weeks of dosage
      upward titration are required. The investigators propose to compare the current recommended
      weight based, 0.1 U/kg to a correction factor derived formula. Starting with an insulin
      tolerance test estimation of basal dose, one would arrive at the eventual titrated basal
      insulin dose in significantly less days than starting at a starting dose estimate of 0.1
      U/kg. Further, there would be no significant increase in overall reported hypoglycemia.
