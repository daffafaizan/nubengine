      samples will be taken before and following the participant walking at a self-selected speed
      for 20 minutes. During the 20 minutes of treadmill walking real-time biofeedback will be
      displayed in an attempt to alter mechanical loading. Participants will complete a control,
      overloading, under-loading, average loading testing session. Order of loading condition will
      be randomized.
