      We aim to compare the performance and safety of heparin-grafted AN69 membrane (oXiris,
      Gambro) with the conventional AN69 membrane (M150, Gambro) without systemic anticoagulation
      during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), in critically ill patients with acute
      kidney injury (AKI) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), who has moderate bleeding risk
      and in whom systemic anticoagulation is contraindicated.
