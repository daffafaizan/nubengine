      western world. The technique of choice is currently to support inguinal tissues by using
      polypropylene mesh. Chronic postoperative pain and discomfort occur in 25-30% of patients
      after inguinal hernioplasty. Pain might be related to mesh fixation by sutures. This
      randomized study investigates whether mesh fixation by tissue glue (cyanoacrylate) is better
      than sutures. The patients are followed 1 year postoperatively. Pain, quality of life,
      operative parameters (time, cost) and recurrences are reported.
