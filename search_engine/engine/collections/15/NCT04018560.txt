      COs. COs and their drinkers are assessed at baseline and 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year
      follow-ups. Hypotheses are that, compared to usual care, AIR will increase Al-Anon
      participation and improve CO outcomes. We will examine hypotheses using generalized
      mixed-effects regression models (GLMM). This project is built on the foundation that it is
      essential to help COs because of their own suffering.
