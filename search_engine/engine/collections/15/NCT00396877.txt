    
      In this event-driven study, participants were to be randomized and treated as soon as
      possible after shunt placement. They were then to be treated and followed until the primary
      endpoint criteria was reached i.e. (shunt thrombosis, the next surgical procedure for
      correction of the congenital heart disease or death) or one year of age or the common
      study-end-date, which ever came first.

      The common study-en-date was defined as the date when it was projected that 172 participants
      would have reached the primary endpoint criteria.
