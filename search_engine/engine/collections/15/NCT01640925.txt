      study arm one will receive standard bathing (soap and water or non-medicated cloth) daily.
      Patients in study arm two will receive a 2% chlorhexidine bath on study day 1 and every 48
      hours and a standard bath (soap and water or non-medicated cloths) on study day 2 and every
      48 hours. Patients will be followed until ICU day 28 or discharged from the surgical ICU.

      Hypothesis: Compared to standard daily bathing, chlorhexidine-based bathing on ICU admission
      and every 48 hours will decrease the incidence of nosocomial infections.
