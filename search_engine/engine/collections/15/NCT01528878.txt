      treat lesions, tumors and conditions anywhere in the body when radiation treatment is
      indicated. In order to treat tumors during the respiratory cycle (vs. increasing the margin
      of treatment around the tumor to compensate for movement or requiring the patient to breath
      hold during the delivery of each beam), the Synchronyâ„¢ option, a system option that enables
      dynamic radiosurgery during respiration, will be used. The purpose of this study is to
      determine a tolerable dose of radiation delivered by the CyberKnife in two groups of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Group 1: Patients with HCC and Childs A cirrhosis, and
      patients with colorectal liver metastases. Group 2: Patients with Childs B cirrhosis.
      Patients will be irradiated with radiation doses using the CyberKnife system in 3-5 radiation
      fractions using guidance from fiducials placed by interventional radiology. Treatments will
      be delivered with standard CyberKnife procedures to account for respiratory motion and set up
      variations. The fiducial location will be the prime determinant of the delivery site and
      respiratory motion and fiducial markers will be placed via percutaneous approach by
      interventional radiology.
