      predictors of risk of breast cancer and an abnormal mammogram. Breath samples will be
      collected using an ultra-clean collection bag and analyzed with gas chromatography surface
      acoustic wave detection (GC SAW)

      The study will be performed in two phases:

      Phase 1: Model-building phase (cross-sectional study): Breath VOCs will be employed to
      construct multivariate algorithms that distinguish between normal women and those with breast
      cancer and abnormal screening mammograms.

      Phase 2: Model-testing phase (cross-sectional study): The predictive accuracy of these
      algorithms will be tested to predict outcomes in normal women and those with breast cancer
      and abnormal screening mammograms.
