      unacceptable rates of neurotoxicity when high dose radiotherapy is used. Idarubicin has
      activity in systemic lymphomas and crosses the blood brain barrier and may add to the
      efficacy of methotrexate. By combining these 2 drugs with moderate dose radiotherapy survival
      outcomes should be optimal but with lower rates of neurotoxicity.

      Comparison: TROG has previously performed a phase 2 study using methotrexate with high dose
      radiotherapy and this will allow comparison of survival and neurotoxicity rates.
