        -  Determine the response rate in patients with progressive stage IV or recurrent renal
           cell cancer treated with ZD 1839.

        -  Determine the median time to objective progression in these patients receiving this
           drug.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Determine if epidermal growth factor receptor expression in tumor tissue correlates with
           response and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-23
      months.
