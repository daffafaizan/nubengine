    
      Design, Setting and Patients: A randomized clinical trial study of 382 adults recruited from
      786 patients who had been diagnosed with hypertension and receiving treatment for
      hypertension in two district hospitals in the north of Taiwan. Physicians had access to
      cloud-based BP data from CPOE. Neither participants nor investigators were blinded to group
      assignment. The study was conducted for a period of seven months.

      Interventions: Patients from two hospitals were randomized into a control group which
      received traditional care (n=212) and an intervention group (n=170) which received a
      cloud-based home BP monitoring device. The device measured and transmitted BP data to the
      cloud server, which was integrated with the CPOE system in the hospitals. Physicians could
      access the BP data during the patient encounter to adjust the antihypertensive therapy
      accordingly. Meanwhile, patients could browse their own BP data from their computers, smart
      phones, tablets and so on.

      Primary Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcomes were control of systolic BP to less
      than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg at two, four and six months. The
      secondary outcomes were changes in BP and antihypertensive drug prescription at two, four and
      six months.
