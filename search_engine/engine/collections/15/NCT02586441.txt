      surgical outcomes of patients depending on the dose of the anesthetic, as well as operation
      time and intensity.

      The BIS Index, one of the VISTA Monitor output parameters, may be used as an aid in
      monitoring the effects of certain anesthetic agents;and its usage with certain anesthetic
      agents may be associated with a reduction in primary anesthetic use and a reduction in
      emergence and recovery time.

      However, this equipment does not give the proper anesthetic depth index is a number of
      experimental results have been reported.

      Therefore, the investigators study that the BIS VISTA receives an electroencephalogram (EEG)
      obtained through the depth of anesthesia monitors brain waves to collect statistical data,
      through mathematical analysis to analyze the exact correlation between the patient's brain
      waves and the depth of anesthesia.
