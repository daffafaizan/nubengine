    
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to assess safety, feasibility and clinical activity of
      pre-HCT moxetumomab pasudotox for patients with ALL in morphologic CR but with MRD. It is
      hypothesized that subjects in a morphologic complete remission with proven minimal residual
      disease (MRD) after chemotherapy for ALL planned for allogeneic HCT who receive a course of
      moxetumomab pasudotox prior to the start of conditioning will show a marked reduction or
      elimination of detectable MRD after moxetumomab pasudotox treatment without adverse impact on
      the feasibility or safety of allogeneic HCT.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox
      in the MRD positive setting is able to lead to MRD negativity (< 0.01% by flow cytometry) or
      at least a 1-log10 reduction in MRD prior to allogeneic HCT.

      Secondary objectives to be studied include: toxicity profile (including safety and
      feasibility of administration in the pre-HCT setting and ability to proceed to transplant,
      incidence of capillary leak syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome and other post-HCT
      toxicities), comparison of quantitative MRD assessments, progression-free survival, overall
      survival, pharmacokinetic profiles, immunogenicity to moxetumomab pasudotox,
      transplant-related mortality, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and
      relapse.
