      sedation in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Subjects are randomized to different
      treatment groups (including 1 for Remimazolam Besylate and 1 for propofol). Remifentanil is
      co-administered with remimazolam or propofol. Efficacy and safety profiles of Remimazolam
      Besylate are to be evaluated.
