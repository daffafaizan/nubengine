      syndrome on the functional outcome and the survival after an ischemic stroke and to measure
      the impact of the treatment with continuous positive airway pressure on the outcome of
      patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.Patients and methods : We will
      prospectively explore by polysomnography, 300 consecutive patients hospitalized for an
      ischemic stroke in the stroke units of university hospitals at the sub acute phase after
      stroke (J15Â±4). 1) We will compare the functional outcome, the neurological impairment, the
      peripheral endothelial function, the continuous blood pressure measure on 24 hours recording,
      the quality of life and the survival at 3, 6 and 12 months in four groups of patients
      depending on their apnea/hypopnea index 2) In patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome, we will explore the impact on the functional outcome, the neurological impairment,
      and the survival at 3, 6 et 12 months of a treatment with continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) randomly compared to a treatment with sham CPAP (non efficacious pressure) during 3
      months. Conclusion : This study should allow us to evaluate the consequences of obstructive
      sleep apnea syndrome on the outcome and the survival after ischemic stroke and the impact and
      the tolerance of the treatment with continuous positive airway pressure in patients with
      severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.
