      expensive testing. We will do both cardiac computed tomography (CT) and stress cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients who have an inconclusive noninvasive cardiac
      stress test. We will test whether MRI predicts significant coronary artery disease in a more
      cost effective and accurate manner than CT, or vice versa.
