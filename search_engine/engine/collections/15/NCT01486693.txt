      chain reaction) from aqueous humor tapping from January 2006 to June 2011. All the patients
      (40 men, 20 women) were immunocompetent and diagnosed as symptomatic CMV infection. Their
      medical records will be reviewed, including demographic data as well as their ophthalmic and
      medical histories.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate long term efficacy and safety of topical
      ganciclovir treatment in CMV anterior uveitis.
