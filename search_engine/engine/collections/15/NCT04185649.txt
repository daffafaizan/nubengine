    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, positive-controlled, superiority phase III
      clinical study. The object is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BAT8001 for the
      treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, using lapatinib in combination with
      capecitabine as the positive control drug.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to the experimental or control group in a 1:1 ratio and
      stratified by the number of HER2-positive advanced/metastatic breast cancer treatment
      regimens (0, 1 VS > 1) and lesion site (organ VS non-organ).
