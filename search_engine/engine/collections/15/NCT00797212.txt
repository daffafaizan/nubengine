      glucose results obtained by subjects with samples taken from the palm and forearm were
      compared with fingerstick capillary blood glucose results obtained from subjects by an HCP.
      Product labeling was evaluated for comprehension of performing alternative site testing as
      well as for additional meter features. User feedback about the system and its features was
      obtained.
