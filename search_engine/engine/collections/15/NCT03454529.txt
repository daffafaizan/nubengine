      I. Evaluate the relationship between short-term use of oral simvastatin on change in
      expression of Ki-67 as a candidate biomarker of breast tumor proliferation among women with
      clinical stage 1 or 2- primary invasive breast cancer.

      II. Evaluate the relationship between short-term use of oral simvastatin on changes in other
      candidate predictive markers of breast tumor proliferation (cyclin D1 and P27), changes in a
      marker of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 [CC3]), changes in a marker of inflammation
      (c-reactive protein [CRP]) and as novel additional biomarkers changes in the composition of
      the plasma membrane (lipid rafts) and changes in activation of signaling markers
      (phosphorylation [p]Akt, pMAPK, pEGFR, PHER2).

      III. To conduct exploratory analyses comparing the effect of statins on breast tumor
      proliferation and apoptosis in groups defined by tumor expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl
      co-enzyme A (CoA) reductase (HMG-CoA), estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)
      status, HER2neu, and tumor grade.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) daily for 2-4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
