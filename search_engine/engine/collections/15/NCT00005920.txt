      intravenously by a peripheral line once-daily. Patients are treated for 48 hours beyond
      resolution of symptoms or for a maximum of 14 days. Each patient is expected to complete the
      study, including the 14-day follow-up, within approximately 4 weeks. A physical examination
      is performed daily during the antifungal treatment period and at the follow-up visits 7 and
      14 days post-therapy. Laboratory tests of blood and urine for safety are performed every
      three days during treatment and at follow-up 7 days post-therapy. Liver enzymes are drawn at
      the 14-day follow-up visit.
