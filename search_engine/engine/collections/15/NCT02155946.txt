      expected to resume in the future. This is not a suspension of IRB approval.

      The proposed study focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic
      rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation. The main idea is that brain stimulation
      can enhance functioning in the specific brain regions/networks, thereby increasing the
      patients' ability to benefit from memory rehabilitation. This will be a randomized,
      double-blind study (active vs. fake brain stimulation), that provides multiple treatment
      session. Outcome will be examined using both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing
      as well as brain imaging. This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully
      translate more "basic" science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally
      meaningful treatments for our aging population.

      The general purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two types of treatments for
      memory impairment in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One form of treatment is
      cognitive rehabilitation, which involves teaching new ways to learn and remember information.
      The second form of treatment uses a type of electrical brain stimulation called transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to increase activity in certain brain areas that may be
      involved with memory. We will use brain imaging to see whether these treatments changed how
      individuals learn and remember information. We will also use cognitive tests and
      questionnaires to examine whether memory (and related abilities) changed because of
      treatment.
