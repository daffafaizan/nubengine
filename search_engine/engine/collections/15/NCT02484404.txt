    
      Background:

        -  Disruption of the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 pathway yielded clinical activity in
           subsets of advanced solid tumors, such as melanoma and lung cancer.

        -  Olaparib (O), a PARP inhibitor (PARPi), has demonstrated single agent activity in
           recurrent ovarian cancer (OvCa), and subsets of prostate, triple negative breast or lung
           cancers.

        -  Our recent randomized phase 2 study showed that O and cediranib (C), a VEGFR1-3
           inhibitor was clinically superior to O alone in platinum-sensitive recurrent OvCa.

        -  We hypothesize that increased DNA damage by PARP inhibition and/or reduced angiogenesis
           by VEGFR inhibition will complement the anti-tumor activity of an immune checkpoint
           nhibitor, MEDI4736, in recurrent OvCa and other solid tumors.

      Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and the safety of doublet
           herapies (MEDI4736/olaparib [MEDI+O] and MEDI4736/cediranib [MEDI+C]) and triplet
           therapy (MEDI+O+C) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Phase II Cohort 1 OvCa; MEDI+O, MEDI+C and MEDI+O+C arms: To determine clinical efficacy
           as measured by overall response rate (ORR)

        -  Phase II Cohort 2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); MEDI+O and MEDI+C arms: To
           determine clinical efficacy as measured by progression-free survival (PFS)

           clinical efficacy as measured by ORR

           evaluated for response initially at 8 weeks then every 12 weeks using RECIST v1.1
           criteria as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2).
