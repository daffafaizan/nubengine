      Clinic will be consented to participate in this study for a minimum of two days and/or the
      duration of their hospital stay for their clinical care. Subjects will be asked to wear up to
      4 different commercially available seizure detection devices and complete surveys.

      In the second year of the study patients who have implanted devices capable of recording or
      detecting seizures will be recruited to wear a noninvasive biosensor for multiple months.
      This data will be used to develop algorithms capable of detecting and/or forecasting
      seizures.

      When the subjects clinical EEG monitoring is completed data scientists will analyze the data
      to identify patterns.
