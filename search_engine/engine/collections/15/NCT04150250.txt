    
      The study consists of a screening phase, an inpatient containment period with challenge with
      Vibrio cholerae on Day 1 followed by treatment with iOWH032 or placebo and a post-challenge
      observation period until discharge, an outpatient follow-up period of at least 28 days, and a
      final follow-up (by telephone) 6 months post-challenge (Day 180) for the collection of
      serious adverse events.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either iOWH032 500 mg every 8 hours for three
      days or matching placebo. Blinded therapeutic dosing will start at the onset of diarrhea or
      by 48 hours after ingesting the challenge inoculum of V. cholerae. The observation and
      management of cholera diarrhea and symptomatology will occur on an inpatient isolation
      research ward over a duration of approximately 11 days, including a three-day course of
      antibiotics to treat all participants prior to discharge from the inpatient unit.
