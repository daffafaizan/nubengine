    
      Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is the viral cause of Kaposi sarcoma. Although infection
      with this virus appears to be uncommon in the United States, the prevalence in the general
      population in uncertain, and routes for transmission are poorly characterized. This study
      makes use of questionnaire data and serum specimens obtained in the third National Health and
      Nutrition Survey (NHAnes III). Sera from 18,168 individuals in this study were tested for
      antibodies to the KSHV proteins K8.1 and LANA. We will use these measurements to estimate
      KSHV seroprevalence for the overall U.S. general population and for demographic subgroups. To
      characterize potential transmission routes, we will also examine whether KSHV seroprevalence
      is related to sexual activity and exposures to blood, as indicated by responses to
      questionnaire items and previous NHANES III measurements of markers of relevant viral
      infections.
