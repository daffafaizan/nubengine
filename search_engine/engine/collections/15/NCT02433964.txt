      technological applications. Therapy with coherent and non-coherent light is a treatment
      modality for a variety of musculoskeletal injuries. The main benefits certificates for
      phototherapy are the reduction of nociceptive processes, tissue remodeling, among others. The
      aim of the present paper is to analyze the changes caused by the use of LED (627 +/- 10 nm)
      with an energy density of 10 J / cm2 in 40 subjects divided into two groups (placebo and
      LED). All volunteers participating in this study had ankle inversion sprain grade II treated
      with the price technique. The study was performed in six days. And the results were verified
      by review of all individuals, through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain, McGill Pain
      Questionnaire and Titrimetry. Measurements were performed at first, third and sixth day's of
      treatment.
