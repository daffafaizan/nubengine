      hyperactivity in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involves the
      use of stimulant medications. Most children with ADHD are treated by pediatricians, but the
      treatment provided is often less than optimal. This study is designed to see if training for
      pediatricians in following guidelines for management of first-line medicines for ADHD leads
      to improvement in child behavior, and whether the physicians can adhere to the guidelines.

      Over 100 studies have shown that stimulant medications are effective for improving the core
      symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Approximately 70% of children
      who receive ADHD medications are treated by their primary care pediatrician, but studies show
      that management is not always optimal. The present study is designed to see if child behavior
      can be improved by training pediatricians in the use of guidelines for treating ADHD, and
      whether the physicians can adhere to the guidelines. Twenty-four pediatric practices were
      randomized to a treatment as usual or specialized care (receiving training in guidelines and
      computer assisted monitoring of patient progress and medication titration). Children are
      assessed with parent and teacher reports at baseline, 4-, 9-, and 12-months post initiation
      of treatment, and classroom observations of behavior are assessed at baseline, 6-, and
      12-months. Approximately 400 children are to be enrolled.
