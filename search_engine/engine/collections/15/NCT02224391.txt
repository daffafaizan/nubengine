      I. To determine the feasibility of smartphone-delivered, in-home attentional bias
      modification (ABM) to reduce attentional bias (AB) to smoking cues and to reduce smoking
      behavior in the short- and long-term.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ABM training over 30 minutes through a smartphone on days 1-14.
      Patients then receive nicotine patches for up to 8 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo sham training on days 1-14. Patients then receive nicotine patches
      for up to 8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 15, 29, 43, 57, and 72.
