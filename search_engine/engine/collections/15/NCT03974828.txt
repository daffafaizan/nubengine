      investigators will screen surgical patients enrolled in TECTONICS (NCT03923699) and
      randomized to intraoperative contact. Near the end of the operation, the investigators will
      calculate the same machine learning risk forecasts of major complications as TECTONICS, and
      enroll patients if all of the following are true: (1) No ICU admission is intended (2) ML
      mortality risk forecast is in top 15% of historical PACU patients.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to no contact, brief contact, and full contact. The
      postoperative provider (PACU physician, anesthesiologist, ward clinician) will be notified
      before arrival of the risk forecast in the contact groups, and in the full contact group an
      additional set of explanatory ML outputs will be provided. The intention-to-treat principle
      will be followed for all analyses.
