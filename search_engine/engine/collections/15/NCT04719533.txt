    
      Purpose: To compare short- and long-term outcomes of women following episiotomy during the
      second stage of labor, following marking of episiotomy location during the first stage of
      labor with those of women who underwent episiotomy without marking.

      Hypothesis: Women following episiotomy following pre-marking of the location will suffer from
      fewer short- and long-term complications compared to those without pre-marked episiotomy
      location.

      Study type: prospective randomized-controlled trial
