    
      This is a single-center, open-label, double-arm, crossover study which will include
      approximately 40 HIV-infected subjects on an established suppressive HAART for at least 2
      years with evidence of undetectable HIV-1 RNA levels (either <50 copies/ml by RT-PCR or <75
      copies/ml by bDNA assay) and CD4+ count of <350 cells/mm3 or an increase in CD4+count <100
      cells/mm3 in the last 2 years. Participants (~20 Group 1 and ~20 in Group 2) will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment arms described below in Table 1:

      Table 1. Study groups and treatment assignments

      Group A Raltegravir 400 mg PO q12h in addition to established ART (Part 1) followed by a
      washout period only on ART (Part 2) followed by ART (Part 3)

      Group B Established ART (Part 1) followed by a washout period only on ART (Part 2) followed
      by raltegravir 400 mg PO q12h in addition to ART (Part 3)

      The participants' pre-study HAART will be monitored so as to ensure that the distribution of
      NNRTI to PI-based regimens is roughly 1:1 and no higher than 2 (NNRTI):1 (PI).

      The total duration of the study will be 40 weeks. This will include Part 1 (16 weeks)
      followed by Part 2 (8 weeks) followed by the crossover to Part 2 (16 weeks) (Figure 1).
      During Part 1 participants in Group A will receive open-label raltegravir in addition to
      their established antiretroviral regimen while Group B participants will continue taking
      their established antiretroviral regimen for 16 weeks. After completion of Part 1, both
      groups will enter Part 2 that will consist of a washout period of 8 weeks during which both
      groups will only take their established antiretroviral regimen without raltegravir. This will
      be followed by Part 3 during which the two study groups will undergo a crossover with respect
      to the treatment assignment during Part 1 so that Group A will continue to receive their
      established antiretroviral regimen while Group B will receive open-label raltegravir in
      addition to their established antiretroviral regimen for 16 weeks.

      After obtaining informed consent, patients will be enrolled into the study, a study number
      will be assigned, a complete history will be obtained, and a physical exam will be performed.
      Blood will be drawn for the following laboratory exams at Day 1 and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 10, 16,
      24, 25 26, and 40 for Group A and at Day 1 and at Weeks 1, 2, 16, 24, 25, 26, 28, 34, and 40
      for Group B:

        -  T-cell subsets

        -  Plasma viral load

        -  Episomal viral cDNA PCR

        -  HLA-DR levels

        -  CD38 levels

      Blood will also be drawn for the following laboratory exams at Day 1 and at Weeks 4, 12, 16,
      24, 28, 36, and 40 for both Group A and Group B to determine

        -  Plasma levels of LPS, 16s ribosomal DNA, and sCD14

        -  T cell receptor excision circles

        -  CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell apoptosis

      At all visits, a directed physical exam will be performed on an as-needed-basis.
