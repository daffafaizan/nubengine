    
      At a single US-based study site, a driving simulation will be used to assess the effect on
      driving performance for the co-primary endpoints, study subjects' driving performance at 45
      minutes and 10 hours post-dose, compared with placebo. Eligible subjects will be prescreened
      for ADHD but otherwise healthy, aged 18-25 years.

      Driving simulations that simulate common driving events to which the study subject must
      react. The reactions to each event will be assessed. Using a parallel-group design, subjects
      will be assessed while on study drug, and while on placebo.

      Safety assessments will include spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events and
      vital signs at 4 hours post-dose.
