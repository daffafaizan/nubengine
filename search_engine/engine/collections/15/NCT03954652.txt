    
      In the GENOME FIRST APPROACH (monocentric, prospective, open-label diagnostic) project,
      patients with molecularly undiagnosed diseases will diagnostically be analyzed by Whole
      Genome Sequencing (WGS)-trio analysis. The following questions will be leading the project:

      Primary:

      â€¢ Efficacy of WGS trio analysis in different clinical indications

      Secondary:

        -  Systematically benchmark WGS analysis to detect genetic variations compared to WES and
           single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis,

        -  Expand the analysis from coding single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to regulatory
           mutations, structural variants (SVs), and low complexity regions,

        -  Validate the efficacy of clinical genome trio sequencing in a routine diagnostic
           setting,

        -  Analyse whether 42x coverage has the potential to discover mosaicism as disease causing
           mechanism,

        -  Further develop algorithms for integrative analyses of Trio-WGS data with Ribonucleic
           acid- sequencing (RNA-seq),

        -  Identify de novo alterations and novel disease mechanisms,

        -  Gain fundamental new insights into disease mechanisms and cellular biology,

        -  Combine WGS with further Omics methods to improve genetic diagnostics of future rare
           disease patients, and

        -  Explore overall financial costs and time to report conclusive data to the patients of
           the Trio-WGS approach compared to traditional multistep diagnostic approaches using
           single-gene, panel, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and chromosomal microarray (CMA) (SNP
           array, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH)) analysis.

      In addition, healthy parents of the subjects will be included in the project to perform
      parent-child (trio) analyzes.
