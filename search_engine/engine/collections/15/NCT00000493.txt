      The study of methods for minimizing the mass of ischemic infarcted myocardium associated with
      a myocardial infarction was identified as a topic of research priority in the 1973 Report of
      the Panel Chairman for the Preparation of the National Heart, Blood Vessel, Lung, and Blood
      Program. In September 1976, the Institute convened a workshop involving 32 investigators
      active in this field, respondents to past solicitations, experts on the topic of
      collaborative clinical trials, members of previous review committees, and several members of
      the Cardiology Advisory Committee. The attendees were enthusiastic about the practicality and
      timeliness of a collaborative clinical trial in this field. The concept of collaborative
      clinical trials to protect ischemic myocardium was discussed by the Cardiology Advisory
      Committee in its meeting of September 22, 1976, and was recommended affirmatively and
      enthusiastically. This trial was part of the Institute's initiatives and was reviewed and
      favorably recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council at its December
      1976 meeting. The trial consisted of five clinical centers, six central laboratories, a
      clinical coordinating center, and a data coordinating center.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized. Group A patients were randomized to propranolol therapy, hyaluronidase therapy,
      or control therapy; patients assigned to Group B (propranolol contraindicated) were assigned
      to hyaluronidase or control therapy. Single-blind for propranolol therapy, double-blind for
      hyaluronidase or control therapy; fixed sample. Detailed follow-up of clinical status and
      endpoints for a six-month period; annual health status follow-up thereafter.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Query View Report (QVR).
