    
      Evaluation of the serum carbon dioxide gradient (GapCO2), central venous saturation (ScvO2)
      and the clearance of serum lactate (Clac) in predicting hospital mortality after cardiac
      arrest syndrome (post-PCR).

      Prospective study, unicenter - Intensive Care Unit - HNSC. Period: May/2010 to June/2011.
      Serial assessment of GapCO2 of ScvO2 Clac and the first 72 hours post-PCR. Excluded under 18,
      survival of less than 6HS, pregnant women, traumatized, post-operative hypothermia and liver
      disease. T-student test, 95% (p <0.05).
