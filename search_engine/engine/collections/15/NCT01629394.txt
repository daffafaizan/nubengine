    
      Morbidly obese patients [ body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2 ] planned to undergo open or
      laparoscopic surgery for weight loss will be managed with standardized general anesthesia
      (intravenous Propofol combined with remifentanil and muscle relaxation induced by
      rocuronium).

      By the end of the surgery, Group A and group E patients will receive sugammadex 2 mg/kg
      corrected body weight [corrected body weight(CBW)=ideal body weight(IBW) + 40%(real body
      weight(RBW)-ideal body weight)] when T2 arises in adductor pollicis. Group C and group G will
      receive neostigmine 50μg/kg corrected body weight when T2 arises in adductor pollicis. Group
      B and group F patients will receive sugammadex 2 mg/kg ideal body weight when T2 arises in
      adductor pollicis. Group D and group H patients will receive 50μg/kg neostigmine ideal body
      weight.

      Investigators will proceed in continuous acceleromyography monitoring of adductor pollicis
      and corrugator supercilii during induction of anaesthesia, surgery, recovery and in the post
      anaesthesia care unit, recording TOF values. Total consumption of neuromuscular blocking
      agent, doses of reversal agents and clinical criteria of post operation residual curarization
      will also be recorded.
