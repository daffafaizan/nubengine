      any other specific cognitive intervention) conducted with individuals with FXS. Further, no
      studies have been conducted to examine the possible underlying or mediating brain processes
      involved during matching-to-sample skill acquisition in children with FXS or any other
      neurodevelopmental disorder.

      Previous pilot data have indicated that the computerized match-to-sample procedure, even when
      conducted in time-limited sessions, may significantly help individuals with FXS learn new
      skills. We plan to utilize brain imaging methodology to compare functional connectivity
      networks for those who pass and those who fail the equivalence test. 30 subjects with FXS and
      30 control subjects with idiopathic developmental disability will be enrolled in the study.
      All subjects will be enrolled at Stanford.
