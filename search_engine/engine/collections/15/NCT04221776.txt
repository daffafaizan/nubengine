      participants (per daycare center) were randomly allocated to an Intervention group or a
      Control group.

      Evolution of the TT process was monitored in the daycare center until the child was
      considered to be fully toilet trained (or 'clean') during the day (this means wearing
      undergarments, conscious of the need to void and initiating toilet behavior without reminder
      of the parents with a maximum of one leakage a day [9]).

      Daycare workers evaluated the TT process of all participating children on a weekly basis.
      Parents were asked to fill in an online questionnaire when their child was completely toilet
      trained.
