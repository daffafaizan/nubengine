    
      At the recruitment, participants will undergo a neurological visit, a neuropsychology
      assessment (2 tests for each considered cognitive domain: memory, attention, visuospatial,
      executive function, language) and a motor assessment with wearing sensors under supervised
      conditions.

      In the treatment arm only, patients will have the Neuronation application installed on their
      personal technology device (smartphone or tablet) and are asked to complete 4 training
      session three times a week. Each session is composed of 5 exercises from one out of 4
      cognitive domains: Memory, Attention, Speed and Reasoning. The training is tailor made, the
      complexity of the exercises is adjusted online, based on the patient's performance.

      Participants are re-assessed at the end of the 6-week cognitive training (T1) to find out its
      effects on cognition and motor ability. The same assessment is administered also after 1 (T2)
      and 3 (T3) months from the end of the cognitive training to test long-term effects.
