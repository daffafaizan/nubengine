      coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, several limitations made these facial risk factors
      hard to be utilized in clinical practice, including 1) low prevalence in CAD patients, 2)
      lack of specific definition, 3) poor reproducibility in artificial recognition.

      Thus, the investigators designed a multi-center, cross-sectional study to explore the
      association between facial characteristics and CAD and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of
      appearance factors for CAD. The investigators will recruit patients undergoing coronary
      angiography or coronary computer tomography angiography. Patients' baseline information and
      facial images will be collected. First, the investigators will explore the facial factors
      associated with CAD by using artificial intelligence technology to compare facial photographs
      between patients with CAD and without CAD. Secondary, the investigators will evaluate the
      dose-response relationship between facial characteristics and CAD. Third, the investigators
      will establish a CAD risk model based on facial factors, and evaluate the diagnostic effect
      of the model.
