      postural stability. The vestibular system is comprised of two types of sensory organs
      (semicircular canals and otolith organs) each with unique contributions to balance.

      Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) is the treatment of choice for patients experiencing
      dizziness, imbalance, and mobility impairments related to vestibular dysfunction. VR
      typically includes gaze stability exercises, gait and balance training, and general
      conditioning. Gaze stability exercises were developed based on the concepts of adaptation and
      substitution with the goal of improving gaze stability by facilitating vestibular
      compensation of the semicircular canal-mediated vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).

      Many factors that might influence recovery, such as the involvement of different vestibular
      sensory organs (semicircular canals versus otolith organs) have not been examined to
      determine their impact on recovery. Most studies examining the effectiveness of VR have used
      only tests of VOR function (caloric and rotational tests) that measure hSCC to determine
      vestibular loss. Thus, little is known about interventions to facilitate vestibular
      compensation of the otolith organs.

      Recent studies have demonstrated adaptation following otolith organ stimulation using
      centrifugation (or linear acceleration), but there is no data regarding optimum stimulus
      parameters. The concept of using centrifugation for otolith adaptation may be similar to
      using gaze stability exercises for VOR adaptation. Healthy control subjects (n = 5 per
      experiment) will participate in three separate experiments to determine: (1) the optimum
      off-axis distance of the rotary chair, (2) the optimum duration of OAR, and (3) the optimum
      OAR stimulation/training schedule.
