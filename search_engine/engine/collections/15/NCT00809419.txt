      provided multiple treatment options for the disease. Brachytherapy has been studied in
      multiple clinical trials in the past with many studies showing a therapeutic benefit.
      Treatment with radiotherapy and anti-VEGF compounds is a promising approach to treating AMD.
      The current treatment for neovascualar AMD involves multiple injections over an indefinite
      period of time. This trial will evaluate whether treatment with brachytherapy can reduce or
      eliminate the need for continued injections.
