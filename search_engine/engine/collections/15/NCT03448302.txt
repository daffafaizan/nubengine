      of the lesions and allows for biopsies. However the pre-operative specimens from endoscopic
      biopsies sometimes fail to grade tumor because of the lack of sufficient tissue. Recent
      improvements in computed tomography have allowed for minimally invasive evaluation of cancer
      colon. Quantitative iodine density measurement can be used to differentiate low and high
      grade colorectal cancer. However, debate continues regarding the correlation between tumor
      grade and computed tomography perfusion parameters of colorectal cancer demonstrating the
      need for further investigation in this area of research.
