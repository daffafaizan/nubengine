      meta-analysis show that patients treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
      (TIPS) have lower rebleeding rates compared with endoscopic therapy. However, TIPS is
      associated with higher rates of portosystemic encephalopathy and does not show survival
      benefit. TIPS with a small-diameter may achieve sufficient portal decompression and reduce
      the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. The aim of this study was to conduct a prospective
      randomized trial to compare TIPS with 8mm ePTFE-covered stents and endoscopic variceal
      ligation plus propranolol for the prevention of recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding.
