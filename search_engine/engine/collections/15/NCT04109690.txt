    
      Proposed is a two-phase study. The Phase I portion will confirm the tolerability and safety
      of CPX-351 chemotherapy. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive dose level 1 of
      CPX-351 (44mg/m2 of daunorubicin and 100mg/m2 of cytarabine) on 2 days (day 1 and day 5) of
      the cycle.

      If less than 2 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) are observed in the first cohort of 6, we will
      increase level of exposure to Dose Level 2 by giving (44mg/m2 of daunorubicin and 100mg/m2 of
      cytarabine) on days 1, 3 and 5 of

        -  If less than 2 DLTs are observed Dose Level 2 will become the Recommended Phase II dose
           (RP2D)

        -  If 2 or more DLTs are observed Dose Level 1 will become the RP2D If 2 or more DLTs are
           observed in the first cohort of 6 patients, another 6 patients will be enrolled at dose
           level -1 (29mg/m2 of daunorubicin and 65mg/m2 of cytarabine) on day 1 and 5.

        -  If less than 2 DLTs are observed Dose Level -1 will become the RP2D

        -  If 2 or more patients experience a DLT at dose -1 the study will be stopped Patients
           failing to achieve a response after cycle 1 will be offered a second cycle of induction
           with for dose level 1 and 2 (44mg/m2 of daunorubicin and 100mg/m2 of cytarabine) on day
           1 and 5 of induction 2. And for dose level-1, (29mg/m2 of daunorubicin and 65mg/m2 of
           cytarabine) on day 1 and 5 of induction 2.

      Phase II: Once the RP2D is confirmed we will enroll 12 patients. If 3 or more responses are
      observed an additional 12 patients will be enrolled for a total of 24. If 7 out of 24
      evaluable patients achieve response, an additional 24 patients will be enrolled for a total
      of 48 patients.

      â€¢ If less than 3 responses are observed in the first 12 patients, the study will be
      terminated.

      The outcomes presented in this protocol are associated with the Phase II of the study.
