      Critically ill patients experience a degree of hyperinflammation, cellular immune
      dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Supplementation with key nutrients, like glutamine and
      antioxidants, is most likely to have a favourable effect on these physiological parameters
      leading to an improvement in clinical outcomes. The results of two separate meta-analyses
      suggested that glutamine and antioxidants may be associated with improved survival. We have
      recently completed a dosing study to determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of glutamine
      dipeptides and antioxidants in critically ill patients with evidence of hypoperfusion. The
      purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the effect of high dose glutamine and antioxidant
      supplementation on mortality in a large scale randomized trial.

      Study Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized to receive glutamine supplementation or antioxidant
      supplementation (or respective placebo).
