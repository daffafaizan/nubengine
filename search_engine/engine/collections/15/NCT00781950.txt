      examine and compare the effects of dietary ground flaxseed supplementation in volunteers with
      claudication secondary to lower extremity atherosclerotic arterial disease (peripheral
      arterial disease). The original proposal was for a two year study duration but this was
      truncated at one year to insure patient compliance remained high. This patient population is
      likely to benefit from flaxseed because there is a high prevalence of accelerated
      atherosclerosis and a higher than normal incidence of arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions and
      stroke. This study will be focus on whether dietary flaxseed can reduce clinical
      manifestations of peripheral arterial disease and increase exercise capacity in these
      patients. Two general hypotheses will be tested in this proposal. First, we hypothesize that
      fewer primary and secondary events (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke,
      myocardial infarctions, angina, arrhythmias) will occur in patients who ingest flaxseed in
      their diet. Secondly, we hypothesize that dietary flaxseed supplementation will be associated
      with beneficial effects on exercise performance, blood pressure and circulating lipid levels.
      This trial will generate data on the safety, tolerability, cardiovascular efficacy and
      genomic response to a diet rich in flaxseed in patients with peripheral arterial disease
      (PAD).
