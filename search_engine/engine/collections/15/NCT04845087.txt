    
      The aim of this study is to assess if ozonized water can be used for the treatment of
      peri-implant mucositis in patients with dental implants.

      Patients who respond to eligibility criteria and that will sign the informed consent will
      undergo a professional oral hygiene procedure.

      Patients willl undergo professional dental hygiene also with the use of glycine powders.
      Then, glycine powders air-flow will be administered. Then they will be randomly divided into
      two groups:

        -  Trial Group: irrigation of peri-implant periodontium with mucositis with ozonized water.

        -  Placebo Group: irrigation of peri-implant periodontium with mucositis with water.

      Periodontal indices will be recorded at the baseline, after 1 and 2 months. After 1 and 2
      months, only glycine powder will be performed, together with ozonized water/water irrigation
      and the collection of periodontal indices.
