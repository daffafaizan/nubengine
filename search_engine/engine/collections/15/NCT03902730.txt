      disease, but the biggest benefit may be found in the effects on maintaining muscle mass
      throughout the aging process. The implications resistance training has on an individual's
      ability to function throughout the day with less fatigue whilst performing tasks at an easier
      level can all be related to improved strength and endurance that comes with resistance
      training. Furthermore, how the nervous system adapts and sends signals to the working muscles
      are of great interest as neuromuscular adaptations help in coordination, balance, and
      agility. Variations of the same style of exercise have been theorized to improve and/or
      change the adaptations that can occur. Thus, the purpose of this study would be to assess
      surface electromyography (sEMG) activations on 4 anatomical sites simultaneously during the
      squat exercise under varying conditions.
