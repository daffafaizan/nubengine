      cross-linking (CXL) with conventional ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation at 3 milliwatt/cm² (mW/
      cm²) or accelerated ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation at 9 mW/ cm². In both groups riboflavin
      with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was used. The objectives of this study are to evaluate and
      compare different corneal parameters (maximum corneal curvature, depth of collagen
      cross-linking, endothelial cell density) and clinical outcomes of uncorrected visual acuity
      (UCVA) and best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA)) after CXL with conventional and
      accelerated UVA irradiation.
