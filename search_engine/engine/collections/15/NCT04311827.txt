      in Emergency Department (ED) depending on the resources available. Not all ED physicians are
      trained or comfortable with the serratus anterior nerve block and thus it is not always
      available to patients and is provider dependent.

      This is an observational study where patients with multiple rib fractures will receive either
      a serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) in addition to traditional forms of pain control when
      providers trained to perform the block are available, or will receive traditional forms pain
      control if trained personnel are not available. In addition to the serratus anterior plane
      block, standard forms of pain control in the Stanford Emergency Department include: oral or
      parenteral acetaminophen, oral or parenteral NSAIDs, oral or parenteral opiates, parenteral
      lidocaine, and parenteral ketamine.

      Retrospective evaluation of the allocation of patients to either nerve block or no nerve
      block will be dictated by physician ability, time and resources to do the block. The efficacy
      of the block will be evaluated by serial measurements of pain score and respiratory capacity.
