      period in order to eliminate factors that could interfere with the proper plaque control.
      Forty-five non dental students with healthy gingival (maximum 5% of sites showing gingival
      bleeding) were randomized into four groups according to the frequency of oral hygiene (every
      12h, 24h, 48h or 72h). Plaque Index (PLI) and Gingival Index (GI) were evaluated by two
      trained examiners at baseline, 15 days and 30 days.
