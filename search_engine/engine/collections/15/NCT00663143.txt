      bone producing cells in the bone marrow.

      A total of 5 subjects who require surgery for mandible (jaw) fracture and bone graft will be
      recruited. Some patients who will undergo mandible surgery will require a bone graft. In this
      procedure, a small piece of bone from the hip is placed in the mandible. In this study, a
      small amount of bone marrow fluid (5 mL or 1 teaspoon) will be obtained after the bone graft
      is completed. Obtaining the bone marrow will not result in additional pain or health
      problems. The effect of TZD on bone marrow and bone forming cells will be studied. The cells
      obtained during surgery will be grown at Dr Beck's laboratory at Emory University School of
      Medicine.

      A working hypothesis suggests that the increased fracture risk in patients taking TZDs is the
      result of TZDs altering the differentiation capacity of bone marrow stromal cells pushing
      them towards the adipocyte lineage at the cost of osteoblast formation thereby decreasing
      bone formation.

      Study AIM:To determine whether TZD exposure in vitro alters bone formation and the
      differentiation capacity of bone marrow stromal cells by promoting adipocyte lineage
      differentiation and lowering osteoblast formation.
