      of mediators from mast cells and basophils, characterized by cutaneous, respiratory,
      cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. The most common specific causes of
      anaphylaxis are venom, drug, and food allergies (i.e. patients with specific anaphylaxis,
      SA), When a causative factor is not identified in patients are said to have idiopathic
      anaphylaxis (IA). Evidence of an underlying clonal mast cell disease has been found in about
      I in 15 patients with IA in our studies and in about 1 in 12 patientswith venom induced
      anaphylaxis in a European study. (1) The number of patients with anaphylaxis to foods or
      drugs who have a clonal mast cell disease is not known and the number or patients with venom
      induced anaphylaxis in the US with clonal mast cell disease has not been determined. Thus, a
      more complete understanding of the prevalence of clonal mast cell disease in those
      experiencing anaphylaxis and a better understanding of the associated laboratory
      abnormalities and disrupted molecular signaling pathways will have a substantial impact of
      the clinical management of patients who present with anaphylaxis.

      This protocol thus focuses on determining the prevalence of clonal mast cell disorders in
      patients with the anaphylaxis, whether unexplained (IA) or associated with exposure to an
      antigen (SA), and attendant changes in the mast cell compartment. Subjects 13 - 75 years old
      will be evaluated to correlate both clinical and laboratory features of anaphylaxis and to
      identify genetic and molecular pathways that may predispose to these events. Subjects may
      undergo bone marrow examination in addition to supporting laboratory studies when indicated.
      We plan to enroll up to 200 subjects.
