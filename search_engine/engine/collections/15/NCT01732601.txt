      inpatient psychiatric hospitalization in this country. These expensive contacts with the
      health care system effectively address acute suicidality for many adolescents but there is a
      significant subset of suicidal patients that have continued suicidality. This study will
      target teens that are at risk for re-hospitalization based on continued suicidal ideation,
      their mood and another risk factor such as self-harm or substance use. These risk factors
      have been shown to increase risk for continued suicidal behavior and expensive contacts with
      the health care system. This protocol has been designed to determine whether Intensive
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which was designed to treat adolescents with a mood
      disorder, suicidal ideation, and substance use, will result in better treatment outcomes
      compared to standard care in the community. The Intensive CBT condition will be delivered by
      a team of two licensed mental health therapists over the course of one year and will work
      with both the teen and parent. The standard care condition will receive treatment in the
      community. One hundred-and fifty adolescents (38 a year) will be recruited from several
      inpatient and partial hospital locations. Each adolescent will receive a thorough baseline
      assessment to determine whether they are appropriate for the study and will be assigned to
      either the Intensive CBT condition or treatment within the community. Both groups of teens
      will receive follow-up assessments at 6, 12, and 18 months to identify how they are doing
      over time.
