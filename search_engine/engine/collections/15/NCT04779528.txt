      may lead to life-threatening situations. Awake Fiber-Optic Bronchoscopy Intubation (FOBI)
      technique is considered as the gold standard when a difficult airway is anticipated to secure
      the airway and to facilitate the surgery. FOBI is usually done in supine position, while (in
      conscious patients) lateral position is the most recommended position to keep the upper
      airway patent.

      This prospective clinical trial study will test whether awake FOBI in Lateral position will
      provide a safe profile or a significant advantage over FOBI in supine position, in morbidly
      obese patients undergoing elective bariatric surgery. The main outcome is success rate and
      duration of the procedure. Secondary outcomes are oxygenation maintenance, hemodynamic
      stability, airway complication, sedation score, and postoperative airway morbidity in 6 hours
      after surgery.
