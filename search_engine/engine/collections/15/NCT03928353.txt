      on-site Randomization/Treatment day, 3 days on-site for treatment and safety monitoring, a
      Follow-up Visit (Day 7), and a Final Follow-up visit (Day 28). Seven days prior to
      Randomization, subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be administered ASA 81 mg orally once daily
      (QD) until the final dose on the morning of Day 1 before receiving study drug. A ticagrelor
      180 mg oral dose will be administered on the morning of Day -2 followed by either 90 mg or
      180 mg every 12 hours until the 5th dose has been administered on the morning of Day 1.

      On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be randomized in a ratio 3:1 (PB2452:placebo), to receive an IV dose of PB2452 or
      placebo 2 hours following the 5th ticagrelor dose. Subjects may be discharged from the
      clinical site between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7,
      if already discharged, and on Day 28 (Â±2 days).
