      carotid and aortic atherosclerosis in patients being treated with lomitapide. Patients from
      countries in the EU, the US and Canada who are being treated with lomitapide and are enrolled
      in The Lomitapide Observational Worldwide Evaluation Registry (LOWER), will be invited by the
      LOWER enrolling physician to participate in this substudy.
