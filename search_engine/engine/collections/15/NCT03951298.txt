      production of myelin during neurodevelopment in WFS, as active and developing
      oligodendrocytes (cells that produce myelin in the brain) are more vulnerable to ER stress
      than mature ones. However, standard DTI methods conflate inflammatory processes (which can
      also be associated with ER stress) in the extra-axonal space with metrics of axonal and
      myelin integrity, leading to potentially confounded measurements. The research team proposea
      to collect novel, validated diffusion sequences on a new state of the art MRI scanner
      (Siemens Prisma) and apply cutting-edge analysis approaches to measure white matter integrity
      throughout the brain and in the optic nerve, improving the ability to draw conclusions about
      axonal and myelin integrity over time. Researchers will assess WFS patients annually at our
      WU Wolfram Research Clinic using these methods.

      Findings from this work may indicate future targets for brain-specific intervention, identify
      outcome measures or high-risk subgroups for clinical trials targeting neurological symptoms.
      These data will also greatly expand our understanding of the cross-sectional and longitudinal
      phenotype of WFS1-mutation related disorders, rather than classically defined Wolfram
      Syndrome. Such knowledge will have a significant impact on patients and families by allowing
      physicians to provide more accurate prognoses. Finally, forms of ER stress-mediated apoptosis
      have been implicated in more common neurodegenerative, endocrine and neurodevelopmental
      diseases, which may benefit from the insights gained here.
