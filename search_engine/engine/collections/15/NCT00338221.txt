    
      This is a double blinded randomized clinical trial of Alanyl-Glutamine or Glycine in children
      with persistent diarrhea or malnutrition. The primary objective of the study is to determine
      the effect of 7 days of supplementation of alanyl-glutamine as it compares to glycine on the
      damaged intestinal barrier function, measured by lactulose/mannitol test on day 8, in
      children at HIAS in Fortaleza, Ce, Brazil, with persistent diarrhea (history > 2 weeks
      duration) or malnutrition (assessed by height-for-age Z-score less than -1). Secondary
      objectives of the study include determining the effect of 7 days of supplementation of
      alanyl-glutamine or glycine on diarrhea frequency and duration; weight gain; protein loss and
      intestinal inflammation, and lactoferrin excretion; and weight gain at 2-4 weeks after
      treatment. One hundred and eight children who meet the inclusion criteria will be
      prospectively randomized to one of two treatment groups: (1) Glycine or (2) Alanyl-Glutamine.
      All children will be given vitamin A and Zinc supplementation; and if they have diarrhea,
      standard oral or IV rehydration therapy will be administered.
