    
      In Part 1, a total of 24 healthy male subjects matched for weight will be divided into 3 age
      groups:

        -  Cohort A: 8 subjects aged 65 to 74 years, inclusive

        -  Cohort B: 8 subjects aged ≥ 75 years (1:1 weight matched with subjects of Cohort A [±5
           kg])

        -  Cohort C: 8 subjects aged between 18-50 years, inclusive (1:1 weight matched with
           subjects of Cohort A [±5 kg])

      Each cohort will be randomized 3:1 to active (6 subjects) and placebo (2 subjects) treatment
      respectively. Weight matched subjects in Cohorts B and C will be assigned to active treatment
      and placebo accordingly. Cohorts A and C will be dosed with 50 mg q.d. GLPG1205 for 14 days.

      In the open-label Part 2, an additional cohort of 8 subjects aged 65-74 years (Cohort D) will
      be included to characterize the PK profile after a loading dose followed by multiple doses of
      GLPG1205 q.d. for 13 days. A 250 mg loading dose will be administered on Day 1 followed by 50
      mg q.d. from Day 2 to Day 14.
