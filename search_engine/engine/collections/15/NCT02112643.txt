      become inflamed, scarred, and at times permanently damaged in an autoimmune reaction highly
      associated with abnormal thyroid hormone levels. Some patients have much more severe TED than
      others, but overall, most patients reach a point with relatively stable TED after 1 to 2
      years. A recent European study showed that oral selenium, a trace mineral involved in
      anti-oxidation and immune regulation, could actually alter the course of mild TED, lessening
      its signs and symptoms and even improving the quality of life of those who took it. The
      investigators would like to perform a sister study throughout North America. In this
      randomized, double-blinded, multi-center trial, some subjects with mild TED would be given
      100 micrograms of sodium selenite twice a day; others would receive a placebo. Signs,
      symptoms, and quality of life would be measured at regular intervals throughout the 6 month
      period of drug administration, and for 6 months thereafter.
