    
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical study for participants with
      histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HCC or
      G/GEJ cancer. All participants will receive study treatment (s) until progressive disease
      (PD), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by sponsor.
      This study consists of the following phases.

      Phase 1 (Dose escalation for sitravatinib as monotherapy and in combination with
      tislelizumab): Two dose levels of sitravatinib as monotherapy, 80 mg once daily and 120 mg
      once daily, will be evaluated in participants with unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic HCC or G/GEJ cancer. A modified 3+3 design will be used in the dose escalation.
      Approximately 6 to 12 DLT evaluable participants will be treated with sitravatinib as
      monotherapy. The combination dose escalation of sitravatinib (80 mg once daily and 120 mg
      once daily; modified 3+3 design) with tislelizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks, in both cohorts)
      will be evaluated in participants with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HCC or
      G/GEJ cancer. Approximately 12 to 24 DLT evaluable participants will be treated with
      sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab.

      Phase 2 (Dose expansion for sitravatinib as monotherapy and in combination with
      tislelizumab): Approximately 20 participants will be enrolled in each cohort. There will be a
      total of 4 cohorts in the study.

        -  Cohort A: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Antibody Na√Øve or Refractory/Resistant HCC

        -  Cohort B: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody naive HCC

        -  Cohort C: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody refractory/resistant HCC

        -  Cohort D: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody naive G/GEJ cancer
