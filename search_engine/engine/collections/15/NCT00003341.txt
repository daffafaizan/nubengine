        -  Determine the hematologic response and transfusion requirements of patients with
           malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma with chemotherapy
           related moderate anemia treated with epoetin alfa.

        -  Determine the effect of moderate anemia on quality of life of these patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate changes in quality of life with changes in anemia associated with treatment
           with epoetin alfa in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of changing quality of life on health care resource utilization
           among these patients treated with epoetin alfa.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study.

      Patients are evaluated for anemia during their prescribed chemotherapy regimens at either 3
      or 4 week intervals beginning week 3 or 4. Patients with hemoglobin levels of 10.0-12.0 g/dL
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with hemoglobin levels greater than 12.0
      g/dL are not randomized until their hemoglobin levels decrease to 12.0 g/dL or below.

        -  Arm I: Patients immediately receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously each week.

        -  Arm II: Patients are observed for 6-8 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated.
           Patients whose hemoglobin levels decrease below 9.0 g/dL receive epoetin alfa
           subcutaneously each week. Patients whose hemoglobin levels are at least 9.0 g/dL are
           observed for another 3-4 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated.

      Patients receive epoetin alfa treatment for up to 15 or 16 weeks.

      Qualify of life questionnaires are completed every 3 or 4 weeks until week 30 or 32.

      Patients are followed through week 36.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 275 patients (at least 130 per treatment arm) will be accrued
      for this study.
