      5000, Medison Co. Ltd, korea). Examination is performed after emptying of the bladder in
      dorsal lithotomy position.

      Three dimensional ultrasound will be performed using Medison, Voulson 530 D-MT ultrasound
      machine (Medison Co. Ltd, Korea). The uterus is visualized in the longitudinal plane, the
      ultrasound probe is kept steady and the patient is asked to lie still on the examination bed.

      Sonohysterography will be done after introduction of the catheter into the cervix, a twenty
      milliliter syringe which is prefilled with the distending media (saline) is then fitted to
      the catheter. The speculum is removed and endovaginal probe is introduced in the posterior
      vaginal fornix. The uterus is then visualized in the longitudinal plane to demonstrate the
      endometrial cavity and the catheter. Once this is possible, sterile saline is slowly injected
      through the catheter into the uterine cavity; up to ten milliliter of saline is usually
      enough for the procedure.

      Hysteroscopy will be done under general anesthesia. The hysteroscopy is rigid continuous flow
      diagnostic hysteroscopy . It has a 30ยบ panoramic optic which is 4 mm in diameter and the
      diagnostic continuous flow outer sheath is 6.5 mm in diameter.
