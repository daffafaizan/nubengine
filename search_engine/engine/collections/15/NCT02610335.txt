      which presents co-morbidity factors and risks of post-operative complications. The
      non-invasive methods are a good alternative compared with the surgery : the patients
      medically treated present few damages and the results of the postponed surgery are equivalent
      to the immediate surgery. That is why a non-surgical treatment is proposed in first intention
      to the patients with mild or moderate symptoms : this treatment associates an epidural
      infiltration and a kyphosis reeducation.

      Yet the kyphosis reeducation did not show a real profit in the time compared with the natural
      evolution of the pathology. The benefits of the infiltration are lost three months after this
      one in 80 % of the cases. A return to physical activity and a restored spinal mobility would
      improve the duration of the infiltration effect. The objective is then to compare the
      efficiency of a spinal mobility reeducation program versus a kyphosis reeducation program in
      patients with acquired and central lumbar spinal stenosis. It is a prospective, monocentric,
      randomized, superiority and parallel-group study :

        -  group C (control group) : kyphosis reeducation + patient education + auto-reeducation at
           home,

        -  group M (test group) : spinal mobility reeducation + patient education +
           auto-reeducation at home.
