    
      Up to 60 subjects, including males and females ages 19-89 years old and of all races, and
      with tinnitus severe enough to seek medical attention, will be enrolled in this study. All
      participants must be evaluated or have documentation of being evaluated prior to beginning
      therapy with rTMS in order to confirm eligibility and to rule out any medically treatable
      causes of tinnitus. An MRI scan of the head may or may not be required, depending upon the
      results of this evaluation, in order to rule out specific middle ear pathologies.

      This study will require participation in at least three weeks (4 weekdays per week) of rTMS
      sessions, including two active weeks and a sham (or placebo) week. There will be a three week
      washout period following each treatment week. At the completion of the three treatment weeks,
      subjects who have noticed an improvement in their tinnitus will have the option of
      participating in a maintenance rTMS program providing up to 8 additional weeks of treatment.
