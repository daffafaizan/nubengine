      common use of glucocorticoids in immunosuppresive regimens after transplantation. Reduced
      kidney functions and hypomagnesemia with the use of PPIs have been reported in various
      patient populations. However, few studies examined the effects of PPIs on kidney transplant
      recipients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of PPI and/or
      histamine H2 receptor antagonist use on serum magnesium levels, allograft functions and
      survival in kidney transplant recipients.
