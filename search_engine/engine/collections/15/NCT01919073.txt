      of children who complete the Brief Behavioral Intervention to a wait-list control. Children
      in the wait-list control will be waitlisted for four months prior to initiation of treatment,
      which is a typical wait for clinical care. Treatment will then be offered to the children on
      the wait-list.

      All parts of the intervention and all measures of behavior and family functioning are part of
      standard clinical care. The parts of this protocol that are not standard clinical care are
      the following: 1. Randomization process with half of the patients on a waitlist for four
      months. Randomization will be block randomization stratified by gender. 2. Booster sessions
      for problem solving at three months and six months after last treatment session. In standard
      clinical care this occurs only if the patient calls and requests. 3. Collection of behavior
      and family functioning measures at three months and six months after the active treatment
      component.
