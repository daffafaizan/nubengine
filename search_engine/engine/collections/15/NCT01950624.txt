    
      Objective: The development of a patient registry for Down syndrome (DS) was identified as a
      priority in the 2007 Down Syndrome Research Plan. Under the auspices of the Down Syndrome
      Consortium, founded in 2011 as a public-private partnership between the NIH and DS advocacy
      organizations, NICHD awarded a contract in 2012 to create a patient-focused online registry
      to facilitate research participation by individuals with DS. Two advisory boards, composed of
      advocates, family members, clinicians, researchers, and other relevant parties, have been
      involved in the development of the registry materials.

      Study Population: Individuals with DS (including those with mosaic DS and partial trisomy 21)

      Design: DS-Connect (TM) is an online survey tool designed to collect demographic data and
      health information from individuals with DS.

      Outcome measures: The purposes of DS-Connect (TM) are:

        1. To identify the various phenotypic manifestations of DS.

        2. To identify individuals with DS who may be eligible for research studies or new clinical
           trials, based on specific information about their diagnosis and health history.
