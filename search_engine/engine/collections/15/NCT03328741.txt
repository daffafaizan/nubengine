      exercise and information. The face-to-face BOA program is a model to deliver this treatment
      at primary care facilities in Sweden. Presently less than 20% of people with OA receive
      adequate treatment. This may be due to lack of healthcare resources or people having trouble
      to fit their schedule to primary care opening hours. To facilitate a better OA care,
      alternative methods are therefore required.

      A two-armed randomized clinical superiority trial will be performed to compare OA treatment
      by a web-based program, Joint Academy, with the traditional face-to-face BOA program in 270
      adults with clinically verified OA. Using intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol,
      evaluations will be performed at baseline, after 6 weeks and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The
      primary outcome is physical function. Secondary outcomes are joint pain, health-related
      quality of life, self-reported function, amount of time of physical activity/exercise and
      overall satisfaction. A health-economic analysis will also be performed. The primary endpoint
      will be at 12 months. Data will be monitored using web-based questionnaires in Joint Academy,
      and regular paper questionnaires for the face-to-face treatment.

      Should the trial show superiority in favor of Joint Academy, an implementation of the
      web-based treatment would benefit both patient and society at large, since Joint Academy
      entails a more flexible treatment in regards to time and location, and is not as costly
      per-patient as regular face-to-face treatment.
