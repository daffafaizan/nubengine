      and for all treatment options, including a conservative treatment policy. The predictability
      will then be compared with on the one hand simplified prognostic models that include only a
      selective set of highly predictive parameters that have already been described in the
      literature, such as patient age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and
      pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS). On the other hand, machine learning techniques, that
      incorporate a large set of variables and have recently shown some promising results, will
      also be applied to predict long-term outcome after ischaemic stroke.
