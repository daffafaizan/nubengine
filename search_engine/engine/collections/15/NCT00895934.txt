      I. Determine the vorinostat dose with the most favorable efficacy and toxicity when combined
      with azacitidine and GO.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the complete response (CR)/ CR with inadequate recovery (CRi) rate after a total
      of 6 cycles of therapy.

      II. Describe the disease-free survival of patients that achieve CR/CRi. III. Determine
      whether acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characteristics associated with preclinical GO efficacy
      predict for clinical benefit, and assess whether differentiation-inducing agents modulate
      these characteristics and lower the apoptotic threshold for calicheamicin-gamma1-induced
      cytotoxicity (in vitro correlative and mechanistic studies).

      OUTLINE: This is phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) on days 1-9, azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or
      intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours
      on day 4 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
