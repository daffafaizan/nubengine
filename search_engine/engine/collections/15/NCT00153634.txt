      patients were randomized to either the standard or biofilm study arm. Antibiotic selection
      was performed centrally according to a standard algorithm using the susceptibility test
      results of the assigned study arm. On Day 0, patients were started on a 14-day course of two
      antibiotics as selected per protocol. Antibiotics were administered intravenously (IV) and/or
      orally. A follow-up phone call or visit occurred on Day 7. An end of treatment visit was
      conducted after completion of antibiotic therapy. A total of 39 patients were randomized.
      Many screened patients were ineligible for randomization based on microbiology results.
