      tolerated regimen for long-term administration to patients with colorectal metastases.

      Primary objectives

      To establish a tolerated dose of daily oral curcumin to be taken long-term with FOLFOX-based
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will be conducted to assess:

      1. Safety, tolerability and feasibility of administering oral curcumin at increasing doses
      escalating to 4 capsules (â‰ˆ2 g C3-complex) during FOLFOX-based chemotherapy and continued for
      the duration of the chemotherapy course.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To observe any changes to the neuropathic side-effects of chemotherapy.

        2. To observe potential for efficacy in terms of disease response and survival.

        3. To identify putative biomarkers in plasma.

      This is a phase I/IIa study:

      Phase I will be a traditional escalation response design study (or 3+3+3) to firstly assess
      the safety of this combination and identify a maximum tolerated dose up to 4 g per day.

      Phase IIa will be a randomised control study comparing curcumin and FOLFOX with FOLFOX alone,
      recruited at a 2:1 ratio respectively.
