      modality for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urethral imaging in children. It employs
      ultrasound technology in combination with ultrasound contrast agent, which is administered
      intravesically via a bladder catheter. Currently, second generation ultrasound contrast
      agents are commercially available, comprising of gas-filled microbubbles. CeVUS in children
      is being widely practiced, primarily in Europe, despite the fact that none of the
      commercially available ultrasound contrast agents are yet approved for clinical applications
      in pediatric population. In the United States, there is limited clinical experience with
      ceVUS in children. Among the currently commercially available ultrasound contrast agents,
      OPTISON has already been used in research and off-label in clinical settings involving adults
      and children. One in-vitro study has been conducted aiming to optimize the ultrasound
      technical parameters and the dose of OPTISON for intravesical administration in children. In
      this clinical trial the investigators aim to evaluate the diagnostic feasibility and safety
      of ceVUS with the intravesical use of OPTISON for vesicoureteral reflux detection and
      urethral imaging in children.
