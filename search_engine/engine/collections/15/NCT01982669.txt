      multiple organ damage and death. Excessive salt intake plays very important role in the
      development of hypertension. Reducing salt intake prevents high blood pressure as well as
      cardiocerebral vascular diseases.

      The experimental design is a multi-center, random-order, double-blind observational study to
      investigate the salty taste and salt intake in population-level.

      A total of 606 individuals from four cities in China are recruited in this study. This study
      aims to explore the salty taste characterization and salt intake in participants who like or
      dislike spicy diet through questionnaire, spicy preference, salty perception and
      super-threshold as well as the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion.
