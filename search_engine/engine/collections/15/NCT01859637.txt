    
      This was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative study. Eligible patients with Severe
      Chronic Neutropenia received Zarzio® for 12 months. Study visits were scheduled for
      screening, start of treatment with Zarzio®/Filgrastim HEXAL®, 6 weeks after start of
      treatment and at months 3, 6, 9 and 12.

      Immunogenicity assessment: Patients were screened for anti-recombinant human granulocyte
      colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) antibodies at screening (Visit 01) and at every study
      visit with the exception of Visit 02 (start of treatment). The evaluation of the immune
      response to rhG-CSF administration was made by a three-step procedure comprising a validated
      binding antibody screening and confirmatory radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIP). Samples
      positive for binding antibodies in the confirmatory RIP assay were evaluated for neutralizing
      antibodies using a validated cell-based neutralization antibody assay (NAB).

      Efficacy: Complete blood counts with differential white blood cell counts were performed and
      absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were calculated at every study visit. For each time point the
      neutrophil counts are summarized by the SAF set using descriptive statistics for the ANC as
      well as for the changes from baseline.

      Safety: Adverse events are listed for the safety population set (SAF) (term, date of AE
      onset, date of AE resolved, AE duration, severity grade, relationship to study drug, action
      taken, SAE). Additionally, the following variables were also listed: Serum human chorionic
      gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test, Physical examination, vital signs (pulse, blood pressure),
      weight (kg), height (cm), Laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis) values
