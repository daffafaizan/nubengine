      operation. These TILs were cultured in human IL-2 medium for 2 to 3 weeks, and reactivated by
      OKT3, irradiated feeder cells from the PBMCs of healthy donors and LCL set from
      EBV-transformed normal B cells, and expanded in human IL-2 medium for another 15 days. 10e9
      to 10e10 TILs were yielded. The phenotype, function and sterile were detected before these
      TILs infused patients. After accepting operation or first round of routine chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy, the patients were treated with autologous TILs 10e9-10e10 via intravenous in 30
      min, q weekX2 weeks, and followed by two weeks with daily sc low-dose interleukine-2.

      Patients will be evaluated for toxicity and immune response. Peripheral blood of patients
      using multimer analysis and/or ELISPOT assays. Additional, we will be able to determine
      anti-tumor effects from immunotherapy by evaluating the clinical response of patients with
      stable or progressive disease at the time of TILs infusion. Lastly, we will assess additional
      tumor markers in patients with relapsed/refractory disease by immunohistochemical staining of
      tumor sections from previous diagnostic or therapeutic biopsy samples to determine the
      incidence of additional tumor antigen targets that may be used in future studies.
