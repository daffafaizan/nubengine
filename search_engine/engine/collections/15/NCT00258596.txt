      coronary stenting significantly decreases restenosis as compared with conventional balloon
      angioplasty, this treatment modality has shown to be superior in an increasing number of
      indications. Percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusions (CTO), however,
      is still limited by high restenosis rates. Although coronary stenting using bare metal stents
      significantly decreases restenosis in CTO, restenosis rates still reach 32% to 55%.

      In 200 patients with CTO randomized in the PRISON I study, we demonstrated a restenosis rate
      of 22% after bare metal stent implantation as compared with 33% after conventional balloon
      angioplasty. During the past few years, sirolimus (rapamycin), a cytostatic macrocyclic
      lactone with anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties, delivered from a
      polymer-encapsulated stent was shown to almost eliminate the risk of restenosis in selected
      groups of patients.

      In this prospective, randomized, single-blind trial we enrolled 200 patients with chronic
      total occlusions: 100 were randomly assigned to receive bare metal BxVelocity™ stents, and
      100 to receive sirolimus-eluting Cypher™ stents. The primary endpoint was angiographic binary
      restenosis rate at six months follow-up. Secondary endpoints were a composite of major
      adverse cardiac events, target vessel failure, in-stent and in-segment minimal lumen
      diameter, percentage diameter stenosis, and late luminal loss at six months follow-up.
      Clinical long-term follow-up will performed up till 24 months
