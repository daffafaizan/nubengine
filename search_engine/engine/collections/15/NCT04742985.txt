      tea leaves (epigallocatechin-3-gallate) may improve gastric mucosal status in rat with
      alcohol-induced gastritis.Therefore, the investigators conduct a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled pilot study to investigate the effects of a combined extract of green tea
      seed (saponins) and green tea leaves (epigallocatechin-3-gallate) on gastric mucosal
      protection in adults with functional dyspepsia for 8 weeks; the safety of the compound are
      also evaluated. The Investigators examine C-reactive protein, IFN-γ, TNF-α, gastrin,
      malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine, and questionnaires (Gastrointestinal Symptom
      Rating Scale, Nepean dyspepsia index-Korean version, Nepean dyspepsia index-Korean version
      QOL questionnaire, Gastrointestinal symptom scale) at baseline and after 8 weeks of
      intervention. Twenty four adults were administered either 320 mg of combined extracts of
      green tea seed (saponins) and green tea leaves (epigallocatechin-3-gallate) or a placebo each
      day for 8 weeks.
