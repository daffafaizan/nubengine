      that CCM therapy delivered with the Optimizer meaningfully improved health outcomes in
      patients with NYHA class III heart failure symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction of
      25-45%. CCM has shown significant improvements in quality of life measures, with an average
      improvement of >11 points in MLHWFQ incremental to the improvement of a randomized control
      group with no device. Six minute hall walk and functional class also showed improvements in
      the PMA data. The post-approval study (PAS) protocol has been designed to evaluate long term
      safety and efficacy of the OPTIMIZER Smart in a real-world setting.
