      diabetic dogs and has improved the dogs' longevity and quality of life. Observational
      analysis by trained veterinarians has indicated that the natural fluctuations in blood
      glucose levels do not exist in dogs using the product. The hypothesis for this study is that
      healthy human subjects will have an increase in insulin levels after consuming the
      investigational food product.
