      vasculitides that typically follow a chronic course and are associated with serious illness
      and death.Three clinical conditions are recognized: microscopic polyangiitis (MPA);
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's, GPA); and eosinophilic granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (EPA, formerly Churg Strauss Syndrome). Though these conditions have different
      clinical features, they can have overlapping immunological characteristics.

      The precise cause of AAV is not understood, but there are clear genetic associations which,
      in the context of predisposing environmental factors, such as infections, may lead to
      development of disease. There are no diagnostic criteria for AAV, but there are validated
      classification criteria and disease definitions.

      There is a need to find biological markers that define immunological tolerance so that
      immunotherapy medicines may be correctly changed and safely withdrawn in some people.
