      displaying del(13) at initial diagnosis following two cycles of high-dose melphalan 200 mg/mÂ²
      each supported by autologous stem cell retransfusion with interferon versus PEG-interferon.
      Patients with del(13) are screened for availability of a fully HLA-matched related or
      unrelated donor. If patient's informed consent is obtained additionally, he is scheduled to
      undergo an allogeneic SCT following the first cycle of high-dose melphalan. All other
      subjects are to proceed to a second course of high-dose melphalan similar to the
      standard-risk group. Initial cytoreduction is foreseen with four cycles of
      anthracycline-dexamethasone combination followed by combination therapy with
      ifosfamide/epirubicine/etoposide for stem-cell collection.
