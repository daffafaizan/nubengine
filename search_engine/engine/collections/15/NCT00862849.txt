    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution,
      breakdown and elimination) of regular human insulin + recombinant human hyaluronidase
      (rHuPH20) versus insulin lispro alone, and to compare the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro
      + rHuPH20 versus insulin lispro alone. The effects of regular human insulin + rHuPH20,
      insulin lispro + rHuPH20, and insulin lispro alone on the body will be evaluated by blood
      glucose measurements and by calculating the rate at which a glucose solution is infused to
      maintain blood glucose within a certain range. The safety and tolerability of insulin lispro
      with and without rHuPH20 and regular human insulin with rHuPH20 will be studied. The study
      drugs will be administered by subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.
