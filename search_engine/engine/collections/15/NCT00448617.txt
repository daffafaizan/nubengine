      exposure and increased risk for viral respiratory illnesses. Published and preliminary data
      suggest that airborne pollutants including tobacco smoke increase susceptibility of
      respiratory epithelium to infection with influenza A and that this effect is at least
      partially mediated by oxidative stress. However, no studies have specifically looked at the
      interaction between smoking and the effects of influenza virus in human volunteers.
