      Facility using the established brain tumor initiating cell (BTIC) cell line GBM-6 as the
      antigen source. Vaccine administration will begin at four weeks (week 10) following
      completion of radiation therapy and will be given every two weeks for four doses. At the time
      of the 1st and 3rd vaccinations, additional 180 cGy fractions will be delivered in single
      doses in a novel effort to induce NKG2D ligand upregulation (thereby "sensitizing" residual
      tumor to lymphocyte attack). The total radiation dose for each patient will be 5940 cGy.
      Subsequent vaccinations will be given every four weeks and will continue to a maximum of one
      year from study enrollment, by which time median survival will have passed based on
      historical data. Imaging will be obtained at study entry (post radiation therapy) and every
      eight weeks thereafter to eighteen months, after which time the interval between imaging
      follow-up episodes will be determined by the patient's clinical status. Imaging will include
      MRI of the brain using our current institutional brain tumor imaging protocol. Imaging will
      also include SPECT/MRI and perfusion MRI. FDG-PET imaging may be used in certain cases to
      differentiate tumor necrosis from progression.
