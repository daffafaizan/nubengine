      this study. Of these, 25 obese children will be enrolled in the study group, and 25 non-obese
      children will serve as controls.

      All subjects will fill out a comprehensive mineral intake questionnaire as part of the study
      to ensure adequate calcium intake prior to the study.

      All subjects will collect a first morning urine sample for calcium, creatinine, and NTX.

      Fasting blood samples will be drawn for the following analytes: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,
      25-dihydroxyvitamin D, intact PTH, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, osteocalcin, insulin,
      c-peptide, fasting blood glucose, leptin, and adiponectin.

      Bone Mineral Content will be evaluated in 16 obese subjects with vitamin D level of < 30
      nmol/L.
