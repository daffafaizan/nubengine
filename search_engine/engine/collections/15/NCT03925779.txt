      In Dexmedetomidine (DEX) group the patients will be administered a loading dose of i.v.
      dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2-1 μg/kg/h,
      titrated according to the sedation score, till the end of the procedure. In the PR group,
      propofol will be started by a loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg over 3-5 minutes then a maintenance
      infusion of 25-75 μg kg/min. Remifentanil infusion will be started at 1 μg kg over one minute
      then and 0.01-0.1 μg kg/min. If the patient complained of pain or discomfort, the infusion
      rates of dexmedetomidine (DEX group) or propofol-remifentanil (P-R group) will be increased.
      If the higher limit of the dose range of the study drugs reached, additional fentanyl 0.5
      μg/kg i.v. boluses will be administered. Rescue medication consisting of propofol boluses of
      0.5 mg/kg i.v. will be given if the previous protocol failed. Sedation score,haemodynamics,
      end-tidal carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation, total fentanyl, propofol bolus doses, patient
      and colonoscopist satisfaction and side effects will be recorded.
