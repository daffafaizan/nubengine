      radiation exposure for the patient. Usually, radiation exposure in radiological interventions
      is measured by the dose area product (DAP). Diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) are based on
      the third quartiles (Q3) of the pooled dose area product (DAP) for the known interventional
      procedures. They have been introduced in the 1980s by the International Commission on
      Radiological Protection's (ICRP's) to reduce patients radiation exposure. In the recently
      published guideline of the Federal OfÔ¨Åce for Radiation Protection in Germany in 2016 DRLs are
      not defined for PTBD procedures due to insufficient data. Procedure complexity due to
      different techniques, patient anatomy, lesion characteristics and disease severity makes it
      difficult to define DRLs in this fluoroscopy-guided intervention. The ICRP recently published
      some recommendations on DRLs in medical imaging including radiological interventions. As DRLs
      are often missing in this field, it was suggested to analyze national data sets comprising
      dosimetric data from a large number of facilities. The aim of this retrospective study is to
      give a nation-wide survey on patients radiation exposure in different PTBD procedures
      considering factors that may have an impact on increased or decreased radiation exposure like
      fluoroscopic-guided versus ultrasound-guided bile duct puncture. A questionnaire was sent to
      200 gastroenterological and radiological departments in university and non-university
      hospitals to analyze the last 10 - 30 consecutively performed PTBD procedures.
