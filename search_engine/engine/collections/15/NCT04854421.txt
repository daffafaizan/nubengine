      be asked to arrive at PBRC wearing easily removable gym-style clothing. Upon checking in,
      they will first complete the informed consent process, then have their vital signs checked,
      and then women of child-bearing potential will also have a urine sample taken. Outpatient
      clinic procedures will be followed by a series of body size and composition assessments that
      will require an outfit of minimal clothing. Clean spandex shorts, sports bras, and lycra caps
      will be provided.

        -  Anthropometric measurements including hip, waist, arms, and thighs circumferences will
           be collected by a trained observer using a calibrated tape measure.

        -  Body shape will be measured digitally using 2D and 3D optical devices that optimize
           light patterns to calculate depth.

        -  Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis measures the amount of fat and lean mass in the body
           using electrodes positioned close to the feet and hands.

        -  Whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures the amount of bone, muscle, and fat
           mass in the body using low energy X-rays.

        -  BodPod estimates whole body volume, fat mass, and fat-free mass of the body using
           variations in air pressure
