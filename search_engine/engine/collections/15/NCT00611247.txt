    
      This is a single institution phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of tailored temozolomide therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      and poor risk features.

      Patients will be assigned to 1 of 2 parallel treatment groups based on their AGAT promoter
      region methylation status, as determined by PCR.

      Patients achieving a complete remission after 1 to 2 cycles of chemotherapy will be eligible
      to receive up to an additional 5 cycles of temozolomide of 5 or 19 days, depending on the
      methylation status of the AGAT promoter (consolidation phase).
