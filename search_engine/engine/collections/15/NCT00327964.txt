      mortality especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The need for an accurate, simple, and inexpensive
      method to diagnose malaria has become increasingly urgent. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs),
      based on detection of Plasmodium antigens, may represent a more practical diagnostic tool
      than traditional light microscopy. This longitudinal study's objectives are (1) to evaluate
      the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values)
      of RDTs, as compared with presumptive diagnosis and microscopy, for the diagnosis of malaria
      in children in Kampala, Uganda, and (2) to identify host and test factors that lead to false
      positive and false negative RDT results by comparison with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      analysis. Study subjects in this RDT study will have already been enrolled in a larger
      on-going longitudinal study of antimalarial drug efficacy, tolerability, and safety that
      began at the Kampala study site in late 2004. In the RDT study, over a one-year period, study
      participants' blood samples will be evaluated with the current gold standard for malaria
      diagnosis (microscopy) as well as two types of RDT whenever they present with a new fever
      episode (the first fever after study enrollment, or a fever that occurs more than 14 days
      after the patient's most recently diagnosed episode of malaria). As part of the on-going
      longitudinal drug efficacy trial, probability sampling was used to select a random sample of
      600 children, who will be followed for three years for all their health-care needs. The RDT
      study will involve evaluation of the cohort over 12 months, beginning in approximately the
      third quarter of 2005. This protocol is a substudy of 04-068.
