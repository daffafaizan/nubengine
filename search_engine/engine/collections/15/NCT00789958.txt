        -  To estimate the stratum-specific (R0 and R1) and overall 2-year survival probabilities
           of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
           comprising capecitabine and gemcitabine hydrochloride, followed by capecitabine and
           radiotherapy. (R0 stratum closed as of 12-15-11)

        -  To estimate the 2-year stratum-specific and overall disease-free survival and local
           disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the frequency and severity of toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to margin of
      resection (negative [R0] vs microscopically positive [R1]). (R0 stratum closed as of
      12-15-11)

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine every 12 hours on days 1-14
           and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats
           every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning in week 13, patients receive oral capecitabine every 12
           hours on days 1-7. Patients also undergo concurrent three-dimensional or
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy on days 1-5. Treatment repeats weekly for 5-6 weeks in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
