    
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism
      (PE), or both, is a life-threatening complication in postoperative patients. This
      cross-sectional study was aimed to investigate the incidence, associated risk factors,
      prophylaxis, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in a large clinical neurosurgery center in China.
      9010 patients underwent neurosurgery procedure were included. Distribution of age, sex,
      whether received PICC during perioperative period, and some special primary diseases are
      significantly different between VTE and non-VTE patients. Student's test and chi-square test
      were performed for analyses. We investigated VTE incidence, risk factors, prophylaxes,
      treatment and outcomes in postoperative neurosurgical patients, and summarized the VTE
      susceptible population of the patients, providing a VTE patient profile for neurosurgeons to
      concern.
