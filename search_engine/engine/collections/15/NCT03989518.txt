      day 1, imaginal extinction on day 2, and a fear reinstatement procedure, again to visual
      stimuli, on day 3. Skin conductance is used to measure fear responses.

      Participants' are randomized to receive conditioning, extinction and reinstatement with
      either complex or simple stimuli. During imaginal extinction, imagery of each experimental
      stimulus is prompted through different verbal instructions.
