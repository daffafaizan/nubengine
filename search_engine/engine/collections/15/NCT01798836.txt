      resulted in a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate in patients with poor embryo
      quality, with repeated IVF failures and in poor responders. This is a protocol combining the
      effect of the microdose flare on endogenous FSH release with the benefit of an immediate LH
      suppression of the GnRH antagonist.

      A major disadvantage of the use of a GnRH antagonist protocol is the limitation for
      programming cycles, as the drugs administration is started on day 2 of the menstrual cycle
      and is strictly followed until the hCG criteria are met.

      The purpose of the study is to perform oestradiol pre-treatment with the combined ultrashort
      flare GnRH agonist /GnRH antagonist protocol aiming to

        1. better programme an antagonist cycle and

        2. improve the IVF outcome parameters, from the production of more follicles / oocytes up
           to the rise in live birth rates.
