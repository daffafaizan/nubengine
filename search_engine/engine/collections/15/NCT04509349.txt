      unlocked vs. phase-locked, modalities of tACS and transcutaneous ACS on tremor amplitude in
      25 patients with ET.

      Comparing transcranial and transcutaneous, as well as unlocked and phase-locked, modalities
      represents the novelty of our approach. This has the potential to generate a wealth of
      preliminary data forming the basis of a large, randomized controlled trial of multiple
      sessions of this intervention, hence potentially capable of producing long-lasting effects,
      in this common and disabling disorder. Given its non-invasiveness and relatively low cost,
      this approach has, if effective, a huge therapeutic potential in ET.
