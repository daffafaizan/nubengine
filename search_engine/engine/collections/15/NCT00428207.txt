      patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. We have noted that some
      pump patients develop glycemic instability with use of insulin lispro, and that this resolves
      with change to insulin aspart. Several patients using lispro have reported noting a whitish
      precipitate in the infusion set, and in two cases we have examined the catheters and
      confirmed biochemically that this precipitate was insulin. Furthermore, in vitro studies
      indicate that insulin aspart is more resistant to isoelectric precipitation than insulin
      lispro. Although it has been rare for patients to notice a visible precipitate in the pump
      catheter, there is a subset of patients using lispro who have noted that their blood glucose
      levels will tend to rise 2 or more days after the insertion of a new pump infusion system.
      These findings mirror bench studies showing that the relative stability differences between
      aspart and lispro in pump infusion systems becomes more apparent over time.

      The endpoints examined in previous randomized clinical trials comparing aspart and lispro
      were not directed specifically at assessing the effect of insulin type on glycemic stability.
      In these previous studies, pump infusion systems were changed every 48 hours whereas most
      pump patients routinely replace their infusion catheters only every 72-96 hours; this
      discrepancy may account for the failure of these trials to demonstrate the difference in the
      stability of insulin aspart and lispro that has been noted in clinical practice.

      This investigator-initiated clinical trial is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of
      CSII with insulin aspart compared to insulin lispro with use of pump infusion catheters for
      up to 96 hours.
