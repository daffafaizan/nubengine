    
      This study occurred in two parts: Part A and Part B.

      Part A of the study was an open-label, PK evaluation of intramuscular (IM) administered
      suptavumab in preterm infants for whom palivizumab was not recommended to enable the
      selection of dosing regimens for Part B.

      Part B of the study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, designed to
      evaluate efficacy, safety, serum concentration and immunogenicity of IM administration of
      suptavumab in preterm infants for whom palivizumab was not recommended. The total duration of
      Part B was up to 265 days (includes a 28-day screening period, 57-day treatment period and
      180-day follow-up period).

      Up to 1515 subjects were planned to be included in Part B of the study. Participants were
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 different groups, each with 505 infants; one group received one
      dose of suptavumab and one dose of placebo, the second group received two doses of
      suptavumab, and the third group received two doses of placebo.

      There was a separate genetic testing sub study.
