      diagnosis. The treatment recommendation of primary metastatic NPC is systemic chemotherapy.
      However, the optimal regimen is yet to determine due to lack of prospective randomized trial
      for this unique group of patients. Generally, GP regimen is used as the first-line treatment
      of primary metastatic NPC. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of Toripalimab
      Combined with GP Regimen Chemotherapy Versus GP Regimen Chemotherapy for Primary Metastatic
      NPC.
