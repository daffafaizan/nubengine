      convenience. Afterwards, patients will be submitted to pulmonary function test (spirometry)
      and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (incremental and submaximal), maximal inspiratory pressure
      evaluation and induction of the inspiratory muscle metaboreflex through venous occlusion
      plethysmography. Disease specific health related quality of life questionnaire (Saint George
      Respiratory Questionnaire) and daily life dyspnea questionnaire (Baseline Dyspnea Index and
      Transitional Dyspnea Index) will be administered at the first and last visit of each subject.
      Patients will undergo inspiratory muscle training for 30 minutes per day, 7 times a week, for
      8 weeks, with Inspiratory Muscle Trainer device (PowerBreath Inc.). There will be a weekly
      follow up at the institution's Clinical Research Center, where maximal inspiratory pressure
      (PImax) and inspiratory training techniques will be reevaluated. After this period, tests of
      pulmonary function, questionnaires exercise tolerance and induction of the inspiratory muscle
      metaboreflex will be reevaluated.
