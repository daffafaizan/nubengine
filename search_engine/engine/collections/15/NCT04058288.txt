      suffer from upper-limb motor deficits including weakened hand dexterity. As upper-limb motor
      functions are crucial for most of the daily living activities, there is a need for effective
      intervention. The current therapeutic approaches involve intensive physical therapy training
      involving repetitive tasks which causes fatigue and lack of engagement in the patients. To
      address this issue, the investigators will investigate the combined use of individually
      targeted noninvasive brain stimulation (T-NIBS) using High-definition Transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) and music-assisted hand exercises using MusicGlove to modulate
      the neuroplasticity in the desired manner to observe functional changes in hand dexterity.
