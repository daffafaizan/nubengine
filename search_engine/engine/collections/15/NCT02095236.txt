      Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) and
      Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), patients with hepatic tumors could be treated with high
      local doses by sparing normal liver tissue. However, frequently occurring large HCC tumors
      are still representing a dosimetric challenge in spite of modern high sophisticated RT
      modalities. This interventional clinical study has been set up to evaluate the value of
      different fiducial markers, and to use the modern imaging methods for further treatment
      optimization using physical and informatics approaches.Radioopaque fiducial markers or
      electro-magnetic transponders will be implanted into or in close proximity of the tumor.
      During a radiotherapy treatment session image and/or signal acquisition will be performed by
      ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or by specialized signal
      detectors The data will help to characterize tumor and organ motion during one treatment
      session which may in fact have impact on dose distribution
