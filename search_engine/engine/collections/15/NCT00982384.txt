    
      The study objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive program among
      patients with advanced COPD, implemented by a multi-disciplinary team. The program consists
      of best care recommended in clinical guidelines, combined with disease management, compared
      to best care only.

      The program will include designated COPD centers operated by multi-disciplinary teams
      (pulmonologists, nurse practitioners, physiotherapists, social workers and dietitians).
      Disease management will be provided in these centers by qualified designated nurses.
