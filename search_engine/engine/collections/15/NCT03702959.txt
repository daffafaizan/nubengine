    
      A retrospective study from January 2010 to December 2017. Eligible for analysis are:
      singleton pregnancies between 24 - 34 weeks' gestation who were given a single course of
      intramuscular betamethasone. Single course comprised of two separate doses of 12 mg given 24
      hours apart. Each woman was allocated into one of the four pre-defined groups based on the
      time the intramuscular betamethasone was administered; Group 1 (5am-11am), group 2
      (11am-5pm), group 3 (5pm-11pm) and group 4 (11pm-5am). The investigators hypothesized that
      exogenous corticosteroids given during the nadir state of endogenous corticosteroids activity
      could alter maternal and fetal glucose homeostasis.
