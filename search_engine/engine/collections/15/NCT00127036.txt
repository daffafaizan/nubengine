      treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is undergoing rapid improvement. Currently, there
      are two major chemotherapy regimens, which can both be combined with anti-angiogenesis
      treatment. These regimens are 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) + irinotecan and 5-FU + oxaliplatin. Each
      therapy has roughly similar rates of response, but it is unclear which specific therapy would
      benefit which patients. The advent of genome wide expression analysis provides a tool to
      analyze these differences. In the microarray analysis of colon cancer outcome trial,
      sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Moffitt Cancer Center, patients with
      newly diagnosed metastatic colon cancer are biopsied and samples are preserved in ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) later. Patients are then randomized to either one of two state of the art
      regimens: capecitabine + irinotecan + avastin (bevacizumab) or capecitabine + oxaliplatin +
      avastin. Response to chemotherapy, time to progression, and overall survival are end points
      of this trial. Once accrual of patients has been met, the investigators will compare genome
      wide expression patterns for each group.
