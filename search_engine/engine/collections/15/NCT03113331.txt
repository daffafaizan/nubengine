      for the assessment of the effects of combined prenatal exposure on both birth outcomes and
      longer-term infant and child health. The specific objectives are to:

        1. Determine the effects of pre- and post-natal exposures to environmental contaminants,
           nutritional factors and psychosocial stress on pregnancy and neurodevelopmental
           outcomes;

        2. Assess the contribution of social, genetic, epigenetic, nutritional and environmental
           factors to the etiology and outcomes of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and
           preterm birth; and

        3. Assess the effects of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) on indicators of
           epigenetic modifications, and the relationship between such epigenetic changes and
           infant neurodevelopmental, cardiovascular, and metabolic outcomes.
