      an 8-week intervention using open-label vortioxetine with flexible dose between 5-20 mg,
      dependent on participant response and tolerability. In addition to assessment of depressive
      symptoms, improvement of menopause-related physical and emotional symptoms that occur with
      MDD, including vasomotor symptoms, cognition, fatigue, anxiety, sleep complaints, and quality
      of life, were also examined.
