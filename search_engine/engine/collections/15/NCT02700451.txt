      decrease opioid requirements following spine surgery, the investigators propose a
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial comparing the efficacy of intravenous
      (IV) acetaminophen (Group A) or IV ketorolac (Group K) versus placebo (Group P). The impact
      of treatment on perioperative opioid use, opioid-related complications, functional outcomes
      and rates of pseudarthrosis following 1 or 2 level lumbar fusion surgery will be measured in
      each group. The specific aims of this study are as follows:

        -  Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of IV ketorolac or IV acetaminophen use on
           immediate postoperative opioid requirements, postoperative pain levels and opiate
           related symptoms using the Opiate-Related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS)

        -  Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of IV ketorolac or IV acetaminophen use on
           functional outcomes defined by return to work, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the
           Veterans Rand-12 (VR-12) Health Survey

      The primary outcome is to determine the total postoperative opioid dose (in oral morphine
      equivalents) in each group. The investigators hypothesize that patients in Group A and Group
      K will have lower total opioid use, suffer from fewer opiate related symptoms and have
      similar rates of pseudarthrosis to patients in Group P. The investigators hypothesize that
      patients in Group A and Group K will have a quicker return to work and improved early
      functional outcomes although they acknowledge that long term functional outcomes may be the
      same for all groups.
