      of endometrial like tissue outside of the uterus. The condition affects approximately 10% of
      reproductive-age females and can cause various types of pain, including chronic pelvic pain
      and deep dyspareunia (pelvic pain with deep sexual intercourse). Research has shown that
      individuals with endometriosis and dyspareunia have significantly reduced sexual quality of
      life, lower self-esteem, and impaired sexual function. Qualitative research has also
      demonstrated that many individuals with dyspareunia feel guilty about their pain, and often
      continue to engage in intercourse even when the pain is severe.

      Aims and Hypotheses:

        1. To measure the reduction in deep dyspareunia observed among people using the PLR with
           their partner. The investigators hypothesize that the PLR will be associated with a
           reduction in self-reported deep dyspareunia scores among participants randomized to the
           PLR intervention, compared to participants randomized to the waitlist control group. The
           measured reduction in deep dyspareunia will be used to power a future definitive trial.

        2. To assess the acceptability of the phallus length reducer (PLR) for participants with
           endometriosis and their partners. The investigators hypothesize that both partners will
           indicate the PLR is acceptable on the self-reported questionnaire.

        3. To explore whether an at-home assessment of dyspareunia is an acceptable and valid
           alternative to clinical measures. The investigators hypothesize that the at-home
           assessments of dyspareunia will be acceptable to participants and will yield results
           that are highly correlated with questionnaire-based and clinical assessments of this
           pain.
