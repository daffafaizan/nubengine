      study within a more diverse population also at high risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to
      evaluate whether a high-legume diet will result in increased satiety and in turn will
      facilitate reduced energy intake and weight loss compared to a control diet provided under
      similar conditions. In addition, explore potential beneficial effects of the high-legume diet
      on gastric emptying and circulating levels of appetite-regulating hormones and other
      biomarkers. Dietary behaviors that are even moderately more satiating over time have the
      potential to enhance weight loss and could lead to a significant public health impact among
      populations at high risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other chronic diseases.

      Towards the end of the study, the participants will do an additional test, looking at how
      long food takes to pass through the digestive system using a SmartPill capsule. The SmartPill
      is a pill about the size of a large multivitamin that can measure pH, pressure, and
      temperature changes, which it uses to assess where in the digestive tract it is. The
      participant swallows the pill, and carries around a receiver that is about the size of a deck
      of cards for the next 3-5 days. The SmartPill is expelled, and the receiver notifies the
      participant that they can return the receiver to the study personnel.
