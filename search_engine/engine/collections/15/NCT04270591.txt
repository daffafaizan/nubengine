    
      Phase Ib study population

      Approximately 15 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIb, IIIc or IV).
      All patients should carry at least one of the following MET alterations (confirmed by local
      or central laboratory):

        -  Patients with METex14 skipping mutation who had previously responded to and later
           progressed on another MET inhibitor

        -  Patients with MET amplification (FISH GCN ≥ 5 or MET/CEP7 ratio ≥ 2)

        -  Patients with MET over-expression (IHC3+) Phase II - Safety Run-in Population (US only)
           A minimum of 6 patients who meeting the eligibility for either Phase Ib or Phase II.

      Phase II study population (globally) Approximately 90 patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIb, IIIc or IV) harboring METex14 skipping mutation that have been
      pre-screened by local or Sponsor-designated central laboratory, who are either systemic
      treatment naïve (patients should be chemotherapy intolerance or not eligible for chemotherapy
      or patients refusing of chemotherapy after well-informed) or no more than 2 prior systemic
      therapies and have not had prior MET inhibitor for the advanced NSCLC. It is planned that
      approximately 30% of the enrolled patients are systemic treatment naïve for the advanced
      disease.

      After approximately 90 patients have been enrolled, if the proportion of patients at sites in
      Japan is < 10% of the total population, enrollment may continue in Japan until the proportion
      is 10%.
