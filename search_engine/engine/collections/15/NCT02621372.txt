      intention of avoiding endoscopy in low-risk cases . Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <
      150,000/Î¼l) is a common complication in patients of chronic liver disease (CLD) . So, the
      investigators in this research formulated this study to determine whether platelet count can
      predict the presence of EV or varices which need prophylactic therapy (medium or large size
      EV) in a cohort of Egyptian patients with liver cirrhosis and can identify patients with the
      intention of avoiding endoscopy in low-risk cases.
