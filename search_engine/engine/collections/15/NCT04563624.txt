      blocks and ceramic blocks ., the choice of nano hybrid composite blocks based on the claim of
      the manufacturer, as it's considered to be promising , nano hybrid composite blocks has the
      highest fillers content (86% by weight), resembles natural teeth perfectly , Excellent
      physical values for flexural strength and abrasion, No firing required (a real one step ),
      can be processed using any conventional milling unit, can be finished and polished optimally,
      Ideal for grinding even in cases with thin edges.
