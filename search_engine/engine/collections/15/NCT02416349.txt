      participants will undergo to the initial assessment, which consisted of anamnesis and
      anthropometric measurements: weight, height and body mass index (BMI). Then, they will be
      submitting to spirometry and respiratory muscle pressure using a manovacuometer.

      All patients will submit underwent two types of intervention: respiratory muscles stretching
      (RMS) and remain at rest (control group). The stretching will occur throughout the expiratory
      phase to allow respiratory muscles to reach their maximal length, and two sets with 10
      consecutive incursions will use for each stretching pattern with an interval of 30 seconds
      between series.

      For the intervention in the control group, all volunteers will be position at rest in a
      comfortable in a chair during 20 minutes.
