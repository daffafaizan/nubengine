      consist of a Screening Phase to determine eligibility, a Pretreatment Phase, a Treatment
      Phase, and a Follow-up Phase. The study is designed to estimate the magnitude of the effects
      of JNJ-56021927 on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates. In vitro studies have indicated
      that JNJ-56021927 and its active metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) have the potential to affect
      multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8) and drug
      transporters proteins (P-glycoprotein [P-gp] and breast cancer resistance protein [BRCP]) via
      inhibition or induction. In human hepatocytes, JNJ 56021927 and JNJ-56142060 (M3) were found
      to be inducers of CYP3A4. The induction of CYP3A4 suggests that JNJ-56021927 and M3 will
      induce other CYP isozymes and drug transporters (eg, CYP2C and P-gp via activation of
      pregnane X receptor). The study is designed to confirm the in vivo significance of these
      non-clinical findings.
