      Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments in patients with severe CHF who
      receive heart transplants. The following is a list of goals for this project:

        -  To estimate the responsiveness of PROMIS domain scores by comparing scores in patients
           with severe heart failure before and after a clinically significant event (heart
           transplant). The specific PROMIS domains assessed are physical functioning, fatigue,
           satisfaction with discretionary social activities, depression, and global health.

        -  To estimate the responsiveness of a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO)
           measure, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), the Medical Outcomes Study
           Short Form-36 Vitality subscale (SF-36v2), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2).

        -  To collect cross-sectional and longitudinal data on traditional clinical measures of
           heart failure outcome (6-minute walk test and New York Heart Association [NYHA] class)
           that can inform the definition of a minimally important difference (MID) for the PROMIS
           domains of physical functioning, fatigue, satisfaction with discretionary social
           activities, depression, and global health.
