    
      Two dose levels were tested: Recombinant Anti-EGFr Antibody Low-dose level patients received
      initial dose 100 mg/m2 and 4 weeks later 250 mg/m2 weekly maintenance to the disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity or death or withdraw informed consent.High-dose level
      patients received cetuximab initial dose 400 mg/m2 and 4 weeks later loading 400 mg/m2 and
      250 mg/m2 weekly maintenance to the disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or death or
      withdraw informed consent. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as: grade 4 or 3-time
      grade 3 cutaneous toxicity,successive 3-time infusion suspension due to grade 3 cutaneous
      toxicity,any other â‰¥grade 3 adverse reaction or acute pneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, and
      other lung diseases.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive single dose of low-dose group of Recombinant Anti-EGFr
      Antibody. If the ratio of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) after a single dose is not more
      than a third, then high-dose group can be treated.After high-dose(initial dose 400 mg/m2,
      iv., 2 h),safety will be observed and blood sampling will be taken for a single dose
      pharmacokinetic analysis.After 4-week continuous administration (loading dose 400 mg/m2, iv.,
      2 h; maintenance dose 250 mg/m2, iv, 1 h, q1w) until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity reaction, death or revocation of informed consent.As the blood concentration reach
      steady state, blood sampling will be collected for steady-state pharmacokinetic analysis, for
      1 week.After completion of the steady-state pharmacokinetics,patients can receive
      chemotherapy,and safety (including immunogenicity) and curative effect will be observed.
