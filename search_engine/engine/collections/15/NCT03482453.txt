    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. The study will assess the safety and
      tolerability of single oral dose of TAK-788, evaluate the effect of a low-fat meal on PK of
      TAK-788 and will assess the relative bioavailability of two DiCs of TAK-788.

      The study will enroll approximately 69 participants. The study is designed to consist of 3
      parts: Part 1- dose escalation phase, Part 2- low fat meal effect and Part 3 - relative
      bioavailability. The study population of Part 1 will consist of 40 participants enrolled into
      5 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8 randomized participants with 6 receiving a single dose of
      TAK-788, and 2 receiving matching placebo under fasted conditions. In Cohorts 1 to 5, safety
      of single-dose TAK-788 will be evaluated. For Part 2, the effect of a low-fat meal on a
      single tolerable dose of TAK-788 will be determined following review of safety and
      tolerability data from the previous cohorts in Part 1. The study population of Part 2 will
      consist of 16 participants enrolled into 2 cohorts of different doses, where participants
      will be randomized to a cross-over sequence of:

        -  TAK-788 Fed + TAK-788 Fasted

        -  TAK-788 Fasted + TAK-788 Fed

      The study population of Part 3 will consist of 13 participants enrolled into 1 cohort, where
      participants will be randomized to a cross-over sequence of:

        -  TAK-788 DiC (reference) + TAK-788 DiC (test)

        -  TAK-788 DiC (test) + TAK-788 DiC (reference) This single-center trial will be conducted
           in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 7
           months. Participants will be contacted by telephone 30 days after the last dose of study
           drug for a follow-up assessment.
