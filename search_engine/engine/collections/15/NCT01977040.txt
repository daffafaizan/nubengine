      pregnancy or at the time of delivery who delivered between January 1, 2000 and December 31,
      2012 at participating centers. The primary objective of the study is to describe techniques
      utilized to screen for and diagnose vasa previa.

        -  In those cases that were diagnosed antenatally, to describe the different management
           protocols utilized, correlate these management protocols with neonatal outcomes and
           support the management protocol that offers optimal outcomes for both mother and
           neonate.

        -  In those cases that were not diagnosed antenatally, to describe the clinical scenario
           surrounding delivery and the neonatal outcomes. Review the ultrasound reports and
           maternal characteristics to identify any potential risk factors for vasa previa that
           could have been identified antenatally in attempt to improve neonatal outcomes in the
           future.

        -  In all cases of diagnosed vasa previa (those diagnosed antepartum, intrapartum, and
           postpartum), to describe the maternal characteristics and identify potential underlying
           risk factors that may provide a basis for future screening recommendations and
           protocols. Due to the rarity of this diagnosis, the study hopes to include 100-250
           participants.
