      reconstitution of patients´ health in ischaemic stroke. This is the reason why patients with
      extended stroke are increasingly subjected to an endovascular stroke therapy (EST).

      Matter of ongoing debate is how to sedate these patients during intervention. Some clinicians
      prefer an intubation due to a reduction of patients´movements and therefore potentially
      lowering complication rates (injury by catheter, aspiration e.g.).

      On the other hand retrospective investigations hypothesize that general anaesthesia is
      associated with peri-interventional hypotension followed by poorer clinical outcome.

      The best anaesthaesiologic management in endovascular stroke therapy to this point of time is
      not known. The investigators therefore designed this study comparing intubated state with
      general anaesthesia vs. non-intubated state with conscious sedation during EST, focusing on
      patients´ outcome.
