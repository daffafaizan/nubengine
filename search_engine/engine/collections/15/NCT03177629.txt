      patient has active bleeding or less than 30Ã—10^9/L of platelet, because of side effect and
      cost issues. Since the first case report by Italian study, several investigators have
      reported that secondary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can occur in patients with Helicobacter
      pylori (H. pylori) infection. We already reported the efficacy of H. pylori eradication in
      moderate ITP patients with phase II study (Annals Hematology 2015:94:739-46). To improve the
      evidence of this strategy for the treatment of moderate ITP, we plan to start this
      multi-center, open label, prospective randomized phase 3 study.
