      HIV-negative healthy female volunteers, and to see if these cells can be modified using a
      combined anti-viral and antiinflammatory drug called maraviroc, a medicine used in the
      treatment of HIV infection. Maraviroc works by preventing HIV from entering human immune
      cells by blocking a protein on the outside of these cells called the C-C chemokine receptor
      type 5 (CCR5) receptor. When maraviroc is bound to this protein, the virus cannot enter the
      cell. The investigator thinks that CCR5 antagonists could be particularly good drugs for HIV
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and could potentially be dosed in ways that are easier to
      take than the current drugs used for PrEP.

      In order to further evaluate this PrEP strategy, the investigator will first study the immune
      cells in the blood and genital tract of HIV-negative healthy female volunteers over the
      course of 3 months to see how these cells change over time and are affected by factors such
      as age, menstrual cycle, and genital infections.

      The amount of maraviroc compared with the drugs in the current drugs used for PrEP
      (tenofovir/ emtricitabine) in the blood and genital tract of HIV-negative healthy female
      volunteers before, during, and after they are given maraviroc versus tenofovir/ emtricitabine
      for 7 days will be measured. We will also study immune cells from the blood and genital tract
      from these women to see if maraviroc, tenofovir, or emtricitabine have an effect on these
      cells that would prevent them from becoming infected with HIV.
