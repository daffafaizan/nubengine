      anastomotic stenosis and access failure. A stent graft can be used in AVG with recurrent
      venous anastomotic stenosis to improve long-term patency rate. However, after stent graft
      implementation, the effective treatment for restenosis in a stent graft is still unknown.
      This randomized trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug-coated balloon
      versus regular balloon for in-stent restenosis in stent graft. The investigators plan to
      enroll 40 patients who presented with prosthetic AVG in-stent restenosis, and then to
      evaluate the restenosis lesions by intravascular ultrasound. Patients will be randomized into
      two groups of treatment: drug-coated balloon angioplasty or regular balloon angioplasty.
