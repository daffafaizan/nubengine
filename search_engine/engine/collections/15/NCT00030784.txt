        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin HCl
           liposome in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic soft tissue
           sarcoma.

        -  Determine the objective response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of ifosfamide.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 4
      hours on days 1-3 OR on days 1-4 (for patients enrolled on dose level 6). Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ifosfamide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 12 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
