      vaginal estrogen in the management and treatment of GSM symptoms resulting in vaginal
      atrophy, sexual dysfunction and a decreased quality of life in women with a history of breast
      cancer. Patients will be stratified according to menopausal status prior to breast cancer
      therapy and HR tumor status. Fractional CO2 laser therapy has been approved by Health Canada
      for use in menopausal women with GSM, nevertheless long term efficacy and safety data is
      lacking in the breast cancer survivor population. In the short term (i.e. 6 month follow up),
      research has shown that this therapy is a safe and effective treatment that has promising
      benefits with little to no reported adverse events.
