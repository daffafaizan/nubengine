      or submucous myoma. However, hysteroscopic procedure can cause morbidity and even mortality
      related to infusion distension medium. We had used a manual syringe infusion method to infuse
      fluid for distending the uterine cavity in our institute without significant morbidity, and
      it seems that this method need less amount of distension medium, and possible result in less
      possibility of hyponatremia. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform a randomized
      controlled trial of comparing the manual syringe infusion method with the conventional
      infusion pump method to clarify if the manual syringe infusion method really needs less
      amount of distension medium during hysteroscopy.
