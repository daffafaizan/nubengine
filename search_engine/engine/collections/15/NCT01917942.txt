      Humidification will modulate the natural history of mucositis resulting in a clinically
      significant reduction in the intensity of severe acute mucositis as a function of time for
      CTCAE grade > 1 mucositis (e.g. grade 2 or higher), measured as the area under the time curve
      (AUC) of the plot expressing grade of acute reactions vs weeks for observed CTCAE mucosal
      reactions > 1

      The additional hypotheses are:

        -  Humidification will palliate the acute symptoms of mucositis and xerostomia

        -  Humidification is cost effective through a reduction in hospital bed occupancy

        -  Humidification will improve the functional outcome, particularly swallowing function, of
           patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy
