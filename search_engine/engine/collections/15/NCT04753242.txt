      psychosomatic, psychiatric and psychological consultation and liaison (C&L) services in
      general hospitals worldwide. We want to build upon the experience gained so far in order to
      be well prepared for the future.

      The aims of this survey are

        1. To summarize the efforts made in psychosocial care in the context of the COVID-19
           pandemic.

        2. To assess the experiences made with the established services so far.

        3. To assess the need for networking, cooperation and support.

        4. Improvement of psychosocial care in acute hospitals in the context of pandemics.

      The health services research project is an international cross-sectional online survey. The
      heads of all psychosomatic, psychiatric and psychological consultation and liaison (C&L)
      services in acute care hospitals across all participating countries will be contacted and
      asked to participate. Contact will be made via the respective national professional societies
      and relevant working and interest groups.

      Self-developed questionnaire based on relevant literature, own experience and consultation
      with participating professional societies.

      The survey contains 26 questions on structural and process variables regarding psychosocial
      care structures that psychosocial CL services have established in acute hospitals in the
      context of the COVID 19 pandemic, the implementation and use of COVID-19-related services for
      patients, relatives and staff, special challenges, as well as structural and process-related
      recommendations for pandemic situations. The survey is available in English, French, German
      and Italian. Participants are free to choose the language version to be worked on.

      There will be one survey time point.
