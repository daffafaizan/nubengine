      personnel and patients will not know what treatment is being assigned to patients),
      multicenter, placebo-controlled (a placebo is a treatment identical in appearance to the
      study agent, but containing no active ingredient), dose-ranging study. Approximately 250
      patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups. The maximum length of study
      participation is 54 weeks, including a 6-week screening period. The end of the study will be
      the last follow-up visit of the last patient. Study visits and evaluations will occur, and
      patient safety will be monitored throughout the study.
