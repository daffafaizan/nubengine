      outcome. Inappropriate use of antibiotics has contributed to the emergence and spread of
      drug-resistant micro organisms and increased treatment costs. International guidelines
      provide recommendations for the initial evaluation and management of LRTI, including advice
      on judicious antibiotic therapy. Nonetheless, studies have demonstrated a wide variability in
      adherence to these guidelines.

      To implement key recommendations in clinical practice, various strategies have been used,
      with mixed results. Perhaps the most important aspect of choosing a potentially effective
      intervention is that the choice of intervention should be based upon assessment of potential
      barriers in the target group. Many intervention studies are flawed by failing to control for
      secular trends.

      The investigators performed a cluster randomised controlled trial, to study the effect of a
      multifaceted intervention strategy on the quality of antibiotic use for LRTI. Their
      intervention was tailored to the areas most in need for improvement and took perceived
      barriers in the target group into consideration at the individual hospital level.
