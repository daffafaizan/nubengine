      versus gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant) as treatment restless leg syndrome. Subjects will be
      randomized to gabapentin (IR) or Horizantâ„¢ (ER). Dosing will be blinded to both patient and
      study team members. Once study medication dosing has been optimized, subjects will then
      remain on a stable dose for six weeks until study endpoint, after which subjects will be
      down-titrated off of study medications.
