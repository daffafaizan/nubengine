    
      In this study, we plan to enroll 400 non-dialysis patients with CKD 2-5 and 300 maintenance
      hemodialysis patients. Participants will receive coronary artery computed tomography (CT)
      scanning to detect the extent and the severity of CVC. Follow-up is scheduled at 0, 6, 12,
      18, and 24 months and will consist the following: routine physical examinations, standard lab
      panels (blood routine, liver/kidney functions, tests of the coagulation system, etc.), total
      calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum 25(OH) vitamin D, fibroblast growth
      factor-23 (FGF-23) and coronary artery computed tomography (CT).

      The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between CVC in patients with
      different CKD stages and serum Klotho for renal function correction, and to clarify that
      Klotho can be used as an early biomarker for CVC in patients with CKD, so as to predict the
      occurrence and progress of CVC.
