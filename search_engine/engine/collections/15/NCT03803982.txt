      neuromuscular blockade with a paralytic reversal agent versus patients undergoing standard
      anesthetic protocols in low-pressure pneumoperitoneum bariatric surgery. The study population
      will include patients aged 18-65 referred to St. Joseph's Healthcare for Roux-en-Y Gastric
      Bypass (RYGB) after completion of standard work-up for bariatric surgery through the Ontario
      Bariatric Network (OBN). The investigators plan to recruit and randomize 100 patients in a
      1:1 ratio between deep NMB and standard anesthetic in low-pressure pneumoperitoneum bariatric
      surgery. Once enrolled in the study, patients will be assigned to one of the two groups using
      computer-based randomization on REDCap software. Allocation will be concealed until the time
      of the operation and will be provided directly to the anesthetist in opaque envelopes. The
      anesthetist will be aware of the assigned group, but the patient, surgeon, PACU nurses, ward
      nurses, research assistants and house staff will be blinded. The primary outcomes to be
      examined will include maximum intra-abdominal pressure, Leiden-Surgical Rating Scale, and
      postoperative pain scores. Secondary outcomes will include operative time, postoperative
      nausea, postoperative narcotic use, and length of stay.
