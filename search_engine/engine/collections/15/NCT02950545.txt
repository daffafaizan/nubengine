      driving performance of adults with astigmatism when wearing 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST for
      ASTIGMATISM (toric), 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST (spherical control), and 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST
      (placebo) contact lenses. Adult subjects with nearsightedness and astigmatism will wear three
      types of soft contact lenses (placebo, spherical and toric in randomized order). Each subject
      will read letters on standard eye charts and complete vision and driving tests in a driving
      simulator. Subjects will repeat these tests with each lens type. Analyses will include an
      ANOVA to look for a main effect of lens condition, and separate contrasts to compare toric
      vs. spherical, toric vs. placebo, and spherical vs. placebo lenses. Investigating the lenses
      under simulated driving conditions, which involve eye movement demands, will lend insight
      into the potential advantages of toric over spherical contact lenses for driving safety.
