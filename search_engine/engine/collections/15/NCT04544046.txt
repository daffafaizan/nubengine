      experience significant symptoms and side-effects related to the cancer and the cancer
      treatment.

      This research study is evaluating if a program that involves remote monitoring and home-based
      care may improve the quality of life, ability to manage symptoms, and overall care of
      individuals during cancer treatment. Remote monitoring is broadly defined as a way of monitor
      outside of conventional clinical settings (e.g. in the home) that often utilizes technology
      to increase access to care.

      Eligible participants will be randomized into one of two groups:

        -  Usual Care or

        -  Supportive Oncology Care at Home

      It is expected that about 300 people will take part in this research study.
