      first-time, unilateral, ischemic subcortical stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory
      with mild to moderate hand weakness. All subjects will be assessed for baseline upper
      extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer test and Action Research Arm test), structural and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A single session of bihemispheric tDCS (anodal
      tDCS to ipsilesional M1 and cathodal tDCS to contralesional M1 with 2 mA stimulation for 20
      min) or sham tDCS (same but stimulation for only 2 min) with simultaneous
      physical/occupational therapy will be tested in each subject with a randomized sequence on
      different days (at least two days apart from each other). All stroke patients will receive
      standard medical and rehabilitation treatments during the study period. Changes in
      corticospinal excitability and transcallosal inhibition from the TMS study, as well as
      sensorimotor oscillations, MEG source projection, and functional connectivity from the
      task-related MEG will be assessed immediately before and after intervention.
