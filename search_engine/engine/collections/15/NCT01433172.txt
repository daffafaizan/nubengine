      been grown in the lab, and 2) experimental "bystander (present but not taking part in the
      immune response)" cells. All the cells in the vaccine will be treated with high-dose X-rays
      to make sure that none of them grow and cause more cancer. The bystander cells are human
      cells that have been genetically changed to express GM-CSF and CD40L. These are called
      "GM.CD40L". (That is the original cells, called K562, with the genes for human GM-CSF and
      CD40L inserted into them). These changes are designed to help boost the participants' immune
      system to better fight the cancer in their body. GM-CSF is a hormone that is known to
      stimulate bone marrow to make more white blood cells.

      CCL21 is a chemokine (protein) that helps to recruit T cells (a type of white blood cell that
      helps to protect the body from infections) and leads to hyper-responsive T cells. This leads
      to heightened immune responses when T cells are exposed to both CCL21 and antigen (a
      substance that when introduced into the body lead to production of an antibody)-presenting
      cells (A cell that can "present" antigen in a form that T cells can recognize it ). The
      induction of a strong cell-mediated immune response is the type of immunity expected to be
      most involved in controlling cancer cell growth. A randomized trial of a vaccine consisting
      of the GM.CD40L bystander cells and an equivalent number of allogeneic (taken from different
      individuals) tumor cells plus or minus CCL21 is proposed.
