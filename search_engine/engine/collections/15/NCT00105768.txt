      VA investigators have described greater substance use at the beginning of the month when
      disability and other monthly checks are received. The proposed research addresses an
      important VA priority�seeing that veterans� funds are spent to improve veterans� quality of
      life and are not misspent on substances of abuse.

      Objectives:

      The objective was to determine the effectiveness of a money management-based therapy called
      ATM for veterans who abuse cocaine or alcohol compared to a financial advice control
      condition.

      Methods:

      Veterans were randomly assigned to 36-weeks of ATM or to the control condition, financial
      advice. ATM (Adviser-Teller Money Manager) involves meeting with a money manager at least
      weekly. The money manager performs three functions�limiting patients� access to funds by
      storing checkbooks and ATM cards, training patients to budget their funds, and linking
      spending to treatment goals. The control condition involved listing income and expenses in a
      workbook. Veterans were enrolled from each of two sites if they had spent at least $100 in
      the preceding 90 days on alcohol or cocaine, and had at least $300 per month income. Measures
      of treatment fidelity and participation included number of visits attended, whether funds
      were stored, monthly income and expenses and Likert-scaled ratings from 1-4 of money
      management-related outcomes. Outcome measures collected included urine toxicology tests and
      breathalyzers, self-reported substance use as assessed by the ASI follow-up, and secondary
      measures including quality of life and psychiatric symptomatology.

      Status:

      Data analysis is ongoing. Attempts are being made to (a) disseminate ATM and assess its
      effect among homeless women veterans (b) determine the reliability and validity of money
      management-based assessments used to determine which veterans are capable of managing their
      funds (c) optimize funds management by disabled veterans.
