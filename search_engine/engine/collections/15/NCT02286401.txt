      to evaluate vessel specific ischemia in patients with a clinical indication for invasive
      coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements for suspected
      coronary disease. TAFE is a novel method that derives coronary blood flow from easily
      obtainable non-invasive coronary CT angiograms.

      Participants will undergo a rest coronary CTA, a regadenoson stress CT, and a clinically
      indicated invasive coronary angiogram. The study aims to determine the accuracy of TAFE
      compared to invasive fractional flow reserve.

      We hypothesize that TAFE-derived coronary blood flow, coronary flow reserve, and myocardial
      CT perfusion imaging can accurately diagnose an abnormal FFR (<0.80) measured in vessels in
      patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography.
