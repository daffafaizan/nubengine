      CRSsNP and investigate the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with severe eosinophilic CRSsNP
      who are resistant to the conventional treatment with intranasal corticosteroids and have
      significantly extensive disease involving more than 2 sinuses bilaterally in sinus CT scan
      and Lund-Mackay sinus (LMK) CT score >=10 at baseline. In addition, the investigators will
      have a prespecified enrollment goal of at least 50% of patients with type 2 inflammatory
      diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and/or atopic dermatitis on the basis of
      patient-reported history and will stratify subject numbers between dupilumab treatment and
      placebo group.
