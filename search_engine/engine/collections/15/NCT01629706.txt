      overnight in contact lens solution for 2 hours and 4 hours, separate days. A minimum of 7
      days separated the wear periods. Ocular surface cells were collected after both wear periods.
      In Phase 2, participants wore their habitual contact lenses on a daily wear basis for 4 weeks
      with habitual lens care. Ocular surface cells were collected after Day 1 and Day 28. Phase 2
      included eligible participants who completed Phase 1 and new participants. A participant was
      considered to be asymptomatic if he/she can typically wear contact lenses comfortably for at
      least 10 hours/day a minimum of 5 days/week, and symptomatic if he/she typically wears
      contact lenses for a minimum of 3 days/week and experiences ocular discomfort after less than
      6 hours of wear. Phase 1 participants not eligible to participate in Phase 2 or uninterested
      in continuing into Phase 2 were exited from the study.
