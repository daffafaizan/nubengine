      Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a leading cause of OM and respiratory infections in older
      individuals. Currently, there is no vaccine for NTHi infection. Studies indicate that serum
      bactericidal antibodies are associated with protection from NTHi infection. We predict that
      serum antibodies with bactericidal activity to the lipooligosaccharide (LOS), a major surface
      antigen and virulence factor of NTHi, will confer immunity to this pathogen. LOS of NTHi is
      too toxic to administer to humans and detoxified LOS (dLOS) is not immunogenic, probably due
      to its low molecular weight. In order to improve its immunogenicity, the dLOS was convalently
      bound to tetanus toxoid (TT) using a clinically relevant scheme of vaccination, elicited
      bactericidal antibodies to LOS in an in vivo model. This investigational vaccine also showed
      protection against infection in a chinchilla otitis media model. We propose to evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of this dLOS-TT vaccine in adults (Phase I). Our goal is to develop
      a vaccine for OM and respiratory infections caused by NTHi.
