      eighteen months from August 2014 until February 2016. Eligible women who were admitted in
      spontaneous labour or for induction of labour were recruited. For women who underwent
      induction of labour, an interval of at least six hours following vaginal prostaglandin before
      recruitment was mandatory to avoid overlapping effect of prostaglandin and oxytocin. Upon
      enrolment, each patient was given a study explanation and written consent was obtained.

      The randomisation sequence, either to the early oxytocin group or the delayed oxytocin group,
      was generated using the computer randomisation program in block of two. Allocation to either
      arm of treatment was determined by the sequential opening of sealed numbered envelopes.

      In the first arm of early oxytocin group, labour augmentation with oxytocin was started early
      following artificial ruptured of membrane(ARM). In the second arm of delayed oxytocin group,
      oxytocin augmentation was delayed at two hours after ARM and this practice is currently being
      used as standard protocol in this hospital to manage women in labour. In both arms,the
      infusion rate was doubled every 30 minutes to a maximum of 48 mL/h or until four to five
      moderate contractions per 10 minutes were achieved at which point the infusion rate was
      maintained. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring was maintained throughout the intrapartum
      period. Vaginal examination was performed at four hours after ARM as well as when clinically
      indicated ie. abnormal cardiotocography (CTG) and maternal desire to bear down. In the
      presence of abnormal CTG, either fetal blood sampling or expedited delivery was undertaken as
      per decided by the obstetrician in charge.
