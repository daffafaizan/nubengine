      feature or dynamic feature of tissue and cells, is used to detect malignant cells or tissue
      in fresh specimens. Morphological structure and pathological changes could be captured in
      minutes, which implies a possible application in intraoperative diagnosis. The investigators
      aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of FFOCT for the tissue samples obtained from
      EUS-FNB of pancreas.
