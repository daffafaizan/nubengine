    
      Background:

      The concomitant use of 5-aminosalicylates (5ASA) next to azathioprine (AZA) or
      6-mercaptopurine (6MP) in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may lead to an
      increased effectiveness of therapy as higher levels of the active metabolite of AZA/6MP
      (6-thioguaninenucleotides (6TGNs) are measured.

      Objectives:

      To determine the influence of 5-ASA compounds and its metabolites on the metabolites of
      AZA/6MP (6TGNs + 6-methylmercaptopurine (6MMP).

      Methods:

      Patients with quiescent disease under AZA/6MP therapy are eligible. Patients will receive
      three succeeding regimes (5ASA 2 gram/5ASA 4 gram/ no 5ASA) of 4 weeks next to the standard
      AZA/6MP therapy. At the start and at the end of every regime 5ASA and its major metabolite
      (N-acetyl-5ASA) will be determined in serum next to the measurement of 6TGNs and 6MMP in
      erythrocytes. The safety will monitored by standard laboratory parameters every four weeks.

      Population:

      Patients with IBD in remission and unchanged AZA/6MP dosages for at least 4 weeks.

      Medication:

      5ASA (Pentasa Â® granules; Ferring) will be administered orally in dosages of 2 or 4 grams
      daily for a period of 4 weeks.

      Endpoints:

      The rise or decrease in 6TGNs and 6MMP during the different 5ASA regimes. The evaluation of
      the safety of co-administrating 5ASA next to AZA/6MP.

      Risks:

      Side effects of 5ASA use are limited and well known. Some case reports have described the
      potential risk of developing a myelodepression when AZA/6MP and 5ASA are given together due
      to the rise in 6TGNs. However, in daily practice both drugs are administered together
      frequently. The risks of the frequent blood draws are minimal and usually self-limiting
      (haematoma).
