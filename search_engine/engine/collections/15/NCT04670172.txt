    
      This real-life chronic rhinosinusitis outcome registry aims at longitudinal data collection
      from patients attending specialist care centres across Europe.

      As primary aim it intends to provide new insights on the burden of uncontrolled disease, the
      impact on health-related quality of life, productivity loss as well as the effect of disease
      severity and co-morbid disease on these outcome parameters.

      In addition this outcome registry intends to identify patients eligible for type 2 targeted
      biologic therapy, evaluate treatment effectiveness and markers of treatment response.

      Beyond that direct and indirect costs for society related to chronic rhinosinusitis and its'
      treatment will be studied.
