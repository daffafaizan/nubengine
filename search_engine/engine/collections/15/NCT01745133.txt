    
      This is a single-center, investigator-blind study. Approximately 60 qualified subjects will
      be enrolled into a 2 week treatment phase where they will receive 2 weeks of treatment with
      Olux E foam. After 2 weeks treatment, subjects with a PGA of 0 or 1 will be re-randomized
      into maintenance phase.

      Subjects that achieve PGA scores of >2 will be discontinued from the study and will not be
      randomized. Subjects that achieve PGA scores of 0 or 1 will enter an 8 week maintenance phase
      where they will be randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the following treatment groups:

        -  Vehicle foam (BID)

        -  Sorilux foam (BID)

        -  Sorilux foam (BID on weekdays) + Olux E foam (BID on weekends)

      Subjects will then attend clinic visits at week 6. At week 10 study treatment will be
      stopped.

      The maximum duration of the study is 10 weeks and consists of a Screening/Baseline Visit
      (Week -0), Re-randomization to maintenance phase visit (Week 2), treatment follow-up visits
      at Weeks 6, and end of treatment visit at weeks 10.
