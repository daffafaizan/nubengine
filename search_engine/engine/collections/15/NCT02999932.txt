      critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). However, hyperoxia can be harmful
      too. Examples are myocardial infarction (MI) patients and patients resuscitated to return of
      spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. In Air Versus Oxygen in Myocardial Infarction
      (AVOID) trial, Meyhoff and colleagues proved hyperoxia caused more cardiac injury in patients
      with ST-elevation MI but without hypoxia. Kilgannon and colleagues found that arterial
      hyperoxia following resuscitation from cardiac arrest were associated with increased
      in-hospital mortality, and a pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94-98% was recommended.

      Recently, Panwar and colleagues found that compared to liberal oxygen strategy (SpO2 ≥96%),
      conservative oxygen strategy (SpO2 of 88%-92%) was feasible in patients receiving invasive
      mechanical ventilation. Girardis and colleagues found control oxygen therapy (targeting SpO2
      of 94%-98% or PaO2 of 70-100mmHg) resulted lower ICU mortality than conventional oxygen
      therapy (SpO2 ≥97%) in the randomized clinical trial called Oxygen-ICU. However, the
      Oxygen-ICU trial was single-centered, early-terminated with only 480 patients included and
      led to an unplanned interim analysis. In this larger multicenter trial, investigators
      hypothesized that a relative low SpO2 directed oxygen therapy was safe and would reduced the
      28-day mortality in patients staying longer than 72 hours in ICUs.
