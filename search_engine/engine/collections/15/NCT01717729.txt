      A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to undergo RFA-125I (n = 68; 42 men, 26 women;
      mean age, 50.7 years; age range, 29-73 years) or RFA alone (n = 68; 47 men, 21 women; mean
      age, 48.9 years; age range, 30-74 years). Patients with viable tumors at computed tomography
      (CT) 4 weeks after treatment received additional treatment. Rates of local tumor progression
      and overall survival were evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests, respectively.
      The relative prognostic significance of variables in predicting overall survival and the time
      to tumor recurrence or metastasis were assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards
      regression and logistic regression analyses, respectively.
