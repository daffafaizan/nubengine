      recurrent GBM. The study was conducted with 2 parallel groups of patients. Group 1 was
      designed to study the biological effects of RAD001 in patients scheduled to undergo salvage
      surgical resection, and Group 2 was to enroll patients who were not scheduled for surgery.
      Patients in Group 1 were randomly assigned to one of three pre-surgery treatment groups (0, 5
      or 10 mg/day RAD001 for 7 days). All patients in Group 2 were to receive a fixed daily dose
      of 10 mg/day oral RAD001.
