    
      A fifth European survey of Cardiovascular Disease prevention and Diabetes (EUROASPIRE V) is
      being conducted in 2016-2018 under the auspices of the European Society of Cardiology,
      EURObservational Research Programme. This fifth survey incorporate an assessment of
      dysglycaemia and kidney function in all patients. As in the previous EUROASPIRE surveys this
      survey focusses on hospital patients with coronary heart disease, with and without diabetes
      mellitus, and apparently healthy individuals in primary care at high risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease including those with diabetes.

      This multicentre European study identifies risk factors in coronary patients and high-risk
      individuals, describes their management through lifestyle and use of drug therapies providing
      an objective assessment of clinical implementation of scientific knowledge as reflected in
      current European management guidelines. For the first time we extended this new survey to
      include more information about medication adherence, atrial fibrillation, familial
      hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. All
      centres and countries that participated in the first four surveys are invited to participate
      in the fifth European Survey of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Diabetes (EUROASPIRE V)
      and new countries and centres will be included. This fifth survey will give a unique European
      picture of preventive action by cardiologists, other specialists and primary care physicians
      looking after patients with coronary disease and their families, individuals at high risk of
      developing CVD and all those with dysglycaemia, diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
      Europe.
