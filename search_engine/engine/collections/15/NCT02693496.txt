      of quasi-circular. These lung nodules are surrounded by normal lung tissues, and will not
      cause pulmonary atelectasis. In some early standards, all the quasi-circular shadows within
      6cm found in lung are categorized as lung nodules. However, according to current standards,
      the lesion within 3cm can be identified as lung nodules. With widespread use of lung cancer
      CT screening, lung nodules were identified more and more frequently.

      What is the optimal way to manage this CT finding? Should we adopt surgical removal or just
      observation? An optimal solution is to determine a clearly defined standard of care that is
      easy to learn. We propose a method called "three plus two". The 'Three' is a three-step
      testing method, and the 'Two' means two alternative solutions. Three-step testing method
      includes collecting medical history, non-invasive examination, and invasive examination. The
      two alternative solutions are surgical removal and follow-up observation. We have
      independently developed an application based on a smartphone platform. This platform will
      provide a novel evidence-based research method for observing the dynamic evolution of the
      lung nodules in patients. There have been no prior studies about managing this CT scan
      finding, either in China or internationally.
