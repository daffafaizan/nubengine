      vestibular nerve) versus a sham or placebo device. The effect of the device will be evaluated
      in a study that uses normal sleepers and advances them(puts them to bed 5-hours earlier than
      normal) to see if they fall asleep faster in one group or the other. Stimulation in the
      treated or sham group is only for the first hour after lights off.
