    
      Worldwide, up to 600 patients are estimated to die annually as a result of the complications
      that occur during tracheal intubation The GlideScope® (videolaryngoscope) is used for
      endotracheal intubation in patients with difficult airway predictors, in this patients
      overall success intubation rate is 96%. but success intubation rate at first attempt is only
      86%.

      Despite this positive rates, due to high comorbidity when intubation fails, both failure
      rates (inverse of success rate) are impermissible. 14% failure at the first attempt
      intubation as well as 4% overall intubation failure.

      in this study the investigators try to show that new procedure associating aScope®
      (disposable fiberscope) together with GlideScope® increases the success intubation rate of
      both ( overall and first attempt).
