      cancer, pulmonary diseases, autoimmune diseases, premature birth, and certain birth defects.
      Health benefits of smoking cessation start very fast after the last smoke. However, smoking
      cessation has significant side effects including weight gain. Several theories have been
      proposed to explain weight gain after smoking cessation.

      Microbiome research is an upcoming, extensively followed research field that has found
      unsuspected connections between human health and gut occupants. Many recent studies
      established important roles for the gut microbiome in regulating obesity, and metabolic
      diseases.

      The general aim of this study is to investigate the effect of smoking and smoking cessation
      on the intestinal microbial composition and function.

      This study follows 200 healthy participants who will be recruited according to their
      affiliation to one of three groups:

      Group 1: Non-smokers for at least 10 years Group 2: Cigarette smokers that do not plan to
      quit. Group 3: Cigarette smokers who plan to quit smoking. Participants who are planning to
      quit cigarette smoking will be offered to join a program for smoking cessation. The study
      will start 8 days before cessation group volunteers will stop smoking and will continue for
      one year after. Participants of all groups will be followed-up for one year.

      During the study, the participants will collect stool and oral samples which will be used for
      microbiota profiling. At every meeting anthropometric measurements, blood samples will be
      taken, and body composition performed. Participants will be connected to a continuous glucose
      monitor and will be asked to log a food diary using a designated mobile phone application.
