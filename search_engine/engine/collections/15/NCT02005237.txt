      date, there are no available treatments to improve cognition in this patient population. Some
      evidence from animal studies and small clinical trials suggest that aerobic exercise might
      beneficially affect cognitive function in MS.

      Aims: This study aims to explore the potential of an aerobic exercise program on brain
      structure and function in MS in a single-blind, randomized controlled phase IIa trial. We
      hypothesize that exercise will improve verbal learning and memory (primary endpoint) as well
      as induce changes in neuroimaging markers of structural and functional central nervous system
      (CNS) connectivity (secondary endpoints). Tertiary outcomes will include walking ability,
      motor function and coordination, as well as patient-based outcomes (depression, fatigue, and
      health-related quality of life).

      Design: This is a single-blind, randomized, controlled phase IIa trial with a parallel group
      design comparing 3 months of standardized aerobic exercise training (bicycle ergometry) to a
      waitlist control group (superiority framework). The allocation ratio of exercise to waitlist
      control is 1:1 with a sample size of n=60.
