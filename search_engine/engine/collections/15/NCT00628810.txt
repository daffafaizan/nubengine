    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the objective response (RECIST criteria) at 6 months associated with FOLFIRI
           and bevacizumab therapy.

        -  Evaluate the tolerability (NCI CTC v. 2.0 criteria) of this treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life (EuroQOL EQ5D questionnaire).

        -  Explore the prognostic factors associated with the tolerability and efficacy of this
           treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to genotype
      (UCT1A1*1/ UCT1A1*1 vs UCT1A1*1/ UCT1A1*28).

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
      minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 4 courses, and then every 2 months after the
      completion of study therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2-3 months.
