      cervical cancer. Due to the nature of their work, female sex workers (FSW) are at a
      particular high risk of HPV infection and developing cervical cancer. These groups are also
      likely to be reservoirs for HPV transmission since they are less likely to clear the
      infection and are known to be infected with multiple HPV types simultaneously. Benefits in
      vaccinating HPV-infected individuals, includes protecting them against HPV vaccine types that
      the person is not currently infected with as well as re-infection with the same HPV type.
      Therefore, immunising FSW with HPV vaccine is a novel strategy to reduce their risk of
      cervical cancer as well as downstream effects on HPV transmission. FSW is common in low-and
      middle-income countries (LMICs) of Asia (i.e. Vietnam), but the use of HPV vaccine in LMICs
      is very low often due to high costs and logistical difficulties in vaccine delivery.
      Furthermore, available data on the immunogenicity of HPV vaccine in FSW are limited. The aim
      of this study is to determine the immunogenicity of HPV vaccine in FSW and compare their
      antibody responses among young women (non-FSW) of the same age group by comparison with
      published data.
