      control-TENS group where the TENS machine will be set at the lowest sensory threshold and an
      intervention-TENS group where the TENS machine will be set at a recognised analgesic level
      (>50 Hertz (Hz) and below the pain threshold for the patient) (Bennett et al. 2011). The
      identity of the TENS type will be concealed from both the patient and the doctor performing
      the biopsy. The primary outcome will be pain and this will be recorded by the patient
      immediately after the procedure using a validated numerical scale (0-10). All patients will
      receive standard pain relief (ie. local anaesthetic with or without inhaled nitrous oxide).

      The benefit of this study is to establish whether or not TENS can benefit patients as an
      additional, safe, non-invasive and inexpensive method of pain relief during this frequently
      painful procedure.
