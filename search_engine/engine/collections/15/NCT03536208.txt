      tumorigenesis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Warfarin is a readily available drug in
      the clinical setting and could be easily, safely, and quickly used in patients in combination
      with known cytotoxic chemotherapies to improve overall survival.

      Oral warfarin has been well tolerated in both prophylaxis for catheter-associated thrombosis
      and in advanced pancreatic cancer patients.

      The aim of this trial is to confirm the preclinical evidence that warfarin affects AXL
      pathway in patients with pancreatic cancer. This will validate the effect of escalating doses
      of warfarin on circulating biomarkers of AXL.
