      moderate/severe psoriasis has failed to respond to anti-TNFα therapy, whether a single
      anti-TNFα therapy failure or multiple anti-TNFα therapy failures.

      Numerous double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel-group, active and placebo
      controlled studies have already been designed and run for the Phase III secukinumab clinical
      development program, in accordance with Health Authorities guidelines and feedback, including
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). None of these
      specifically studied patients who have failed to respond to anti-TNFα therapy as defined by
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

      Therefore, this study utilises a pragmatic, open-label, non-comparator design, which has been
      shown to be appropriate in similar studies looking at anti-TNFα therapy in patients failing
      on other therapies (Papp et al. 2012; Strober et al. 2011), to answer the question of whether
      secukinumab is an appropriate choice in patients who have failed to respond to anti-TNFα
      therapy (TNF-IR) per NICE definitions, whether a single anti-TNFα therapy failure or multiple
      anti-TNFα therapy failures.
