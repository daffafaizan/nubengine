      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate and response duration in older patients with progressive
           hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with docetaxel and erlotinib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Initial combination therapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral
           erlotinib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 9 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding
           disease receive 3 additional courses beyond maximal response.

        -  Extension phase: After 9 courses of initial combination therapy, patients achieving a
           complete response, partial response, or stable disease receive 8 courses of erlotinib
           alone (total of 17 courses of study treatment).

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 1 of each course, and at the end of study
      treatment. For patients in the extension phase, quality of life is also assessed on day 1 of
      courses 10, 12, 14, and 16.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
