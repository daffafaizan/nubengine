      initial control of acute variceal bleeding, patients still carry a high risk of rebleeding.
      Of those do rebleed, there is a 20%-35% mortality (1). Therefore, preventive procedures are
      required in patients surviving an episode of acute variceal bleeding. In recent years,
      endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as
      the endoscopic treatment of choice in the management of bleeding esophageal varices (2-3). On
      the other hand, nonselective beta blockers have been well documented to be effective in
      reducing variceal rebleeding (4-5). The addition of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN) has been
      shown to be even more effective than propranolol alone in the reduction of portal pressure
      and in the prevention of variceal rebleeding (6). Some studies showed that the combination of
      nadolol and ISMN is more effective than EIS or EVL in the reduction of variceal rebleeding
      (7-8). It is still unknown whether EVL combined with nadolol and ISMN is superior to nadolol
      and ISMN in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. This study was undertaken to compare the
      effectiveness and complications of ligation plus nadolol and isosorbide mononitrate vs.
      nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate for the prevention of variceal rebleeding.
