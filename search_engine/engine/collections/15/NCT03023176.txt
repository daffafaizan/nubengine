      broadly and deeply across different age groups and with different vaccine modalities and to
      probe the influence of genetics on these responses using monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The
      investigators plan to compare various immunological responses, identify age-specific
      biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of influenza-specific T-cells pre-
      and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of T-cell repertoire to an
      influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to what degree this is
      genetically determined.

      The study will be conducted in healthy young identical and fraternal 1-8 year-old twins. All
      participants will be immunized with seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3).
      Blood samples to conduct the assays described will be taken at pre-immunization, Days 6-8 and
      28 post-immunization for children requiring 1 dose of vaccine. For children requiring 2 doses
      of vaccine, a second immunization will be given at least 28 days after Dose 1 with responses
      measured on Day 6-8 and Day 28-32 post-second immunization.

      Children 35 months and under will receive Fluzone® standard IIV3 Pediatric Dose, while
      children 36 months and older will receive Fluzone® standard IIV3.
