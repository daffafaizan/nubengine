      (control group),first basal, and then at the same time of using CPAP with a nasal mask, at
      progressive pressures (from 4 to 10 cmH20 in snorers, and until 2 pressures above the
      polysomnography determined pressure in apneics). The wave tube of pharyngometer is connected
      to the patientÂ´s mouth by a mouthpiece, and to the computer. It makes a graphic of area x
      distance for each measurement. Then the investigators compare the changes in area, distance
      and volume of oral cavity and pharynx, determined by CPAP pressures, in both groups, and
      compare the measurements inside each group and between the two groups. Finally, the
      investigators analyse the CPAP pressure that most modifies the AP graphic, observing if it
      has some relationship with the polysomnography determined CPAP pressure.

      The investigators intend this way to show the kind of modifies determined by CPAP in oral
      cavity and oropharynx and, secondarily, observe some relationship of AP and polysomnography
      in determine the CPAP ideal pressure for severe apneic patients.
