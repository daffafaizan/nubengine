    
      Plants from the genus Artemisia, and specifically Artemisia dracunculus L. (Russian tarragon)
      have had a long history of medicinal (health) and culinary (food) use and have been reported
      as effective as a traditional treatments for diabetes in various parts of the world. The
      overall objective of this study is to conduct early human investigation and to evaluate the
      effect of nutritional supplementation with a well characterized extract of Artemisia
      dracunculus L. The primary objectives would be to evaluate safety, tolerability and effective
      dose in non-diabetic human subjects. Secondary objectives would assess metabolism of the
      extract and evaluate effects on proposed mechanisms such as insulin secretion, lipid levels
      and/or insulin resistance.

      Single Oral Dose Evaluation

      After completing a screening visit and meeting qualifications for the single oral dose
      evaluation, subjects will receive three single doses (two different doses of the supplement
      and one dose of placebo) on three separate test periods which are separated by a washout
      period of at least 7 days. Each testing period requires an overnight stay on the inpatient
      unit. The inpatient stay will be approximately 26 hours. The doses that will be used in the
      study are 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20 and 30 grams plus the placebo. The supplement and the placebo
      will be mixed with sugar-free flavoring in water. There will be an opportunity to sample the
      liquid drink during the screening visit.

           IV line, and then the subject will drink a sugar solution consisting of 75 grams of
           glucose. Blood will be drawn at specific times after the drink is consumed. Each blood
           sample will be about 1 tablespoon. (6 tablespoons total for the test). During the IV
