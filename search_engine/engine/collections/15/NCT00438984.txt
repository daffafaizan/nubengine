      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients
      receiving autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T cell clones following cyclophosphamide
      conditioning and post-infusion IL-2.

      II. To assess the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cell
      clones.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptively transferred CD8+ antigenspecific cytotoxic t
      lymphocytes (CTL) clones following cyclophosphamide conditioning and post-infusion IL-2.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are assigned 1of 2 treatment cohorts.

      All patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2 and
      autologous antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte clones IV over 30-60 minutes on day
      0.

      COHORT I: Beginning within 6 hours of T cell infusion, patients receive low-dose aldesleukin
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 0-14.

      COHORT II: Beginning within 6 hours of T cell infusion, patients receive high-dose
      aldesleukin IV 3 times daily on days 0-5.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and every
      3 months thereafter for up to 1 year.
