      malleolus Our research will cover this gap of knowledge ,so our research question will be
      what is the normal variation of vertical distance between medial and lateral malleolus
      Fractures of ankle are common injuries,approximately 2% of the general population will
      sustain an ankle fracture during their life time .many can be successfully treated non
      operatively However,for those injuries that require surgical intervention ,restoration of the
      anatomy is the main principle The importance of anatomic restoration of the fibula ,specially
      in preserving normal length has been appreciated by several authors Data will be obtained
      from measuring the vertical distance between lateral and medial malleolus in AP view of ankle
      in traumatic non ankle fractured people in standing and non standing position
