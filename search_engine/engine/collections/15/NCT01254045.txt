      mutation) will participate in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. They
      will receive a dose of either 24 IU oxytocin, 48 IU oxytocin or placebo at each of three
      visits to the lab, with each visit spaced one week apart. The efficacy of each dose will be
      evaluated using behavioral, cognitive and physiological metrics. If individual subject
      results suggest that either of the oxytocin dosage levels (24 IU or 48 IU) is superior to
      placebo in the double-blind phase, a single-blind trial using the optimal dosage of oxytocin
      will then be administered daily for 14 days by parents at home. Subjects will then come into
      the lab for a final assessment on Day 30. Determination of beneficial response to oxytocin
      will be based on a 20% change (improvement) in behavior or test performance (see below). If
      both oxytocin dosage levels provide similar benefits compared to placebo, the lower dose will
      be chosen for the 14 day single-blind trial.
