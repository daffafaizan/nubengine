      than in the general population, and may participate to the increased cardiovascular mortality
      observed in this group of patients. Despite a significant increase in knowledge about the
      harmful effects of obstructive sleep apnea, the pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly
      understood. Recent observations suggest a causative relationship between overnight fluid
      displacement from the legs to the neck soft and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. This
      mechanism was demonstrated in otherwise healthy subjects, in heart failure patients, and in
      patients with venous insufficiency. We thus suspect that this pathophysiologic mechanism
      could explain the increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with fluid
      overload, including chronic renal failure.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of renal transplantation on fluid
      overload and its consequence on the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, in patients with end
      stage chronic kidney disease. It aims further to investigate the relationship between
      overhydration, nocturnal rostral fluid shift and the severity of sleep apnea.

      The severity of obstructive sleep apnea is measured by two attended polysomnographies, a
      baseline PSG performed before and a follow-up PSG performed 6 month after renal
      transplantation. Overhydration and leg fluid are evaluated by bioimpedance, performed at the
      beginning and at the end of each polysomnography. Patients who are not already transplanted 6
      months after the baseline PSG will be re-assessed and will be analyzed as control group.
