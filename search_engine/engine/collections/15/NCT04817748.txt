      in addition to the early understanding of plaque rupture, plaque erosion and other
      mechanisms, studies have found that inflammation, immunity, metabolism and other factors also
      play an increasingly important role in the occurrence and development of myocardial
      infarction. The LoDoCo2 study published at the 2020 ESC annual meeting and the COLCOT study
      previously published confirmed for the first time the therapeutic effect of anti-inflammatory
      drug colchicine in chronic coronary disease and acute myocardial infarction. At the same
      time, the fourth international definition of myocardial infarction also defines three
      different types of acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), acute non ST
      segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and non infarct acute myocardial infarction
      (MINOCA). However, there are no clear research results on the mechanism, especially the
      mechanism of MINOCA. Therefore, the study of acute myocardial infarction in three groups is
      of great significance.
