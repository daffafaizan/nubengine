      multidirectional differentiation potential. studies revealed that local or systemic
      administration of mesenchymal stem cell-derivrd exosomes (MSC-Exo) efficiently suppressed
      detrimental immune response in inflamed tissues and promoted survival and regeneration of
      injured parenchymal cells. European Union countries have written MSCs into treatment
      guidelines for refractory graft-versus-host disease.

      In China, the technology for isolation, in vitro culture and expansion of MSCs is already
      mature. With further research on the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-Exo and the development of
      clinical trials, it is expected to become a treatment for severe illness.

      A predictable infection plan is going to be widely used in clinics to provide individualized
      treatment for patients, improve the prognosis of patients and improve the quality of life.

      The investigators intend to enroll all children who were hospitalized in pediatric intensive
      care unit PICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2022 to December 2023.
      Children with a PICU length of day less than 48h will be excluded.
