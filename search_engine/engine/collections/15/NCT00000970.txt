      there may be 6000 to 10000 patients with CMV retinitis. Many clinical reports suggest that
      both ganciclovir (DHPG) and foscarnet have an antiviral effect against CMV that is often
      associated with clinical stabilization. Effectiveness of ganciclovir and foscarnet is
      correlated with weekly maintenance and since toxicity is dose-limiting in up to 20 percent of
      patients receiving either drug for long periods, it may be beneficial in long-term
      maintenance treatment to combine or alternate these two drugs at a lower total weekly dose of
      each drug.

      This strategy may result in a greater net antiviral effect with less toxicity than is seen
      with either drug alone, because the toxicities of each drug are quite different.

      All patients have newly diagnosed CMV retinitis and have completed a 14-day course of
      intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet induction therapy within 1 week prior to study entry.
      The maintenance period consists of a 12-week study period followed by a 40 week follow-up
      period. Treatment consists of either combined sequential daily maintenance therapy of both
      foscarnet and ganciclovir or alternating daily treatment with ganciclovir one day and
      foscarnet the following day.
