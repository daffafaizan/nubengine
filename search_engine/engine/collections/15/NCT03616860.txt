    
      This is a prospective, single center, single-arm study to establish the safety, feasibility,
      and effectiveness of BBB disruption along the periphery of the tumor resection cavity using
      the ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2 (220 kHz) system and DEFINITY ultrasound contrast in
      patients with GBM. Adult patients with a first time diagnosis of GBM, whom have undergone
      maximal safe surgical resection and have safely completed the initial phase of concurrent
      chemo-radiation therapy, will be recruited for this study. Twenty patients will undergo up to
      6 treatments with FUS coincident with their standard TMZ cycles.
