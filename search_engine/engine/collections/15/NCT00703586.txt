    
      -  DURATION: Subjects will participate for a minimum of 28 weeks.

        -  SAMPLE SIZE: 18 subjects randomized 2:1 continued ARVs plus maraviroc versus continued
           ARVs plus additional ARV to be determined based on baseline ARV regimen.

        -  REGIMEN: At entry, subjects will be randomized to one of the following in a 2:1 ratio:

      ARM A:

      Intensification with maraviroc for 24 weeks at one of the following doses:

        -  150 mg orally BID when coadministered with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor

        -  600 mg orally BID when coadministered with efavirenz or nevirapine

      ARM B

      Intensification with an additional NRTI for 12 weeks then cross over to maraviroc
      intensification for an additional 12 weeks as above:

        -  Addition of abacavir 600 mg orally once daily to a tenofovir containing regimen for 12
           weeks then replacing the abacavir with maraviroc

        -  Addition of an alternate FDA approved NRTI [such as zidovudine (AZT) or didanosine
           (ddi)] at standard oral dosing to a tenofovir containing regimen for 12 weeks (if the
           participant declines abacavir therapy) then replacing the alternate NRTI with maraviroc.

      The objectives of this study are:

      To determine whether intensification of current ARV regimens with maraviroc will result in
      more complete suppression of viral replication and improved immune reconstitution in GI
      mucosal lymphoid compartment based on:

        -  Reduction in normalized levels of CD4+MMC HIV-1 RNA as determined by PCR pre- and post-
           intensification at week 12 in Arm A versus Arm B.

        -  Reduction in normalized levels of CD4+ mucosal mononuclear cell (MMC) HIV-1 RNA at week
           12 compared to baseline in Arm A.

        -  Reduction in %CD4+MMC HIV-1 RNA positive as determined by PCR pre- and post-
           intensification between Arm A and Arm B as well as week 12 and 24 post maraviroc
           intensification.

        -  Levels of CD4+ T cells in GALT (% by flow and absolute #s by immunohistochemistry).

        -  Phenotype of cells in GALT by flow (memory, naive, R5, X4, dual expressing).

        -  Levels of activation of CD4 and CD8 in PB and GALT using HLA DR and CD 38.
