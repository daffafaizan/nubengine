      All were normotensive, had a normal lipid profile, normal renal and liver function tests, and
      were not on any medications. All subjects gave their written, informed consent. Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA) approved the
      study protocol. The 36 participants were randomly assigned by the primary investigator (PI)
      following simple randomization procedure (computerized random numbers) to three different
      groups, each received one type of macronutrient (Glucose, whey proteins or lipids). Following
      an overnight fast, a baseline blood sample was taken. Subjects were then given either 300
      calories of glucose (NERL Trutol 75) or lipids (90 grams whipping cream, 31.5 grams fat, 1.7
      grams protein and 2.25 grams carbohydrate) or protein (Isopure unflavored Whey proteins
      isolate (WPI) powder containing 26 grams per serving of 100% WPI, stripped of fat, carbs,
      fillers, sugars and lactose) solution over 5 minutes. Cream and protein preparations were
      diluted with water up to 300 mL solutions. Further blood samples were obtained at 1, 2 and 3
      hours after the macronutrient intake. Subjects, either one week before or after the
      macronutrient challenge, were given 300 mL of water to drink in the fasting state. Blood
      samples were obtained before and at 1, 2 and 3 h after water intake as well. Each subject
      served as his/her own control and was randomly given macronutrient or water intake.
