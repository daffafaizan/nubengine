      I.V. once a day for 28 days and to identify the maximum tolerated dose.

      All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study
      enrollment.

      Treatment will start with 1.7mg/kg with dose escalation by 0.5 mg/kg every 3-4 days and will
      increase to the maximum dose of 3.2mg/kg. Day 1 to Day 28 patients will be on active
      treatment.

      After completion of 28 treatment days, participants who will choose to continue treatment (at
      the investigator's discretion), will be enrolled in a follow-up study. Participants that
      discontinue treatment after Day 28 will be followed up by a nurse phone call and return to
      the clinic for a final visit on Day 56 from the first dose.
