      cardiovascular disease as the general population. Both traditional and non-traditional
      cardiovascular risk factors are thought to be important. Of the non-tradtional cardiovascular
      risk factors, creation of an arteriovenous fistula or graft for the purposes of a blood
      access for hemodialysis may contribute to an elevation in BNP and left ventricular
      hypertrophy - both factors that have been associated with an increased risk of mortality
      Prior to access creation and at one month and one year post access creation - samples for BNP
      will be collected Prior to access creation and at one year post access creation -
      echocardiography will be performed
