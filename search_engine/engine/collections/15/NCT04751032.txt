      is any adverse outcome when discharged from the hospital will be recorded. Daily energy,
      protein and fiber are 75% of the target amount as the standard for feeding.The diet, exercise
      status and adverse outcomes of participants within 90 days after hospitalization will be
      followed up through outpatient, telephone or remote consultation.Primary endpoint-the impact
      of nutritional therapy (energy, protein, dietary fiber compliance or failure) on mortality,
      new infections, falls and readmissions in elderly hospitalized patients within 90 days after
