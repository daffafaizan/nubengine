      limit myocardial damage is to perform an early coronary reperfusion. However, despite
      reperfusion, the size of infarctions is many times large. Infarct size has been recently
      shown to be a strong predictor of future cardiovascular events and mortality. Therefore
      interventions aimed at reducing infarct size are the matter of intense research; but despite
      great efforts, no therapy has been shown to consistently limit infarct size.

      ß-blockers are a class of drugs that have been used to treat cardiovascular conditions for
      several decades. β-blockers reduce mortality when administered after an AMI, and are a class
      IA indication in this context. What remains unclear is what timing and route of β-blocker
      administration gives the maximum cardioprotective effect. In particular, whether early
      β-blocker administration is able to reduce infarct size is a subject of debate. Recent
      experimental data suggest that the β1 selective blocker metoprolol is able to limit the area
      of necrosis only when administered before reperfusion.

      The objective of this trial is to determine whether the administration of intravenous
      pre-reperfusion metoprolol might reduce infarct size.
