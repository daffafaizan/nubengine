      gastric cancer. The extent of lymphadenectomy, however, is controversial. The two European
      randomized trials only reported an increase in operative morbidity and mortality, but failed
      to show survival benefit, in the D2 lymphadenectomy group. We conducted a randomized
      controlled trial to compare the Japanese standard D2 and D2 + para-aortic nodal dissection.
