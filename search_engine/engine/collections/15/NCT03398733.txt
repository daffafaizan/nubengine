    
      Between December 1, 2017 and June 30 2019, 200 patients with chronic heart failure caused by
      rheumatic valvular heart disease waiting for heart valve replacement in Department of
      Cardiovascular Surgery were screened for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by full-night
      polysomnography (PSG). Of them, 30 OSA patients were enrolled and randomly received CPAP
      treatment and non-CPAP treatment (15:15).

      The CPAP treatment group received both baseline and CPAP treatment. The full-night CPAP
      treatment was conducted from 21:00 pm to 6:00 am for 7 days preoperatively. The non-CPAP
      treatment group received baseline treatment.

      Preoperative Sleep parameters (AHI, mean and lowest SPO2) and clinical evaluations including
      NYHA class, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, arterial blood gas analysis findings,
      baseline medication, and 6-minute walk test were recorded.

      Operation related parameters such as duration of operation, duration of cardiopulmonary
      bypass and bleeding volume were recorded.

      Postoperative adverse events such as duration of ICU stay, postoperative duration of
      mechanical ventilation, pacemaker use, complicated infection and reintubation are recorded.

      A PSG was re-examined before discharge from hospital. The changes of AHI, mean and lowest
      SPO2 between pre- and post-operative PSG parameters were calculated.

      The operation related parameters, postoperative adverse events and the changes of sleep
      parameters were compared between CPAP and non-CPAP patients.
