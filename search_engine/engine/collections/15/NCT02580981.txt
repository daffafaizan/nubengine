      major insights into the biologic and clinical features and the genomic landscape of Ph-like
      ALL, which is strikingly heterogeneous. Gene expression profiling and RNA/transcriptomic,
      exome, and whole genome sequencing have identified several distinct subclasses of kinase
      activating lesions in 91% of the Ph-like ALL cases studied to date, most commonly kinase and
      cytokine receptor gene rearrangements and fusions. UNMCCC investigators are now collaborating
      with Children's Oncology Group (COG) and the adult National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Cooperative Groups (Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) - American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), The Alliance) to develop
      national clinical trials for pediatric, adolescent and young adult (AYA), and adult ALL
      patients that incorporate their genomic diagnostic screens, molecular diagnostics, and next
      generation sequencing studies to identify underlying genomic lesions in ALL and target
      patients to appropriate therapeutic regimens.

      In this feasibility study, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies will inform an acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia risk classification system, which may be adapted to identify patients
      who might benefit from targeted therapies; such patients will be targeted to NCTN National
      Treatment trials or UNMCCC-sponsored trials where appropriate, through detailed genomic data
      analysis performed under College of American Pathologists (CAP)/CLIA conditions and in
      individual case discussions in a Molecular Tumor Board.

      In addition, the association of race and ethnicity with the spectrum of ALL-associated
      genomic mutations in the New Mexico and regional ALL population, which includes a significant
      proportion of underrepresented minorities, will be studied. This may ultimately allow for the
      development of an ancestry-based risk classification system.
