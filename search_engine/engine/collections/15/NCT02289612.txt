      fibres that lead to different postprandial glycemic and satiety responses in individuals at
      risk for type 2 diabetes. This is accomplished by utilizing a variety of dietary fibres that
      demonstrate a wide range of properties in a pudding product, and by examining the ability of
      each of these to limit gastric emptying, limit glucose absorption, limit insulin secretion,
      and improve satiety, versus a low fibre control product. To accomplish this, a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo controlled, crossover study design will be used, in order to
      determine the different effects of a variety of fibre-enriched pudding products on markers of
      type 2 diabetes and satiety response, versus low-fibre control puddings.
