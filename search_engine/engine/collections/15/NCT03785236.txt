      islet survival after transplantation. This could lead to better patient outcomes which would
      be of great interest for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. In order to assess the possibility
      of visualizing transplanted islet grafts with Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET, a proof-of -concept
      study is performed in 10 patients with type 1 diabetes who have undergone intrahepatic islet
      transplantation with biochemically proven functional islet grafts and 5 patients with type 1
      diabetes who are on the waiting list for islet transplantation. The investigators propose to
      determine the uptake of the radiolabeled tracer and compare it to functionality of the islet
      grafts. These highly relevant data will provide us with more information on the suitability
      of GLP-1 receptor imaging for monitoring of transplanted islet mass.
