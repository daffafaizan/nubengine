      undergoing a revolutionary transformation. Emerging data show that mitochondria form a
      dynamic networked reticulum that is regulated by cycles of fission and fusion. The discovery
      of a number of proteins that regulate these activities has led to important advances in
      understanding human disease. Data show that activation of dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1), a
      protein that controls mitochondrial fission, is reduced following exercise in prediabetes,
      and the decrease is linked to increased insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation. The proposed
      research will test the hypothesis that mitochondrial dynamics is a key mechanism of insulin
      resistance in type 2 diabetes. Translational first-in-man studies will use an acute lipid
      challenge to investigate the physiological significance of altered skeletal muscle
      mitochondrial dynamics on insulin sensitivity in humans. The experimental approach harnesses
      innovative molecular and cellular tools, interfaced with physiologically significant human
      studies to obtain meaningful data on insulin resistance, and has the potential to generate
      insights that will lead to new diabetes therapies for future generations.
