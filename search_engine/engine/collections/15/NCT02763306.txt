      agree to have small areas of their middle and lower abdomen exposed to cooling with the
      Dermal Cooling System within 180 days before the planned surgery. Exposure of multiple test
      sites will be completed in areas of skin that will be excised as part of the abdominoplasty
      procedure. Clinical assessments of the treatment sites at 1-week post-treatment and at
      1-month post-treatment intervals throughout the time period prior to surgical excision, and
      histologic evaluation of the treated skin will be conducted to assess skin changes.
