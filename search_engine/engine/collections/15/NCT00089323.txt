      Primary

        -  Determine the relative risk of death associated with the presence of tumor cells in the
           bone marrow of patients with stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer undergoing surgery and
           bone marrow analysis using multicolor fluorescence immunocytochemistry and bright field
           immunocytochemistry.

      Secondary

        -  Compare multicolor fluorescence immunocytochemistry vs bright field immunocytochemistry
           in the detection of bone marrow micrometastases in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration during surgical resection of the primary tumor. Bone
      marrow cells and tumor samples are analyzed using bright field immunocytochemistry and
      multicolor fluorescence immunocytochemistry.

      Patients are followed every 12 months for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,634 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
