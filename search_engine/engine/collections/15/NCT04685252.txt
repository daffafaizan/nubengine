      modulation of perinatal mood and stress, even less so for probiotics. The probiotic strain
      Bifidobacterium longum (BL) NCC3001 has previously been shown to normalize anxiety-like
      behavior in preclinical models and to reduce feelings of low mood and emotional reaction to
      fearful stimulus in human adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The strain is also
      considered safe and has previously been administered to pregnant and lactating women as well
      as infants. Therefore, the study aims to evaluate the effect of probiotic (BL) NCC3001 on
      mood and stress levels during the perinatal period.
