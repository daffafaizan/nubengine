      selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist affects the likelihood of male patients developing
      post-operative urinary retention following hernia repair surgery. It is also of interest to
      determine whether or not a well-known urological screening tool, the IPSS, can identify
      patients at risk for urinary retention following elective laparoscopic or open hernia repair
      surgery. We will investigate if it is possible to pre-treat patients with a selective
      alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist which we think can reduce the incidence of post-operative
      urinary retention and the associated adverse consequences, especially in those patients at
      higher risk.
