      life (QOL) in people with type 1 or 2 diabetes delivering mealtime insulin using a novel
      insulin bolus-patch (Finesseâ„¢; Calibra Medical, Inc., Redwood City, CA) versus current
      devices that deliver bolus insulin (pen/syringe). All subjects injected their basal insulin
      using their current pen/syringe.
