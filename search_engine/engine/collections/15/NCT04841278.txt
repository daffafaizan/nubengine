      obstruction, rejection, infection and ischemia. Battery of tests, and at times empiric
      therapy, is necessary to obtain final diagnosis. This results in waste of time and medical
      resources that can lead to delay in care, which may ultimately translate to increase
      morbidity and mortality, as well as increase in cost.

      In this protocol, the investigators propose utilization of interventional endoscopy for the
      diagnosis and treatment of liver graft dysfunction. Use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with
      possible liver biopsy and cholangiography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      in one session may facilitate diagnosis and treatment. All patients enrolled in this protocol
      will undergo the same procedural protocol. The quality of care metrics in these patients
      (such as length of stay, cost, mortality, etc), will be compared to that of historical
      controls.
