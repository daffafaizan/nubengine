      treatment field sizes and associated radiation doses on the patient's microbiome and
      metabolome, whereby the link with radiation-induced GI toxicities will be emphasized. Blood,
      urine and fecal samples will be longitudinally collected at 4 different time points: (1)
      shortly before, (2) during and (3) shortly after RT treatment, as well as (4) one-month
      post-RT. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical research project relating the impact of
      multiple radiation parameters on fecal-, urine- and blood-based biomarkers to risk of GI
      toxicities in a homogeneously defined study population.
