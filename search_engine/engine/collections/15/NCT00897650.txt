        -  To determine protein and/or RNA expression patterns capable of predicting tumor response
           to therapy in tumor tissue samples from patients with lung cancer or suspected of having
           lung cancer.

        -  To characterize the genes and proteins found to be predictive of response in order to
           help elucidate the molecular biology underlying cancer chemosensitivity.

        -  To evaluate DNA mutations found within the lung cancer sample which may be predictive of
           response or resistance to certain therapeutic agents.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of tumor tissue by percutaneous fine needle aspiration,
      core biopsy, thoracentesis, or during any medically indicated procedure involving removal of
      lung cancer tissue. Tissue samples are analyzed by a variety of techniques, including DNA
      sequencing, RNA sequencing and expression levels, protein assessment [by
      immunohistochemistry, western blot, Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of
      flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS]). The goal of these studies is to identify of gene
      mutations, gene expression levels, and proteins predictive of treatment response. Blood
      samples are also collected to obtain normal DNA for analysis.

      After completion of study, patients will be followed until their death.
