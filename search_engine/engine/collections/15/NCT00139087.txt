      mothers or caregivers of HIV-exposed children with administering medication for the first 6
      weeks of life to prevent mother-to-child HIV infection in the infants. To be eligible,
      mothers of infants were identified as HIV-infected in the Mother-Infant Rapid Intervention at
      Delivery Study. Mothers or caregivers of infants were randomized into two groups: the
      intervention group received a cellular phone and scheduled twice daily calls to assure infant
      medications were given, and the other group received the current standard of care. Enrollment
      into the study was completed and analysis of the study data is underway.
