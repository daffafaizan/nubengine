      light during the day and dim light in the evening are beneficial for the circadian timing
      system. Nowadays, large parts of the population spend 90% of their time indoors and are
      thereby exposed to artificial lighting instead of daylight. The artificial light levels are
      relatively low during the day and continue relatively late in the evening. The lack of a
      clear natural light-dark cycle could results in delayed timing of the biological clock
      relative to the behaviour. Optimizing the lighting conditions under controlled laboratory
      settings might lead to better alignment of the biological clock, which in turn could improve
      metabolic parameters such as glucose control.
