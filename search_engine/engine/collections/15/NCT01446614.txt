      loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. A combination of genetic and
      environmental factors is likely to be important in producing abnormal protein aggregation
      within select groups of neurones, leading to cell dysfunction and then death. A large number
      of agents together with surgical interventions are now available to treat early and late
      complications of PD, but they are suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of
      efficacy with disease progression.

      Bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an differentiate under certain
      circumstances into cells from various neuronal and glial type lineages; they also exert
      immunomodulatory effects. PD-derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype,
      morphology, and multidifferentiation capacity. Moreover, PD-derived MSCs are capable of
      differentiating into neurons in a specific medium with up to 30% having the characteristics
      of dopamine cells. These findings indicate that MSCs derived from PD patients' bone marrow
      may be a promising cell type for cellular therapy.

      BM-MSCs cultured with a cocktail of growth factors (containing FGF and BDNF) differentiate
      into neuronal/glial lineage cells with a predominance of cells expressing astrocytes'
      markers. They were effective in suppression of chronic EAE in mice and induced
      neuroprotection, preserving most of the axons in the CNS of successfully-treated animals.
      Histopathological studies revealed that MSCs could efficiently migrate into the CNS inflamed
      tissue (both when administered intravenously and intraventricularly) and differentiated into
      cells expressing neural-glial lineage markers. Such an approach may provide a feasible and
      practical way for PD.
