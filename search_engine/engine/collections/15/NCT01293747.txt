      Main objective:

      To determine plasmatic profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of estradiol and progesterone
      on each of the formulations studied, after multiple-dose administration.

      Secondary objectives:

      To determine bioavailability of each of the formulations studied, after
      multiple-dose-administration. Describe tolerability of each of the formulations studied,
      after multiple-dose administration.

      Study design: Randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel, pharmacokinetic study

      Investigational Products:

        -  Estradiol and progesterone microspheres aqueous suspension (1 mg/20 mg)

        -  Estradiol and progesterone microspheres aqueous suspension (0.5 mg/15 mg)

      Study subjects: 30 postmenopausal women 45 - 65 years old

      Brief description: After written informed consent, 30 eligible women will be randomized to
      study treatments (one IM injection each 28 days, for a total of 4 doses). Blood samples will
      be obtained for pharmacokinetic study.
