      Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the University of Washington.

      Single doses of DMAU in castor oil/benzyl benzoate injections intramuscularly (IM) (80 mg,
      240 mg, 480 mg, and 800 mg) or administered subcutaneously (SC) (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg)
      were selected for this dose-escalating study. Twelve subjects will complete this study at
      each of the DMAU doses (10 on DMAU and 2 on placebo injections) yielding a total of 84
      completed subjects (70 on DMAU and 14 on placebo) across both sites. Safety will be assessed
      in all subjects and recovery will be assessed in two subjects receiving lower doses, either
      IM or SC, before additional men receive higher doses of IM or SC of DMAU. In addition to
      safety and tolerability, suppression of serum T, E2, gonadotropins, and SHBG will be assessed
      as secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. PK of DMAU and DMA will be assessed through
      blood draws done at each visit. Suppression of spermatogenesis will be assessed with semen
      analysis.

      DMAU injections will be administered at the study site by research nurses or physicians. For
      intramuscular injections, the staff will inject DMAU in castor oil into the gluteal region
      following standard procedures for intramuscular steroid injection. Abdominal subcutaneous
      injections will follow standard subcutaneous procedures. The subject will be observed for at
      least 30 minutes before release from the study site.
