    
      The primary objective is to assess the degree of agreement of FeNO measured with the NIOX
      VERO using the 6-sec and 10-sec modes.

      The secondary objectives of the Clinical Investigation are to:

        -  Assess the ability of participants to use the NIOX VERO for measuring FeNO in both
           exhalation modes, and

        -  Compare the repeatability of FeNO measured with the NIOX VERO in both exhalation modes.

      Participants will attempt 2 measurements taken using the 6-sec mode followed by 2
      measurements using the 10 second exhalation mode or vice versa.
