      phenomenon. OIH could also be shown for Remifentanil in an acute pain model. As CBD showed
      antihyperalgesic potential in the animal model, this brings up the question if CBD might be
      used to prevent or diminish OIH. Until today there are no studies investigating CBD as an
      adjunct to remifentanil or other opioids regarding the OIH. This is however of great clinical
      value because CBD with its possible antihyperalgesic effect on the OIH might be a worthful
      adjunct for opioid based anaesthesia and analgesia.

      Every participant will pass through two interventions with electrically induced pain (Koppert
      model). CBD will be applied orally at the beginning of the intervention. Pain, allodynia and
      hyperalgesia will be assessed and recorded every 10 min during the remifentanil infusion and
      afterwards.
