      pre-cancerous polyps, but some lesions can be missed, especially if they are located behind
      folds in the lining of the colon or behind flexures (sharp bends) in the colon.

      The Third Eye速 Retroscope速 is a device that can be inserted through the instrument channel of
      a standard colonoscope to provide an additional, retrograde (or backward) view that reveals
      areas behind folds and flexures in the colon. Previous studies have shown the device to be
      effective for detecting additional polyps that could not have been seen with the colonoscope
      alone.

      The purpose of this research is to compare the additional diagnostic yield obtained by using
      the Third Eye速 Retroscope速 vs. the diagnostic yield for the standard colonoscope alone in the
      context of a randomized, controlled study design.

      Patients who are scheduled for colonoscopy will be recruited to the study and randomized to
      one of two groups. Each patient will undergo two "back-to-back" procedures.

      Patients in Group A (study group) will undergo a standard colonoscopy followed immediately by
      a Third Eye colonoscopy.

      Patients in Group B (control group) will undergo a Third Eye colonoscopy followed immediately
      by a standard colonoscopy.

      Results from the two groups will be analyzed and compared to determine the effectiveness of
      the Third Eye Retroscope for detecting additional adenomas and other polyps compared with the
      standard colonoscope alone.
