    
      A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in 34 Systemic
      Sclerosis-Pulmonary Hypertension (SSc-PAH) patients. The study medication will be added to
      stable background PAH medication(s). Subjects will be dosed for 24 weeks, will undergo
      examination every 8 weeks, and will be finally evaluated 12 weeks after completion of
      treatment. Dosage will begin at once daily oral doses of 120mg for the first 7 days and
      follow the up-titration schedule to a maintenance dose of 240mg twice a day (or highest
      tolerated dose of a minimum of 120mg twice a day by the start of Week 8) for the remainder of
      the study. Participation will be for a total of 40 weeks, including a 4-week screening
      period, 24 weeks of drug, and a safety follow-up 12 weeks after the last dose. The study will
      determine the safety and the primary outcome variability for DMF in treating SSc-PAH; the
      primary outcome of clinical efficacy in this pilot trial will be improvement in 6-minute walk
      distance (6MWD).
