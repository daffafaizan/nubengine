      are rather complicated and clinically less useful. Blood viscosity is associated with
      hematocrit and inflammatory factors known to be related to the prognosis of acute
      pancreatitis, and our group's previous study which is not yet published showed that blood
      viscosity better predicts severe acute pancreatitis than other single factors such as
      C-reative protein. Therefore, this study aims to prospectively evaluate the usefulness of
      blood viscosity as a prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. During the study period, the
      study is conducted on patients with acute pancreatitis between the ages of 19 and 70, and
      patients with acute pancreatitis after ERCP are excluded. Blood viscosities at initial and 24
      hours after hospitalization, and serum phosphate, which have shown potential as a predictor
      of severity in post-ERCP pancreatitis in previous studies are measured. The association of
      these blood biomarkers with the severity of acute pancreatitis will be analyzed and compared
      with hematocrit, C-reactive protein, etc., which are known as a single prognostic predictor
      of acute pancreatitis.
