      monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of patients with MCL, the goal of this study is to
      investigate the possible therapeutic benefit of combining Ara-C with Bendamustine and
      Rituximab (R-BAC). All three agents exhibit individual and unique mechanisms of action in
      MCL, and a synergistic or additive effect might be expected when these agents are used in
      combination, as suggested by the pre-clinical studies.
