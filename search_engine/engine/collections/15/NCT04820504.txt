    
      Longitudinal, randomized control trial that examined the effectiveness of AIR among 270
      participants, with 1,080 recorded ventilation scenarios, and across 20 sites in Uganda and
      the U.S. Birth attendants - including a mix of midwives, nurses, respiratory therapists,
      pediatricians, and neonatologists - with recent HBB and/or NRP training were recruited to
      participate in this randomized control trial. Participants ventilated training mannequins for
      a fixed duration of time. Participants were randomized to receive visual feedback from AIR
      (intervention) or have the AIR feedback covered (control). They were then requested to
      administer effective ventilation and verbally assess the mannequin condition. All mannequins
      appeared to be identical, but each session's mannequin was randomly selected with an upper
      airway that was normal, partially leaking, or partially obstructed.
