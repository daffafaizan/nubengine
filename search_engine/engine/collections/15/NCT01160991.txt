      study ward at 10:00 p.m. prior to the study day and kept fasting until the next morning. At
      8:00 a.m. they receive their study medication (olanzapine, amisulpride or placebo).
      Subsequently, measurements of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion are performed by
      euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique followed by hyperglycemic clamp.
