    
      Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization is common in patients undergoing frequent
      platelet transfusion, and is the most important cause of immune platelet refractoriness.
      Management strategies in HLA alloimmune platelet-refractory patients include transfusion with
      HLA-matched or crossmatched platelets; however, in broadly-sensitized patients, or in
      patients with uncommon HLA types, antigen-negative or epitope compatible donors may be
      difficult to find.

      The Luminex immunoglobulin (Ig)G single-antigen-bead (SAB) solid phase immunoassay is now
      commonly used to detect HLA antibodies. However, an assay that specifically detects
      C1qbinding to HLA antibodies has been reported to identify a clinically relevant subset of
      HLA antibodies in solid organ transplantation; one group has studied the utility of this
      assay in platelet transfusion of HLA-alloimmunized platelet refractory patients. We intend to
      evaluate the ability of this C1-binding immunoassay to predict response to platelet
      transfusion in HLA alloimmune patients.
