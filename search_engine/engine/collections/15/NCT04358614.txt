    
      Baricitinib, an anti-Janus kinase inhibitor (anti-JAK) acting against JAK1 and JAK2 that
      inhibits JAK1- and JAK2-mediated cytokine release, was recently described using
      BenevolentAI's proprietary artificial intelligence-derived knowledge graph, as an agent that
      reduces the endocytosis into target cells, and to inhibit the entry. Based on its potential
      action on inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry, and on its known effects on reduction of cytokine
      release, baricitinib therapy was proposed in patients with moderate pneumonia to explore: the
      safety of this drug combined with antiviral (lopinavir-ritonavir) in COVID-19; as second
      outcome, to evaluate the impact of baricitinib in terms of clinical, laboratory, respiratory
      parameters, and reduction of ICU admission.

      Baricitinib was combined with antivirals because it does not interact with them due to its
      prevalent renal elimination.
