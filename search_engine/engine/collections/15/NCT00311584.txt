      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed neuroblastoma (NB)
           treated with irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide.

        -  Determine the toxicities associated with irinotecan and temozolomide in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the impact of p53 loss of function on response rate and event-free survival
           from start of relapse therapy.

        -  Collect data for ongoing analyses of UGT1A1 polymorphisms in these patients.

        -  Collect and bank serum and nucleic acid specimen to facilitate future biomarker studies.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of collecting blood samples on a group wide basis for
           assessment of changes in circulating markers of angiogenesis.

        -  Assess, preliminarily, the effects of irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide on
           circulating markers of angiogenesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to disease status (measurable disease [measured by
      conventional CT scan and/or MRI] vs evaluable disease [tumor detected by conventional
      morphologic analysis of bone marrow aspirate/biopsy AND/OR abnormal uptake at â‰¥ 1 site on
      MIBG scan]).

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12 and oral
      temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
