      possible to be performed due to anatomical reasons (altered anatomy after abdominal surgery)
      in patients with malignant extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, an alternative method is
      necessary for biliary drainage. In a recently published meta-analysis (Sharaiha,
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 2017), it is reported that percutaneous transhepatic biliary
      drainage (PTBD) is less clinical successful, causes more adverse events and needs more
      re-interventions than endoscopic ultrasound guided biliary drainage (EUBD) in patients with
      malignant, extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. The conclusion was, that EUBD should be
      prefered in this clinical setting in future.

      An improved technique of PTBD may provide better results for coming comparative studies.

      The investigators of this retrospective study therefore analyzed all PTBDs that were
      performed in a period of nine years in a tertiary referral hospital. In this cohort, the
      analysis focused on PTBDs with primary metal stent implantation by endoscopic luminal
      guidance considering technical and clinical success, access route, procedure time,
      fluoroscopic time, radiation exposure, adverse events and survival probability in an
      observation time of six months.
