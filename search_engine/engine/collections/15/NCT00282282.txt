    
      -  After the screening procedures confirm that the patient is eligible to participate in
           the research study, they will be admitted to the hospital to receive chemotherapy and
           stem cell transplantation (SCT). The duration of the hospitalization for the procedure
           is approximately 8 days.

        -  Patients will receive fludarabine once daily over 30 minutes intravenously for 4 days
           and busulfex once daily over 3 hours intravenously each day for the same 4 days.

        -  Just prior to the transplant and following the transplant the patient will receive
           sirolimus and tacrolimus to help prevent Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). Both
           medications are taken orally.

        -  Patients will also take medications to help prevent possible infections (e.g.
           acyclovir). Filgrastim, a white blood cell growth factor, will be given daily in an
           injection under the skin, starting the day after the stem cell transplant and until the
           patients blood counts have recovered.

        -  After the stem cell infusion, the patient will be examined and have blood tests weekly
           for 1 month. At about the 1-month visit, a bone marrow biopsy and/or blood tests will be
           performed to determine the percentage of donor's cells in the blood or bone marrow.
           These tests will be repeated at 3-4 months after transplant.

        -  At 3-4 months after the transplant, patients will also have tests to reassess the
           response of your disease to transplant. This may involve a bone marrow biopsy, blood
           tests, and/or radiology studies depending upon the type of cancer.

        -  Follow-up will continue for the remainder of the patients life.
