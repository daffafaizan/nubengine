      patients with BM with a median overall survival (OS) of 2-3 months when treated with systemic
      corticosteroid alone, and a median OS of 3-6 months when treated with whole brain radiation
      therapy (WBRT). Recently, several studies have reported the benefits of epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR mutation NSCLC patients
      with BM. The median OS of EGFR mutation patients with BM significantly improved with TKIs
      treatment, which ranged from 11.8 to 18.8 months. However, for the EGFR wide-type NSCLC
      patients with BM, the prognosis remains poor.

      It was found that the combination of anti-VEGF drugs and brain radiotherapy can not only
      reduce the volume of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE), reduce the intracranial pressure,
      relieve the symptoms of nerve compression, reduce the risk of brain hernia during brain
      radiotherapy, and but also inhibit the hypoxia of tumor cells, increase the radiosensitivity
      of tumor cells, and ultimately improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.

      Apatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mildly inhibits c-Kit and c-SRC, has been reported to show
      efficacy among some patients with malignant supratentorial gliomas.

      Therefore, the investigators initiated this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      concurrent radiotherapy with Apatinib in patients with Brain Metastases from drive gene
      wide-type Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
