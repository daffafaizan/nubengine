      unsafe intervals between teen births. The Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy (T.O.P.P.)
      program is an 18-month clinic-based program that aims to reduce repeat pregnancies among
      pregnant and parenting adolescents by providing telephone-based care coordination and mobile
      contraceptive services to this high-risk population. This study uses a randomized controlled
      design to compare the effectiveness of T.O.P.P. versus usual care provided to patients at
      participating clinics. Study participants will be adolescent mothers between the ages of 10
      to 19 recruited through seven OhioHealth women's health clinics and three OhioHealth
      hospitals covering seven counties in central Ohio. This study is being conducted as part of
      the national Evaluation of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Approaches funded by the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Adolescent Health.
