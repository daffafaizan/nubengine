    
      This is an open-label, randomized, 2-parallel-arm trial (n=94). All patients will receive (A)
      sham (n=47) or (B) active ESWT (n=47) twice/week for 6 weeks (12 sessions total).
      Concurrently, all patients will receive daily tadalafil 5mg for 24 weeks. Patients will then
      undergo a 4 week washout period without erectogenic aids, and return for a 28-week
      evaluation. Subsequently, patients requiring further erectogenic aids after 28 weeks will be
      offered intracavernosal injections (ICI) of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1).

      Random assignment will be performed by computer program (eg. randomizer.org), in a design
      that obtains equal sample size per group.

      All patients will be followed for a period of 24 months post-RP. Follow-up protocol includes
      evaluation of the IIEF, EHS, GAQ, ICI usage and tolerability, stretched flaccid penile
      length, urinary incontinence, and oncologic status.
