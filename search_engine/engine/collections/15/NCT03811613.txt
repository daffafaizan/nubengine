      [mean±SD] 72±7 years) or sham group (n=18, 70±8 years) during 9 weeks (2 sessions/week). The
      primary endpoint was the motor portion of the Movement Disorders Society-United PD Rating
      Scale. Secondary endpoints were the Scales for Outcomes in PD, static posturography, walking
      ability (ten-meter walk test [TMWT]) and functional mobility (timed up and go [TUG] test).
