      The study will be conducted at Dow University Hospital Karachi, Ojha Campusa. The subjects
      included were elective patients operated for abdominal hernias. Sample size calculated for a
      larger study with 50% frequency, and 99% confidence levels, using Openepi was found to be
      664. According to Connelly*, the sample size of pilot study should be 10% of the sample size
      of a larger pilot study. As it is a pilot study, the sample size for this study was found to
      be 66.
