    
      Registry Objective: The primary objective of this registry is to collect real-world
      performance and safety data on Penumbra System including the 3D Revascularization Device in a
      patient population with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to intracranial large vessel
      occlusion (LVO).

      Registry Design: This will be a prospective, single-arm, multi-center observational registry
      and will include patients that present with either anterior or posterior LVO who are eligible
      for mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra System.

      Registry Duration: Subjects will be in the registry for approximately 90 days from enrollment
      to last follow-up.
