      radiolabelling with a 68Ga chloride solution complying with the requirements of monograph
      2464 of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur), the solution may be used in men with biochemical
      relapse of prostate cancer after treatment. A large number of studies have been published on
      68Ga-PSMA-ligands but none has yet been conducted with a product manufactured in accordance
      with ANMI technology. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of 68Ga-PSMA-11,
      prepared from a room temperature radiolabel kit containing PSMA-11 (PSMA-11 Sterile Cold Kit)
      and gallium 68 obtained from a 68Ge / 68Ga generator on 18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) in
      identifying prostate cancer recurrence after radical treatment sites. So, patients will be
      evaluated with the current workup at CHRU of Nancy and will then be submitted to 68GA-PSMA-11
      and 18F-FCH imaging. Patients will be randomized to the imaging procedure after workup in a
      1/1 ratio between 68GA-PSMA-11 and comparator. So all patients will be submitted to
      68GA-PSMA-11 and 18F-FCH; 50% of patients will receive the 68GA-PSMA-11 first; 50% of
      patients will receive the comparator first. There will be a time interval of minimum 7 days
      and maximum 14 days between both imaging procedures.

      In order to mimic, as far as possible, the routine clinical practices, a sequential
      unblinding will be used for image readers. Readers will evaluate 68GA-PSMA-11 and 18F-FCH
      images with progressive access to more clinical information on each read. It will be done in
      three steps: fully blinded image evaluation, then image evaluation with results of the
      patient's clinical history and finally image evaluation with results of the patient's workup
      and clinical history.
