      important implications for cancer control and prevention because tumor vaccines are emerging
      as tools for cancer treatment and prevention, and the cohort that would benefit from the
      vaccines is likely to be stressed. Women at elevated risk for breast cancer experience
      significant levels of distress that have been associated with immune function decrements.
      Interventions to treat distress-related immune decrements among these women are needed
      because these women will be among the first candidates for breast cancer vaccines. In theory,
      stress-management interventions should improve immune function and response to vaccines, but
      the findings to date are mixed, in part because most intervention studies have been done with
      medical patients who by nature have immune confounds. Thus, it is unknown how stress
      management interventions affect immune function in stressed but otherwise healthy people,
      such as women at elevated risk for breast cancer.

      Comparison: Women will be randomly assigned to a 10-week structured, CBSM intervention or a
      wait-list comparison group with delay participation in the intervention. The comparison group
      will be offered the full CBSM intervention after all assessment time points have been
      completed.
