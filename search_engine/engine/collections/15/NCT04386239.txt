    
      In February 2020, the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and, especially, in
      Lombardy, with a potential fatal outcome in a significant proportion of cases, determined the
      need for adopting new therapeutic approached based on the few data available in literature.
      Although there are no clinical data available in COVID-19 patients concomitantly treated with
      Sarilumab subcutaneously (SC) nor intravenously (IV), there is scientific rationale that
      supports the exploration of sarilumab to treat pulmonary complications related to
      Covid-195-6. By inhibiting interleukin-6 (IL-6)signaling, sarilumab may potentially interrupt
      cytokine-mediated pulmonary injury precipitated by infection with SARS-CoV-2 and thereby
      ameliorate severity and/or reduce mortality among patients presenting with Covid-19 pneumonia
      when administered in conjunction with antiviral therapy. given the apparent dose/dose
      pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) equivalence of 400 mg of tocilizumab to 400 mg of
      sarilumab, we propose a dose escalation protocol by which the first 5 included patients will
      be treated with a dosage of 200 mg of sarilumab IV as 1st dose, followed by clinical
      reassessment after 12 hours and in case of no major adverse events and lack of improvement in
      respiratory function and / or persistence of fever and persistently high inflammatory markers
      re-administration of 200 mg intravenous (IV) of sarilumab. If no patients showed unfavorable
      safety signals, and no clear improvement is detected in >50% of the initially treated five
      patients after 96 hours since last administration, the dosage will be increase to sarilumab
      400 mg IV as first and second dose in the remaining patients.
