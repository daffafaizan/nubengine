      consumer engagement to overcome cognitive and motivational barriers to medication adherence.
      Our goals are threefold: (1) to analyze which interventions are most effective in promoting
      medication adherence; (2) to analyze which interventions are most effective in promoting
      long-term habits that persist even when the interventions are removed; and (3) to understand
      how various patient characteristics (e.g. age or risk preferences) predict adherence or
      treatment receptivity. The investigators plan to track daily adherence of patients to a
      prescribed chronic disease drug using a new technology that electronically monitors when a
      pill bottle has been opened. In our control condition, patients will be monitored but not be
      provided with any reminders, adherence information, or incentive to adhere to their
      medication. Our three additional treatments will be either: (1) provide the patient with a
      daily email, text message, or phone call reminder to take the pill; (2) pay patients for each
      day that they take their pill (3) provide the patient with a daily email, text message, or
      phone call reminder to take the pill and pay patients for each day that they take their pill.
