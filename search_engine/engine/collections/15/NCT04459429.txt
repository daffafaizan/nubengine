    
      NHF will be applied at 8 L/min using the AIRVO 2 through smaller and larger Optiflow nasal
      cannula. The study will have a randomized crossover design. The larger or smaller cannula
      size will be applied as the first intervention during each experiment. During each
      experiment, if the larger cannula is applied first, then the smaller cannula will be applied
      second and if the smaller cannula is applied first, then the larger cannula will be applied
      second. Each experiment will last for 1.5 hour.

        -  During baseline, supplemental oxygen will be added during NHF therapy to keep SpO2 in
           normal ranges (90%-94%). When the SpO2 has stabilized then the level of supplemental
           oxygen will be set for the entire experiment unless there is a significant change in
           SpO2 as determined by the attending consultant.

        -  There will be three consecutive 30-min periods of recording during each experiment and
           each experiment will last approximately 1.5 hour.

        -  Ventilation will be assessed by Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (Respitrace) and
           transcutaneous carbon dioxide and oxygen.

        -  Recordings will be made using ADInstruments Powerlab and Labchart software with video
           recording of the patient.

        -  Routine measurement of heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations will be
           performed as per standard neonatal practice.

      The researcher is an experienced neonatal consultant who will be directly observing the baby
      throughout the study.
