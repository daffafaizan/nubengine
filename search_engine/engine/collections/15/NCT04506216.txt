      associated with a poor prognosis in terms of glycemic control, metabolic complications,
      degenerative complications, and mortality.

      Therefore the terminology "diabulimia" has emerged to characterize an eating disorder
      specific to type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes patients, with insulin under dosage with a view
      of losing or controlling weight and that can contribute to a deterioration of the body
      composition.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of eating disorders in an adult
      cohort with type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes.
