        -  To determine the levels of catechol estrogens (CE), CE metabolites, CE-DNA adducts, and
           CE conjugates in nipple aspirate fluid samples obtained from women with newly diagnosed
           ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I or II breast cancer and from women at high risk of
           developing breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer or at high risk of developing breast
      cancer undergo nipple aspiration. The nipple aspirate fluid is obtained from the unaffected
      breast and is analyzed for 31 estrogen metabolites, conjugates, and depurinating DNA adducts
      by high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) with electrochemical and mass spectrometric
      detectors. All patients undergo urine and serum sample collection. The urine samples are
      analyzed by ultraperformance LC monitored by tandem mass spectrometry for estrogen
      metabolites, conjugates, and depurinating DNA adducts.

      Patients' charts are reviewed to obtain information about age, race, general health, any
      endocrine disorders, history of cancer, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and
      HER2/neu status (for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer), menopausal status,
      reproductive history, history of breast disease, medication use, smoking history, and history
      of alcohol consumption.
