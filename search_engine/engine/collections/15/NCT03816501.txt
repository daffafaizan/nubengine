      117 patients scheduled for inguinal hernia surgery for any reason in the age range of 18-70
      will be included in our study. preoperative STAI I and II score (anxiety questionnaire) will
      be applied to each patient. The patients will be divided into two groups as preoperative
      music played and not played. The list of patients listening to the music will be played
      through the headphones which are the preference of the patients. The postoperative STAI
      questionnaire will be applied again. results will be evaluated statistically
