    
      The device/monitoring system being developed measures the haemoglobin and haematocrit levels
      in blood from a single drop of blood. By measuring these blood parameters, participants are
      able to monitor their haemoglobin level at home.

      The use of the device will take place in the participant's home to simulate what the
      investigators believe will be the ideal location for people who would prefer to self-manage
      their condition.

      This study is a data collection study to evaluate the performance of the prototype.
