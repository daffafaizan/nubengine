      crescent formation at onset have high risks of progressing to end stage renal failure. Though
      clinical studies have shown that steroids in combination with cyclophosphamide could reduce
      proteinuria and preserve renal function, this protocol is associated with many side effects,
      and is not effective in some patients.

      Recent studies have shown that mycophenolic acid(MPA), the active metabolite of mycophenolate
      mofetil(MMF),could inhibit multifarious effects on endothelial cells, including adhesion
      molecular expression, neutrophil attachment,IL-6 secretion, and the process of angiogenesis,
      which contribute to the efficacy of MMF in the treatment of vasculitis. Clinical studies also
      showed that MMF was effective in the treatment of lupus nephritis with vasculitic lesions.
      These findings suggest that MMF might be effective in the treatment of severe HSPN, which is
      a kind of vasculitic lesion. This prospective open-labeled clinical trial study investigates
      the efficiency of MMF in the treatment of severe HSPN compared with pulse intravenous
      cyclophosphamide. After 12 months of treatment, we will assess the efficacy, safety,
      tolerability and relapse of MMF compared with cyclophosphamide in the treatment of severe
      HSPN.
