      widely used to improve the outcome of organ transplantation. The need for frequent and
      specific monitoring of drug concentrations remains essential, since the therapeutic dosing
      and pharmacokinetics show great variability among recipients. However, this may be time and
      cost consuming. Indeed, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus are all metabolized by
      CYP3A, consisting with the metabolic characteristic of endogenous cortisol and cortisone.
      Hence, the present study is designed to determine if the endogenous cortisol and cortisone
      metabolism can be used as an noninvasive probe for immunosuppressants pharmacokinetics in
      Chinese renal transplant recipients.
