      speech impairments, most of which are grouped together and called hypokinetic dysarthria.
      Hypokinetic dysarthria is typically characterized by altered prosody (e.g., reduced loudness
      and pitch variation), phonation (e.g., breathy or harsh voice), and articulation (e.g.,
      imprecise consonants, centralized vowels). Changes in speech may appear early in PD and
      progress in severity over time. Further, such changes in speech lead to significant declines
      in functional communication and quality of life. Pharmacological and surgical interventions
      that alleviate motor symptoms in PD are largely ineffective or sometimes even detrimental for
      speech.

      Objectives Based on results from a preliminary study, the investigators propose to conduct a
      pilot randomized, controlled trial in patients with hypokinetic dysarthria in PD to assess
      the potential effectiveness of a novel home-based exercise intervention with interactive
      automated speech response features that encourage a higher level of speech performance. The
      investigators hypothesize that patients in the intervention program will improve in speech
      intelligibility and self-perceived communication ability over 6 months, as compared with
      patients in a health education program.

      Methods A total of 104 community-dwelling Veterans with hypokinetic dysarthria in
      mild-to-moderate PD will be randomly assigned to the exercise intervention or to the health
      education control. The investigators will test the effects of the intervention at 6 months
      for the outcomes speech intelligibility and self-perceived communication ability.
