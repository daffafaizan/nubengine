      non-diabetic heart failure patients. Prior to administration of study medication, a medical
      history, physician exam, blood draw, laser Doppler imaging (Periscan system), venous
      occlusion strain gauge plethysmography, metabolic exercise stress test and 2D and 3D
      echocardiograms will be performed. Patients will then be randomized to receive rosiglitazone
      2mg/day oral versus placebo with up-titration to 4mg/day oral versus placebo at 3 months.
      Each study arm will have 30 patients who will participate for 6 months. Follow up assessments
      will be completed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post randomization.
