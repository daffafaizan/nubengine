      placebo + MTX for up to 24 weeks. At Week 12 and 18, efficacy evaluation was conducted to
      assess eligibility for early escape, defined as <20% improvement in tender and swollen joint
      counts. Participants who completed the Base Study and those eligible for early escape could
      enroll in the 76-week Safety Extension in which participants were to receive open-label
      MK-8457 100 mg BID + MTX.

      All participants must have been treated with MTX for at least 3 months prior to Screening and
      have been receiving a stable dose of MTX for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. In
      addition, each participant must have either failed treatment with 1 or 2 anti-TNF-α therapies
      or was intolerant to anti-TNF-α therapy prior to Screening. For participants who failed
      therapy, the treatment with anti-TNF-α therapies must have been for at least 3 months.
