      imaging (fMRI). While being scanned participants were asked to recommend punishments similar
      to judges or juries for perpetrators across different scenarios. In addition, participants
      were primed before reading the scenario by using different materials. Based on recent
      theories about "embodied cognition" and extralegal factors investigators hypothesize that
      those primes may influence the harshness of punishments recommended by the participants. If
      those processes engage sensorimotor cortices, the results would strongly support theories of
      embodied cognition.

      The results would help the investigators to understand the neural correlates of priming
      processes. These unconscious complex processes of perception may be important for hospital
      patients. Thus, beneficial haptic experiences during the hospital stay may contribute to
      successful recovery.
