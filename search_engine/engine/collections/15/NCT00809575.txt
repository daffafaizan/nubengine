      patient-reported health status data to support and further facilitate the clinical
      decision-making process. This project has thus a number of goals. The main objective of the
      protocol is to improve our understanding of the possible added prognostic value of patients'
      judgment on their own health status and its potential clinical implications. This would aim
      at providing clinicians with an easy and brief to administer patient-reported health status
      scale or tool to be used to make more informed treatment decisions. In addition, along with
      other recent evidence (also looking at the prognostic value of patients' health status
      judgment in MDS patients), the data of this research could possibly serve to devise a
      patient-based prognostic index to be used in this higher risk population.
