      were compared to measure the Health Related Quality of life (HRQOL) and functional outcomes
      following two different surgical procedures. The first procedure is currently the most used
      procedure is North America, Trapeziectomy with Ligament Reconstruction and Tendon
      Interposition (T+LRTI); this procedure is compared to Partial Trapeziectomy and Tendon
      Interposition (PT+TI). HRQOL is measured using three questionnaires: one generic, one
      condition specific and one to measure utility (costs). Patients received their procedures
      from the respective surgeons and then came in for regular follow up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
      At these follow up visits the questionnaires and functional measurements (including grip, key
      pinch and tip pinch strength), were completed
