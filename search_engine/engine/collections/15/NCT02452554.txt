    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of IMGN901 (lorvotuzumab mertansine) in Wilms tumor,
      rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and other cluster of differentiation (CD)56-expressing tumors
      such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and
      synovial sarcoma.

      II. To determine the tolerability of the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMGN901
      administered as an intravenous infusion, administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, to
      children with refractory Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, pleuropulmonary
      blastoma, MPNST, or synovial sarcoma.

      III. To define and describe the toxicities of IMGN901 administered on this schedule.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate tumor response with tumor CD56+ expression. II. To characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of IMGN901 in children with refractory cancer, including an assessment of
      impact on circulating CD56+ peripheral blood cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lorvotuzumab mertansine intravenously (IV) over 1-1.5 hours on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
