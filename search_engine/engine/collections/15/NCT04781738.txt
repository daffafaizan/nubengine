      esophagus and the trachea. The most common vascular rings are double aortic arch and right
      aortic arch with left ligamentum. Pulmonary artery sling is less common. Another cause of
      tracheal compression occurring only in infants is the innominate artery compression syndrome.
      When patients are symptomatic, surgical correction should be performed.

      data regarding long term functional capacity and quality of life is lacking. our aim is to
      investigate the long term functional capacity and quality of life of patients with history of
      vascular ring whether they did or did not have corrective surgery.

      Methods: a prospective study evaluating functional capacity and quality of life the patients
      will perform pulmonary function test, 6 minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test and
      will fill a quality of life questionnaire (sf-36).
