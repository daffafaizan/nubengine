      LPV/r) taken twice a day decreases the amount of HIV found in participants' blood (viral
      load) compared to taking the once-a-day combination pill Atripla®. This study will also try
      to determine if the new combination has fewer side effects and is tolerated better than
      Atripla®. Another reason this study is being done is to see if this new drug combination
      helps participants' body's CD4 cells recover differently and will also look at how well
      participants' bodies absorbs these drugs and how safe these drugs are when given together.
