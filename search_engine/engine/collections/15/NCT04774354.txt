    
      Abdominal surgery represents the most frequent activity in the surgical block. Advances in
      surgical techniques and improvements in postoperative care imply the need for greater control
      of the surgical outcomes obtained and the comparison of results between services with the
      same characteristics with the help of assessment scales.

      A prospective observational study will be carried out during 2021. All patients undergoing
      abdominal surgery will be included. Demographic variables, personal and surgical history,
      preoperative and intraoperative data, and variables related to surgery will be collected. At
      30 days postoperatively, the clinical history of the patients will be reviewed and
      postoperative complications will be collected as well as the mortality that occurred. With
      these data, the POSSUM, the P-POSSUM and the Charlson comorbidity index will be calculated.

      Once this data are collected, the following objectives will be met:

        -  Validate the POSSUM and P-POSSUM systems in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery
           in our hospital, comparing the estimated morbidity and mortality with that observed 30
           days after surgery.

        -  Analyze the correlation of estimated morbidity and mortality of the POSSUM and P-POSSUM
           with respect to that observed in scheduled surgery vs. emergencies.

        -  Analyze the correlation of estimated morbidity and mortality of POSSUM and P-POSSUM with
           respect to that observed in laparoscopic surgery vs. laparotomy

        -  Establish the relationship and predictive ability of CHF with respect to morbidity and
           mortality at 30
