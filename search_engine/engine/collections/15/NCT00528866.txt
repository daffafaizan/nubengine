    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess whether the addition of androgen suppression therapy and docetaxel to adjuvant
           radiotherapy improves freedom from progression.

      Secondary

        -  To assess freedom from local-regional progression, distant metastases, disease-free
           survival, prostate cancer specific survival, non-prostate cancer specific survival,
           overall survival, and time to biochemical (PSA) failure.

        -  To evaluate treatment-related "acute" and "late" toxicity based on Common Toxicity
           Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0.

        -  To correlate genomic and proteomic biomarkers with the primary and secondary clinical
           endpoints utilizing archival prostatectomy tissue and pretreatment and prospectively
           collected serum/plasma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Androgen suppression therapy: Patients receive a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
           (LHRH) agonist (leuprolide or goserelin) as an injection AND an oral antiandrogen
           (flutamide 3 times daily or bicalutamide once daily) for up to 6 months.

        -  Radiotherapy: Beginning 8 weeks after the initiation of androgen suppression therapy,
           patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy once a day 5 days a week for up to approximately 8 weeks.

        -  Chemotherapy: Beginning 3-6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive
           docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
