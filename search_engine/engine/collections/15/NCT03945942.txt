      Spectroscopy devices. The number of wave lengths used by different devices can influence the
      oximetry values in adult patients. This has never been demonstrated in children with
      hyperbilirubinaemia scheduled for elective liver transplantation.The study will compare
      cerebral and somatic oximetry values measured by two different Near infrared spectroscopy
      devices (FORESIGHT and INVOS) and analyse the influence of bilirubin levels on these
      differences.
