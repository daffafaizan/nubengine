    
      This clinical trial is a single site, double blinded, paired within groups, controlled
      clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy in the use of adult autologous adipose
      tissue for the treatment of pain associated with joint OA. The hypothesis of this trial is
      that the treatment will be safe and the proposed clinical outcome measures of reduced pain
      resulting from the treatment of OA of the knee joint with autologous adipose tissue will be
      superior to a placebo control treatment.
