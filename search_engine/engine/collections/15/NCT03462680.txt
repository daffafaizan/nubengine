      the presence of microglia in the substantia nigra in post-mortem samples [2] as well as
      activated microglia and cytokines in clinical and animal studies [3]. The use of non-aspirin
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was found to reduce the risk of PD [4]. The
      investigators recently identified an anti-inflammatory receptor GPR109A that is upregulated
      in PD [5]. Niacin has a high affinity for this receptor, suggesting that it (niacin) may play
      an important role in reducing inflammation in PD. The investigators also found that
      individuals with PD have a chronic niacin deficiency [5]. Using seed funding from the local
      PD chapter, the investigators obtained pilot data which suggested that restoring the
      deficiency via over-the-counter (OTC) supplementation reduced inflammation and decreased the
      severity of the disease symptoms [6]. In this VA-funded study, the investigators will
      determine the effect of 6 months' OTC niacin supplementation on inflammation (as assessed in
      the blood and spinal fluid) and severity of the PD symptoms.
