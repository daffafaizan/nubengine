      complications including hypoxia and hypotension are frequent in urgent and emergent
      intubation and associated with an increased risk of death. The use of a written,
      pre-procedure checklist and positioning the patient with the head of the bed elevated have
      been proposed as interventions capable of preventing complications during non-elective
      intubation and are used intermittently in routine care -- however neither have been examined
      in a prospective trial. The investigators propose a randomized trial comparing use of a
      written checklist versus no written checklist and ramped versus sniffing position for
      endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults.
