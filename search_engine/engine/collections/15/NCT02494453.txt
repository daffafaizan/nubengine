      have demonstrated decreased local-regional recurrence rates and decreased breast-cancer
      mortality. However, balanced with this survival benefit is the potential toxicity of the
      treatment itself. In particular, cardiac effects of radiotherapy have been a concern and an
      area of research for the past 20 years. From long-term follow up of patients with lymphoma,
      it is known that radiotherapy can lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction, valvular
      dysfunction, systolic and diastolic function abnormalities, and heart failure among
      cancer-survivors. Patients with breast cancer receive lower doses to smaller volumes of the
      heart, but they also have an excellent long-term survival, so it is crucial to study the
      effects of low dose radiotherapy. Indeed, a recent study suggests that these effects can be
      seen within the first 5 years after treatment, and that there is no dose threshold. The
      investigators hypothesize that they can develop imaging and blood biomarkers of cardiac
      exposure, as a first step to identifying patients at increased risk for cardiac effects.
      These patients can then be targeted for close monitoring and early intervention, potentially
      with statins or ACE inhibitors. Additionally, by characterizing a time-course and radiation
      dose-volume relationship, potentially real-time modifications can be made to RT field design
      for patients sensitive to RT effects. Finally, this information can be incorporated into
      better designs of treatment plans for future patients.
