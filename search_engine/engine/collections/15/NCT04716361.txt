      which affects up to 30% people who are over 70 years in the general population. Its symptoms
      include claudication, rest pain and ischemic tissue loss depending on its severity. Nowadays,
      endovascular treatments have become the first-line therapy. If ASO is combined with severe
      calcification, the treatment will be much more challenging. The efficacy of plain old balloon
      angioplasty is limited. New devices including drug-coated balloon, intravascular Lithotripsy,
      directional atherectomy, Supera stent and drug-eluting stent offer another chance and better
      prognosis. The data of these new devices, however, are mainly from low quality evidence.
      Therefore, we start this prospective, multicenter, real world, observational study, providing
      new data on the safety, efficacy and health economics evaluation of endovascular treatments
      for endovascular therapies in chronic femoropopliteal occlusive disease with severe
      calcification.
