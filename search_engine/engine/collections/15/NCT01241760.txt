    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all persons know the study
      drug assignment) multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness of telaprevir administered
      orally as 1125 milligram (mg) twice daily versus 750mg every 8 hours in combination with
      Peg-IFN-alfa-2a, administered via intramuscular injection once a week, and ribavirin,
      administered as an oral tablet twice a day, in treatment-na√Øve study participants with
      chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.

      Telaprevir will be given orally (by mouth) from Day 1 through Week 12 as 3 tablets (1125mg)
      twice daily or 2 tablets (750mg) every 8 hours. Peg-IFN-alfa-2a will be administered once a
      week as an injection under the skin (180 microgram/week) from Day 1 through Week 24 or 48
      (based on the patient's treatment response on week 4). Ribavirin is administered orally (by
      mouth) twice daily from Day 1 through Week 24 or 48 (based on the participant's treatment
      response on week 4) as 1,000-1,200 mg per day. After the end of treatment (Week 24, Week 48,
      or at early discontinuation of all study drugs), participants with undetectable HCV RNA at
      end of treatment will be required to attend follow-up visits until Week 72
      safety/tolerability assessments will be performed throughout the treatment period and during
      the follow-up period.
