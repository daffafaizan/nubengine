      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with
           interferon alfa-2b alone or interferon alfa-2b with bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the time to disease progression and objective response rates in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxicity of interferon alfa-2b in combination with bevacizumab in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      nephrectomy (yes vs no) and number of risk factors for disease progression (0 vs 1-2 vs 3 or
      more). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) three times a week.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b as in arm I and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
           minutes on days 1 and 15.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then annually for up to 10 years after
      study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 700 patients (350 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
