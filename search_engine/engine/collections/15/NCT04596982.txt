      prognosis and quality of life of patients. For those suffering from end-stage heart failure,
      heart transplantation remains the main therapeutic resource, but on the one hand the number
      of available grafts is insufficient compared to the number of transplant candidates, and on
      the other hand heart transplantation is accompanied by risks of rejection, infections and
      cancers, with a current median survival of 12 years .

      For these reasons, in selected patients, a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) may be a
      bridge to transplantation or a way to improve the duration and quality of life of patients
      without a transplant project (destination therapy). Currently, about half of all heart
      transplants performed internationally are done in patients with left monoventricular assist,
      and in 2017 43% of implanted LVAD patients were in destination therapy.

      For this reason, this observational study aims to describe the clinical, ultrasound and
      hemodynamic parameters of these patients and to establish a predictive score for right-sided
      dysfunction in a patient during the 30-day follow-up.

      More precisely, during this study we will compare the clinical, ultrasound and hemodynamic
      parameters of these patients in order to establish a predictive score for right-sided
      dysfunction during :

        -  48 hours on ECMO and IMPELLA (after IMPELLA® placement)

        -  48 hours on IMPELLA alone following ECMO withdrawal.

        -  48 hours under left monoventricular assistance

        -  At day 7 of the follow-up

        -  At day30 of the follow-up Patients who develop right heart failure within 48 hours of
           ECMO withdrawal after IMPELLA® placement will be compared to patients without right
           heart failure on demographic, clinical, history, treatment history, and cardiac echo and
           hemodynamic data at admission.
