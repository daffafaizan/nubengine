      rates up to 34.9 percent. Depression, in the context of HIV, leads to poor self-care behavior
      such as non-adherence to ART and worse retention in care, which are critical for treatment
      success. Based on our prior work, and given that CBT is an evidenced-based treatment for
      depression, this is a two-arm effectiveness randomized controlled trial of nurse-delivered
      cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and adherence integrated into the HIV primary
      care setting in S. Africa. To ensure that those who need this intervention the most will
      receive it, participants will be patients with HIV who did not achieve viral suppression from
      their first line ART, and have a unipolar depressive mood disorder.
