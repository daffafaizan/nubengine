      androgenetic alopecia.

      A total of 40 subjects will be evaluated with 32 subjects randomized to receive active drug
      and 8 subjects randomized to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion (10 subjects in each
      dose cohort with 8 subjects randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects randomized to
      receive placebo for a total of 4 dose cohorts).

      Cohort Dose of KX-826 Subjects

        1. 2.5 mg QD for 14 days 10 (8 active + 2 placebo)

        2. 5 mg QD for 14 days 10 (8 active + 2 placebo)

      Dose escalation will not occur until review of the multiple dose safety from the previous
      dose cohort is completed. Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, vital signs
      (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature), clinical laboratory
      findings, 12-lead ECGs, skin irritation assessments and physical examination findings.
