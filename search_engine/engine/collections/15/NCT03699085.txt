      multi-component intervention adapted from a collaborative care framework initiated in the ED
      for patients at risk for opioid use disorder. According to the 2015 national survey on drug
      use and health, an estimated 3.8 million individuals over 12 years of age were currently
      misusing opioid pain relievers. An additional 329,000 people use heroin. The Emergency
      Department (ED) is currently at the forefront of this public health emergency and often a
      place where patients come for treatment of overdose and for treatment of medical problems
      related to illicit opioid use.

      Overall, the goal is to establish the feasibility of a multi-component intervention called
      'Emergency Department Longitudinal Integrated Care (ED-LINC)' which is guided by principles
      of collaborative care and is comprised of components that are evidence-based. ED-LINC is
      initiated from the ED and continues longitudinally for patients at-risk for opioid use
      disorder.
