      planning and performing laparoscopic liver resections. Models will be developed with unique,
      low-cost approach. Project will consist of three overlapping modules/stages evaluating:

        1. Accuracy of 3D printed liver models compared to computed tomography and standard surface
           or volume rendering

        2. Whether 3D printed utilized in planning surgery affects the decision making regarding
           the surgical plan

        3. Whether 3D printed models utilized in planning and navigating laparoscopic resections
           affect perioperative outcomes

      Methodology of developing 3D models is described elsewhere. Printed models will be delivered
      to surgical team at least 5 days prior to the resection. Surgery will be performed in both
      arms according to the department's procedures and surgical oncology guidelines.
