      accumulation of axonal loss, as measured by retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) on
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with RRMS over 24 months and compared to a
      reference population of healthy controls.

      The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of GA on total macular
      volume (TMV) on OCT in patients with RRMS over 24 months. We will also explore how the
      24-month changes of RNFLT and TMV on OCT relate to progression of disability, as measured by
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).
