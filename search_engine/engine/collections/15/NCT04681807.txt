      explore the neuronal correlates underlying lower social cognitive functioning observed in FHR
      individuals. FHR youth will be randomized into either a 4-session emotion recognition
      training exercise program on iPad or an active control training program on iPad that includes
      commercial games and control emotional attention bias training.
