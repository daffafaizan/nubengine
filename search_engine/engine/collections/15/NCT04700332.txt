      disease in pateints with:

        1. High risk prostate cancer and planned prostatectomy or radiation therapy (arm 1) and

        2. Biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (arm 2) but without evidence of disease of
           standard of care imaging (CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan).

      In both cohorts, PyL PET/CT will be obtained and evaluated by a nuclear radiologist trained
      in novel PET radiotracers, including PyL. Lesions suspicious for disease of PyL that were
      unsuspected on standard of care imaging will be selected for biopsy for pathologic
      confirmation if feasible . Pathology will be used as the reference standard for confirming
      malignancy.
