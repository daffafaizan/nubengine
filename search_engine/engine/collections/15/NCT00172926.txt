      the same pathogen or condition. But according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine, physical
      constitution is an important factor for disease pattern, severity and response to the
      treatment. So it is paid more and more attention in Western Medicine to study the variation
      of individualized susceptibility to diseases.

      There have been some researches to investigate the relationship between physical constitution
      and disease pattern. Before further studies, we need to obtain more information about
      physical constitution and clinical characteristics. Therefore we design a comprehensive
      questionnaire to survey the types of physical constitution. And we plan to collect the data
      from health reports of candidates after their medical tests at Health Examination Center in
      National Taiwan University Hospital Yu-Lin Branch. We focus on the relationship between
      clinical characteristics (age, sex, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory results and image
      findings) of Western Medicine and the physical constitutional types of Chinese Medicine. Then
      we will try to find the correlation and significance between them.

      The study will conclude the constitutional characteristics in general population of Taiwan
      and the distribution tendency of physical constitution for the common diseases. The result
      can serve as a stepping stone for integration of the Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western
      Medicine.
