      corrected before birth. Animal models of the procedures have been carefully translated to
      humans, but less is known about anesthetic techniques. In children, inadequate anesthesia
      results in greater stress responses as shown by cardiovascular, neuro-endocrine, and
      metabolic changes. These stress responses have been associated with poorer outcomes. One of
      the major goals of anesthesia for these procedures is to attenuate this stress response.
      Fetuses get intramuscular opioids before their incision, and the mother is given high doses
      of volatile anesthetic (desflurane) with the assumption that whatever amount of desflurane
      crosses the placenta adequately anesthetizes the fetus. No studies have quantified the fetal
      levels of desflurane.

      High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been used to measure levels of volatile
      anesthetic in various tissues. Measurement of desflurane has been challenging because of its
      higher boiling point (23.5 °C at one atmosphere pressure) when compared to older volatile
      anesthetics such as sevoflurane (boiling point 58.6 °C) and isoflurane (boiling point 48.5
      °C). With techniques in cold rooms and using ice for sample transport, investigators have
      successfully measured desflurane levels in blood and brain tissue of mice.

      Our eventual goal is to quantify fetal levels of desflurane in umbilical cord blood during
      fetal surgery, but we first propose a pilot study to assess and refine the ability of our
      assay to measure desflurane in human blood.
