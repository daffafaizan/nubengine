      participate in this randomized trial. Consent will be completed after explanation of each
      treatment group and the data to be collected. Patients will be randomized into one of the two
      treatment groups by simple randomization into one of two groups: Group 1 will receive
      interscalene nerve block and group 2 will receive liposomal bupivacaine for postoperative
      analgesia. Randomization will be stratified by site.

      The surgeon at each site will be trained prior to enrollment on the correct way to perform
      Exparel injections intraoperatively. Patients in the interscalene nerve block group will be
      given a single shot block in the preoperative area by a fellowship-trained anesthesiologist.

      The primary outcome is pain score on a visual analog scale (VAS) at 24 hours postoperatively.
      VAS pain scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain). Secondary outcomes are
      postoperative VAS pain scores at 6, 12, 18, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, and
      96 hours; VAS pain score at the first postoperative visit ; intraoperative opioid
      consumption; postoperative opioid consumption at days 1, 2, 3, and 4; total opioid
      consumption at day 1 (intraoperative + postoperative day 1); duration of stay in the
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU); duration of hospital stay; and VAS score for satisfaction
      with pain control in the hospital and at home, assessed at participants' first postoperative
      visit. VAS satisfaction scores range from 0 (not satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied).
