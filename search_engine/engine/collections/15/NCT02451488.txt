      have shown this occurs early in the disease process. This regional nodal immunosuppression
      precedes nodal metastasis and may be required for nodal spread. Administration of GM-CSF has
      been used to alter the immune response to metastatic melanoma. The investigators propose to
      assess whether administration of a short course of GM-CSF preoperatively to patients about to
      undergo wide local excisions and sentinel lymph node dissection can alter the immune
      environment of the sentinel lymph node and restore an immune surveillance profile in the
      sentinel lymph node.
