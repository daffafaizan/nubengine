    
      1. A planned Fluoroscopically Guided Lumbar Transforaminal Epidural Injection should be
           performed after receiving the informed consent of the patient.

        2. This study is single-blind because it is not possible to blind the practitioner
           performing the injection.

        3. Subjects were randomly assigned to the subcutaneous anesthesia group (group A) and the
           muscle anesthesia group (group B) by a random random number table, and the possibilities
           for belonging to any group were all the same and can not be artificially controlled by
           researchers.

        4. After the procedure, a resident who does not know of this study records the patient's
           pain and discomfort. and on follow-up visits, post injection site pain is checked.

        5. Because of the large difference between the skilled and unskilled patients, the
           procedure in this study is performed by only one skilled practitioner
