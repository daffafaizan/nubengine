      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the impact of a restricted diet on toxicity and
      efficacy of chemotherapy for breast and prostate cancer.

      II. To evaluate the compliance with a controlled diet intervention.

      III. To investigate changes in plasma insulin, glucose, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)
      and IGF binding protein (IGFBP) levels in subjects who consume a restricted diet compared to
      controls.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 or 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients eat a special low-calorie diet during 3 days prior to chemotherapy, during
      the 12 weeks of chemotherapy, and 24 hours after chemotherapy. Patients are provided with all
      meals and all food to be consumed and maintain a diary of the food consumed and appropriate
      amounts. Patients meet with the study dietician within 3 weeks of enrollment and prior to, or
      on the day of, their first course of chemotherapy on study and at the start of each
      subsequent course.

      ARM II: Patients eat a normal diet and receive dietary advice which may include consultation
      with a nutritionist. Patients maintain a diary of the food consumed and appropriate amounts.
