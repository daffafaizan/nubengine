      on parents and child's management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) from both a group versus
      an individual therapy modality. We want to start a group and individual therapy program that
      looks at youth and family adjustment and coping at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital with
      patients who have T1DM. There has been research before on this group therapy and we want to
      look at it in a "typical" clinical setting at Cincinnati Children's Hospital for both group
      and individual therapy, including recently diagnosed patients (<1 year). This research is
      being done to understand how a peer and family-based group versus individual therapy can be
      helpful by looking at survey data as well as medical data before and after participating in
      the diabetes therapy program. This information will help us further develop prevention and
      intervention programs for other youth with T1DM and their families.
