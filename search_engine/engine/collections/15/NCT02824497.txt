    
      Main objective:

      To describe the care and short-term respiratory become newborns 32 weeks gestation or older
      with early and persistent respiratory distress to 2 hours of life (H2) over a period of one
      year in a type IIb motherhood.

      Methodology :

      Design: retrospective, descriptive, single-center, non-interventional

      Performed in the Saint Joseph neonatal unit. Study duration: 1 year (01/05/2013-04/30/2014).

      Acquisition of data:

      The patients were selected from the hospitalization reports of infants by taking the
      following key words: respiratory distress, invasive and noninvasive ventilation, intubation,
      exogenous surfactant, pneumothorax.

      Data collected:

        -  Obstetric data:

             -  Mode of delivery: route of delivery, presentation at birth.

             -  Maternal morbidity.

             -  antenatal corticosteroids in infants less than 34 weeks.

        -  Neonatal data:

             -  Gestational Age

             -  Birth Weight

             -  cord pH

             -  Apgar M5

        -  The terms of the allocation:

             -  Tracheal Intubation

             -  ventilation modes (controlled mechanical ventilation (VMC), non-invasive
                ventilation (NIV), nasal cannula), the maximum reached FiO2 (fraction of inspired
                oxygen), ventilation time for each ventilation mode. These different methods were
                studied in the delivery room during hospitalization (in intensive care and neonatal
                intensive care "NICU").

        -  The place of hospitalization: resuscitation and / or NICU.

        -  The transfer to the NICU resuscitation if necessary.

        -  Received drugs (exogenous surfactant, antibiotics, caffeine)

        -  The successful primary diagnosis.
