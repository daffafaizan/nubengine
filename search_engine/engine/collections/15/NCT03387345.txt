      increase satiety. Nutrient-dense grain mixtures that include a new cultivar of barley
      (Sustagrain, Ardent Mills, LLC) with exceptionally high dietary fiber content may help
      individuals meet their dietary fiber needs while minimizing the rapid increase in blood
      glucose following the consumption of a refined grain product. The primary objective of this
      study was to compare the effects of five different test meals containing varying amounts of
      whole-grain barley and refined white rice to white bread on post-prandial blood glucose
      concentrations. A secondary aim was to evaluate changes in self-reported hunger and satiety
      following the consumption of each treatment. This study was a single-site, blinded,
      randomized crossover trial among 24 healthy adults. Each participant consumed the following
      treatments: 100% Sustagrain barley flakes, 100% Sustagrain steel cut barley , an 80/20
      rice-steel cut Sustagrain barley mix, a 50/50 rice-steel cut Sustagrain barley mix, 100%
      rice, and white bread.
