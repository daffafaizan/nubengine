      measurements of baseline asthma characteristics were completed; history and examination,
      questionnaires (Asthma Control Questionnaires and Leicester Cough Questionnaire, and basic
      lung physiological assessment were performed.

      At the end of visit 1, a cough monitor was attached to the subject to monitor cough frequency
      for the next 24 hours and this was returned at visit 2.

      Visit 2 followed within two weeks after visit 1, during which a full dose capsaicin cough
      challenge was performed. Emergency contact details were given towards end of visit 2 should
      any adverse events occur.

      Telephone call within 48 hours, Day 3 and Day 7: The purpose of these phone calls was to
      ensure that the patient had not developed any adverse effects to the capsaicin challenge.
