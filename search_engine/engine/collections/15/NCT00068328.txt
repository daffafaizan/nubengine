        -  Determine the relationship between preferences and chemotherapy decisions in women age
           65 and over with operable, newly diagnosed breast cancer.

        -  Determine how factors that could be targets for intervention affect the relationship
           between preferences and chemotherapy decisions in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationships between preference-based chemotherapy decisions, quality of
           life, and satisfaction with treatment decisions in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival and competing causes of mortality of these patients.

        -  Determine the types of physician providers who care for older breast cancer survivors
           after initial cancer treatment is completed and explore how women decide about which
           physicians to see.

        -  Measure quality indicators for the survivorship phase of care and evaluate if quality
           varies by type of physician provider model.

        -  Determine if long-term patient-reported satisfaction varies as a function of physician
           model for providing follow-up care post-treatment.

        -  Determine whether physician-patient communication and coordination of care after
           treatment ends mediate follow-up quality and outcomes post-treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a cohort study.

      Patients participate in interviews over 30-45 minutes at baseline, at 6 months, and at 1 and
      2 years.

      Patients are followed annually for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,296 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
