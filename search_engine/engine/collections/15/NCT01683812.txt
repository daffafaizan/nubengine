      with the infant and maintains proper body alignment while promoting normal head shape
      development. While the cranial cup is not yet FDA approved, it is considered a
      non-significant medical device and it has successfully corrected asymmetric positional head
      shape deformities in hundreds of healthy newborns less than 4 months of age cared for by the
      Children's Hospital Boston outpatient plagiocephaly clinic. Additionally preliminary analysis
      of a prospective randomized controlled trial currently underway suggests that the cranial cup
      may be useful in prevention of positional head shape deformity in a cohort of hospitalized
      infants of varying gestational ages. However, the cranial cup has never been used for
      correction of the most common form of positional head shape deformity in hospitalized
      premature infants; namely dolichocephaly. Thus, the purpose of this descriptive study is to
      provide information on the feasibility of using the cranial cup in a small sample of
      prematurely born infants with dolichocephaly during the convalescent phase of their
      hospitalizations. Information obtained from this descriptive study will be used to determine
      if a larger investigation using the cranial cup is warranted in this specific patient
      population.
