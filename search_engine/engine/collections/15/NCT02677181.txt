      stem cell (PBSCT) has been a stable transplant setting with matched sibling donor
      transplantation. Unmanipulated haploidentical donor PBSCT (haplo-PBSCT) has been applied in
      patients with hematologic malignancies. In our previous cohort study, haplo-PBSCT was
      associated with lower incidence of severe acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD compared with
      matched sibling donor PBSCT (MSD-PBSCT). Haplo-PBSCT has the same GVHD prophylaxis regimen
      with MSD-PBSCT, except ATG. It suggested the potential advantage of ATG in prophylaxis of
      GVHD and improvement of long-term quality of life of the transplant recipients, which
      motivate us to observe the efficacy of combined ATG regimen for GVHD prophylaxis in
      MSD-PBSCT.
