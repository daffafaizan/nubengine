      Zhejiang Province, China. Randomized controlled trial is not an optimum option at this stage
      given the lack of high-quality data in terms of this hypothesis. Eligible subjects will
      include men and women with age of 18 years or older, who have a confirmed diagnosis of acute
      proximal DVT with ipsilateral iliac vein stenosis. A total of 172 subjects will be enrolled.
      The inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria are pre-defined. Subjects meeting all inclusion
      and no exclusion criteria will be eligible for enrollment. All subjects will receive the
      combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy after implanted with iliac vein stent.
      For anticoagulant, it is rivaroxaban 20mg once a day for 6 months. For antiplatelet therapy,
      it is aspirin 100mg once a day indefinitely.The duration of study participation for each
      subject is 12 months. Each subject will be followed at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months
      post-procedure. Efficacy endpoints and safety endpoints will be documented during the
      follow-up. After completing the follow-up, data will be analyzed.
