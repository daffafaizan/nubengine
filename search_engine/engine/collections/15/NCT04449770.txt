      tubes in thoracic surgery is now well established. The investigators have developed a formula
      to be used and published recently. The investigators verified the formula with the use of
      FOB. This observational study will use FOB checking if needed.

      Our hypothesis is that DLT can insert without the use of FOB in most of the cases. That
      doesn't mean FOB is less required.
