      the Tanglewood to Table walking program, and community members of Harlan, KY were invited to
      serve as controls. Each Thursday or Saturday, participants report whether or not they walked
      the 1 mile trail to the farmers market, how many steps the walked in the previous 7 days and
      they reported which fruits and vegetables they consumed the previous week. The control group
      will receive nutrition education handouts. The program is from June 2018 - January 2019.
      Participants complete questionnaires about fruit and vegetable consumption and physical
      activity. Participants also provided physical and biological measurements. Recruiting for the
      2018 Walking Program will begin in May.
