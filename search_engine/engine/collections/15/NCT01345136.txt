    
      This protocol is a Phase II, open-label, efficacy and safety study of single-agent RAD001 in
      patients with NF2. During the study, subjects will receive continuous daily oral treatment
      with RAD001 for up to 1 year or until tumor progression.

      Primary Objective: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the VS growth in patients
      with NF2 at a rate sufficient to submit the drug for further testing.

      Secondary Objectives: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the volume of other
      intracranial tumors, and to assess the effect of RAD001 on hearing function in patients with
      NF2 (when applicable).
