    
      The study consists of three Aims:

      Aim 1: compare the effect on bone structure of mechanical signals with low strain magnitude,
      high strain magnitude, and control groups over a 12-month prospective period.

      Aim 2. Compare the effect on bone structure of mechanical signals with low strain rate, high
      strain rate, and control groups over a 12-month prospective period.

      Aim 3: Examine the effect of withdrawing mechanical signals, by measuring bone structure
      during the 12 months after the intervention is withdrawn.

      The intervention is a voluntary forearm compression task, consisting of leaning onto the palm
      of the hand to produce a target force.

      The primary outcome measure is change in distal radius bone mineral content (BMC).
