      modality. But we consider that the treatment results could be improved by several ways: 1.
      use of VMAT (volumetric arc therapy) based external beam radiotherapy could decrease toxicity
      by reducing of unnecessarily irradiated tissue volumes; 2. in addition to cisplatin
      gemcitabine could enhance tumor cell damaging effect of radiation; 3. interstitial
      brachytherapy could provide higher radiation dose boost to high risk tumor volume while
      sparing surrounding organs at risk.
