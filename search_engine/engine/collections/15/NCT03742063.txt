      tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scan or PET/CT in patients who received
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients had curative surgery of those lesions at Peking
      University People's Hospital or Peking University Shougang Hospital. Pathological evaluation
      was completed by determination of the tumor necrosis rate following Huvos' description. We
      also performed statistical diversity analysis for different pathological groups and generated
      receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) to define the thresholds to distinguish
      different pathological groups.
