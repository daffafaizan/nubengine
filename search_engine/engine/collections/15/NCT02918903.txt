    
      Minimal Caries Removal (MCR) technique was described in 2015 by Chompu-inwai et al., as a
      treatment option for primary molars with deep carious lesions or reversible pulpitis where
      only soft demineralized dentin around the lateral walls of the carious lesion is removed. The
      aim of this study is to assess the success of such a technique in managing primary molars
      with asymptomatic deep caries in terms of; post-operative pulpal symptoms(spontaneous pain,
      pain on percussion, fistula or sinus), incidence of pulp exposure, child acceptance, chair
      time and radiographic success.
