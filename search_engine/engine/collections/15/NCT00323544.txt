      antiretroviral regimen. Regimen characteristics that affect adherence include dosing
      frequency and pill burden. Several studies have shown improved adherence with lower pill
      burden and a meta-analysis of the virological outcome in relation to pill burden has shown a
      significant correlation between lower pill burden and better virological outcome. A
      systematic review of studies across a range of medical specialties demonstrated that once
      daily therapy improves adherence relative to more frequent dosing although statistical
      significance was not demonstrated relative to twice daily regimens.
