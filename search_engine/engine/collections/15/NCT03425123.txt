      treatment group will be compared to historical controls of all subjects treated by Ca(OH)2 or
      MTA apexification in the last 10 years (2007-2017) at the Boston University Henry M Goldman
      School of Dental Medicine.

      All materials used in this protocol are FDA approved and commercially available for similar
      applications. This study does not seek a new use or application of any materials, instead
      recommendations of the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) will be followed to
      evaluate outcomes associated with the REP compare to the standard of care Ca(OH)2 or MTA
      apexification.

      The overall objective for this research is the elimination of any clinical symptoms and the
      evidence of bony healing as examined by radiographs.

      Other objectives include increased root wall thickness and/or increased root length and
      positive response to vitality testing, which if achieved, could indicate a more organized
      vital pulp tissue.
