      inserted percutaneously in the femoral or jugular vein. Low-flow ECCO2R offers an alternative
      or supplement to invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients suffering from acute,
      reversible, hypercapnic respiratory failure. In contrast to invasive MV, low-flow ECCO2R
      provides partial ventilatory support independently of the lungs. The rationale for this study
      is that low-flow ECCO2R with the Hemolung RAS can be used to provide supplemental CO2 removal
      in COPD patients experiencing acute hypercapnic respiratory failure to either avoid or reduce
      time on invasive MV. In this patient population, avoidance or reduced time on invasive MV may
      have significant clinical benefit in reducing the many complications associated with invasive
      MV. The major complication risks of low-flow ECCO2R are associated with central venous
      catheterization and the need for anticoagulation during treatment. This study is designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hemolung RAS plus standard-of-care as compared to
      standard-of-care alone.
