      American sports leagues, international federations, and the World Anti-Doping Agency. Current
      methods employed to detect exogenously administered testosterone include direct detection
      using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and indirect detection using the athlete
      biological passport (ABP). However, different formulations of testosterone (oral,
      transdermal, sublingual, etc) are expected to result in characteristic IRMS profiles, affect
      the ABP readings in unique ways, and differ in their windows of detection. In 2014, a new
      formulation of testosterone, Natesto, which is administered intranasally, was FDA approved.
      Though only approved for medical use, it is expected athletes may use this product, and its
      effect on steroid doping markers has yet to be determined. Characterization of this detection
      profile is necessary for confirmation of the exact product being administered in an
      anti-doping setting. In this study, the investigators aim to understand the effects on the
      steroid doping profile following a single administration of Natesto to healthy, active
      volunteers. Windows of detection will be determined for the standard dosing of Natesto, and
      the effects on ABP markers and IRMS profiles will also be established.
