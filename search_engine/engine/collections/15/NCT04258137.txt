      stratify individual patients to the most promising therapy. Re-analysis of metastatic lesions
      by needle biopsy is possible but invasive, and limited by the known intra-patient
      heterogeneity of individual lesions. These hurdles might be overcome by analyzing circulating
      tumor DNA (liquid biopsy), which in principle might reflect all subclones present at that
      specific time point and allow sequential monitoring of disease evolution.

      Once tumor's genetic profiling is available, patients will be discussed within a
      multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) which aims at discussing the genomic profiles and at
      providing a therapeutic decision for each patient. This MTB involves clinical oncologists,
      molecular biologists and clinical or biological project manager.

      All the patients carrying an actionnable alteration will be proposed to receive a matched
      drug or to enter in a matched clinical trial depending on the possibility of inclusion at the
      time of molecular report.

      the investigators hypothesize that implementing sequential circulating tumor DNA analysis can
      improve management of patients with advanced cancer and therefore their survival.
