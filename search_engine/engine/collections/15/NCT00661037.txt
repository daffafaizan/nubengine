      defibrillation testing (DT), consisting in induction and termination of ventricular
      fibrillation (VF). An effective DT has historically been considered part of standard
      procedures at implant. Nevertheless, implant techniques and technology have evolved during
      years and nowadays deviations are frequent in clinical practice mainly due to the fact that
      physicians are seriously concerned about the risk of severe complications related to DT.
      However, the practice of not performing DT is arbitrary and its safety is yet unproven. This
      observational study will assess the safety of the two strategies adopted at ICD implant:
      induction (including patients who undergo DT at implant) and non-induction (including
      patients who do not undergo DT at implant. No deviation from the centres' current practice in
      choosing to perform or not perform DT is introduced by this study protocol. The study
      considers consecutive patients undergoing first implant of ICD
