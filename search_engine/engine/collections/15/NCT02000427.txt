    
      This is a single-arm Simon II stage design, multicenter study consisting of a screening
      period, an induction treatment period (2 cycles of blinatumomab), a consolidation treatment
      period (up to 3 additional cycles of blinatumomab for applicable participants), and a safety
      follow-up visit 30 days after treatment. Following the safety follow-up visit, participants
      will be followed for response duration and survival every 3 months for 18 months or death,
      whichever occurs first.
