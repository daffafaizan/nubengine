      transgender individuals with recent high-risk transmission behavior will be enrolled into the
      study. Each subject will be followed for up to 48 weeks after enrollment of the last subject.
      The primary endpoint will be measured at 48 weeks.

      All subjects will start PrEP with TDF + FTC fixed dose combination given once daily. Subjects
      will be randomized (1:1) to either the iTAB text messaging adherence reminder intervention
      with SoC or the SoC alone arm. Subjects placed into the iTAB intervention arm will receive a
      personalized, automated texting system to maintain adherence and retention. Both groups will
      receive access to PrEP in accordance with standardized comprehensive methods of prescribing,
      risk reduction counseling, adherence counseling, and clinical assessments that include safety
      monitoring, as well as HIV and STD screening.

      TDF 300 mg + FTC 200 mg fixed dose combination will be given orally once daily starting at
      the baseline visit (month 0) and continued throughout the study.
