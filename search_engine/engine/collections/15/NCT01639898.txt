      cycles" and trial "9 cycles" (Fleming plan in one stage).

      This will mean prospective multicentre studies, around a treatment with the
      lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination in patients suffering from POEMS syndrome either de
      novo, resistant or in relapse.

      Both trials carried out in parallel are complementary regarding the eligibility criteria:

        -  Group 1: the "2-cycles" trial will be available to patients who can be treated by
           radiation or intensive treatment (75 % of cases occurring in front line); they will then
           undergo 2 cycles of the lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination before radiation or
           intensive treatment (Group 1).

        -  Group 2 : the "9-cycles" trial will be available to all other front-line patients (25 %
           of front-line patients) or patients in relapse or resistant, they will undergo 9 cycles
           of the lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination followed by maintenance therapy with
           lenalidomide alone for one year (Group 2).

      Both these trials carried out within the same study will enable us to answer the question of
      potential efficacy of lenalidomide in POEMS syndrome and could enable us to draw up a new
      therapeutic standard.

      Main objective:

      Group 1: to evaluate the efficacy of the Len-Dex combination on the biological response after
      2 cycles in patients with POEMS syndrome who can undergo radiation or intensive treatment.

      Group 2: to evaluate the efficacy of the Len-Dex combination on the biological response in
      patients with POEMS syndrome who cannot be treated by radiation or intensive treatment.
