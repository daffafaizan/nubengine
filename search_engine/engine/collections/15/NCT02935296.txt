      HIV-infected index participant and his/her HIV-uninfected network injection partner(s).
      Network units will be randomized to the intervention or standard of care arms in a 1:3 ratio,
      stratified by site. To assess feasibility of the intervention, additional interviews will be
      conducted with study staff (systems navigators and counselors) and clinic-based stakeholders
      at each study site.

      Approximately 500 Index participants and their partners will be enrolled.
