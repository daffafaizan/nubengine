      diseases. Although great progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side
      effects associated with transplantation,chronic graft-versus-host disease(cGVHD) remains an
      important complication that occurs in about 50% patients. The mortality of cGVHD and its
      complication could reach up to 50%,and cGVHD seriously influence the quality of life. At
      present, glucocorticoids and cyclosporine (CsA) are the first line treatment of cGVHD, but
      their effective rates are only 50%. If first line treatment is ineffective, second line drugs
      would be taken, such as mycophenolate mofetil(MMF)and rituximab. The effective rates of
      second line drugs are 30%-61%. The effective rates and prognosis of refractory cGVHD are even
      worse.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated
      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs
      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and
      treating GVHD after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of refractory
      cGVHD using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor is rarely reported. If such
      treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used
      as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of
      donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status
      of a patient is urgent.

      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with
      refractory cGVHD.
