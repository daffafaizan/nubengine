      poisoning, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,hemorrhagic shock and cerebral infarction etc. We
      used Mesenchymal Stem Cells via portal vein infusion method to treat hypoxic ischemic
      encephalopathy. With different durations of follow-up, we cleared therapeutic effect, the
      quality of life and prognostic implications of the cord blood stem cell infusion on hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy, and evaluated the adverse reactions, through the neurological
      function score (NIHSS，Barthel Index), cognitive score (MoCA, MMSE),and the international
      uniform Parkinson Rating Scale score (UPDRS). Here, we seek new means for the treatment of
      hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and provide the basis for clinical for further application
      of umbilical cord blood derived Mesenchymal stem cells.

      On the basis of conventional therapy, at the same time, selected patients were given by
      intravenous infusion of umbilical cord blood stem cells 100-800 million. All patients before
      treatment, after treatment for 15days, 90days and 180 days were evaluated respectively the
      curative effect. The neurological function score (NIHSS score, Barthel Index) was observed in
      patients with the ability to live independently and prognosis; MoCA, MMSE were used in the
      evaluation of cognitive function ；UPDRS was used in the evaluation of extrapyramidal tract
      function.
