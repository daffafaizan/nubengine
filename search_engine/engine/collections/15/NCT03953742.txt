    
      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-200 in
      patients with advanced tumors

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CPI-200

        -  To evaluate clinical response and resolution of symptoms after CPI-200 treatment

        -  To characterize adverse events of CPI-200 in patients with advanced cancers

      Up to 7 dose levels of CPI-200 will be tested using an accelerated titration method followed
      by a conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design. MTD will be defined as the dose
      associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at
      the dose level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events
      occurring from the intravenous injection of CPI-200 within 21 days:

        -  All Grade 4 or greater adverse events as determined by CTCAEv5 criteria, excluding
           toxicities clearly related to disease progression or inter-current illness

        -  Any Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity with the exception of
           Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea if lasting less than 72 hours, alopecia, or Grade 3
           fatigue if lasting less than 7 days as determined by CTCAEv5 criteria

        -  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the presence of bleeding

        -  Grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia

        -  Any hematologic or non-hematologic adverse events or abnormal laboratory value(s)
           related to CPI-200 that result(s) in permanent study discontinuation of study treatment
