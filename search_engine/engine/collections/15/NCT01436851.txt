      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in sera, answering a questionnaire, and symptom scoring before and
      after provocations. The participants will be investigated one day with a placebo, and another
      day with the allergen extract of either Acarus Siro or Lepidoglyphus Destructor. As a
      measurement of nasal patency we use the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter, but also clinical
      scoring of nasal secretion and blockage. Indices of inflammation (ECP and alfa-Macroglobulin)
      will be monitored in nasal lavage.
