    
      Aim : To evaluate histologic performance and volumetric outcome of a bone substitute used in
      dentistry for guided bone regeneration procedures.

      Model : Human Socket preservation surgery with a control group of spontaneous alveolar
      healing.

      Inclusion criteria includes a class 2 or 3 (loss of at least 1/3 of the buccal bone of the
      alveolar socket) post-extraction sockets.

      Clinical Experimental Methodology :

      Atraumatic extraction of the hopeless tooth without flap retraction, after socket mechanical
      debridement , fill with 2/3 biphasic calcium sulfate cement matrix's with Hydroxyapatite (HA
      granules) and covered with a resorbable membrane.

      3 Month after a CBCT is performed for implant planning.

      At implant placement a 2 mm trephine will be used for core extraction.

      Measurements (Stl File) on the day of surgery (Baseline T0) and at implant placement (3 month
      after tooth extraction) (T1) and after delivery final crown (T2).

      Discrepancy (Trueness) Between STL Files in Teeth Adjacent to Implant will be used at T0, T1
      and T2.

      Histologic measure comprise percentage of vital bone formation, fibrous/connective tissue,
      and material remnant, in a socket preservation model

      To Measure Volumetric changes reverse engineering software (Geomagic Control X, 3D Systems)
      will be used.

      Other evaluation parameters involve radiographic Cone Beam Computer Tomography evaluation,
      primary stability, implant survival and implant success rate

      Clinical Control Methodology :

      Atraumatic extraction of the hopeless tooth without flap retraction, after socket mechanical
      debridement Measurements (Stl File) on the day of surgery (Baseline T0) and at 3 month after
      tooth extraction) (T1) Discrepancy (Trueness) Between Standard Tessellation Language Files in
      Teeth Adjacent to Implant will be used at T0 and T1
