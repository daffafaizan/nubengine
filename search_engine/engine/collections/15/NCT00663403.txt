      drug concentrations during continuous hemodialysis. The daptomycin concentration profiles
      developed from this study will assist in developing a dose recommendation that will result in
      daptomycin levels that are safe and within therapeutic ranges, as previously identified, in
      critically ill patients with acute renal failure treated with continuous hemodialysis.
