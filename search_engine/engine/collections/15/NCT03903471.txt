      lymphadenopathy. The investigators will explore the performance of two kinds of needles and
      different methods to obtain tissues via EBUS-TBNA in the study. The study is designed as a
      prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 600 patients will be expected to
      enroll in the study and randomly assigned to two groups, the 22G-ProCore group and the
      22G-Standard group. The primary aim is to compare the diagnostic yields of the two types of
      needles. The secondary endpoint is to assess the quality of histologic specimen. Meanwhile,
      stylet slow-pull or negative suction techniques and different agitations (10, 20, 30 times)
      that each pass includes will be evaluated in the study as well.
