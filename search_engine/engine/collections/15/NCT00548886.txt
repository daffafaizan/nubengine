      care procedure to treat a separate cardiac condition to participate. Patients approached will
      already have an intravenous line in place for their procedure. After consent and assent as
      necessary are obtained, the patient be brought to a separate room for the low-dose
      epinephrine infusion trial. The patient will lie down on a table, be hooked up to an EKG
      machine and the infusion will start. The amount of epinephrine actually infused is based on
      the weight of the patient but is substantially less than the dose received from an
      epinephrine auto-injection for anaphylaxis. After about 40 minutes, the trial will be
      completed and the patient may return to the waiting room for their original procedure. We
      have performed this test on a number of pediatric patients suspected of having LQTS with
      promising results and with little to no side effects. The patient will be awake for the
      procedure and will be able to verbalize concerns or complaints. A pediatric
      electrophysiologist and nurse will be present throughout the entire procedure.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if children who are infused with low amounts of
      epinephrine will also maintain their normal QT interval as it does with healthy adults. This
      study would hope to prove that low-dose epinephrine infusion trials can serve as a way of
      identifying children with LQTS so that they may be effectively treated and potentially have
      their lives saved.
