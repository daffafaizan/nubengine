      pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation were enrolled in the
      study. Patients were randomly allocated to be treated with either a) a continuous
      terlipressin infusion (1.3 µg•kg-1), b) vasopressin (0.03 U•min-1), or c) titrated
      norepinephrine (control; each n = 15). In both the terlipressin and vasopressin group,
      norepinephrine was additionally administered to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP)
      between 65 and 75 mmHg, if necessary. Data from right heart catheterization, thermo-dye
      dilution catheter, gastric tonometry as well as data from organ function, cytokines
      concentrations, were obtained at baseline and after 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours.
