    
      Patients with non-keratinizing NPC T1-4N2-3或T3-4N0-1M0 (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) are randomly
      assigned to receive induction chemotherapy or CCRT alone. Patients in experimental group
      receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1,8) and cisplatin (80mg/m² d1) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles
      before intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Patients in control group receive IMRT
      concurrently with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m² up to 7cycles.

      IMRT is given as 2.0-2.33 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks to
      a total dose of 66 Gy or greater to the primary tumor.

      Our primary endpoint is failure-free survival (FFS). Secondary end points include overall
      survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), distant failure-free survival
      (D-FFS) rates and toxic effects. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the
      intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive
      their randomly assigned treatment.
