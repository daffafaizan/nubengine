      leading cause of hospitalization > 65 years. Although effective therapies can improve
      functioning and survival in patients with systolic dysfunction, many may not be receiving the
      full benefit of existing knowledge, including counseling on self-management and appropriate
      doses of medications. Patients play a critical role in managing a chronic condition such as
      CHF, but may not have the skills to do so. Clinicians may not provide counseling or
      medications consistent with evidence-based guidelines.

      Systematic reviews of clinical-behavior change have suggested that interventions targeted to
      specific problems are more likely to be successful. Based on shortfalls identified in patient
      self-management and clinical care in Harlem, a predominately non-white area in northern
      Manhattan, we tailored a nurse-management intervention to address the problems documented,
      and evaluated its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial. This trial among
      primarily-minority patients addresses important gaps in this literature: the study targeted
      problems documented among CHF patients in Harlem, enrolled patients from ambulatory
      practices, randomly assigned patients between nurse-management and usual care, and evaluated
      their subsequent health-related outcomes. Hypothesis: the nurse-management program would
      result in nurse patients' having fewer hospitalizations and reporting better functioning.
