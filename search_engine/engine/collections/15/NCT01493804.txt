    
      Objective: To record near-infrared optical signal (NIRS) simultaneously with EEG signal and
      correlate hemodynamic and neuronal responses, and to understand brain connectivity associated
      with cognitive functions using combined EEG/NIRS technology

      Study population: 40 healthy volunteers

      Design: The study will aim to capture the dynamics of brain interactions on two different
      scales by combing EEG (neuronal) and NIRS (hemodynamic) techniques. We will then correlate
      the two responses to study the brain connectivity in a more comprehensive way.

      Outcome Measures: graded changes in blood flow and blood oxygenation, measured with NIRS,
      along with electrical signals recorded by EEG in response to different functional tasks.

      investigators or collaborators. This data may be used for a variety of research purposes. The
