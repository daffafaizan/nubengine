    
      Rhythmic movement disorder (RMD) is a childhood onset sleep disorder that is characterised by
      repetitive movements that involve large muscle groups, such as body rocking, rolling and head
      banging. These rhythmic movements are performed prior to and during sleep and as such can
      disturb sleep with clinical consequences. There is no standard measure to quantify the
      severity of rhythmic movements. 3D video offers a contactless method of achieving this
      without disrupting the child's sleep. Vestibular stimulation has a soothing effect and might
      be effective in promoting sleep. Furthermore, mild vestibular stimulation in the form of
      gentle rocking movements generated by the Somnomat device might function as a stimulation
      substitute for the child's RMD with therapeutic potential.

      This study aims to a) investigate the feasibility of the detection of episodes of RMD using
      contactless 3D video analysis and customised analysis software and b) the use of vestibular
      stimulation as a therapy for childhood rhythmic movement disorder.
