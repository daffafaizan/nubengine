      CBT（ERP）combined with tDCS over the prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in treatment of OCD patients. 60
      OCD patients whose symptom were mainly associated with "contamination/clean" will be
      randomized into two groups (i.e. ERP+active tDCS or ERP+sham tDCS stimulation). The combined
      treatment will be performed twice a week for the first two weeks. And for the next 4 week,
      the treatment for the OCD patients will be undertook once a week. There will be 8 times in
      total. The investigators will assess thhe OCD patients'symptom severity in the baseline, 2
      weeks, 4weeks and after 8 weeks of the whole combined treatment. Through the study,
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale（Y-BOCS）, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised
      (OCI-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI),
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)and side-effect
      questionnaire will be obtained by a trained investigator. The patients will also receive MRI
      scan and EEG.
