      Patients' demographic characteristics (including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, smoking,
      drinking, and education etc.), clinical characteristics (including systolic blood pressure,
      diastolic blood pressure, and lab measurements of whole blood, serum, urine etc.),
      complications, drug information at the baseline will be collected. Patients will be follow-up
      every year, the demographic and clinical characteristics, complications; drug information of
      patients will be collected at each visit. We will also record the outcome at each visit, such
      as mortality (including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality), end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD) or serum creatinine doubling. The patient survival and renal survival
      will be compared using the LN database.
