      placebo-controlled, parallel group study to compare the efficacy and safety of clonidine HCl
      MBT to placebo MBT in the prevention of severe oral mucositis (SOM) in patients with
      oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Best supportive care (BSC)
      will be allowed as per individual institutional practice with some exceptions as described in
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either
      clonidine MBT or placebo. Patients will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The
      randomization will be stratified by p16 status (positive or negative). Randomized patients
      will be required to self-apply the study drug to the gum once a day in addition to BSC. The
      first application of MBT study drug will be performed on Day 1 of the CRT regimen. Each site
      will require the patient to follow the same local practice for BSC per Multinational
      Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO)
      guidelines with some exceptions as described in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Daily,
      self-administered MBT study drug will be continued once daily for the entire duration of CRT
      treatment; defined as from Day 1 of CRT until the last day of CRT (anticipated to be
      approximately 4-8 weeks depending on the patient's prescribed CRT plan). Patients will be
      recruited sequentially into either the Phase 2b or the Phase 3 part of the study. An interim
      analysis will be conducted when Phase 2b patients have either completed their CRT or
      discontinued from the study. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the Phase 2b
      efficacy and safety data at the interim analysis and will make a recommendation on proceeding
      with the Phase 3 part of the study.
