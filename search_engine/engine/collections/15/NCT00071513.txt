      adolescents. Programs that enhance personal efficacy and social support resources may prevent
      at-risk students from developing behaviors that can lead to substance use, academic failure,
      and depression. This study will implement a skills-based program called Coping and Support
      Training for the Transition (CAST-T) as a preventive intervention for at-risk students.

      At-risk students in eighth grade will be randomly assigned to receive either CAST-T or school
      as usual. The CAST-T program will initially be delivered in twelve sessions over 6 weeks in
      the middle school setting. The program includes booster sessions, case management, structured
      home-based parent education, and support and skills training throughout the transition
      period. Participants will be assessed from the beginning of eighth grade to the end of ninth
      grade. Vulnerability to academic problems and depression will be assessed with school records
      and self-report scale scores.
