    
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive immune mediated biliary disease characterised
      by bile duct inflammation and fibrosis, and accompanying hepatic fibrosis. For patients with
      elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in particular, progressive disease is predicted, that
      currently results in a need for liver transplantation in the majority. No current medical
      therapy has as yet been shown to be effective in altering the natural history of disease. For
      this reason patients with PSC with elevated ALP values will be recruited to this study, to
      evaluate the impact of Vap-1 blockade by BTT1023, in an early phase study focused on
      biochemical efficacy and safety.

      This is an early phase study of BTT1023 in immune mediated liver disease, with the rationale
      to identify biochemical efficacy of effect (reduction in ALP) and safety, in an orphan
      disease indication for PSC that presently lacks any other medical therapy. The study design
      therefore focuses on identifying early biochemical efficacy signals to justify larger scale,
      randomised controlled studies over longer duration.
