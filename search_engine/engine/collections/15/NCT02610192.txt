      various autologous therapies for the treatment of knee OA. Differences in the processing of
      autologous therapies can yield substantial differences in the resulting output. Thus, making
      generalizations regarding the effectiveness across these autologous therapies is more
      complicated. Each autologous therapy requires independent efficacy evaluation. nSTRIDE APS
      has been shown to decrease pain, increase function and have a favorable safety profile in a
      pilot trial. Further, demonstration of the treatment effects in patellofemoral
      osteoarthritis, an important subset of knee osteoarthritis is lacking. This study will
      evaluate a population of female patients with patellofemoral osteoarthritis in which
      treatment with other modalities provides limited/short lived relief with the hope that APS
      treatment will provide and extend relief to these patients. The study will document the
      treatment effects and timeline of treatment effects for nSTRIDE APS following a single
      injection (per symptomatic knee).
