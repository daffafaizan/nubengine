    
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter and 2-part study in
      participants with advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma). Part 1 of study will be Dose Escalation phase to determine the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety and pharmacodynamic assessments and Part 2
      will be Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate 2 expansion cohorts (Cohort 2A and 2B) after the
      RP2D for JNJ-64041757 is determined in Part 1. The study will consist of a Screening Period
      (from signing of informed consent until immediately before the first dose), an open-label
      Treatment Period (from the first dose of study drug until the End-of-Treatment Visit); and a
      Post treatment Follow-up Period (after the End-of Treatment Visit until study
      discontinuation). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in part 1, antigen-specific T-cell response in
      part 2 and incidence of adverse events in both the parts will be primarily evaluated.
