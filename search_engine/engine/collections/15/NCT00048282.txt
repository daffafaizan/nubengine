      II/III Safety and Effectiveness Study of the Vaginal Microbicides BufferGel and PRO 2000/5
      Gel (P) for the Prevention of HIV Infection in Women. HPTN 035 requires an average HIV
      seroincidence rate of 5-6 percent among enrolled participants. The primary objective of the
      present study is to estimate the rates of HIV seroincidence among women targeted for
      inclusion in HPTN 035.

      Women will be enrolled in this study for 6 to 12 months. Study visits will take place
      monthly. At each visit, participants will complete a medical/menstrual history and undergo
      pregnancy testing. Each quarter, participants will undergo a structured interview about
      sexual practices and will receive HIV and STD tests, education, and counseling. Participants
      will also undergo a pelvic exam with wet mount testing for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis,
      and trichomoniasis. Colposcopic evaluations will be performed at selected sites. Pap smears
      will be performed at sites with the capacity and expertise to prepare and interpret the
      smears and provide appropriate follow-up care to participants with abnormal results.
