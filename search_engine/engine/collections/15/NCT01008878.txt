      separated into two groups.

      The interdisciplinary treatment group received interventions at our clinic for 6 months.. The
      intervention included a visit every 6 weeks including a nursing consultation (listening,
      psychological support, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure), an endocrinologist
      consultation, a nutritionist consultation (initial evaluation of food intake and
      counselling), a psychologist consultation if needed, an interactive group information session
      (to discuss the following: diet, psychological aspects associated with obesity, physical
      education, complications and pharmacological treatments of obesity), and a questionnaire on
      the individual costs of their visit.

      A control group was monitored during this 6 months by their family physician, as per usual.

      A biological assessment, questionnaires, and tests will be carried out in beginning and end
      of program: the questionnaires are to evaluate the physical activity (Sallis, Canada fitness
      survey); the quality of life (IWQOL-Lite, SF-36); the motivation (analogical visual Scales);
      knowledge (pretest and post-test); and costs. Tests to assess physical activity (6-minute
      walk test and accelerometer) will also be administered.

      After the first 6 months, both groups were followed at the obesity clinic for another 12
      months.
