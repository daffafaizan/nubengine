      Prior to the surgery, baseline blood and saliva samples will be collected. Following the
      surgery, blood and saliva samples will be collected for 48 hours. In addition, hemodynamic
      data (i.e. vital signs) will be collected for the first 48 hours. The patient data will be
      reviewed for the first 30 days for morbidity and mortality assessment.
