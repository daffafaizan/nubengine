    
      Primary Objective:

      Determine the overall safety profile of three different dose levels of AG-707 vaccination
      (with and without an adjuvant, QS-21) at 80, 240 and 400 µg compared to placebo and QS-21
      alone in HSV-2 seropositive adults.

      Secondary Objective:

      Determine immune response to AG-707 vaccination (with and without QS-21) at dose cohorts of
      80, 240, and 400 µg as compared to placebo and QS-21 alone.
