    
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoma that accounts for
      approximately 10%-20% of pediatric and adolescent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs).

      The incidence increases with age, with 37% of NHLs patients being adolescents aged. Poor
      survival has been demonstrated in adolescents and young adults compared to children with
      DLBCL. However, the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) LNH-97
      study showed that age was not a poor prognostic factor in children and adolescents with
      Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and DLBCL. A conclusion as to whether adolescent age is an independent
      risk factor has not been reached.

      At present, the preferred protocols for adolescent DLBCL patients have not been standardized.
      Adolescents with cancer have been designated as a vulnerable population, positioned between
      children and the adult population. Treatment strategies differ between adults and pediatric
      patients. The pediatric strategy for DLBCL was developed in parallel by the
      Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM) and French-American-British/Lymphomes Malins B (FAB/LMB)
      groups. The combination of rituximab plus Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, and
      Prednisone (R-CHOP) or R-CHOP-like chemotherapy regimens are the standard therapy for the
      treatment of adult patients with DLBCL. There is currently a lack of studies that have
      compared the treatment outcomes in adolescent patients with DLBCL who were administered
      pediatric or adult regimens. Hence, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics
      and prognostic factors in DLBCL patients, especially the efficacy and safety of the pediatric
      regimen (modified NHL-BFM-90) and adult regimen (R-CHOP/CHOP), between pediatric and
      adolescent DLBCL patients.
