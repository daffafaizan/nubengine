      virtual reality instruction or role-paying instruction. All students will complete
      self-reported measures of clinical decision-making and metacognitive awareness prior to
      receiving their allocated instruction. While completing allocated instruction (either virtual
      reality or role-playing), measures of diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic efficiency will be
      collected. Following virtual reality or role-playing instruction, all included subjects will
      complete post-test measures of clinical decision-making ,metacognitive awareness, and
      engagement. One week later, all included subjects will be assessed on a musculoskeletal
      objective structured clinical examination (mOSCE).
