    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with obinutuzumab and venetoclax
      in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/Richter
      transformation (RT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of atezolizumab combined with obinutuzumab and venetoclax in
      patients with CLL/SLL/RT.

      II. To determine overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), duration of
      response (DOR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negative remission rate.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To determine the overall survival
      (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine immunological and molecular features, at baseline and/or that change with
      treatment, that correlate with outcomes in patients treated with atezolizumab combined with
      obinutuzumab and venetoclax.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 2, 8,
      and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-9 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days
      3-4 of cycle 1 and on days 1-2 of cycles 2-9. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 9 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 3, patients also
      receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 14 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously IV over 4-6 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and
      15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-9 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 3-4
      of cycle 1 and on days 1-2 of cycles 2-9. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 9 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 2, patients receive
      venetoclax PO on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 25 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
