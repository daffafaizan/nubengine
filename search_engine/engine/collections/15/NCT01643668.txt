    
      You will start the conditioning regimen, which is also called the preparative regimen.
      Conditioning is done to kill more cancer cells which may remain as well as prepare your body
      for transplant. You will receive the conditioning drugs into a vein. The conditioning regimen
      consists of the following drugs: Busulfan and Clofarabine.

      While you are in the hospital you will have regular physical exams and you will be asked
      specific questions about any problems that you might be having. You will also have blood
      tests every day to look at how your bone marrow is recovering, to give possible transfusional
      support, and how to see how your liver and kidneys are functioning.

      You will receive the following drugs before and after the allogeneic stem cell transplant:
      Neupogen (G-CSF) injections, drugs to prevent infections, Tacrolimus to prevent GVHD and
      Methotrexate.

      You will have routine and regular follow-up in the transplant clinic after discharge from the
      hospital. The following will be performed at each visit:

      Physical exam to monitor your health and check for signs of GVHD, infections and any side
      effects you may be having; Blood draw for routine blood tests to measure your blood cell
      count and chemistry; Blood tests to see if the transplanted stem cells are being accepted and
      are growing in the body (engraftment); Bone marrow biopsy to see the status of the underlying
      disease (to be done around 100 days after the stem cell transplant).

      You will be asked to return to the clinic, at a minimum, for follow-up visits at 6 months, 9
      months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months after your stem cell transplant.
