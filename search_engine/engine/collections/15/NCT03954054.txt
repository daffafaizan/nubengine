      effectiveness of "Choizitaconso" by comparing 30 PWAUD following the programme with a control
      group of 60 PWAUD not following it. All 90 PWAUD are individually interviewed using
      standardized face-to-face and phone-based interviews.

      34 questions on alcohol-related harms were identified in the international literature and
      approved by the PWAUD community. The sum of these harms, considered as a measure of the
      individual "burden" related to alcohol use, will be used as principal outcome.

      Secondary outcomes are quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, craving for alcohol,
      coping strategies, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL), self-confidence to resist drinking,
      anticipated and internalized stigma, treatment self-regulation, anxiety and depressive
      symptoms, alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments and capabilities (i.e., a measure of
      wellbeing for the general adult population, used in economic evaluations).

      Primary and secondary outcomes will be collected in face-to-face and phone-based interviews
      at enrolment and 6 months after enrolment. We will use a binomial test and linear regression
      models to assess the impact of the TPE programme on changes in the principal and secondary
      outcomes, while adjusting for other correlates and confounders.

      The study's qualitative component comprises semi-structured interviews of 16 PWAUD who
      completed the TPE programme at least 6 months before the interview. Qualitative interviews
      will be analysed using thematic analysis.
