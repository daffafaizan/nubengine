      function after stroke. There has been increasing evidence suggesting that the execution of
      voluntary movement relies critically on the functional integration of the motor areas and the
      spinal circuitries. More precisely, it was suggested that the central nervous system may
      generate neural motor commands through a linear combination of spinal modules, each of which
      activates a group of muscles as a single unit (muscle synergy). The investigators hypothesize
      that descending motor cortical signals generate movements by combining and activating muscle
      synergies. With this background, the goal is to further improve the efficacy of
      rehabilitation utilizing knowledge on modular motor control. The investigators also seek to
      provide a better understanding of the links between brain activations and movements.

      The project MO-SE has three aims, one primary and two secondary. The main primary aim is to
      test whether the use of virtual reality rehabilitation based therapies are superior in terms
      of clinical efficacy to conventional therapies (randomized clinica trial, RCT). The other two
      secondary aims of the project will be accomplished with further instrumental analysis in
      sub-samples of the group of patients enrolled for the RCT.
