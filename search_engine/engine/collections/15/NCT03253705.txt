      endothelial dysfunction and/or inflammation in disease states, such as, but not limited to,
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) and other pulmonary vascular diseases, arteriosclerosis,

      transplantation, inflammatory processes and sepsis. The collection of human blood and urine
      from both research subjects and healthy volunteers is necessary for the development of
      relevant laboratory assays and protocols, and to further research studies requiring such
      evaluations. In research subjects undergoing renal replacement therapy who produce limited
      urine we may also sample ultrafiltrate as a surrogate for urine. This protocol defines in
      general terms the purposes for which blood, urine and ultrafiltrate will be collected by
      members of the NIH s Clinical Center (CC), Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD) and
      collaborating institutions and establishes general conditions under which sampling will be
      performed.
