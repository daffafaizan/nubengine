      university hospital. 20 patients who achieved the diagnostic criteria for ARDS were included.
      The patients were prospectively allocated into two groups: a standard therapy group and a
      NPPV group. Invasive mechanical ventilation indications had been determined before the study.
      Invasive ventilation was applied to those who in need of intubation, while those given
      intubation received a standard medical treatment.
