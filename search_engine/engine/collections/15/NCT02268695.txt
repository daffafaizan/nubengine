    
      The EXTREME regimen, i.e. cetuximab added to platinum (100 mg/m² every 3 weeks ) and 5FU (96h
      continuous infusion at 1000 mg/m²/day every 3 weeks) during 6 cycles of treatment and
      continued as maintenance in patients with stable disease, is currently the standard of care
      in first line recurrent metastatic HNSCC.

      From our previous experience (phase II GORTEC "TPEx" study), the TPEx regimen of 4 cycles of
      docetaxel-cisplatin-cetuximab followed by maintenance with cetuximab every 2 weeks seems more
      efficient (overall survival) compared to EXTREME regiment. Docetaxel combined with cisplatine
      (each administered at 75mg/m² every 3 weeks) also appeared more convenient than the standard
      Cisplatin-5FU-Cetuximab EXTREME regimen (4 cycles of chemotherapy instead of 6 cycles and no
      i.v. continuous infusion). Toxicity was manageable with G-CSF support. In addition the
      toxicity / efficacy profile also seems favourable as suggested by the excellent dose
      intensity achieved and the high rate of patients (78%) who were able to start maintenance
      therapy.

      Taking together all these considerations, the TPEx regimen might be a good substitute for
      EXTREME as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent metastatic HNSCC, and it is
      justified and necessary to perform a direct comparison in a randomized trial to further test
      this hypothesis.
