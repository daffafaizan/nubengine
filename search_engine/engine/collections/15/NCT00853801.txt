      Indians (12.8%), and Mexican Americans (9.5%) with 8.7% of European Americans diagnosed with
      diabetes. In addition, certain minorities also have much higher rates of diabetes-related
      complications and death, in some instances by as much as 50% more than the general
      population, highlighting that the greatest need for preventive measures are amongst ethnic
      minorities.

      The efficacy of lifestyle intervention in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes has been
      established by the Diabetes Prevention Program and other studies. The Cook County Bureau of
      Health Services, a publicly-funded healthcare system serving a primarily low-income,
      uninsured, ethnically diverse population in Chicago, IL, currently treats an estimated 40,000
      patients annually for type 2 diabetes and estimates that another 85,000 to 100,000 patients
      are at risk for developing diabetes.

      Our primary objective was to test the feasibility of integrating less intensive lifestyle
      intervention therapy into patient visits with their primary care provider to improve weight
      loss and decrease the intensity of metabolic syndrome and pre-diabetes risk factors. The site
      of the study is the General Medicine Clinic, a busy primary care outpatient site treating
      approximately 12,000 patients/year and 200 patients/day, staffed primarily by medical
      residents supervised by attending physicians.
