      disease progression and improve overall survival in Chinese participants who have newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major positive response to initial therapy
      and have not undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). This study will look at the effect of
      ixazomib has on the length of time that participants are free of disease progression and
      their overall survival. After the implementation of Amendment 8, participants who received
      placebo-matching capsules before unblinding and have not yet experienced disease progression
      will cross over to receive ixazomib.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be assigned to a single
      treatment group

      â€¢ Ixazomib

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day
      cycle, for up to 26 cycles or until documented PD or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs
      first.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is until a total of approximately up to 67 months. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic, and every 4 weeks until the next line of therapy begins for a follow-up
      assessment.
