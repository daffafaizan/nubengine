      literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and laboratory data of
      patients who were rehospitalised due to "stroke rehabilitation cause only" The patients who
      were hospitalized in the hospital between January 2015 and July 2018, according to ICD 10
      code; hemiplegia (G81), flaccid hemiplegia (G81.0), hemiplegia, unspecified (G81.9), Spastic
      hemiplegia (G81.1) scanned from the hospital database.

      There were 554 patients with these diagnoses. 9 patients of them were excluded because of the
      hemiplegic due to trauma, cancer and intracranial operation. Detailed epicrisis of 545
      patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were examined. 328 patients who did not have
      missing data were included in the study. Age, sex, hemiplegia etiology, admission season,
      hemiplegia time, hemiplegic side, 25 (OH) vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels, brunnstrom stage
      of upper extremity, lower extremity and hand Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC).

      Brunnstrom staging was used to identify motor function with 6 levels in the upper extremity
      and hand. ROM for abduction, flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation were passively
      measured. Brunnstrom staging was used to evaluate motor development, and stroke patients were
      defined as 6 stages. The flask phase without the lowest voluntary movement is considered to
      be stage 1, while the presence of isolated movements is considered to be stage 6. In the
      Brunstromm staging, upper, lower extremity and hand evaluation are performed separately.

      FAC is defined as 5 stages according to the basic motor skills required for functional
      ambulation. FAC stage 0 is used for non-functional ambulation, stage 5 is used for
      independent walking at each speed and ground.
