      studies of patients with diabetes using bone mineral density and bone markers have noted low
      bone mass and mixed results on remodeling activity. Mouse models of diabetes have suggested
      that low bone turnover is the underlying problem. Low bone turnover could lead to an
      accumulation of microdamage that is not repaired causing compromised bone strength. Low bone
      turnover has not yet been confirmed in humans. This human study is designed to elucidate the
      effect of Type 1 diabetes on 1) bone remodeling, including histomorphometric and biochemical
      measures of bone formation and resorption, and 2) on structure, including micro architectural
      arrangement of trabeculae and bone mineral density.
