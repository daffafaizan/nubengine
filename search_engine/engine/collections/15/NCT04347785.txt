      the carotid cross-clamping due to cerebral hypoperfusion. An associated risk of postoperative
      stroke incidence is also well established.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive factors associated with ND during CEA
      performed with RA. The perioperative implications of the ND were also evaluated.

      All consecutive patients from a tertiary referral center who underwent CEA for carotid artery
      stenosis (CS) and consecutive patients who presented alterations in the neurologic
      examination after ICA clamping during CEA are selected. The control patients, submitted to
      the same procedure but with no neurologic alterations, are consecutively selected.
