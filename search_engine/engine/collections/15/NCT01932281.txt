      supplementation on the determinants of human performance. Anaerobic capacity, muscle fatigue,
      the severity of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and markers of inflammation will be
      measured before and after 3 weeks of supplementation with SierraSil or placebo. There will be
      a 3 week washout period prior to the crossover to ensure SierraSil supplementation has no
      residual effect.
