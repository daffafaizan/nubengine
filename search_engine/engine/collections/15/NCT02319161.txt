      been operated under intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) in orthopedics clinics between
      January 2009 and January 2010 were retrospectively investigated. A total of 312 patients, 164
      patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 148 patients with trigger finger have been operated
      under IVRA. Out of 164 patients who have been operated due to carpal tunnel syndrome, 50
      patients in which either calcium channel blockers or beta blockers were used for treatment of
      critical blood pressure increase after tourniquet inflation and in which whole data were
      obtained, were included to the study.The patients with systolic blood pressure above to 150
      mmHg following tourniquet inflation and in which bolus dose of diltiazem 10 mg (Group I) or
      calcium channel blocker 0.5mg/kg (Group II) have been administered by intravenous route
      constituted the study groups. Demographical characteristics and hemodynamic parameters were
      recorded from the patient files.
