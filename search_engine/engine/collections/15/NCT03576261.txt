      The study participants are randomized (non-blinded) to preoperative fluid therapy
      (preoperative colloid fluid bolus at 6 ml/kg LBW, Gelofusineâ„¢, Fresenius Kabi AB, Sweden) or
      control (no preoperative fluids) before standardized TCI- induction of anesthesia. No other
      intravenous fluids before anesthesia induction.

      Preoperative screening of biventricular systolic and diastolic function of the heart and
      level of venous return is implemented by transthoracic echocardiography approximately one
      hour before preoperative fluid therapy and anesthesia induction.
