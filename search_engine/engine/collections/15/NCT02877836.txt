      studies have expanded our knowledge of the circuits underlying the clinical expression of
      several neurologic syndromes. Globus pallidus internus (GPi) Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is
      a validated technique for the treatment of 'isolated dystonia'. The efficiency of this
      therapy in 'complex dystonia', commonly associated with focal brain lesions, is limited and
      heterogeneous. Broadening indications for DBS therapy to complex DDS disorders require
      further improvement of preoperative assessment of motor circuit functional reorganization and
      white matter integrity. The efficacy of neuromodulation in these clinical syndromes is
      determined by the severity of pyramidal involvement, the interactions between
      cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits and motor network
      reorganization at the cortical level.

      The aim of the study is to identify movement-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) activation patterns in a group of dystonic patients in comparison to healthy controls
      (HC). Further analysis will assess the recruitment pattern in different patient subgroups
      defined according to clinical and radiological criteria relevant to GPi DBS eligibility
      (hyperkinetic/ hypokinetic and prepallidal/ postpallidal). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      will be applied to the assessment of the topographic distribution and severity of white
      matter lesions in the group of dystonic patients in comparison with HC.

      Further knowledge concerning motor network organization and white matter integrity after
      focal brain lesions might contribute to the understanding of this mitigated response to DBS
      and to the refinement of DBS indications and techniques in secondary dystonia
