    
      This study is designed per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for patients with
      impaired hepatic function to assess the influence of hepatic impairment on the PK and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of PSI-7977 and PSI-352938 This study will be conducted in Hepatitis C
      positive patients to ascertain whether the PD effects of PSI-7977 or PSI-352938 are similar
      to HCV-infected patients with normal hepatic function, which may allow inclusion of patients
      with cirrhosis and varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction in future clinical studies. Data
      from subjects who participated in the P2938-0212 study (PSI-352938 MAD) will be used as the
      control group. These subjects were documented non-cirrhotic subjects with normal hepatic
      function. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotypes 1-6 will be enrolled in this study.
