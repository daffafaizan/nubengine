      measurements of lutein, a carotenoid macular pigment of human retina in normal volunteers,
      with a new and novel technique of resonant Raman scattering spectroscopy. This technique is
      generally more objective than psychophysical techniques used for lutein measurements, such as
      heterochromatic flicker photometry. Raman scattering spectroscopy is non-invasive and the
      levels of ocular exposure to argon laser light used in this technique are well below the
      safety limits recommended by the American National Standards Institute.
