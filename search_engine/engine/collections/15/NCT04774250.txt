    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study is to test whether
      zonisamide (ZNS) can treat noise-induced hearing loss in police officers on the range
      following training and certifications sessions. Participants who meet the eligibility
      requirements will be randomized to receive either ZNS 100 milligrams (mg) or placebo.

      Study participants will be recruited from the Akron Police Department, Summit County Police
      Department, and other local surrounding police departments. Police officers will be offered
      participation if they are training for firearm certification as part of their standard
      occupational requirements. These are officers that would be recommended and/or required to
      complete these trainings/certifications despite this investigation and this investigation
      will have no influence on audiologic recommendations.

      After being informed about the study expectations and potential risks, all individuals
      providing written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study
      entry.
