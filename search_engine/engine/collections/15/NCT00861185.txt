      KCa3.1 in the function of several different cell types involved in the inflammatory response,
      and the effects seen in an animal model of allergic asthma, it is reasonable to explore the
      utility of senicapoc, a KCa3.1 blocker, as a novel treatment of asthma. This study will test
      the ability of senicapoc to alleviate bronchospasm induced by an exercise challenge in
      subjects with asthma. Exercise challenge studies have been conducted for many currently
      approved asthma medications. Exercise challenge studies provide a controlled environment and
      test conditions to investigate the potential usefulness of novel study drugs for the
      treatment of asthma. This study will be the first to test the ability of senicapoc to reduce
      airway bronchospasm after exercise challenge, which is one clinically important manifestation
      of asthma seen in patients. In summary, with a demonstrated safety profile across a wide
      range of doses in humans and efficacy in an animal model of allergic bronchospasm and
      hyper-responsiveness, the initiation of exploratory studies of senicapoc for treatment of
      asthma is justified.
