    
      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Hepatitis A (Live) Vaccine, Freeze-dried
      produced by Changchhun Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd, we design this randomized,
      parallel controlled study. 450 subjects are divided into 3 groups, including 1 experimental
      group and 2 control groups (Research Group 1, 2, and 3), each group assigned 150 subjects
      respectively.

      All subjects are aged 18-24 months old.

      150 subjects from Research Group 1 will be administrated with one dose of Hepatitis A (Live)
      Vaccine, Freeze-dried produced by Changchhun Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd. Blood
      samples are collected before vaccination and one month (30 days) later.

      150 subjects from Research Group 2 will be administrated with one dose of Hepatitis
      A（Live）Vaccine，Freeze-dried produced by Zhejiang Pukang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Blood samples
      are collected before vaccination and one month (30 days) later.

      150 subjects from Research Group 3 will be administrated with one dose of Hepatitis A (Live)
      Vaccine, Freeze-dried produced by Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical
      Sciences. Blood samples are collected before vaccination and one month (30 days) later.

      To evaluate the immunogenicity, we will detect and compare the seroconversion rates, and
      antibody geometric mean concentrations. The safety of all groups will be monitored as well.
