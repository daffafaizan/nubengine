      It has poor prognosis regarding its distant lymph node metastasis and local destruction which
      lead to low survival rate.

      Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic drug of the taxols group that is used in the treatment of
      lung, ovarian and prostate cancer. It is also used to treat breast, head and neck cancer as
      well as sarcoma and leukemia. Recent studies and researches explored that Paclitaxel has an
      important role in mitotic arrest activation and induction, which subsequently lead to cell
      death.

      The conventional treatment strategies such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy come
      with low levels of expectations regarding prognosis and survival rate. On the other hand,
      serious side effects of chemotherapy such as renal toxicity, gastrointestinal upset and bone
      marrow suppression remain hazards which cannot be avoided.Thus, there is a great need to
      discover new agents and strategies for treating OSCC or even enhancing the effect of
      chemotherapy in order to reduce the dose given.
