      channels to enhance topical drug delivery deep into the dermis. Combining the efficacy of
      fractional CO2 laser to laser-assisted hyaluronic acid delivery has not yet being studied,
      the combination of these two techniques could improve facial skin remodeling.

      The main endpoint will be to evaluate the efficacy of laser-assisted hyaluronic acid delivery
      by fractional CO2 laser in facial skin remodeling. The secondary endpoint will be to confirm
      the safety of this protocol compared to a standard treatment by fractional CO2 laser.
