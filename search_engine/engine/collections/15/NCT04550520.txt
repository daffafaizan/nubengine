      cumbersome. To date the test with the highest diagnostic accuracy is copeptin measurement
      after hypertonic saline Infusion.

      Instead of hypertonic saline Infusion, arginine infusion - known to stimulate growth hormone
      - is a potent stimulator of the neurohypophysis and provides a new diagnostic tool in the
      differential diagnosis of cDI. Copeptin measurements upon arginine stimulation discriminated
      patients with diabetes insipidus vs. patients with primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic
      accuracy of 94%. Glucagon has been shown to stimulate GH-secretion. In analogy to the known
      stimulatory effect of arginine Infusion it is hypothesized that glucagon might stimulate the
      posterior pituitary gland and could therefore be a novel diagnostic test in the
      polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.

      This study is to evaluate copeptin values after the subcutaneous injection of glucagon in
      adults (healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia).

      This study is planned as a double-blind randomized-controlled cross-over trial consisting of
      two parts, including healthy adults (study part 1 - proof of concept) and adults with known
      diagnosis of cDI or PP (study part 2 - pilot study). Study parts 1 and 2 will be conducted
      consecutively. If the results of study part 1 suggest that glucagon is a potent stimulator of
      Copeptin in healthy adults, study part 2 will be conducted. Participants will receive
      glucagon injection and placebo injection in random order.
