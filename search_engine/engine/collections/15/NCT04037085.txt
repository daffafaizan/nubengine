      strategies focused on minimizing or eliminating opioids are lacking. In the non-obstetric
      surgical population, modalities such as intravenous ketamine are well-recognized as effective
      adjuncts in opioid-reduction strategies for postoperative pain. Although there have been some
      studies of ketamine exposure in postpartum women without deleterious outcomes noted, these
      studies in pregnant and lactating women are limited by a lack of information on maternal
      pharmacokinetics, breastmilk secretion, and clinical effectiveness when used with standard
      multimodal analgesic approaches. There is also a lack of information on intermediate and
      long-term outcomes in this setting. This two-part trial will address these knowledge gap by
      advancing understanding of the safety and efficacy of ketamine and its metabolites in
      peripartum populations.
