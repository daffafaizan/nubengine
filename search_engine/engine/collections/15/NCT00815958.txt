      reaming with either the Synthes RIA (intervention group) or standard reamer (control group).
      All subjects will undergo intraoperative monitoring with transesophageal echocardiography and
      transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Both intraoperative and postoperative oxygen saturation
      levels will be monitored and recorded for evidence of hypoxemia. Subjects will be evaluated
      for evidence of thrombogenesis and systemic inflammation both preoperatively and at selected
      postoperative intervals.
