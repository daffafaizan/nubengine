      enrolled in this study. Prior to enrollment, patients are required to be evaluated by an
      experienced thoracic surgeon, radiation oncologist or medical oncologist to determine
      operability. Patients will udergo computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography
      (PET) prior to EBUS- TBNA. EBUS-TBNA will be performed at the Interventional Thoracic Surgery
      Suite (ITSS) located at Toronto General Hospital by a Thoracic Surgeon. The procedure will be
      performed under local anesthesia with conscious sedation. Mediastinal as well as hilar lymph
      nodes will be assessed by EBUS-TBNA. The result of pathological diagnosis using EBUS-TBNA
      will be compared with the result of radiological staging (CT and PET-CT). Patients who are
      negative for mediastinal lymph node metastasis by EBUS-TBNA will undergo SBRT. In addition,
      the treatment outcome will be evaluated based on the clinical chart review.
