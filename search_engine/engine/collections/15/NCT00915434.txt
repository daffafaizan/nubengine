    
      This is an open-label (both the physician and healthy volunteer know which treatment will be
      administered), randomized (treatment order determined by chance), single-dose study to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (process by which JNJ-31001074 is absorbed, distributed,
      metabolized, and eliminated by the body) and effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      JNJ-31001074. The study consists of three phases: a screening phase to determine eligibility,
      an open-label treatment phase and an end-of-study/early withdrawal assessment phase. During
      the screening phase, healthy volunteers will be evaluated to see if they meet selection
      criteria as specified in the protocol. Healthy volunteers who meet these criteria will report
      to the study center on Day -1 to begin treatment. The open-label treatment phase will consist
      of 4 periods. In each period, volunteers will receive one of the following treatments:
      Treatment A 1 mg JNJ-31001074, Treatment B 3 mg JNJ-31001074, Treatment C 10 mg JNJ-31001074,
      and Treatment D 10 mg JNJ-31001074. Treatment A, B and C will be administered under fasting
      conditions (no food or beverages for 10 hours prior to dosing) and Treatment D will be
      administered after a high-fat meal. The order in which volunteers will receive each treatment
      will be determined in a random fashion (like flipping a coin). Each treatment will be
      separated by a 7-14 day washout period. Multiple blood and urine samples will be collected
      for 72 hours after each dose. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the
      volunteer's participation. Volunteers will be instructed to report any adverse events that
      occur up to 30 days after their last dose of study drug. The maximum study duration for each
      volunteer is expected to be 66 days. JNJ-31001074 1, 3 or 10 mg will be administered orally
      on Day 1 of each of the 4 treatment periods (dose depends on participant's treatment
      sequence)
