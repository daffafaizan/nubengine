      resectable pancreas cancer.

      This study is a multicenter prospective randomized phase II/III study of neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation with gemcitabine in patients with borderline resectable pancreas cancer. The
      study is designed in 2 arms, one with upfront surgery and the other with neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation therapy.

      This phase 2/3 multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed to enroll 110 patients
      with BRPC who were randomly assigned to gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation
      treatment (54 Gray external beam radiation) followed by surgery or upfront surgery followed
      by chemoradiation treatment from four large-volume centers in Korea. The primary endpoint was
      the 2-year survival rate (2-YSR). Interim analysis was planned at the time of 50% case
      enrollment.
