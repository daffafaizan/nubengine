        -  Assess the effectiveness of high-dose dexamethasone after whole-brain radiotherapy in
           maintaining response and preventing recurrence in elderly patients with primary central
           nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Assess the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the survival rate of patients after this regimen.

        -  Identify the anatomic rates of recurrence and frequency of systemic involvement in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Identify the factors that appear to be associated with outcome in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) daily 5 days a week for 4.5 weeks.
      Beginning 30 days after WBRT is completed, patients receive high-dose dexamethasone IV on
      days 1-5 during course 1 and on day 1 only during all subsequent courses. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month after radiotherapy, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.
