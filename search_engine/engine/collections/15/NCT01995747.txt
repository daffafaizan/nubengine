      function of h4b12, a humanized mAb specific for mIgE+ B cells, and compare the effects of
      h4B12, Omalizumab, and Rituxumab on the suppression of IgE production and the number of
      IgE-producing plasma cells. These blood specimens will be collected from 50 patients of
      atopic dermatitis or urticaria with high serum IgE levels. Fountain Biopharma will carry out
      the following two in vitro assays to measure the efficacy of h4B12:

        -  IgE ELISA to determine the concentration of IgE.

        -  IgE ELISPOTto determine the number of IgE-producing plasma cells.
