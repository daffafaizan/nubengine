    
      Patients of 60 years or older who present a mandibular fracture will be enrolled in this
      registry. All patients will be treated (surgical or non-surgical) and followed up according
      to the local standard (routine) of care at around 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months
      after treatment.

      Data collection will include patient and fracture details, treatment details, functional,
      clinical and patient-reported outcomes and anticipated or procedure- and implant-related
      adverse events (i.e. complications). Radiographs and/or other images (e.g. CT scan) taken as
      per standard of care will be collected within the registry.

      Primary objectives are to obtain epidemiological data and describe the most common mandibular
      fracture patterns in older patients, to explore the relationship(s) between the treatment of
      mandibular fractures and its outcome in older patients, to identify risk factors and
      initiating factors of elderly related to mandible fracture events and to describe concomitant
      fractures associated with mandibular fractures in older patients.
