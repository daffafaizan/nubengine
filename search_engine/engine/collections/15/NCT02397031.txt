      interpersonal effectiveness skills (IE) on borderline symptoms. For that purpose, a
      randomized, active-controlled clinical trial was designed. 64 participants with borderline
      personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis were allocated to mindfulness (n=32) or interpersonal
      effectiveness skills (n=32). Both interventions were delivered over a 10-week period. The
      borderline symptom list (BSL-23) was elected as the primary outcome measure. Mindfulness
      related capacities, decentering and cognitive processing of social interactions were also
      evaluated with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Experiences Questionnaire
      (EQ) and the Multidimensional Scale of Social Expression (EMES-C), respectively. Assessments
      were conducted pre and post interventions.
