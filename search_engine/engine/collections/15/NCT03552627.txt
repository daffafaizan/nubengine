      annually, and a large number of these also have co-morbid respiratory diseases such as Asthma
      or COPD. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently recommended that all surgical patients
      receive 80% O2 throughout GA and for 6 hours in recovery to reduce Surgical Site Infections
      (SSIs). However, a recent Cochrane systematic review found no evidence of benefit from this
      approach and some evidence that harm could be increased (including mortality).

      Excess oxygen has been associated with worse outcomes in many areas of medicine (including
      acute respiratory illnesses), possibly due to increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
      production: ROS can cause oxidative stress and damage proteins, DNA, and lipids.
      Observational data from our group shows most surgical patients currently receive nearer 55%
      O2 under GA. The effect of intraoperative O2 concentration on other surgical outcomes remains
      unknown.

      This project will determine whether giving lower concentrations of oxygen to surgical
      patients during anaesthesia can reduce levels of oxidative stress during surgery
      (particularly in the lungs); investigate how this affects other organs; and evaluate the
      feasibility of performing a large (multi-centre) effectiveness study to define 'safe' oxygen
      administration concentrations during surgery.

      Patient undergoing elective major surgery will be randomised to receive 80% (WHO's
      recommendation); 55% (current usual care) or 30% oxygen (intervention) throughout
      anaesthesia. Endotracheal aspirates will be sampled along with paired central venous and
      arterial blood samples throughout surgery to monitor levels of oxidative stress and organ
      function. Patients will be followed up for 7 days after surgery.
