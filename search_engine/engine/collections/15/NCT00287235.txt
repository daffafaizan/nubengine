      receive either SMT or SMT plus five days MARSÂ® treatment. The trial design called for
      patients to receive a baseline hepatic encephalopathy (HE) assessment on admission, and at
      12-hour intervals, giving 10 HE measurements during treatment using a refinement / adaptation
      of the Conn West Haven HE Criteria HE scoring system
