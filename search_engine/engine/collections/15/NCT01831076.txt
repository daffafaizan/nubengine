      the preoperative treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+ or PR+ tumors. This trial is also
      designed to develop a predictive model to correlate expression of the known isoforms of ER
      and progesterone receptor (PR) and the aromatase enzyme with response to estrogenic
      deprivation using exemestane.
