      targets based on the location, timing, barriers, and facilitators of current physical
      activity and sedentary behavior in a child's day. The project will be a prospective
      examination of 340 African American and White girls and boys aged 10 to 16 years, including
      50% who are classified as severely obese. State-of-the-art technology will be used including
      accelerometry to quantify physical activity, magnetic resonance imaging to quantify fat
      accumulation, and geographic position system and ecological momentary assessment to identify
      environmental and socio-emotional barriers and facilitators. In further detail, this study
      will examine the following objectives:

      Objective 1: Determine the effect of severe obesity on physical activity, sedentary behavior,
      and cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood and adolescence and whether these
      associations are modified by race.

      Objective 2: Investigate the contribution of (total, regional, and depot-specific) fat
      accumulation on changes in physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cardiometabolic risk
      factors during childhood and adolescence.

      Objective 3: Determine barriers and facilitators of physical activity that are related to
      obesity, including environmental and socio-emotional factors.
