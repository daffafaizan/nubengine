      compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) in: reducing alcohol use below established risk levels;
      increasing consistent use of effective contraception; increasing engagement in smoking
      cessation treatment and increasing smoking cessation. In addition, our examination of the
      incremental costs of the ChoicesPlus intervention (e.g., staff time, materials,
      administrative services, total medical charges pre- and post-intervention) will provide a
      basis for future cost/benefit analyses that will inform policymakers and healthcare
      organizations of the potential benefits of implementing ChoicesPlus. Results from this study
      will inform and advance future efforts in the service of promoting healthy prenatal behavior
      and reducing the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco-exposed pregnancies.
