      schizoaffective disorder or unspecified nonorganic psychosis, aged 18-56 years, were given
      22-24 weekly or twice weekly sessions of a manualized group treatment for improvement of
      social cognition, Social Cognition and Interaction Training (1,2). Main outcome was defined
      as improvement in social cognition according to specific measures of facial emotion
      identification, Theory of Mind, attributional bias, social cognitive accuracy and
      metacognitive overconfidence.Emotion perception was measured with the Facial Emotion
      Identification Task (FEIT) (3); Theory of Mind was measured with the Hinting Task (4) and
      attributional bias with the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire-Ambiguous Items
      (AIHQ-A) (5). In addition, broad-based social cognitive accuracy, attributional bias and
      metacognitive overconfidence was measured with the Social Cognition Screening Questionnaire.
      All the measures were evaluated at the baseline and immediately after the intervention.
      Changes in total scores for the FEIT and Hinting Task, and the three subscales of AIHQ-A and
      SCSQ were analysed separately using paired samples t-test in IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.
