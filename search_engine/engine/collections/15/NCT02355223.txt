      effective treatment, but from unsuspected cases, and cases with unsuspected drug resistance.
      This study seeks to investigate the implementation of a refocused TB transmission control
      approach that we call FAST (Find cases Actively based on cough surveillance, Separate
      temporarily, and Treat effectively based on molecular drug-susceptibility testing [DST]). We
      will conduct this study at Hospital Nacional Hip√≥lito Unanue in Lima, Peru. Our hypothesis is
      that FAST will reduce delays in identifying infectious TB patients (and unsuspected drug
      resistance) entering the hospital, facilitate timely effective therapy, and thereby reduce
      the risk of TB transmission in a cost-effective manner. We will assess the impact of FAST on
      TB transmission by evaluating IGRA conversions among health care workers at the intervention
      site, Hospital Nacional Hipolito Unanue (HNHU), and two control sites, Hosptial Nacional
      Arzobispo Loayza (HNAL) and Hospital Nacional Sergio Bernales (HNSB). We will also evaluate
      acceptability and barriers to/facilitators of FAST, novel screening strategies, and health
      care worker IGRA testing using a mixed methods approach.
