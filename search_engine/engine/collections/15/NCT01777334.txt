    
      This is a Phase IIIb multicenter, randomized, double-dummy, parallel group study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg) when administered
      once-daily via a novel dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared with tiotropium (18 mcg)
      administered once-daily via the HandiHaler over a treatment period of 24 weeks in subjects
      with COPD. Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25
      mcg), or tiotropium (18 mcg) for 24 weeks.

      There will be a total of 10 study clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects
      who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will complete a 7- to 10-day run-in
      period followed by a 24-week treatment period. Clinic visits will be at Screening,
      Randomization (Day 1), Day 2 and after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks, and 1 day after the
      Week 24 visit (Visit 1 to Visit 10, respectively). Additionally a safety Follow-Up assessment
      will be conducted either by phone call or clinic visit where required approximately 7 days
      after the end of the study treatment (Visit 10 or Early Withdrawal, if applicable). The total
      duration of subject participation, including the Follow-Up will be approximately 26 weeks.
