    
      Aim 1: Initiate a targeted ED-based PrEP screening program and optimize its feasibility and
      acceptability.

      1a Behavioral risk factor eligibility screening will be performed using the ICAP Pre-Exposure
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) Screening for Substantial Risk and Eligibility tool.

        1. b During a 3-month period, use continuous quality improvement methods to decrease the
           time for completion of PrEP eligibility screening to an interval that is acceptable to
           ED patients and providers.

           Aim 2: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Provision in the ED (PrEPPED) Trial: Identify 40 PrEP
           eligible patients over a 12-month period who are interested in initiating PrEP in the
           ED. These patients will be offered immediate PrEP (iPrEP) initiation in the ED with
           facilitated linkage to comprehensive out-patient care.

        2. a Evaluate the impact of a PrEP "starter pack" on patients agreeing to iPrEP. The
           primary outcome is engagement in care at 30-days post PrEP initiation visit. Secondary
           outcomes include retention in care, STI diagnosis, risk behavior and PrEP adherence.

      2b Collect data on recruitment and attrition rates, as well as means and standard deviations
      for key measures that will be needed to plan a definitive trial of ED-initiated PrEP.
