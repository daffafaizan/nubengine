      Primary

        -  Evaluate the response rate in patients with previously untreated cancer of unknown
           primary treated with the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and everolimus.

      Secondary

        -  Assess time to progression, overall survival, duration of response, and time to
           treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine adverse events of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Perform descriptive correlative studies to determine response of specific tumor types,
           identified by the Origin-FFPE test, to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Patients also receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients' tumor tissue samples from the most recent biopsy are analyzed for correlative
      studies, including gene expression profiling by Origin-FFPE test.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease
      progression, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
