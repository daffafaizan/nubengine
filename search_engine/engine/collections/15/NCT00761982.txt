    
      The proposed trial will involve the recruitment of a total of 20 patients.

      The cells will be collected from ten subject recruited as cases, via bone marrow sampling.
      The aspirate will be centrifuged on a Ficoll density gradient to isolate mononuclear cells,
      which will be resuspended in heparinized isotonic saline for infusion into the area of the
      stroke intra-arterially using the middle cerebral artery.

      The investigators will monitor each case and control for a period of 6 months post-stem cell
      infusion. Initially, they will be subjected to a review after one month,three months and
      finally 6 months.

      Assessment of adverse events will be by physical examination and measurement of laboratory
      parameters. Assessment of efficacy will be by physical examination and the measurement of
      laboratory, CT and MRI parameters.
