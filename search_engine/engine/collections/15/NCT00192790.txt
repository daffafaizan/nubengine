      without pain experience. The lack of pain alarm leads to increased morbidity and mortality,
      because the patients do not sick timely medical treatment. This study aims to explore whether
      reduced systemic pain perception in response to painful stimuli and personality pain related
      variables characterizes silent MI patients.

      Methods: Level of chest pain intensity was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), range
      from 0 (no pain) to 100 (maximal pain). Heat pain threshold, magnitude estimation of
      supra-threshold painful stimuli at 47ºC as well as pain catastrophizing scores were assessed
      in 90 acute MI patients (mean age 66±12.1, range 33-79) with chest pain (n=65) and without
      pain symptoms(n=25). All stimuli were performed by Thermal Sensory Analysis (TSA) and applied
      to the right forearm.

      Results: The demographic variables, history of ischemic heart, risk factors for coronary
      artery disease, ST-T segment changes on ECG and troponin levels were similar in both groups.
      Greater intensity of chest pain VAS scores was inversely correlated with lower pain threshold
      (r= -0.417, p<0.001), and directly associated with higher pain scores in response to the heat
      pain (r=0.354, p=0.002). Patients with painful MI demonstrated lower pain threshold (41.9±3.6
      vs. 44.9±3.8, p=0.001), higher VAS scores in response to the supra-threshold painful stimuli
      (50.2 ±21.8 vs. 27.0±25.2, p=0.002), and higher catastrophizing level (10.6±12.0 vs. 5.4±8.8,
      p=0.032). Chest pain complaint was not related to ST-T changes as well as concomitant
      diseases.

      Conclusions: This study suggests that reduced systemic pain perception as well as cognitive
      personality variables play an important role in the etiology of Silent MI.
