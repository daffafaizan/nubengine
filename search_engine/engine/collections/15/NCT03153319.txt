    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center
      study followed by open-label phase, to evaluate the effects of adalimumab compared to placebo
      on the change from baseline in joint and skeletal disease in children and adults with
      mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I or II. Children and adults diagnosed with MPS I or II, with
      significant joint restrictions and pain will be randomized to adalimumab treatment or placebo
      treatment for the first 16 weeks. This will be followed by a 32-week open label adalimumab
      treatment phase.
