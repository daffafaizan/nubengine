      The most common postoperative complication is transitory hypocalcemia. Some studies have
      reported that preoperative vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a risk factor for hypocalcemia after
      total thyroidectomy (TT) in patients with non toxic multinodular goiter or graves's disease.
      Although the association between VVD and postoperative hypocalcemia in thyroid cancer
      patients undergoing TT plus central compartment neck dissection (CCND) remains unclear. This
      prospective study evalue the inflence of pre operative vit D3 administration on post
      operative hypocalcemia in patients undergoing TT.
