      with regular menstrual cycles. Patients will meet at least four of the criteria of the
      American Colleges of Rheumatology for classification of SLE. Disease activity will be
      determined by SLE disease activity index called SLEDAI scores. Patients can take meds to
      control their disease, but none will be able to take birth control pills/patches, or hormone
      replacement at the time of the study. The pharmacy will be in control of the blind and 10
      will get ICI 182,780 (Faslodex) and 10 will get placebo. Lab will be drawn before each
      injection and a bone density will be done on injection 1 and 12, the injections will be
      monthly, depending on the female's cycle. A visit will be done at month 15 to evaluate
      SLEDAI, and draw lab as well. Each vs will have a SLEDAI done with the clinical evaluation.
      The injection is 250mg/5cc, which is divided into 2 injections of 2.5cc each, given IM, on
      day 4-10 of each cycle.
