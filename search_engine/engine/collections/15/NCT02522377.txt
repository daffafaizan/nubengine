    
      The study will compare the effects of standard ketamine dosing with an active placebo arm.

      Hypothesis 1:

      The investigators hypothesize that interleaved Electroconvulsive Treatment and active
      ketamine treatment will lead to a meaningful clinical improvement compared to
      Electroconvulsive Treatment and placebo treatment arm.

      Hypothesis 2:

      The investigators hypothesize that interleaved Electroconvulsive Treatment and active
      ketamine treatment will attenuate cognitive side effects.

      Methods and Design:

      Patients with treatment resistant depression who are deemed to be eligible for
      Electroconvulsive Treatment will randomly be assigned to either ketamine or active placebo

      Electroconvulsive Treatments:

      All patients (independent of their depression scores) will receive the same Electroconvulsive
      Treatment parameters: Bi-frontal brief pulse (0.5 miliseconds) Electroconvulsive Treatment
      administered by using Thymatron Electroconvulsive Treatment machine.

      Study blinding:

      Neither the patients, nor the treating psychiatrist or the nurse will be aware of the
      patient's assigned arm. The success of blinding will be tested after each ketamine treatment
      with a questionnaire given to the subject, raters, and treating physician.
