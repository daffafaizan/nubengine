      weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years postoperatively. The research coordinator at
      each site will identify, recruit, and prospectively follow the 60 patients at his/her site.
      Patient demographics (e.g., age, gender, body mass index (BMI)), comorbidities, reason for
      revision, Paprosky classification, native femoral head measurement (mm) etc. will be
      collected preoperatively. The study coordinator will contact patients prior to each visit to
      ensure patient compliance. At each visit, A-P and cross-lateral radiographic evaluation
      (i.e., use of Engh classification to quantify osteolysis/loosening) will occur. In addition,
      patients will be assessed for any complications (e.g., dislocation, emergency department
      visits, infection, reoperation, etc.). Patients will complete the Hip disability and
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) and Veterans Rand 12 (VR-12) forms (including a specific
      question regarding groin pain) and a pain assessment. In the event that a patient has
      relocated and/or refuses to return to the office for the 5-year visit, a script will be sent
      to the patient to have x-rays done and sent to the PI, and questionnaires will be mailed. All
      data will be entered and maintained in RedCap.
