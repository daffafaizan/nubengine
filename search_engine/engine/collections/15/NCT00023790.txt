        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4) when
           administered with a fixed dose of light in patients with advanced cutaneous
           malignancies.

        -  Determine the MTD of the light when administered with a fixed dose of study drug in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of Pc 4 in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4) IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by light
      therapy over 30-60 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats in 6 weeks for a total of 2 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Pc 4 and a fixed dose of light until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Pc 4 is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding
      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD for Pc 4 is
      determined, additional patients are treated with a fixed dose of Pc 4 (2 dose levels below
      the MTD) and escalating doses of light until the MTD is determined. The MTD of light is
      defined as above.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks (or 8 weeks if treated lesion on lower extremity has not
      healed) and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study annually.
