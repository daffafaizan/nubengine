    
      Primary Aim: To conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of autologous CTL-mediated immunotherapy
      in a homogeneous group of patients with AML who have recently received an autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Specifically:

      Phase 1: To determine the MTD of autologous AML-reactive cultured CTL in patients with AML
      who have recently received an AHSCT.

      Phase 2: To determine 1 year progression-free survival of the study group vs institutional
      historical control group composed of a sequential series of recent patients who have received
      an AHSCT for AML.
