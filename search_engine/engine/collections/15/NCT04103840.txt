      in Liver intensive Care Unit (LICU) Male or Female medical wards or coming to follow up in
      Liver clinic of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India
      from will be screened for enrolment after ethical approval from the institute ethics
      committee. Both previously compensated and decompensated patients will be enrolled in this
      prospective observational pilot study. All patients will be followed up at 30 and 90 days
      from inclusion into the study.

      Estimation of sample size Sample size will be estimated based on previous studies. This is a
      pilot prospective observational study. Based on currently available data from our centre on
      acute-on chronic liver failure, 22.5% of cirrhotics have suspected IFI, and up to 25% of SAH
      have suspicion for IFI, it is estimated that a total sample size of 60 patients would be
      required, with an effect size of 0.5, alpha 0.05, and power 0.85. Therefore, 80 patients will
      be required to enroll to account for 15% attrition. Hence, we propose to enroll 80
      consecutive patients with SAH with 80 matched controls from their family starting from 15th
      August 2019.
