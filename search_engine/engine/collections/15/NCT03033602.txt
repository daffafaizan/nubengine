    
      The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate if a brief, written intervention
      for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Written Exposure Therapy (WET), is equally
      efficacious as an evidenced-based behavioral therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognition
      only (CPT-C), in the treatment of PTSD in active duty military men and women with a diagnosis
      of PTSD who have deployed in support of a post-9/11. The primary study outcome will be change
      in symptom severity as assessed by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual-5 edition (CAPS-5). Independent assessors will evaluate participants using
      the CAPS-5 at baseline, 10- (post-treatment), 20-, and 30-week intervals after the start of
      treatment.
