      (Association Française de Pédiatrie Ambulatoire) were involved in this survey.To belong to
      the PARI network, pediatricians have to use the same software, Axi5-Infansoft (developed by
      CompuGroup Medical, Nanterre, France) for electronic medical record of children. The
      pediatricians were trained to the use of point of care tests and to the infectious diagnoses
      (otitis, pharyngitis, varicella, bronchiolitis, influenza, pneumonia, etc..). The study
      population consisted of all children under 16 years of age from the patient population for
      which an infectious disease was diagnosed.
