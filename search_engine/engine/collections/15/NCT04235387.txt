      During robotic assisted procedures, the intraabdominal pressures are usually higher than in
      standard laparoscopic operations which can pose a risk of cardiovascular and respiratory
      adverse effects. The aim of this study is to investigate the haemodynamic and ventilatory
      effects of robotic assisted prostatectomy, compared to standard laparoscopic prostatectomy.
