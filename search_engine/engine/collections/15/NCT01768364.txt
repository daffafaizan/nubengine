      14 days. This stent is removed cystoscopically and today this is done without giving
      antibiotics. Some patients get urinary tract infections subject to this. However the
      investigators do not know how many of these patients get UTI as most are followed by their
      primary care doctor. With this study the investigators would like to find out whether it is
      possible to avoid such infections and also find out how many actually do get infected.
