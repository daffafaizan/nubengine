    
      Historically, testing and treatment for hepatitis C has been confined to centralised
      laboratories and tertiary hospitals respectively. Recent advancements in point-of-care
      testing for hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA/VL) and treatment options with the
      introduction of direct acting antivirals allows for testing and treatment to occur in
      de-centralised primary care settings.

      This study is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study to assess the feasibility,
      acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a de-centralised approach to hepatitis
      C testing and treatment at community-based clinics in Yangon, Myanmar. Generalist doctors
      trained in hepatitis C treatment will prescribe direct acting antiviral therapy to eligible
      participants.

      The study will utilise SD Bioline HCV RDT and Cepheid GeneXpert HCV VL test; and
      sofosbuvir/daclatasvir to treat hepatitis C. Test of cure will be performed at 12 weeks
      post-treatment completion to assess sustained virological response (SVR).
