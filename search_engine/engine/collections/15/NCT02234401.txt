    
      Design: The study will use a mixed methodology and it will be in 2 phases. Phase I A group
      randomised controlled trial

      The following measurements will be performed on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and twice weekly until
      discharge:

      The exact timing of measurements will be planned by the participant and the researcher.

      All of the outcome measures form part of routine clinical practice except the symptom scoreÍ¾
      the Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptoms Diary (CFRSD V2.0) (Goss et al., 2009)

        1. Early morning and day time carbon dioxide (CO2) level.

        2. Day time oxygen levels

        3. Lung function Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity
           (FVC)

        4. Day time resting Respiratory Rate (RR), Heart Rate (HR)

        5. Symptom score CFRSD

      Phase II A qualitative exploration of the experience of using NIV for adults with Cystic
      Fibrosis during an acute exacerbation

      Methods: Prior to discharge a semistructured interview designed to explore the experience of
      using noninvasive ventilation will be undertaken by a clinical psychologist from the Cystic
      Fibrosis multidisciplinary team. The interviews will be undertaken purely for the research
      project, recorded and transcribed verbatim by the lead investigator. Thematic analysis will
      be undertaken to interpret and explore the individual's experience. Credibility checking of
      interpretation will be undertaken by the clinical psychologists and within academic
      supervision sessions.
