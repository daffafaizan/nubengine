      Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Research indicates that approximately half of veteran
      suicides take place within 1 month of the decedent's final VHA encounter, with one quarter
      occurring within 1 week. This provides a temporal window of opportunity to intervene, and
      necessitates development of a rapid-acting treatment for veterans with SI. Uridine shares
      similar brain mechanisms and neural effects with ketamin and lithium, treatments commonly
      used to reduce suicidal ideation. This study will test the novel intervention uridine as a
      rapid-acting oral treatment for veterans with suicidal ideation. The purpose of this study is
      to investigate whether uridine can decrease suicidal ideation in veterans when taken daily
      for 4 weeks.

      In addition to treatment with the investigational drug versus placebo, the study includes a
      translational neuroimaging component: magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) brain scans
      are performed at baseline, and then repeated following 1 week of treatment with uridine or
      placebo. The scans do not use radiation, and are performed on a 3 Tesla MRI system that is
      approved for clinical use. The scans allow researchers to measure the concentrations of
      several chemicals in the brain that are may be involved in suicidal ideation.
