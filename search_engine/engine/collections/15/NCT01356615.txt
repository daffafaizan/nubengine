      clinical efficacy of Clexane (enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi-Aventis) with unfractionated heparin
      in 27 chronic HD patients. Group A received Clexane (enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi-Aventis) and
      were followed up for 3 months and then crossed over to Unfractionated heparin for a further
      3-month period. Group B received Unfractionated heparin first and then crossed over to
      Clexane, each followed up for 3 months. Heparin anticoagulation, clinical clotting and
      hemorrhage were evaluated by visual inspection after blood draining of the air trap.
