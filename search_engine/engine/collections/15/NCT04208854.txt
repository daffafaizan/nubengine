      metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The introduction of the oral formulation of
      vinorelbine has determined a further impulse to its use in 1st line and above all to its use
      as "metronomic" therapy. Metronomic chemotherapy offers the advantage of increasing the
      overall dosage of the drug administered, but reducing the side effects or making them more
      easily manageable; it is practically a question of administering fractionated doses of the
      drug continuously for long periods (generally up to the progression of unacceptable disease
      or toxicity). This study collects data on the efficacy and tolerability of oral metronomic
      vinorelbine in elderly patients with NSCLC, performed as per normal clinical practice.
