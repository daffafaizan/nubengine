      safety and performance of a Class III medical device (GreenBone Implant) for iliac crest
      reconstruction following bone graft harvesting for pelvic fusion. During pelvic fusion a
      considerable part of the iliac crest is removed and it is used as autologous bone graft for
      the fusion of the pubis symphysis. The bone defect that is formed in the iliac crest is
      usually filled with bone obtained from the cows (bovine xenograft) and or human donors
      (allograft). This carries the risk of transferring disease from animals and/or humans to the
      patient; there is also a risk of host local allergic reaction. Bone substitutes are devoid of
      the above risks and therefore they could be used alternatively to xenografts and allografts.

      GreenBone is a ceramic resorbable bone scaffold that has very similar structure to bone. It
      can be produced in large quantities, shaped easily and sterilised without losing its
      properties. Consequently, it is an ideal substitute that could be used to fill bone defects.
      This study will assess the safety of using GreenBone to reconstruct iliac crest defects.
      Moreover it will assess its capacity of promoting new bone formation. The investigators will
      recruit 15 patients who will undergo pelvic fusion and instead of bovine xenograft the
      investigators will use the GreenBone implant for the iliac crest reconstruction.

      Patients will be followed up for 6 months in total. Safety will be evaluated by monitoring
      local and potential systemic reactions; its bone forming capacity will also be assessed by
      its integration into the iliac crest.
