      with deep navels and poor personal hygiene. It is being diagnosed and reported more
      frequently; however, there is still no consensus regarding its best treatment options.

      Presentation of cases: In this report, we present two cases of UPS, one in a man and one in a
      woman who had typical symptoms with pain, swelling and intermittent malodorous discharge from
      the umbilicus. They had small sinus openings with hair protruding deep in the navel. Because
      patients had previous history of failed conservative treatments an umbilicus preserving
      surgery was performed for both cases.
