      anti-cataplexy effect in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

      The objective of this POC study are firstly to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety
      of escalating doses of BF2.649 and BF2.649 add on Modafinil (200 mg/day) on cataplexy
      attacks, and secondly to evaluate the additive/synergistic effect and safety of the
      combination of BF2.649 and Modafinil on EDS as assessed by both of objective and subjective
