      failure (CHF) treated with ambrisentan for 16 weeks will have improved hemodynamics,
      increased exercise capacity and improved functional class with an acceptable safety profile,
      compared with placebo treated patients.

      Objectives: to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan treatment in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension due to diastolic CHF. Efficacy will be assessed by improvement in
      hemodynamics (PVR(Pulmonary Vascular Resistance): primary efficacy endpoint), six minute walk
      distance (6MWD), World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and quality of life after
      16 weeks of treatment with ambrisentan. Safety of ambrisentan will be compared to placebo.

      Concomitant Medication: Treatment with standard medications for CHF including diuretics and
      optimal blood pressure control with antihypertensive medications will be allowed throughout
      the study period. Diuretics adjustment will also be allowed and encouraged based on the
      planned diuretic management protocol. Approved medications for CHF in general are allowed as
      well, though it should be noted that there are no medications shown to have benefit in
      diastolic CHF. Patients may not be on an endothelin antagonist or sildenafil.
