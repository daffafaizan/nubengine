      disease (CKD) patients with direct impacts on their metabolic and clinical outcomes. Existing
      evidence and the investigator's preliminary data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is a
      key underlying mechanism of sarcopenia in CKD. However, the ability of treatments to modify
      mitochondrial functioning in CKD patients is unknown. Coenzyme Q10 (coQ10) and nicotinamide
      riboside (NR) are naturally occurring supplements that reduce oxidative stress and restore
      substrate delivery to mitochondria, respectively.

      Both processes have the potential to increase mitochondrial energy production with direct
      consequences for many metabolic and physical processes, including:

        -  aerobic capacity

        -  work efficiency

        -  mitochondrial energetics

        -  fatigue

        -  physical function

        -  inflammation

        -  oxidative stress

        -  heart failure symptoms

        -  metabolomics

      These outcomes will assessed in all study participants who enroll in the trial. Addressing
      these knowledge gaps is necessary to shed new light on the pathophysiology of sarcopenia in
      CKD and suggest future interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial of coQ10 and NR
      treatments. Participants will receive coQ10 (1000 mg daily), NR (1200 mg daily), or placebo
      each for six-weeks in random order with a 7-day washout between treatment periods. The
      primary outcomes are aerobic capacity and muscle work efficiency, measured during cycle
      ergometry.
