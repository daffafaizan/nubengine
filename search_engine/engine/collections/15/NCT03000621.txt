      enrolled in this observational cohort of investigation. Whole blood samples will be separated
      immediately into plasma for storage. The participants will have their 2nd and 3rd samples
      obtained at 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours respectively. The schedule of most of sampling
      schedule is designed in concordance with the ICU routines to avoid extra burdens on patients.
      The plasma samples will be used as prognostic markers in prognostic and predictive values in
      identifying patients at high risk for mortality and acute liver failure. Patients who are
      discharged will be tracked for any clinical recurrence of the diseases every 28 days to
      assess the diagnostic accuracy of the miRNA biomarkers that are measured.

      The 2nd objective will be assessed by measuring the concentration of miRNAs in recruited
      healthy volunteers before and after a brief public speech. The circulating miRNAs will be
      detected directly from 1 - 5 ul of plasma samples with the miRFLP assay. This capillary
      electrophoresis-based miRNA quantification method detects multiple miRNAs in absolute copy
      number in smaller sample signature with negligible batch to batch variation, thus providing a
      standardizable miRNA detection method.
