      run-in phase. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate which includes complete
      response (CR) and partial response (PR) at Week 12 and Week 24. The secondary endpoints
      include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. There are
      two phases of the study. The first phase is the 'safety run-in phase'which plans to enroll 6
      patients who would be observed for safety issues for 12 weeks after study drug
      administration. If no Grade ≥ 4 (CTCAE) adverse events (AE) occurs during this phase, the
      study would enter the second phase; if Grade ≥ 4 (CTCAE) AE happens during this phase, the
      study would be terminated. In the second phase of the study, another 24 patients would be
      enrolled. All enrolled patients would receive the study drug until progression of disease,
      intolerability of the drugs or Week 96 and would be followed every 4 weeks in the first 12
      weeks, every 12 weeks until Week 48 and every 24 weeks until Week 96. The follow-up phase to
      assess PFS and OS will last from initiation of study drug to 36 months after enrollment
      (evaluation would be carried out every 24 weeks after Week 96). The total study duration will
      be 4 years after the last patient starts study medication.
