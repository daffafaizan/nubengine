      the vein dilated with sufficient blood flow in order to puncture the vein and perform
      hemodialysis in patients with renal failure. The success rate of this procedure varies
      between 50-80% and depends mainly on the size of the vein, with success being higher with
      larger veins. One of the veins used for an AVF is the basilic vein, located at the upper arm.
      This vein is however deeply located and necessitates transposition during surgery to a less
      deep and lateral subcutaneous plane before the anastomosis with the artery, in order to be
      used. A single study has shown that surgery performed in two stages (one to enlarge the vein
      and the second one to relocate the enlarged vein under the wound, not in a new path) is more
      successful than doing the procedure in one stage.

      The aim of this study is to confirm the findings of the single study mentioned above (one
      versus two stages of basilic vein AVF), with the difference that the basilic vein will be
      relocated outside the main wound, a method that is widely accepted as being better.
