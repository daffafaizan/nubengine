      touches the wall with the lines of the UULEX. The tables of the UULEX contain 8 horizontal
      levels. Each level is 84 cm wide and 8 cm high. The distance between the level centers is 15
      cm. The line below corresponds to the knee level of the participant. The individual moves the
      plastic bar, which has a weight of 0.2 kg, from the hips by holding the arms at the shoulder
      width and moves it to the different levels of the lines of the UULEX in front of it. Each
      movement starts at the hip joint and ends at the hip joint. After making the first level for
      two minutes, the upper levels are made in two minute. The beginning and end point of each
      level is the hip joint. The bar is removed until 30 movements per minute accompanied by a
      metronome (level up). When individuals reach their maximum height, the bar weighing 0.2 kg is
      replaced with a 0.5 kg weighted bar. This weight will continue to raise to the maximum
      height. The weight is then increased by 0.5 kg per minute to 2 kg. Individual is referred to
      the test to continue until symptom limitation.

      Statistical Analyses:The data will be given as mean ± standard deviation (X ± SD). The
      Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) will be used to evaluate the reliability of the
      UULEX. For concurrent validity, the relationship of the 30 sec Push up-Pull Test, DASH, HAQ
      and the 6-peg board ring test will be evaluated with Pearson correlation analysis. In our
      study, 85% power was obtained in the design made with 5% type 1 error and at least 70
      patients. p value will be taken as 0.05.
