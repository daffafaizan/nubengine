    
      Thrombocytopenic patients are followed with blood samples (thromboelastography, Multiplate,
      haematology) daily, Monday to Friday for up to 30 days.

      In addition bleeding evaluation is done daily ,using a standardized questionnaire. The
      questionnaire is filled out after interview of the patient, and som times next of kin and
      nurses. Nurse journals and medical journals are also used to fill in the questionnaires.

      For thromboelastography (TEG) we are looking at which parameters are abnormal, and if there
      is other factors than platelet count that influence the results. We will also compare TEG
      from days with and without bleeding, to see if they differ.

      For Multiplate we are doing a pilot study to see whether this analysis can be of any use at
      all in this group of patients. We are looking into which factors that influence the
      Multiplate result, and if we can see a difference in the results if the patient is bleeding.

      For reticulated platelets and thrombopoietin we are studying the levels related to platelet
      transfusions.
