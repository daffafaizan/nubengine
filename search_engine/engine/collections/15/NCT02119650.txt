      participants each), to confirm the safety of ruxolitinib in combination with
      pemetrexed/cisplatin in participants with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that
      is Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent. Participants in the safety run-in received open-label
      ruxolitinib and pemetrexed and cisplatin.

      In the second part of the study, participants enrolled and randomized and received pemetrexed
      and cisplatin (open-label) and either ruxolitinib or placebo in a blinded manner. The dose of
      ruxolitinib administered was determined from the data produced in the safety run-in phase.

      Treatment consisted of repeating 21-day cycles. Participants received infusions of pemetrexed
      and cisplatin on Day 1 of each cycle and ruxolitinib/placebo was self-administered during the
      entire cycle. Maintenance therapy with ruxolitinib or placebo in combination with pemetrexed,
      based on the original treatment assignment, was allowed for participants eligible for
      maintenance therapy.
