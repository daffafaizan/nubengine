      screening, temporal artery biopsy, vascular ultrasound examination and FDG PET/CT.

      All patients with a diagnosis of GCA will be treated with 60 mg af prednisolone and tapered
      according to a predefined algorithm.

      In patients with FDG PET/CT verified LV-GCA, FDG PET/CT is repeated after either 3 (n=12) or
      10 (n=12) days of steroid treatment.

      An experienced nuclear medicine physician (LCG), blinded to clinical symptoms and findings,
      qualitatively assesses PET scans. A semiquantitative approach is applied (a.m. Meller) in
      which FDG uptake in vascular regions is graded on a 5-point scale (0 = no uptake, 1 = uptake
      below or equal to blood pool, 2 = above blood pool but below liver, 3 = above liver, 4 = 2
      times above liver). Any score â‰¥3 is considered consistent with vasculitis. Sensitivity of
      post-therapeutic FDG PET/CT will be evaluated.

      Moreover, standard uptake values (SUV) mean and maximum values in vascular regions will be
      calculated. A ratio SUV(wall)/SUV(blood pool) and a total metabolic burden (TMB) based on
      affected vascular volume and SUV mean values are obtained as measures of vascular wall
      inflammation.
