      first two weeks, a baseline phase will be used to collect data on immune function and
      symptoms. LDN will be administered for 8 weeks. Although there is no placebo arm built-in,
      participants will be advised that they may receive a placebo during the trial. Participants
      will provide twice daily symptom reports using an android tablet device and Dooblo SurveyToGo
      survey software. Participants will also provide a blood sample twice every week for the
      duration of the study. Plasma inflammatory markers will be tested using a luminex based
      63-plex inflammatory assay panel.

      The primary aim of the study is to test if 8 weeks of LDN administration is associated with a
      reduction in pro-inflammatory markers in plasma in women with FM.
