        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of capecitabine
           administered with epirubicin and carboplatin in patients with unresectable locally
           advanced, metastatic, or recurrent solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine and correlate these PK parameters
           with clinical toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate end-of-infusion levels of epirubicin and its metabolites with epirubicin dose
           and clinical toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the possible correlation between polymorphisms in the promoter region of the
           thymidylate synthase gene with clinical toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine.

      Patients receive epirubicin IV over 2 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 24 additional
      patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-45 patients (24 patients for phase II) will be accrued for
      this study within 2 years.
