    
      This study has an open-label, single-dose classical pharmacokinetic design with no comparator
      treatment or group. At least twenty-four (24) children, ages 2 to <12 years, and twelve (12)
      adolescents, ages 12 to <18 years, with nasal symptoms due to hay fever or other upper
      respiratory allergies will complete the study. To ensure that younger children are
      represented, at least 35% (8) of the 24 children enrolled will range from 2 to <6 years of
      age.
