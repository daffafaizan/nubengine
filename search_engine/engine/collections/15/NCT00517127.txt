      are better suited for fluid therapy. Early proponents both for crystalloids [Shires 1961] and
      colloids [Shoemaker 1979] deserve credit for elucidating important facts about volume
      replacement therapy - without answering the primary question. Elaborate reviews comparing
      crystalloid and colloid therapy for critically ill patients have been performed in the late
      nineties and updated recently [Roberts 2004]. However, it has been suggested that both
      questions and answers of reviews leave us none but wiser [Webb 1999]. Although a plethora of
      studies comparing crystalloid vs. colloid therapy in the last decades have been published,
      volume replacement therapy is still considered to be based on dogma and personal beliefs
      [Boldt 2003].

      Goal-directed intraoperative fluid therapy monitored by Esophageal Doppler identifies
      volume-responders, thereby decreasing length of stay in hospital in orthopedic [Sinclair
      1997], cardiac [Mythen 1995], and abdominal surgery patients [Gan 2002, Wakeling 2005,
      Noblett 2006]. However, all these studies have been performed with a colloid to be the
      substance applied. Thus, it has been questioned whether monitoring with the Esophageal
      Doppler monitor, or the application of additional colloid improved outcome [Horowitz, Kumar
      2003].

      Consequently, the researchers will use Esophageal Doppler Monitoring for intraoperative
      goal-directed fluid therapy to compare the effects of crystalloid vs. colloid therapy on
      various organ systems, assessing combined perioperative morbidity [Bennett-Guerrero 1999] .
