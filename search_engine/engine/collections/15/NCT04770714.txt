    
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the global costs of two standard of
      care imaging techniques in patients with a new breast cancer diagnosis and planned breast
      conservation surgery. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized to either CEM or
      breast MRI. The purpose of this study is to compare the global costs (based on actual
      reimbursement rates) of initial imaging modality (CEM or breast MRI), downstream imaging
      related to breast cancer evaluation, and diagnostic breast procedures in women randomized to
      breast MRI versus CEM.

      Secondary endpoints include assessment of patient's reported satisfaction with the initial
      imaging technique received (CEM versus MRI), quantifying differences in health-related
      quality of life (as assessed by the patient reported Euro quality of life 5D questionnaire),
      rate of conversion from planned lumpectomy to mastectomy, and rate of re-operation for
      positive margins.
