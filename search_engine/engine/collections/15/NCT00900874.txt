      studies involving few children on use of formoterol that shows rapid bronchodilatation in
      children with asthma and no study that used it as rescue drug in children with acute
      exacerbation of asthma. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate whether the rapid
      bronchodilatory effect of formoterol is similar to that of salbutamol in children of 5-15
      years with mild exacerbation of asthma.

      Children will receive either salbutamol or formoterol by MDI. Participants will be explained
      about the study, spirometry and inhalation of medicine with MDI and spacer. Children will
      receive two puffs (100 microgram each of salbutamol) or Formoterol 2 puffs (6Âµg /puff) by MDI
      and spacer. Each child will be explained about the inhalation technique by using a MDI of
      placebo. After shaking the MDI it will be attached to spacer (700ml volume) and actuated.
      Child will be asked to take 5 tidal breaths. Another puff will be given by similar method.
