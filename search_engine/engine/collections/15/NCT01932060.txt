      increase the muscular tone of the uterus to reduce uterine bleeding after neonatal delivery.
      Pregnant patients undergoing elective (scheduled)Cesarean delivery routinely receive oxytocin
      after delivery of the baby. Post-delivery, oxytocin is commonly administered as an IV bolus
      and/or infusion. No previous studies have accurately assessed differences in oxytocin
      infusions after delivery in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Thus the study
      aim is to investigate which infusion rate can optimally provide adequate maintenance of
      uterine tone during Cesarean delivery while being associated with minimal or no maternal
      side-effects.
