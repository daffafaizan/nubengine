      among PLWH in San Diego, and to characterize negative predictors of DAA treatment uptake
      among PLWH in San Diego. Retrospective and prospective data from UCSD Owen Clinic will be
      utilized to calculate HCV prevalence, primary incidence, and reinfection incidence. Using
      mathematical epidemic models, the study will assess levels of existing and scaled-up
      interventions necessary for HCV elimination from PLWH in San Diego.
