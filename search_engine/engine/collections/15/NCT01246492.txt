      along in the lining of the gut. Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of these
      sweetness taste receptors, either by sugars such as glucose, fructose, lactose, or artificial
      sweeteners such as saccharin and aspartame can influence the way nutrients, including glucose
      are absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. Studies in animal models have shown that
      activation of the sweet taste receptors can increase the expression of the sodium-dependant
      glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) which transport glucose from
      the lumen into the bloodstream. Thus providing a potential mechanism by which glucose uptake
      can be regulated. Although artificial sweeteners stimulate the sweet taste receptors, they
      have little nutritive value, so that when they are consumed in the absence of any other
      nutrients there is little effect on blood glucose response. However, the effects of consuming
      artificial sweeteners in combination with sugars such as glucose is unclear. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate whether the addition of artificial sweeteners to an orally
      consumed glucose solution affects the rate at which the glucose appears in the blood.
