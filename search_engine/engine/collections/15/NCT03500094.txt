      safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric
      subjects 12 to <18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg (99 pounds) with Fabry disease and with
      amenable GLA variants. Subjects must be either naïve to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or
      have stopped ERT at least 14 days at the time of screening.

      Stage 1 will be a treatment period of approximately 1 month (4 weeks); Stage 2 will be a
      treatment period of 11 months and a 30-day (untreated) safety follow-up period. There will be
      no break in treatment between Stages 1 and 2. Prior to Stage 1, there will be a screening
      period lasting at least 14 days and up to 30 days (or more, if GLA genotyping is required).
      Stage 1 and 2 together will consist of a 12-month treatment period, and a 30-day safety
      follow-up period, for a total of approximately 13 months. Subjects may have the option to
      enroll in a long-term extension study conducted under a separate protocol.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 PK sampling groups using interactive
      response technology (IRT). Four blood samples for determination of migalastat concentrations
      in plasma will be collected on any one 24 hour period between Day 15 and Day 30 of study drug
      administration and again at Months 6 and 12.
