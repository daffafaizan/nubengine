      I. To determine the phase II dose when intermittent short-course vorinostat is combined with
      fractionated radiation therapy in recurrent high-grade glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      demonstrate that vorinostat influences glioma biology.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      Patients receive high-dose vorinostat orally (PO) at 48, 27, and 3 hours prior to surgery.
      Beginning 2-6 weeks later, patients receive vorinostat PO once daily (QD) on days 1-3 in
      weeks 1-2and undergo fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy on days 1-5 in weeks
      1-2. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
