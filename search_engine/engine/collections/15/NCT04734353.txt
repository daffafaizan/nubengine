      increased risk of ischemic events following PCI, there are unmet needs to develop the
      tailored strategies (e.g., intensified antiplatelet treatment) for this cohort. During
      antithrombotic treatment, East Asian patients have been prone to bleed compared with Western
      patients ("East Asian Paradox"). For example, standard-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g.,
      ticagrelor, prasugrel) vs. clopidogrel did not demonstrate the better net clinical benefit in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome. One of the tailored antiplatelet strategies for East
      Asian patients would be the de-escalated strategy of potent P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g.,
      ticagrelor, prasugrel). The ISAR-REACT5 trial showed the lower ischemic event and better
      tolerability of ticagrelor vs. prasugrel in ACS patients. This E5TION trial will compare the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of the de-escalated strategies (low-dose prasugrel and
      ticagrelor) in East Asian patients with CHIP character.
