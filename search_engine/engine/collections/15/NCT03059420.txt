      development of normal vision and is recognized to be an inherited trait in some families. The
      Engle Lab has investigated the genetics of complex and common strabismus and eyelid movement
      disorders for over 10 years and the lab's interests have expanded to include Congenital
      Cranial Dysinnervation Disorders (CCDDs) which are neurological disorders affecting one or
      more of the 12 cranial nerves. Cranial nerves control bodily functions such as movement of
      the eyes, transmission of visual information, smell, facial sensation, facial expression,
      blinking, hearing, balance, taste, chewing and swallowing.

      Based on genetic studies on individuals with eye movement and eyelid disorders, the lab
      learned that some individuals have additional ocular defects, vascular, limb and other
      abnormalities. In addition, in some families relatives who carry the gene mutation may
      manifest the familial syndrome by having only some additional features but NOT the
      oculomotility disorder. Therefore, to gain greater understanding of the spectrum of the
      disorders being investigated, we may also enroll individuals without eye movement or lid
      defects who have symptoms associated with mutations in congenital cranial dysinnervation
      disorder (CCDD) genes.
