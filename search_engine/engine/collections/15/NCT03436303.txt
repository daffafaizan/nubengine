      and risks of half-dose or standard-dose conjugated equine estrogens(CEE) plus natural

      postmenopausal women with intact uterus seeking treatment for menopausal symptoms are
      enrolled in this study.Participants are randomized into three groups, the CEE 0.3
      mg/micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg group; CEE 0.625 mg/MP 100 mg group; CEE 0.625
      mg/dydrogesterone 10 mg group,metabolic parameters,body composition,bone mineral
      density,breast cancer risk factors and life quality will be measure at baseline,one year and
      two year intervention.The investigators hypothesize there may be differences of these
