    
      Primary endpoints

      â€¢ Assess the volume of blood loss

      Secondary endpoints

        -  Compare the rates of intra- and postoperative complications, the necessity of blood
           transfusion, length of surgery, length of hospital and ICU stay, and leiomyoma symptoms
           relief

        -  Determine the procedure impact on fertility by evaluating the level of anti-mullerian
           hormone, pregnancy rates, pregnancy complications, and the way of delivery

      Patients who meet study inclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two treatment arms:
      1) laparoscopic myomectomy preceded by temporary uterine blood supply occlusion or 2)
      laparoscopic myomectomy with a conventional approach.

      Sixty patients will undergo laparoscopic myomectomy preceded by temporary uterine blood
      supply occlusion performed by gynecologists at Mother and Child Clinic Saint-Petersburg and
      other institutions participating in the study. Sixty patients will undergo conventional
      laparoscopic myomectomy performed by gynecologists at Mother and Child Clinic
      Saint-Petersburg and other institutions participating in the study.

      Patients eligible for inclusion, after signing an informed voluntary consent to participate
      in the study, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment groups using stratification
      by age, size, and leiomyoma nodes location.
