      pain after spinal surgery. Moreover, this method is frequently used in patients with chronic
      low back pain conditions without previous spine surgery also known as "virgin back".
      Epiduroscopy allows by optical fiber technology and skiascopy imaging the exact examination
      of the epidural space and subsequently mechanical lysis (with advanced interventional options
      by laser, radiofrequency, balloon techniques etc.) and/or drug administration to the target
      point.

      II. The Racz catheter procedure is based on epidural neurolysis. It is used to release some
      of the adhesions or scar tissue which surround entrapped nerves in the epidural space of the
      spine. This state could be caused by chronic inflammatory adhesions or by healing mechanisms
      after spine surgery - scars. Mechanical liberation of epidural space further allows better
      administration and targeting of drugs as corticoids or hyaluronidase. This technique is
      performed under fluoroscopy imaging. Suitable epidurogram and skiascopy confirm appropriate
      catheter position during procedure.

      III. The caudal epidural block involves placing a needle through the sacral hiatus to deliver
      medications into the epidural space. This approach to the epidural space is popular in
      managing a wide variety of chronic pain conditions in adults, especially chronic low back
      pain syndromes. Fluoroscopy is considered as a gold standard of needle guidance during
      procedures in which caudal epidural injections are performed.
