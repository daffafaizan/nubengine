      is delivered on the PTV1rx (area at high risk of relapse) up to at least 70 Gy [RBE] in 2-3
      Gy [RBE] per fractions for 8-15 total fractions.

      PTV2 rx (area at low or intermediate risk of relapse) will be irradiated with photon IMRT up
      to a total dose of 50-60 Gy [RBE].

      Secondary endpoints of the trial are local control, relapse free survival, overall survival,
      tumor specific survival, intermediate and long term toxicity.
