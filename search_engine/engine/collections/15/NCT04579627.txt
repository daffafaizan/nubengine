      significant health consequences for healthcare workers, which may be related to the provision
      of personal protective equipment (PPE). Following PPE guidance is a significant health and
      safety concern, under which facial hair guidance for tight fitting masks falls.

      This has implications as FFP3 masks are not the only form of PPE for the face, and this study
      may highlight a need for employers to diversify which PPE they supply to their employees,
      such as full hoods if staff need to maintain facial hair for cultural or religious reasons.

      As such, facial hair has potential implications for patient safety, but also these have to be
      balanced with personal or religious reasons for maintaining facial hair. Our study aimed to
      determine the facial hair styles of hospital doctors, and reasons for maintaining them during
      the COVID-19 pandemic. We also looked at whether these styles adhered to the PPE guidance set
      about by Public Health England (PHE)
