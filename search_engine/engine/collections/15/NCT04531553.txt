      commonly used techniques for analgesia after thoracic surgery. However, TEA has several
      adverse effects, such as hypotension, motor blockade, hematoma, and abscess and TPVB has a
      chance of epidural spread and pneumothorax, and multiple injections are needed if more than 4
      dermatome analgesia is required. Recently, erector spinae plane block (ESPB) was reported as
      a treatment for thoracic neuropathic pain.

      ESPB is a relatively simple technique with easily identified sonographic landmarks, and a
      catheter is easily inserted into the plane after distention induced by the injection.
      Additionally, the ESPB has the potential to provide both somatic and visceral sensory
      blockade.

      The selectivity of dexmedetomidine to the α2-receptors is eight times of its prototype,
      clonidine. Accordingly, dexmedetomidine is a more powerful sedative and analgesic drug than
      clonidine with less hemodynamic derangements from the α1-receptor activation. Dexmedetomidine
      has been primarily used for intra- venous sedation in intensive care settings. The unique
      analgesic properties of dexmedetomidine have encouraged the anesthesiologists to use it
      perineurally. Previous studies have declared that dexmedetomidine potentiates local
      anesthetic effect when administered by neuroaxial route.

      This study aims to evaluate the effect ultrasound erector spinae plane block with
      dexmedetomidine infusion in management of acute and chronic post thoracotomy pain.
