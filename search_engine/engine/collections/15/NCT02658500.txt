      barrier function, metabolic reactions, trophic effects, and maturation of the host's innate
      and adaptive immune responses. Therefore, the human health depends on the gut health. It is
      reported that the human gut microbiota of a healthy adult is highly resilient and very stable
      over time. And before it reaches maturity, the microbiota must develop itself from birth and
      establish its mutually beneficial cohabitation with the host. However, the early developments
      of the microbiota in infants are influenced by many factors, such as prenatal parameters, the
      influence of the mother and her microbiota, and therapies occurring around the time of birth.

      Human milk is the sole source of nutrition for infants during the first weeks to months after
      birth, and has evolved to provide nutrition and immunological protection in the extra-uterine
      environment into which the infant is born. But when breastfeeding is not possible, human
      newborns may circumstantially be fed with infant formulas. The difference of feeding mode has
      been demonstrated to have a strong influence on early gut colonization particularly on the
      probiotic bacteria. Studies show that breastfed infants have higher counts of Bifidobacteria
      and Lactobacillus and lower counts of Bacteroides, Clostridium, coccoides group,
      Staphylococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae as compared with formula-fed infants.
