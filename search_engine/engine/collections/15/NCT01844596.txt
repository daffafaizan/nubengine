      critical component of hypertension management is to facilitate sustained access of affected
      individuals to effective clinical services. In partnership with the Government of Kenya, the
      Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) Partnership is expanding its clinical
      scope of work in rural western Kenya to include hypertension and other chronic diseases.
      However, linking and retaining individuals with elevated blood pressure to the clinical care
      program has been difficult. To address this challenge, we propose to develop and evaluate
      innovative community-based strategies and initiatives supported by mobile technology.

      The objective of this application is to utilize a multi-disciplinary implementation research
      approach to address the challenge of linking and retaining hypertensive individuals to a
      hypertension management program. The central hypothesis is: community health workers (CHWs),
      equipped with a tailored behavioral communication strategy and a smartphone-based tool linked
      to an electronic health record, can increase linkage and retention of hypertensive
      individuals to a hypertension care program and thereby significantly reduce blood pressure
      among these patients. We further hypothesize that these interventions will be cost-effective.

      This research will generate innovative and productive solutions to the expanding global
      problem of hypertension, and will add to existing knowledge on scalable and sustainable
      strategies for effectively managing hypertension and other chronic diseases in low- and
      middle-income countries.
