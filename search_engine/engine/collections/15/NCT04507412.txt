    
      The purpose of this study is to detect the efficacy of intravenous perioperative steroid
      supplementation for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) surgeries in terms of short-term and
      long-term clinical outcomes and to demonstrate its advantages over the routine anaesthesia
      protocol. The comparison will be evaluated in terms of post- operative pain and function,
      opioids and analgesic drugs consumption, patient satisfaction, patient reported outcome
      measures (validated clinical scores), clinician-assessed clinical scores, systemic
      inflammatory response, length of hospital stay and long-term outcomes. Moreover, to confirm
      the safety of steroid supplementation all treatment related adverse events- and reactions are
      going to be recorded and reported, as well as post-operative glycaemia will be monitored.

      The primary objective of the study is to show the efficacy on post-operative pain of
      intravenous perioperative dexamethasone supplementation for TSA.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to show superiority by comparison of the
      intravenous peri- operative dexamethasone supplementation group to the routine analgesia
      protocol (no steroid supplementation group), in terms of post-operative pain and function,
      patient satisfaction, shoulder active- and passive range of motion, quantification with
      validated clinician- and patient reported outcome measures as the Constant, ASES and SSV
      Scores for function and EQ-5D-3L Score for health-related quality of life, opioids and
      analgesic drugs consumption, systemic inflammatory response, time until first mobilization
      and until the patient first slept through at night, the length of hospital stay and presence
      or absence of a frozen shoulder at the postoperative follow-up, as well as adverse events and
      reactions, in order to document the advantage over the absence of steroid supplementation in
      the short-, mid- term- and long-term follow up.
