      incidence has reached as high as 19.2% in China. GDM is associated with various adverse
      pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and her offspring, and not only during the perinatal
      phase, but also in the long term.Thus finding effective way to reduce the risk of GDM is of
      great importance,especial for women with high GDM risk factors. GDM history is one of the
      risk factors. Imoportantly, with the gradual opening of a two-child policy, more and more
      Chinese women of reproductive age enter pregnancy have a history of GDM. Our previous study
      showed that regular exercise commenced in early pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk
      of developing GDM in Chinese overweight and obese pregant women. Thus, in this study, we want
      to evaluate the effect of lifestyle intervention with detailed information on how to eat and
      how to diet in preventing the recurrence of GDM
