      assess a variety of the most frequent psychological disorders. Its reliability and validity
      has been demonstrated in clinical samples. Also, studies have tested patients' and
      therapist's acceptance of the interview. Since structured interviews are also used in
      non-clinical samples like epidemiological research the investigators would like to conduct a
      study in a community sample to test the interview's reliability, validity and acceptance in
      this population (study aim 1). The investigators also plan to compare positive mental health
      and affective styles of the subsample of participants with no current or lifetime mental
      health illness to patients from the local outpatient treatment center at the Ruhr-University
      Bochum, who all reported at least one current mental illness (study aim 2). If the
      researchers obtain enough participants with no current mental health problem, but a history
      of at least one mental health illness, they will be included in the analysis for study aim 2
      as well.

      Since the data collection takes place during the Corona pandemic, participants will also be
      asked to give information about how they are affected, about their living situation and their
      media use over the course of half a year to describe the sample and to determine the impact
      of these factors on the incidence and course of mental illness (study aim 3).
