      I. To investigate efficacy of groups of patients defined by disease type, genomic aberration
      and treatment regimen.

      II. To assess the confirmed response rate of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin
      (nab-rapamycin) in mTOR aberrant advanced cancers. (Sub-protocol Arm A)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate other clinical outcomes (e.g., progression-free and overall survival) of
      groups of patients defined by disease type, genomic aberration and treatment regimen.

      II. To describe the adverse event profile of each regimen. III. To assess the clinical
      benefit rate of nab-rapamycin in mTOR aberrant advanced cancers. (Sub-protocol Arm A).

      IV. To estimate progression-free survival (specifically at 6 months) and overall survival of
      these patients. (Sub-protocol Arm A) V. To estimate the adverse event profile of
      nab-rapamycin. (Sub-protocol Arm A)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms using the European
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core
      (QLQ-C)30 in groups of patients defined by disease type and/or treatment regimen and to
      correlative HRQOL/symptoms with genomic markers.

      II. To assess the rate of individual mTOR pathway aberrations and assess the association
      between individual mTOR pathway aberrations and clinical outcome both across disease
      indications and within disease indications. (Sub-protocol Arm A)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 24 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
