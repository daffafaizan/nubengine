      differentiate various subtypes of ADHD children, and to investigate the efficacy of anti-ADHD
      drugs on various cognitive performance of ADHD children by event-related potentials(ERP).

      Children, aged six to 18 years old, are enrolled and assigned to three groups (normal
      control, pure ADHD, and ADHD with comorbidities). ADHD children fulfill the DSM-IV-TR
      criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD. ADHD children are evaluated by Chinese version of SNAP-IV
      Rating Scale for rating ADHD-related symptoms before and after medication. EEG and
      audiometric testing are required for every participant to exclude dialeptic seizures and
      hearing impairment respectively.

      Methylphenidate (either immediate-release or extended-release formulations) or atomoxetine
      Hydrochloride is given to ADHD participants.Continuous performance task (CPT) and ERP tasks
      are applied.
