        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian
           tube, or primary peritoneal cancer treated with erlotinib and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the duration of stable disease, time to progression, and response duration in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate the level of epidermal growth factor receptor tumor expression with objective
           tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      platinum-containing therapy (platinum-sensitive, defined as 6 months or more since prior
      therapy with platinum agent [closed to accrual as of 2/13/2004], vs platinum-resistant,
      defined as less than 6 months since prior therapy with platinum agent).

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib once daily on
      days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses. After the completion of 6
      courses of therapy, patients with responsive or stable disease may continue to receive
      erlotinib and carboplatin in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-60 patients (8-30 for platinum-sensitive stratum [closed to
      accrual as of 2/13/2004] and 15-30 for platinum-resistant stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 15-23 months.
