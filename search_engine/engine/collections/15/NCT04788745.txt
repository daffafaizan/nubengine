      clinical markers of disease and oxidative stress. After the lead-in phase, participants will
      receive trimetazidine for 12 weeks. Participants will visit the clinic at 6-week intervals,
      during which we will obtain a blood sample to measure the pharmacodynamic response. We will
      also collect information regarding the rate of disease progression (i.e. ALSFRS-R and SVC).
      At weeks 3 and 9 of treatment, participants will conduct a teleconference visit, during which
      we will collect data on ALSFRS-R. Adverse events will be collected and recorded throughout
      the entire trial duration. At the end of the on-treatment period, a close-out visit will
      occur after four weeks. The total study period per participant will be 20 weeks.
