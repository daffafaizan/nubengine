      intervention designed to promote toilet construction, exclusive toilet use and maintenance in
      peri-urban communities of Tamil Nadu. The intervention leverages two years of formative
      research and reflects a norms and network-centric approach that will employ dynamic
      information dissemination to signal others' sanitation practices while also addressing other
      barriers to the adoption of improved sanitation practices. The study will determine whether
      those who received the interventions had significant improvements in toilet usage compared to
      those who did not.

      For this cluster-randomized trial, communities will be engaged in two rounds of surveys to
      assess toilet ownership, toilet usage practices of their family members and include
      additional questions about beliefs, norms and other factors influencing toilet use.
      Investigators will also conduct a process evaluation to monitor change from baseline to
      endline and identify successful pathways of or bottle-necks to the adoption of improved
      sanitation behaviors. These indicators will include fidelity indicators to assess the quality
      of intervention delivery, level of community participation, behavioral antecedents,
      contextual changes in community and household conditions that may facilitate improved
      behavioral adoption and/or outcomes (e.g., exclusive toilet use). They will also conduct
      qualitative research using observations and semi-structured interviews with respondents and
      stakeholders to assess exposure and reactions to the intervention. They will also assess
      spillover in the control wards using mixed-method assessment tools.
