      ID# GI 1001) offered preliminary evidence that the CREON2000A system may be beneficial in
      asthma. This study is a follow-up, using children, aged 6 to 17 with mild to moderate
      persistent asthma, as the subjects of the study. Children are usually treated with fewer
      controller medications and have fewer confounding co-morbidities making it more likely to
      detect a therapeutic benefit from an environmental intervention. The study will involve 4
      study site visits, 2 home visits, and 7 phone calls. Adjustment of asthma therapy by the site
      clinician will occur at baseline (Visit 1) and at each follow-up office visit after Visit 1
      using a modified algorithm based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
      Expert Panel Report 3 (NAEPP EPR3) guidelines. Enrollment will be over 18 months. The study
      duration for each subject will be 12 months.
