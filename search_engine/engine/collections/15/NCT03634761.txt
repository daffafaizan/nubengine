      with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). High quality and structured early intervention programs
      grounded in the principles and procedures of applied behavior analysis have been found in
      numerous research studies and reviews to significantly improve developmental outcomes,
      adaptive behaviors and learning outcomes of preschool children with ASD.

      A prerequisite of which is a high quality learning environment that includes both the
      physical set-up, learning climate and competence of staff. The primary purpose of this
      project is to improve program quality for preschool children with ASD through a competency
      based model grounded in ecological systems theory sustainable over time and applicable within
      the Swedish service support system. In total approximately 16 preschools will participate,
      half of which will receive "treatment as usual" EIBI to a Child with ASD in the preschool,
      supervised by an external supervisor from a habilitation center), while the other half will
      also receive obtain in-service training and monthly on-site coaching through habilitation.
      Involved habilitation specialists will obtain in-service training prior to the onset of the
      study on how to use the Autism Program Environment Rating Scale (APERS), the basic tenets of
      coaching based on the concept of reflective and collaborative dialogues in which the
      preschool teachers knowledge of the child and context are taken into account.

      It is hypothesized that the competency based model will improve program quality, child's
      engagement, adaptive behavior, increase preschool staff knowledge, allegiance and
      self-efficacy compared to the comparison group only receiving supervision in implementing a
      comprehensive program.
