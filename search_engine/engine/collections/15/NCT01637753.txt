      particular important. Gliadel wafer developed in the States and marketed in the developed
      countries is an example of such treatments. The product in this study, Carmustine Sustained
      Release Implant (CASANT), is similar to that of Gliadel wafer as for the API(Active
      Pharmaceutical Ingredient), but different as for drug delivering system. As required, the
      preliminary clinical studies were conducted in China. Based on the results of phase I/II ,
      8-10 wafers containing given dose of BCNU will be administered intracranially in this phase
      III to the tumor resected cavity to investigate the safety and efficacy in the treatment of
      recurrent malignant glioma in 212 patients.
