    
      Purpose: The study has four aims;

        -  The primary aim of the study is to determine whether women who are receiving either
           weekly Taxol (80-100 mg/m2) or bi-weekly Taxol (i.e.,dose-dense; 175 mg/m2) show
           deficits in axon-reflex mediated vasodilation (AMV) over the course of six weeks of
           Taxol therapy similar to those that have been reported in patients with diabetic and
           genetically-inherited neuropathies.

        -  The second aim of the study is to determine whether women who are receiving either
           weekly or dose-dense Taxol develop changes in AMV before developing signs & symptoms of
           chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in a way that supports using changes
           in AMV as an early detection method for small-fiber CIPN.

        -  A third (exploratory) aim of the study is to determine whether any changes in AMV
           detected during the study are significantly correlated with self-reported CIPN in a way
           that would support using changes in AMV as a confirmatory marker for CIPN.

        -  A final (exploratory) aim of the study is to describe the size of axon reflexes and axon
           flares in women receiving weekly Taxol before they start their pre-Taxol anthracycline &
           cyclophosphamide (AC) therapy.
