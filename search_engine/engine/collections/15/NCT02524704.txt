    
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)
      hardware and software in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) for providing regional and
      quantitative information for identifying regions of obstruction and consolidation, and
      determine whether these measures will correlate with improvements seen after hospitalized
      treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation (PE). In particular, EIT will be used to identify
      regions of obstruction (air trapping) and consolidation comprised of atelectasis and airway
      occlusion (consequences of mucus plugging) in CF patients, and to determine whether EIT can
      demonstrate the beneficial effects of antibiotic treatment for CF patients with an acute PE
      by correlating changes in quantitative EIT measures with clinical measures known to improve
      following therapy, with patients serving as their own controls. Regional changes in air
      trapping and consolidation from pre to post treatment as indicated by the EIT images will be
      calculated, with subjects serving as their own control.
