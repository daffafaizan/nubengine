      approximately 20%-45% of breast cancer patients suffer from postoperative depression.
      Esketamine is an anesthetic in analgesia, and has presently become more and more popular for
      treating anti-depression, particularly for resistant depression.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled (randomized, parallel group, concealed
      allocation), double-blinded trial. All depression patients undergoing breast cancer operation
      will be randomized 1:1 to the treatment intervention with general anesthesia as an adjunct to
      esketamine or saline. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the postoperative
      depression、gut microbiota、bispectral index data of patients undergoing breast cancer
      operation with esketamine or saline
