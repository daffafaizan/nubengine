    
      Prospective observational study with 5-year follow up. 55 patients are included with moderate
      to severe tooth wear, whereby through informed consent the decision was taking to monitor the
      patients. At the baseline and the 5-year recall digital 3D scans will be made, which will be
      compared and subtracted. Per tooth the loss of material is measured in maximum loss in height
      (Âµm) and volume (mm3) per year, using best fit alignment and 3D subtraction.

      In a multivariate statistical model the loss of tooth material per tooth type will be tested
      against possible individual risk factors such as bruxism and reflux. An interim analysis will
      be performed to test the feasibility of the research.
