      disease control or organ preservation in many cancers including head and neck, esophageal,
      rectal, bladder cancers and sarcomas, leading to improvements in overall survival and limb or
      organ preservation.

      This interventional study will be done in two phases using the Simon two-stage Phase II study
      design. The median progression-free survival of these patients with current standard of care
      therapy is in the range of 6-8 months (6.9 months in the standard of care). With the proposed
      trial of surgical resection of the tumor after chemotherapy and radiation the median
      progression free survival is anticipated to be approximately 11-12 months from subset
      analysis of available literature and based on prior data on other disease sites. In other
      words, the 7-month local progression rates is anticipated to decrease from 50% to 25%, or
      progression free survival improve from 50-75%
