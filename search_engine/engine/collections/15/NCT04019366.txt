      such patients are not evaluated and treated on balance and stability parameters. So this
      study was conducted with objectives to determine the effects of Balance training using Biodex
      stability system in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

      Experimental group has received Balance and stability training on Biodex stability system
      along with conservative protocol of traditional exercises.

      Control group has received only conservative protocol of traditional exercises.
