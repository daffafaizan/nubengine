      demonstrated efficacy of short antibiotic course in e.g. acute streptococcal tonsillitis,
      community acquired pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. Erysipelas is an acute
      dermo-hypodermal infection due to streptococcus. To date no resistance of theses bacteria to
      amoxicillin was described. The diagnosis of erysipelas is clinical. Thus, short course of
      antibiotic is a good regimen to test in erysipelas treatment. To date there is no controlled
      trial concerning efficacy of oral amoxicillin in erysipelas treatment. Expected advantages of
      the demonstration of the non inferiority of a short and oral amoxicillin treatment in
      erysipelas are: reduction of antibiotic selective pressure, cost, adverse events caused by
      infusion and hospitalisation.
