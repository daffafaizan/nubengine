      increased pain tolerance, better mood, and improved quality of life, in both healthy and
      medical populations. Although mindfulness meditation is well promoted both clinically and in
      the media, finding ways to promote engagement in and fidelity to the intervention, in a
      format that is accessible for cancer survivors is crucial, as the availability of resources
      and appreciation of the benefits does not necessarily lead to behavior change.

      With many more people surviving cancer than in previous decades, there is an opportunity to
      act on the residual effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment, and with the prevalence of
      technology ever increasing, online and mobile interventions have become more frequently
      delivered and have a particular utility for this population. Physical and geographic
      limitations could prevent cancer survivors from accessing psychosocial interventions. Whether
      the repeated beneficial findings of face-to-face training in mindfulness meditation will be
      found in a mobile environment is an open and timely question. In this current clinical trial,
      we are testing the impact of the intervention on anxiety or neuropathy. Potential
      participants who are experiencing either side effect are invited to learn more.
