      antigen (PSA) value, it is unclear which biopsy strategy offers the highest detection rate
      for significant prostate cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that targeted MRI/ultrasound
      fusion-guided biopsy improves the detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancers
      (csPCa) compared with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.

      Patients who fulfill all eligibility criteria and have provided written consent will be
      randomized to undergo MRI followed by biopsies (arm A) or TRUS transrectal biopsy (arm-B).
      Patients will be randomly assigned to arm A or arm B following a 1:1 simple randomization
      procedure according to a computer-generated randomization list. The primary end point will be
      the comparison of detection rates csPCa between arm A and arm B. csPCa will be defined
      according to the Standards of Reporting for MRI-targeted Biopsy Studies (START) criteria for
      targeted biopsy Gleason Score ≥ 7 or maximum CCL ≥ 5 mm and the updated Epstein criteria for
      SB (Gleason score ≥ 7, PSA density ≥ 0.15, Gleason score ≥ 2 positive cores, and bilateral
      cancer). The secondary end points will be (1) Comparison of the overall detection rate of PCa
      and csPCa between arm A mpMRI+ and arm B and (2) Comparison of complication rates between arm
      A mpMRI+ and arm B.
