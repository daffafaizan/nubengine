      we would asses if the differences between the two devices affect the extent of retinal
      periphery view and if ocular ametropies which come with different retinal pathologies would
      affect the retinal periphery assessment.

      Aim: To compare two CE-marked imaging systems concerning the extent of retinal periphery area
      viewing.

      We would like to perform a prospective observational study that would include patients
      divided into three groups: myopic patients, hyperopic and emmetropic patients.

      Fundus photography will be performed using two ultra-wide-field imaging systems (Optos,
      Daytona, Optos PLC, Dunfermline, UK and Clarus, 500 Carl Zeiss, Meditec AG, Jena, Germany),
      performed by the same investigator.

      All images with sufficient quality will be exported and saved to hard-disk. The difference in
      periphery view will be investigated as follows: two retinal photos for each patient will be
      imported into Photoshop CS6 image-editing system (Adobe, version 13.0.0) where the anatomical
      landmarks will be matched for each image and the borders will be compared to see if there are
      differences in retinal periphery area viewing between the two devices.
