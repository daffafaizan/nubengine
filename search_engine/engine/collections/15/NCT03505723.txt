    
      The POISE-3 study is a 10,000 patient, multicentre, international, non-inferiority randomized
      controlled trial of tranexamic acid (TXA) versus placebo and, using a partial factorial
      design, of a perioperative hypotension-avoidance versus hypertension-avoidance strategy. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine; if TXA is superior to placebo for the
      occurrence of life-threatening, major, and critical organ bleeding, and non-inferior to
      placebo for the occurrence of major arterial and venous thrombotic event; and to determine
      the impact of a hypotension-avoidance strategy versus a hypertension-avoidance strategy on
      the risk of vascular death and major vascular events in patients who are followed for 30 days
      after noncardiac surgery.
