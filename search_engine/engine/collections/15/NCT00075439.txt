      I. To determine the 6 month progression free survival rate in patients with progressive,
      advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with ZD1839.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objective tumor response rate. II. Progression free survival and time to progression. III.
      Improvement in circulating hormone levels. IV. Overall survival V. We will explore the
      molecular characterization of these tumors in attempt to understand the role of EGFR
      expression and its inhibition with ZD1839 in neuroendocrine tumors. The measurements will be
      performed on pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies when possible: EGFR expression
      and gene amplification (IHC for EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR, ISH for gene amplification);
      Activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (IHC for phosphorylated MAPK); Cell proliferation
      (Ki-67 staining); Apoptosis (TUNEL assay).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type
      (carcinoid vs islet cell and other neuroendocrine tumors).

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 2 years from study entry.
