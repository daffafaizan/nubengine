      with de-novo GBM.

      Eligible patients will be randomized between arm A and arm B:

      Arm A (standard): Radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to standard protocol for newly
      diagnosed GBM. This consists of 30 daily fractions of 2 Gy or 33 fractions in 1.8 Gy to the
      tumor and surrounding margin in combination with temozolomide 75 mg/m² per os daily (po qd)
      and six adjuvant cycles of temozolomide 150 - 200 mg/m² po qd.

      Arm B (experimental): Standard treatment as described under arm A combined with daily intake
      of 400mg CQ. CQ will start with one week before the start of radiotherapy and end on the last
      day of radiotherapy.

      In a single centre exploratory substudy, thirty subjects sequentially recruited within
      MAASTRO clinic randomized to arm B will be invited to receive two 3-[18F]fluoro-
      2-(4-((2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1- yl)propan-1-ol PET-scans
      ([18F]HX4 ). The first on day -6 (start CQ), the second on day 0 (before the start
      radiotherapy and TMZ).
