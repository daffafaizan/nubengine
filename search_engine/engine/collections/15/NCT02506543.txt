      at pre-test/baseline and post-intervention. Quantitative survey methods will be used to
      evaluate attitudes towards a host of topics related to physical and financial assets and
      health-related behaviors. Survey questions will be administered using Audio Computer Assisted
      Self-Interviewing (ACASI). Quantitative methods will be used to yield statistical measures of
      the scale of changes in attitudes, skills, and behaviors due to the intervention.

      Qualitative methods at baseline will include focus group discussions with caregivers and
      participatory methods with girls to assess topics such as self-esteem, empowerment, safety,
      and resilience. Endline qualitative methods include in-depth interviews with caregivers, and
      small-group warm-up activities with adolescent girls, followed by in-depth interviews.
