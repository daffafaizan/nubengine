      unknown etiology that is currently incurable. This study is a national multi-center
      registration study. The study collects general information of ALS patients including medical
      history, disease characteristics, clinical treatment data, and patient information for
      different visits in different centers. The aim of the study is: a) describe the distribution
      of ALS in mainland China(explore the differences in the number of ALS at different times,
      different regions, and different populations) and further find the reasons that affect the
      distribution of ALS, b) study the development of ALS in mainland China and the corresponding
      changes in the characteristics of the disease, c) explore factors that influence the
      prognosis of ALS.
