      using lung ultrasonography as a new diagnostic test compares to fiberoptic bronchoscopy as a
      standard test. Both of them detect lung collapse reported as surgical grading lung collapse
      by the thoracic surgeons. The protocol was performed in a randomized controlled trial whether
      the subject was allocated to the ultrasonography group or the fiberoptic bronchoscopy group.
