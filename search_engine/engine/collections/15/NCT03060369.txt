    
      Approximately 50 subjects meeting recruitment criteria will be enrolled with a minimum of 20
      subjects meeting entry criteria for established shock (Cohort A).

      Noninvasive near-infrared spectroscopy CareGuide™ measurements of SmO2, tissue pH and
      hematocrit will be collected from enrollment through device removal. These data will be
      compared to specific hemodynamic and laboratory parameters obtained as a part of routine care
      during the CareGuide™ monitoring period.
