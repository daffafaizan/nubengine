      patients who applied to the Department of Periodontology, received dental implant treatment,
      and required routine follow-up for the maintenance of peri-implant health will be included.
      Clinical and radiographic examinations will be performed at baseline (prothesis delivery) and
      at the end of the 3rd, 6th month, 1st year following the prosthetic loading. During clinical
      examination probing depth (PD), modified plaque index (mPI) and modified bleeding index (mBI)
      measurements will be evaluated with the Williams periodontal probe. These measurements will
      be taken at four points of the implant (mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, disto-buccal and
      mid-lingual) and these four measurements will be averaged for each implant. In addition, the
      amount of keratinized mucosa (KM) in the implant sites will be evaluated by measuring the
      mucosal margin and mucogingival junction on the vestibular surface with the same probe. After
      clinical examination, a periapical radiograph will be taken using a parallel technique to
      determine marginal bone loss surrounding the implant. The distance between the implant neck
      and the most coronal part of the alveolar crest will be measured on the mesial and distal
      surfaces for each implant on the obtained radiographs and the average of the two measurements
      will be taken. The parameters checked during clinical and radiographic examination will be
      compared between patients with or without keratinized mucosa and whose keratinized mucosa has
      been increased by free gingival graft.
