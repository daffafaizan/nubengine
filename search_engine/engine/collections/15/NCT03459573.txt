    
      Sub-study 1 (T2D). Eligible participants (N=300) with T2D, an A1c above 7.0% and Body Mass
      Index (BMI) ≥ 25 will be randomized to one of three groups. Participants assigned to group 1
      (n=100) get One Drop's digital therapeutics solution (app, meter, and 'On Track' in-app
      coaching) and a Fitbit Ionic smartwatch and are asked to use both for 3 months. Participants
      assigned to group 2 (n=100) get One Drop's digital therapeutics solution and are asked to use
      it for 3 months. After 3 months, group 2 gets a Fitbit Ionic smartwatch. Finally,
      participants assigned to group 3 (n=100) are asked to manage their diabetes without an app,
      coach, or activity tracker for 3 months. After 3 months, group 3 gets One Drop's digital
      therapeutics solution (app, meter, and 'On Track' in-app coaching) and a Fitbit Ionic
      smartwatch (n=100).

      Sub-study 2 (T1D). Eligible participants (N=100) with T1D and an A1c above 7.0% will be
      randomized to one of two groups. Participants assigned to group 1 (n=50) get One Drop's
      digital therapeutics solution (app, meter, and 'On Call' in-app coaching) and a Fitbit Ionic
      smartwatch and are asked to use both for 3 months. Participants assigned to group 2 (n=50)
      get One Drop's digital therapeutics solution and are asked to use it for 3 months. After 3
      months, group 2 gets a Fitbit Ionic smartwatch.

      Sub-study 3 (Pre-diabetes). Eligible participants (N=100) with pre-diabetes, an A1c between
      5.7-6.4% and a BMI ≥ 25 will be randomized to one of two groups. Participants assigned to
      group 1 (n=50) get One Drop's digital therapeutics solution ('Revive' in-app coaching) and a
      Fitbit Charge 2 and are asked to use both for 3 months. Participants assigned to group 2
      (n=50) get One Drop's digital therapeutics solution and are asked to use it for 3 months.
      After 3 months, group 2 gets a Fitbit Charge 2.
