      empirically for community-acquired pneumonia. . Moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were
      determined the day after therapy initiation using ultra high performance liquid
      chromatography. The moxifloxacin plasma concentration-time profiles were described with a one
      compartment model, using NONMEM. Peak drug concentrations (Cmax) and 24-hour area under the
      free drug concentration-time curve values (fAUC0-24) predicted for each patient were
      evaluated against epidemiological cut-off MIC values for Streptococcus pneumoniae,
      Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophilia. PK-PD targets adopted were Cmax/MIC â‰¥
      12.2 for all pathogens, fAUC0-24/MIC > 34 for S. pneumoniae and fAUC0-24/MIC > 75 for H.
      influenzae and L. pneumophilia. The same PK-PD estimates were used in the simulations of
      probability of target attainment (PTA) versus MIC.
