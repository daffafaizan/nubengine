      snack prototypes containing two different fiber blends on gut community structure and
      features of host biological state (plasma proteome/ metabolome). The information gained from
      this work will increase our understanding of the importance of specific dietary fibers in
      manipulating the composition of the gut microbiota in ways that may improve our metabolic
      health.
