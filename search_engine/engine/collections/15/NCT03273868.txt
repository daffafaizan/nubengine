      on autonomic nervous system activity (e.g. increase in skin sympathetic nerve activity) and
      on sensitivity to experimentally-induced pain (e.g. increase in pressure pain threshold).

      It is generally unknown i) if these supposed effects last after the immediate post
      intervention period and ii) if there is a statistical relationship between them, considering
      that pain and autonomic networks are closely connected and interact at the peripheral, spinal
      and supra-spinal levels.

      The primary aim of the study is to assess every single effect immediatly and at short-term
      after the intervention.

      The secondary aim is to assess the bivariate statistical relationship between cardiovascular
      autonomic activity and sensitivity to experimentally-induced pain after the intervention.

      Cardiovascular autonomic nervous system activity is assessed with both heart rate and
      systolic blood variabilities

      Sensitivity to experimentally-induced pain is measured using pressure pain threshold.
