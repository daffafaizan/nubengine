    
      This study is an adaptive, prospective, randomized platform trial designed to compare the
      effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic therapy with no antithrombotic therapy after
      hospitalization for 48 hours or longer for COVID-19. For Stage 1 of this study, participants
      will be randomized to either prophylactic anticoagulation or matching placebo for 30 days,
      and then followed for an additional 60 days after the completion of treatment (total duration
      of follow-up, 90 days).

      The primary objective is to determine the most effective and safe antithrombotic strategy to
      prevent the composite outcome of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, other
      venous thromboembolism, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, other arterial
      thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality by 30 days following discharge from the hospital.

      Biobanking of samples for future biomarker and mechanistic studies will be available for
      centers able to participate and collect samples from eligible participants. Samples will be
      collected at the time of enrollment and after the completion of 30 days of therapy
