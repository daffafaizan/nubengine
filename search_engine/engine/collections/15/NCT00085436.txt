      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
           treated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC
           vaccine) in combination with interleukin-2 and interferon-alfa.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, within relevant immune pathways, the treatment-related, tumor-specific immune
           response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate tumor-specific immune response with objective clinical response in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients undergo leukapheresis on day -9. Patients receive autologous
           dendritic cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC vaccine) by intranodal
           injection on days 0 and 14; interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously on days 1-5 and 15-19;
           and interferon-alfa (IFN-α) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, and
           19.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients undergo leukapheresis on days 33, 61, and 89. Patients
           receive DC vaccine by intranodal injection on days 42, 70, and 98; IL-2 IV continuously
           on days 43-47, 71-75, and 99-103; and IFN-α SC once daily on days 43, 45, 47, 71, 73,
           75, 99, 101, and 103.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
