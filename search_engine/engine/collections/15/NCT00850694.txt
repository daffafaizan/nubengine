      staging. Serum 25-OH vitamin D, intact PTH , lipid profile, serum CRP measurements and oral
      glucose tolerance tests (with glucose and insulin level measurements) will be done to assess
      the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and to assess the insulin sensitivity- resistance
      indices.
