      generalized skin thickening, scaling and underlying cutaneous inflammation. The vast majority
      are orphan disorders and are associated with extremely poor quality of life related to social
      ostracism from altered appearance, associated itchiness and discomfort, and functional
      limitations from the skin disease. Among the most common of these orphan disorders are
      autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) with its phenotypic subsets of lamellar
      ichthyosis (ARCI-LI) and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (ARCI-CIE), epidermolytic
      ichthyosis (EI) and Netherton syndrome (NS). Therapy is time-consuming for patients or
      parents and is supportive, focusing on clearance of the scaling. There are no therapies based
      on growing understanding of what causes the disease. There have been recent discoveries of
      marked elevations in expression of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17-related cytokines in
      the skin of individuals with ichthyosis, which may explain the inflammation. Psoriasis,
      another inflammatory skin disorder with redness and scaling, has now been shown to result
      from IL-17 pathway activation and IL-17A inhibition is the most effective therapy known to
      treat psoriasis. Investigators propose that IL-17-targeting therapeutics will safely suppress
      the inflammation and possibly the other features of ichthyosis, improving quality of life. In
      this long-term, open-label extension, Investigators propose to treat adults with ichthyosis
      and at least moderate erythema with subcutaneously administered anti-IL-17 antibody
      (secukinumab) and to serially assess clinical response to this therapy and its safety.
