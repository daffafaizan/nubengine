      I. To determine the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent or progressive benign
      and atypical/malignant meningiomas, despite prior therapy, as measured by six-month
      progression-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the response rate and overall-survival in this patient population.

      II. To evaluate the safety profile of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent meningiomas.

      III. To perform an exploratory study in patients with hemangioblastoma and
      hemangiopericytoma.

      IV. To assess tissue for VEGF and VEGFR to correlate with response. An exploratory analysis
      of HER-2 will be performed.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks for 6 months. Patients may
      then receive bevacizumab IV every 3 weeks for up to 12 months. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
