      one of two groups. The control group will receive the standard of care contraceptive
      counseling which includes any prenatal counseling they received as well as information from
      the nurse practitioner that rounds on them in the post-partum period. The intervention group
      will also receive the standard of care contraceptive counseling but will also watch a 10
      minute video created by the CHOICE project which counsels on different contraceptive options.
      Both groups will fill out a pre-intervention questionnaire as well as a post-intervention
      questionnaire 24hrs later. The primary outcome will be which type of contraception each woman
      chooses. The secondary outcomes will include determining if the women come to their
      post-partum visits as well as if they get the method of contraception they chose on the
      post-partum floor.
