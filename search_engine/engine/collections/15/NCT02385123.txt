      vaccine in healthy adult subjects. This study will enroll males and non-pregnant females,
      18-49 years old. The study duration is 6 years and participant duration of 180 days. The
      subjects will be screened at enrollment with a history and physical exam and laboratory
      testing to ensure they are healthy enough to participate. Qualifying subjects will be
      vaccinated with an FDA approved seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) according to the
      package insert. Approximately 450 ml of blood will be collected for the research assays
      during the course of the study. Specifically, 16 ml will be collected for screening; 48ml
      will be collected at enrollment; 96ml will be collected at visit days 7 and 14; and 64 ml
      will be collected at 28, 90, and 180 days post vaccination. The study will enroll 10 healthy
      volunteers per vaccination season in years 1, 2, and 4; as well as 20 healthy volunteers per
      vaccination season in years 5 and 6 of this study, for a total enrollment of 70 subjects.
      Individuals who complete the study will be given the option to re-enroll in subsequent years
      as long as they continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Re-enrolling subjects will
      be re-consented, given new subject identifiers, and counted towards the enrollment number
      goal for each year of participation. The primary objective of the study is to characterize
      HA-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after influenza vaccination and secondary
      objective investigate the longevity of humoral immunity to influenza virus in humans.
