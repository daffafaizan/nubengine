    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the clinical performance of a novel point-of-care diagnostic test for
      detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes
      the disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the clinical performance of provider-collected nasopharyngeal samples with
      self-collected nasal swab, cheek swab, and saliva sample using the novel SARS-CoV-2
      diagnostic test.

      II. To measure viral load and evaluate the role of viral load in COVID-19 severity.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo collection of nasopharyngeal (back of the nose) samples by a medical
      provider and self-collection of oral, saliva, and nasal samples.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 month.
