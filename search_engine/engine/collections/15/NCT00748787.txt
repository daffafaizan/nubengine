      people as in children and adolescents. The early diagnosis and treatment measures could be
      very important in order to reduce the cardiovascular risk in such populations.

      Ispaghula husk could be efficacious to reach the remission of the syndrome due to its effects
      in several important lipidic parameters.

      The study will consist in the treatment with Ispaghula husk during 4 months in patients with
      metabolic syndrome. The main variable is the remission of the metabolic syndrome following
      the IDF(International Diabetes Federation) criteria specifics for children.
