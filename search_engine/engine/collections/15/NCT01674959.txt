      as planed, but in recently reported ARTIST trial, capecitabine was admitted to concurrent
      with radiotherapy,patients who completed treatment as planed in concurrent group reach high
      as 80%. IMRT is an advanced radiotherapy technology which allows high conformal dose
      distribution to Planing Tumor Volume (PTV) and low dose to organ at risk. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of concurrent IMRT combined with capecitabine
      for the treatment of gastric cancer patients after D1/2 surgery.
