      successfully take daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for a well-defined period of time
      (3 months); Hypothesis 2: Children with early developmental impairment will better adhere to
      administration of a small quantity of slightly fishy-tasting oil than to a large quantity of
      sweet-tasting paste; Hypothesis 3: A 3 month period of daily omega-3 supplementation will
      produce some improvement in fast-mapping language skills (a dynamic vocabulary learning skill
      that has been shown to rapidly improve after exposure to beneficial intervention).
