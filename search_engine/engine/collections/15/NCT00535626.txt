      treatment of degenerative joint disease. Clinical results for cementless acetabular
      components have demonstrated excellent long-term fixation of these devices. However, so
      called 'first generation' cementless acetabular components have not had similar success
      rates. In these cases the acetabular component is often revised due to loosening, wear or
      infection.

      Revision hip arthroplasty also becomes a challenge as patients often present with severe bone
      loss and poor bone quality. This can lead to compromised initial stability, which in turn
      leads to lack of long-term fixation and failure. Acetabular revision with a cementless
      component has shown improved results over cemented fixation.

      Radiographic evaluation of the Trident® Tritanium™ Acetabular Shell will provide valuable
      early to intermediate information that may help predict the long-term success of this new
      system.

      It is the intention of this study to closely follow subjects that have undergone revision hip
      replacement with regard to implant survivorship, signs of radiographic loosening, subjects'
      function evaluated through Harris Hip Score and Lower Extremity Activity Scale, subject
      quality of life through SF-36 and adverse events.

      The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the rate of revision or pending revision (as defined
      by radiographic parameters) due to instability or lack of fixation for the Trident®
      Tritanium™ Acetabular Shell will be less than 10% at 5 years.
