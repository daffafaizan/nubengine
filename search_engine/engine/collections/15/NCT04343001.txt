      simvastatin (80mg once daily) in patients with COVID-19 infection.

      Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to one of eight study arms (aspirin only;
      losartan only; simvastatin only; aspirin and losartan; aspirin and simvastatin; losartan and
      simvastatin; aspirin, losartan and simvastatin; standard care only). Trial treatments are
      given in addition to the usual standard of care at the study hospital.

      Treatment will be started as soon as possible after randomisation and will continue until
      death, discharge or 28 days after randomisation, whichever occurs first.
