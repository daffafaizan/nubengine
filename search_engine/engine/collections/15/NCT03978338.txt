      Alzheimer's disease will be selected and divided into brain polypeptide nutrient solution
      group (experimental group) and control group according to the numerical random table. The
      experimental group will take brain polypeptide solution 60ml per day, while the control group
      took placebo in the same package 60ml per day. The observation period is 84 days. And
      follow-up will take place at 42 and 84 days .The treatment regimen remained unchanged during
      the observation period. Safety indexes include blood and urine routine, liver and kidney
      function, coagulation index, etc. Screening indexes include syphilis antibody, HIV antibody,
      hepatitis b virus antibody, hepatitis c virus antibody, folic acid, vitamin B12, etc.
      Clinical outcome indicators include a number of scales to evaluate neurological and cognitive
      functions, such as the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog).
      Mechanism related indicators such as metabolomics was used to understand the possible
      differences in metabolic indicators. It is helpful to guide the use of brain polypeptide in
      Alzheimer's patients correctly .
