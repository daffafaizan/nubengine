      chronic moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) who
      remained clinically symptomatic after guideline-directed medical treatment. After signing an
      informed consent form, subjects are enrolled and treated with the DragonFly Transcatheter
      Mitral Valve Repair System. All subjects receive clinical follow-up immediately after
      procedure, before discharge, 30 days after procedure, 6 months after procedure, and 12 months
      after procedure.

      The primary outcome is defined as a composite measure include all-cause mortality and
      recurrent heart failure hospitalization at 12 months after procedure.

      The secondary outcomes include acute procedural success, acute device success, mitral
      regurgitation degree (MRâ‰¤2+), recurrent heart failure hospitalization, NYHA class I or II at
      30 days, 6 months, and 12 months, and the improvement in 6 minutes walk test distance, left
      ventricular end-diastolic volume, quality of life change as assessed by the Kansas City
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score from baseline at 12 months after procedure.

      The safety endpoints include major adverse events (MAEs) at 30 days and 12 months after
      procedure, and all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months
      after procedure.

      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Valgen Medtech DragonFly Transcatheter Mitral
      Valve Repair System in the treatment of patients with chronic moderate to severe (3+) or
      severe (4+) functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) who remained clinically symptomatic after
      guideline-directed medical treatment, and to evaluate the product performance.
