      admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were eligible for the study. All infants
      were placed on Nellcor N600 pulsoximetry. Saturation data in two-second sampling from N600
      OXIMAX pulse oximeters (Covidian, CA) was collected using a modified Nellcor® Oxinet® III
      system (Covidian, CA and Cardiopulmonary, Milford, CT) Alarm limits were set at 83% and 93%
      while infants required oxygen supplementation and 85% to 100% when neonates were in room air.
      Desaturation events were defined as number of times the saturation fell below the low
      saturation limit set on the monitor (83% if oxygen requirement >21%, 85% if patient on room
      air). High saturation events were defined as the number of times the patient's saturation was
      above the upper saturation limit (93% if oxygen requirement >21%)

      The data collection system summarized each day in tabular form including average SPO2, number
      of low and high SPO2 events, duration of events in minutes, and the percentage of time
      infants spent outside of the intended saturation range. Primary outcome was threshold ROP
      requiring laser ablation. Data on ROP was collected during hospitalization and after
      discharge until resolution of ROP by pediatric ophthalmologist blinded to the study results.
      Secondary outcomes included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, length of hospitalization, sepsis,
      focal bowel perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis (stage 2 or greater), patent ductus
      ligation, intracranial hemorrhage, and number of red blood cell and platelet transfusions.
