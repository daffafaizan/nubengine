      carbohydrate versus EAA-enriched whey plus additional EAA using a randomized, cross-sectional
      longitudinal study design. Thirty healthy, functional and aerobic exercise trained adults
      will complete two, 5-d controlled feeding phases, one maintaining energy balance and one
      inducing energy deficit in random order and separated by at least a 7d washout period. The
      difference in post-exercise (whole-body exercise model) muscle protein synthesis and
      whole-body protein turnover between the study treatments will be determined the day after
      each 5-d controlled feeding phase. This design will test the following hypotheses: 1) The
      magnitude of post-exercise anabolic response to EAA-enriched whey protein plus carbohydrate
      are enhanced compared to EAA-enriched whey protein plus additional EAA during energy deficit;
      2) Regardless of protein treatment, the magnitude of anabolic response will be reduced during
      energy deficit compared to energy balance.
