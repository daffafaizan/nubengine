    
      This was a prospective randomized single-blinded clinical trial of ambulatory patients to
      assess the efficacy of bowel preparation and preparation-induced mucosal inflammation.

      Endoscopists who were blinded to the preparation taken, assessed both bowel cleansing by
      using the Ottawa bowel preparation assessment tool and preparation-induced mucosal
      inflammation. Acceptability was assessed by questionnaire.
