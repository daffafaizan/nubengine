      measure children's and adolescent's EI are needed. Self-report methods (e.g., 24-hour recall
      and food records) have their strengths and are frequently used to measure children's EI.
      Nonetheless, they also have significant limitations, including participant and caregiver
      burden and lack of near real-time data.

      Our group developed the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) to measure the EI of adults in
      near real-time and the validity data in adults are exceptional; the RFPM underestimates EI in
      laboratory settings by less than 6% and in free-living conditions by less than 7% compared to
      weighed foods and by less than 4% compared to doubly labeled water (DLW) over 6 days. At the
      same time, participant burden is drastically reduced compared to self-report methods, as
      participants are only required to capture images of their food selection and plate waste with
      a smartphone app and send these images to the laboratory for analysis. This validation study
      aims to assess the accuracy of the RFPM and SmartIntake app in a sample of adolescents in
      free-living conditions.
