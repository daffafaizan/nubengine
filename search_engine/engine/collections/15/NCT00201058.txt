      Teenagers are among an age group that has seen dramatic increases in deaths from asthma. In
      Detroit, asthma death rates for teenagers are high relative to younger ages, despite a higher
      prevalence in the latter age group. Early studies suggest that inadequate asthma management
      plays a significant role in these grim statistics.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study hypothesis is that students randomized to the intervention group will have lower
      asthma-related morbidity as determined by fewer emergency department visits and
      hospitalizations at the time of the 12-month follow-up. Based on a second hypothesis of
      better functional status among students randomized to the intervention group, secondary
      outcomes include fewer symptom-days, symptom-nights, school days missed, and days of
      restricted activity at the time of the 12-month follow-up. In addition, it is hypothesized
      that students in the intervention group will have higher scores on the Juniper Pediatric
      Quality of Life scale at 12 months. Finally, it is hypothesized that intervention students
      would exhibit positive changes in adherence behavior, having a rescue inhaler nearby, and
      smoking at the 12-month follow-up.
