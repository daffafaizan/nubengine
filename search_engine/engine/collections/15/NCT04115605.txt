      multicenter prospective, observational (i.e. naturalistic) post-marketing clinical follow-up
      of women for who stress urinary incontinence was diagnosed and will be treated with Altis
      Single Incision Sling System. Therefore these patients will be asked to allow to use their
      clinical data and answer some questionnaires. The patients'data will be collected in routine
      clinical practice before, during and after surgery until 12 months. Then, questionnaires will
      be mailed to the participants annually during 2 additional years.
