      cerebral oxygenation (SctO2) using non-invasive probes. A high incidence cerebral
      desaturation events (CDE-defined as a decrease in SctO2 values below 20% of baseline measures
      or absolute SctO2 values ≤ 55 for ≥ 15 seconds) have been observed in previous investigation
      of patients undergoing shoulder surgery in BCP with hyperventilation. The investigators
      hypothesize that the incidence of CDE will be reduced in patients ventilated at normocapnic
      levels (end-tidal carbon dioxide values (ETCO2) of 40-42 mm Hg) when compared to subjects
      hyperventilated (ETCO2 of 30-32 mm Hg) in the operating room. Patients undergoing shoulder
      surgery in the BCP will be randomized to a hypocapnic group (ETCO2 of 30-32 mm Hg) or a
      normocapnic group (ETCO2 of 40-42 mm Hg). Cerebral oxygenation will be measured continuously
      throughout the procedure to assess perioperative SctO2 values and the incidence of CDE. The
      investigators previously observed an association between CDE in the operating room and
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. Therefore, the effect of ventilatory pattern and
      intraoperative SctO2 on clinical recovery will also be determined.
