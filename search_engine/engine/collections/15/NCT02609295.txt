      nondiabetic and borderline-to-moderate hypercholesterolemic (200mg/dL ≤ serum cholesterol ≤
      300mg/dL) subjects, not taking any medications and supplements to affect lipid metabolism,
      platelet function and inflammation, divided into two groups: an α-linolenic acid (ALA) group
      [1.2 g (two capsules) of perilla oil daily; 497 mg ALA] and a placebo group (1.2 g of
      medium-chain triglyceride oil daily).
