    
      Phase 1, pre-intervention: The first twelve weeks will include 25 random visits to main ICU
      and point observations of all venous access devices under parameters like condition of
      dressing, connectors and documentation. This will also include the comparison of incidence of
      CLABSI in the pre and post intervention phase.

      Phase 2, intervention: Next four weeks will be an intervention in the form of intensive
      training and education of the HCW (doctors and nurses). The intensive training will be in the
      form of an online presentation in which the investigators would have videos on care and
      maintenance of venous access devices, and the importance of documentation of days of
      insertion and change of dressing.

      Phase 3, post-intervention: Another twelve weeks, post-intervention, again 25 random visits
      will be done to collect point observations about the same parameters of venous access devices
      and documentation as done in phase 1.

      Statistical analysis: Each of these point observation parameters (for central or peripheral
      venous access) will be finally categorized as appropriate/inappropriate as per guidelines for
      best practice.

      The compiled data from pre and post intervention phases would be compared. All the
      categorical parameters (appropriate/inappropriate) will be compared using chi-square test.
      All the quantitative parameters (e.g. incidence of CLABSI) will be compared using a paired
      t-test
