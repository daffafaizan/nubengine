      MRI techniques. The number and size of uncovered areas will be studied, and the upper genital
      tract will be examined for the presence of topical gel using MRI. MRIs will be performed with
      both a standard pelvic coil and an enhanced resolution endo-rectal coil in order to obtain
      maximal resolution. MRI images will be acquired before and after simulated coitus.
