      trial, initiated and implemented conjointly by the Nephrology and Cardiovascular Surgery
      Departments at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL. We propose to
      study whether lowering uric acid provides significant renal and cardiovascular protection in
      subjects undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Up to 30 patients presenting for elective or
      urgent cardiovascular surgery with uric acid level > 6.5 mg/dl and estimated glomerular
      filtration of 30 - 60 ml/min will be included in the study. Patients recruitment will
      continue until up to 30 patients have completed the study, taking into account expected
      patient loss due to withdrawal of consent, incomplete study and other reasons.

      Patients will be randomized to a control group or rasburicase group. Rasburicase or identical
      placebo will be administered to each group after randomization. A selected number of patients
      may undergo additional testing for mechanistic (non-clinical) secondary endpoints.
