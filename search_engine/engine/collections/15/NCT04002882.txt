      cystic fibrosis (CF) have a higher propensity to increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT)
      accumulation and decreased lean body mass (LBM) compared to healthy controls, and this
      dysregulation in adipose and protein deposition exacerbates glucose intolerance and lung
      function decline. A sub-set of participants with CF will be followed longitudinally for two
      years (n=40). The investigators will conduct detailed body composition, fat distribution,
      metabolic, and nutritional phenotyping in this cohort. Body fat distribution will be assessed
      with MRI. Whole body composition will be assessed with DEXA. Glucose tolerance will be
      assessed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and mathematical modeling of the
      C-peptide and insulin response to glucose. Lung health will be assessed by objective clinical
      data and self-reported symptoms.
