      have inhibitory effects on TGF-beta 1 production and can limit the progression of liver
      fibrosis.

      Therefore, the angiotensin II could be another mediator of the synthesis of the
      extra-cellular matrix at the hepatic level, opening new perspectives with the antagonists of
      angiotensin II receptors drugs (ARA2/sartans).

      This study is a randomized, double blind, multi-center, parallel assignment, and efficacy
      study.
