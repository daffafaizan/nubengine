      and approximately 20-25% of patients with ALL. The protein created by this unusual trait
      causes normal cells within the body to become cancer cells, and then causes these cells to
      grow and divide at a rapid rate. Researchers think that the protein "Growth Factor Receptor
      Bound Protein-2 (Grb-2)" plays an important role in the rapid growth of leukemic cells. The
      study drug (BP1001) may be able to inhibit the cells from making Grb-2. Researchers hope that
      without this protein, the leukemia cells will die.

      Up to 60 patients are expected to be enrolled on this study.

      Part A: Dose escalation: Each cohort will receive BP1001 at a dose higher than the previous
      group.

      Part B: Dose-expansion Cohorts: Subjects with relapsed or refractory AML will receive
      escalating doses of BP1001 concurrently with fixed low-dose ara-C (LDAC)

      The study drug is an antisense molecule complementary to the messenger RNA (mRNA) code for
      the cell's expression of the protein Grb-2. The study drug is incorporated into lipid (fat)
      particles known as liposomes. This incorporation process is part of the manufacturing process
      and is done before the study drug is administered. The liposomes (which carry the study drug)
      will be administered intravenously twice a week for 28 days. Subjects enrolled in Part B of
      the study will receive study drug twice a week for 28 days concurrently with low dose ara-C,
      self administered twice daily for 10 consecutive days.
