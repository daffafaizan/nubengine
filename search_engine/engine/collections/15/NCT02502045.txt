      study in order to increase our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) phenomenology.
      Research has shown that the severity of sleep disturbance and dementia advance in parallel
      and possibly in a manner amenable to therapeutic intervention. In AD, sleep disruption is
      characterized by changes in sleep architecture. It is our contention that neuropathology
      specific to AD alters the circadian system at the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
      Environmental light is the most powerful regulator of this circadian system,4,5 and is known
      to have a significant regulatory effect on pineal melatonin synthesis and secretion via the
      SCN and multisynaptic pathways downstream from the SCN. This study will explore further the
      efficacy of a particular type of therapeutic light intervention in regulating the circadian
      system in AD, using data analytic methods capable of detecting changes at multiple time
      scales. Our central hypothesis is that properly-timed light exposure in individuals with AD
      will synchronize disorganized circadian and sleep-wake rhythms and improve functional
      plasticity [approximate entropy (ApEn), fractal dimension (FD)], thereby resulting in
      increased sleep efficiency (SE), reductions in sleep fragmentation (SF), reduced excessive
      daytime sleepiness (EDS) and dementia-related behaviors, and improvements in cognition and
      other daytime behaviors. Women are nearly twice as likely as men to develop AD due to longer
      life expectance and emerging evidence. In light of this increased risk and also to enhance
      other aspects of biological uniformity in our study, this project will investigate women with
      AD.
