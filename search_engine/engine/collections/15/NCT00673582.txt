      rosuvastatin 10mg/day or placebo for a period of 96 weeks. B-mode carotid ultrasound will
      assess the primary outcome measure of average total thickness (a composite measurement of
      intima media thickness and total plaque area) at baseline, 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks. We
      hypothesize that rosuvastatin will be significantly more effective with respect to inhibition
      of change in average total thickness between baseline and 96 weeks compared to placebo.
