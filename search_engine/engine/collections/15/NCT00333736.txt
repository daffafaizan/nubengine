      quality of life questionnaire, the MOS-HIV questionnaire; ISR questionnaire and a
      satisfaction questionnaire to patients that have used a standard need to inject enfuvirtide
      for at least one month. As well, demographics and laboratory data will be collected. The same
      procedures will be given 1 month after the use of Biojector in a follow-up visit.
