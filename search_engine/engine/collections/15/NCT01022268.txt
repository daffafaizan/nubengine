      cause severe illness and death. The emergence of Influenza A subtype (H1N1) as a major cause
      of childhood severe illness in 2009 permitted further study of how this virus triggers severe
      disease, and how the inflammatory response to H1N1 differs from other infections. It is
      likely that host-mediated inflammatory processes triggered by the infecting agent contributes
      to severe illness. In addition, viral infection induces profound changes in the innate immune
      response to common bacterial pathogens, with increased bacterial colonisation of normally
      sterile lower airway. Thus both host and bacterial factors may contribute to lung damage in
      severe respiratory infection.

      This study was initiated to identify the aetiology and immunopathologic mechanisms of
      childhood respiratory infection (Immunopathology of Respiratory Infection Study - IRIS),
      recruiting children with suspected respiratory infection or respiratory failure (and
      controls). This dataset will provide a unique resource for further study of disease
      mechanisms in children with a range of infections including H1N1/09 infection, Respiratory
      Syncytial Virus (RSV), Rhinovirus, other common respiratory viruses and severe bacterial
      infections.
