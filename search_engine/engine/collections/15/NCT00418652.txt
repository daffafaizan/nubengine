      for over the dorsal stream (PO3 EEG site) or over the vertex.

      First they performed a perceptual closure task which asked them to identify an object in a
      series of six progressively less degraded pictures.

      Then, they also performed a control task previously shown not to be mediated by the LOC and
      not to be impaired in schizophrenia: The perception of illusory contours.
