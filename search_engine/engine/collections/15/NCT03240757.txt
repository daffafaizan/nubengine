      acids (FFA)) elicited by three diverse test-meal loads followed by a 20-min bout of
      low-intensity aerobic exercise were investigated. All subjects underwent a 50-g OGTT (A) and
      3 test-meal loads: milk and cereals (B1); milk, apple and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake
      (B2); milk, bread, apple and hazelnut chocolate cream (B3). In the exercise trial,
      participants cycled for 20 minutes at 40% VO2max, 100 minutes after load ingestion.
