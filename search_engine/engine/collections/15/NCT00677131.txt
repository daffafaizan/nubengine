      pharmacists in National Taiwan University Hospital. We designed twelve questions about
      reconstitution, storage, and administration of oral antibiotic suspension from powder dosage
      form in a questionnaire. We will recruit pediatric patients who are prescribed one of the two
      oral antibiotics powder for suspension, Augmentin and Zithromax. We will randomize the family
      of these patients into one of the following three groups:

        1. To read the package insert of the drug

        2. To read the education information provided by Pharmacy of NTUH

        3. Oral education provided by the pharmacist

      Then we will ask them the twelve questions in the questionnaire and record their answer.
      Eventually, we will be able to compare the number of the correct answer, and to evaluate the
      difference on patient knowledge of reconstitution, storage, and administration of oral
      antibiotic suspension from powder dosage form between these three groups.
