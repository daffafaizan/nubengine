           written consent for this study;

        2. Perform biopsy to obtain tissue for organoids and TILs, coculture to screening
           anti-tumor T cells, select monoclonal T cells;

        3. Clone TCR sequence; collect PBMCs from the blood of the patients, isolate and activate
           the T cells and produce TCR-T cells;

        4. Test the quality and killing activity of the TCR-T cells and then transplant back the
           patients via systemic (vein and/or artery) or local injections, and follow up closely to
           collect related clinical data as needed;

        5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.
