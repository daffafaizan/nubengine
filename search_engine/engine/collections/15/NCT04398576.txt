    
      A quasi-experimental three-arm implementation study will be undertaken in Flanders (Belgium)
      to assess the effects of tailored training and support to general practitioners (GPs) alone
      or in an area context of alcohol community actions and compared to 'support as usual' on GP's
      performance in terms of early identification of hazardous and harmful drinking and brief
      intervention.

      The study will last 18 months and will take place in three cities of comparable size. In each
      area at least 28 GPs will be recruited.

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of consulting adult patients screened for
      hazardous and harmful alcohol use at the end-point of an 18-month implementation period. The
      secondary outcomes will be the screening rate as assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months and
      the proportion of patients screening positive for hazardous and harmful alcohol use that
      receive a brief intervention at 3,6,9, 12, 15 and 18 months. Furthermore, the relation
      between GP's views and needs and practices' contexts, and EIBI performance will be explored.

      Data regarding screening and brief intervention activities will be collected from the
      electronic health records (EHR).
