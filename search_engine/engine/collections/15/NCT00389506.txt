      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of pretreatment with fludarabine phosphate and
           cyclophosphamide in preventing neutralization of antibodies in patients with
           CD25-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with LMB-2 immunotoxin.

        -  Determine the response duration in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  Correlate serum levels of LMB-2 immunotoxin with toxicity and response in these
           patients.

        -  Assess the development of neutralizing antibodies and the effect of these antibodies on
           blood levels of LMB-2 immunotoxin and toxicity.

        -  Correlate soluble Tac-peptide levels with treatment response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, pilot study.

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 60
      minutes on days 1-4 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 5 and
      continuing until blood counts recover.

      Beginning 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients receive LMB-2 immunotoxin IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression.

      Blood is obtained prior to and after chemotherapy and then periodically during LMB-2
      immunotoxin therapy for pharmacokinetic studies to measure lymphocyte subsets.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
