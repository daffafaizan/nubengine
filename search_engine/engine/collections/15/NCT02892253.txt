      which is definitive in 1-4% of operated patients (1). This complication is mainly due to
      surgery-induced parathyroid dysfunction, which could be improved by a better intraoperative
      identification of the parathyroids. Intraoperative parathyroid auto-fluorescence
      visualization (without any dye injection) using near infrared light (NIR) is an emerging
      technique, which allows correct identification of normal parathyroids in almost all cases
      (2), but the clinical impact of NIR is unknown.

      The aim of this prospective, comparative randomized study, is to compare 2 groups of
      patients: patients operated with NIR (NIR+) vs patients operated without NIR (NIR-).

      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of intraoperative use of NIR camera
      on postoperative hypocalcemia. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of NIR on the
      visualization, autotransplantation and inadvertent resection rates during TT.
