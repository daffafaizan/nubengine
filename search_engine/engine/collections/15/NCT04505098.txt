    
      For the MITIGATE study, eligible members receiving care within Kaiser Permanente Northern
      California (KPNC) will be identified and screened electronically in a 1:10 intervention to
      control allocation (i.e., IPE vs. usual care) stratified by age and pre-existing respiratory
      status. Patients randomly assigned and enrolled into the intervention arm will be asked to
      take IPE (2 grams by mouth twice daily) for a minimum of 6 months and until study completion.
      Patients assigned to the control arm (i.e., usual care) will be passively followed only
      electronically via the electronic health record (EHR).
