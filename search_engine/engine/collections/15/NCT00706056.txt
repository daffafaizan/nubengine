      progress to blindness. Traditionally, glaucoma and its treatment have been closely linked to
      intraocular pressures. In normal tension glaucoma, damage to the optic nerve occurs without
      any increase in intraocular pressure. Normal tension glaucoma most often occurs in the
      elderly and can lead to loss of sight and significant disability. Subjects with progressive
      visual field loss are often a highly motivated group of subjects, ready to take an active
      part in the treatment of their condition. Investigating the risk factors that contribute to
      the development of normal-tension glaucoma may shed light on the progression of the disease.

      Subjects with normal tension glaucoma will have their demographic and clinical
      characteristics recorded and their eyes examined at baseline, 6-months and 12 months.
      Subjects will wear an external blood pressure cuff for 48 hours that will record blood
      pressure every 30 minutes. This same blood pressure recording procedure will be performed at
      baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months. At these same time intervals, visual fields will
      also be measured, as per routine clinical care, by the treating ophthalmologist. The results
      of the visual field testing will be recorded. The primary outcome of the study will be visual
      field abnormalities and their relationship to dips in systemic blood pressure. Results will
      be published and will be used as a base for future projects that may impact treatment and the
      understanding of risk factors of normal tension glaucoma.
