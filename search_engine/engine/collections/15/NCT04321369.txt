      populations as well as advance the public health emergency (PHE) response to the community
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially as the number of cases and deaths continues to rise in
      many geographies. Leveraging our presence in the Seattle/Puget Sound area with Everett
      Clinic, we intend to develop a model that can screen a large number of patients at varying
      levels of risk and manifestation of clinical symptoms while conserving personal protective
      equipment (PPE) and decreasing transmission risk to health care workers. This will also serve
      to support the enterprise and public health response. Towards this goal, we must first assess
      the equivalence between clinician-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to patient-collected
      tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 across a broad
      cross-section of the population.
