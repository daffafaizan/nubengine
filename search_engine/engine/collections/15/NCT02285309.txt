      setting of cardiac surgery. In many centres around the world nearly 100% of pateints
      undergoing cardiac surgery are monitored using this modality. There are several studies and
      observational reviews suggesting intraoperative TOE can change management and thus indirectly
      influence outcome in patients undergoing valve, aortic or bypass graft surgery. Certainly in
      our centre at The Heart Hospital, it is routine practce to perform an intraoperative TOE in
      all patients undergoing cardiac surgery in order to guide surgical and anaesthetic management
      of the patient. Despite this use of TOE there is very little evidence of how TOE influences
      patient related outcomes, both morbidity and mortality.

      Several advances have occurred over the years involving both better technology to image the
      heart with TOE along with the development of novel measurements of heart function. As
      technology has evolved, many modalities and measurement have not been validated in the
      setting of cardiac surgery. In our observational clincal trial we aim to investigate the
      following:

        1. The significance of measurements involving left heart relaxation (LV diastolic function)
           and its relation to outcome measures.

        2. The significance of measurements involving the right heart relaxation function and itrs
           relation to outcome measures.

        3. The influence of drugs such as enoximone on these outcome measures.

      While many of these measurements have been validated in the care of medical patients, they
      have not been examined in the surgical setting. In addition, its ability to predict outcome
      has never been tested. We believe this study will help us answer these important questions.
