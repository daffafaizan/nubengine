      to the dental clinic when experiencing pain which commonly means the decay is deep and is
      very close to or has penetrated the nerve of the tooth. When the decay is very close to the
      pulp or nerve of the tooth, a procedure called pulp capping is done in an attempt to save the
      tooth and to prevent root canal treatment. A material has been introduced to the market for
      this purpose, called Biodentine. This study aims to investigate the nerve response to this
      material and to assess the quality of the overlying filling compared to another material
      (glass ionomer cement) used more commonly. Also, X-rays are a routine procedure used to
      assess how close the decay is to the nerve and to see if there are abnormalities around the
      tooth. However conventional X-rays may not be accurate. A new technique called Cone Beam
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) has been developed which shows a 3-D image of the tooth and may be
      more accurate. We aim to compare the images gained from conventional X-rays and CBCT to help
      improve diagnosis and care planning for patients.
