      completion ranging around 15 minutes in duration. Patients undergoing cataract surgery are
      typically given sedatives and often times pain medication (e.g. opioids) just prior to and
      during the procedure. The overwhelming majority of patients are given these medications via
      intravenous administration. The insertion of an IV line has been associated with patient
      complaints of pain and bruising, and can increase the administrative burden on the clinical
      staff. In addition to the national crisis surrounding opioid abuse, opioids have many
      negative side effects during cataract surgery such as respiratory depression, dizziness,
      nausea, and post- operative vomiting.

      To reduce the side effects, improve patient satisfaction, and help surgical center flow the
      Midazolam/Ketamine melt (MK Melt) has been suggested as an alternative to provide sedation
      and analgesia in subjects undergoing minor outpatient surgery, such as cataract surgery. The
      addition of ketamine should provide enough analgesia for the mild discomfort reported during
      cataract surgery. This study is intended to evaluate the MK Melt and its ability to provide
      an adequate level of both sedation and intraoperative pain control vs an active control.
