      chronic illnesses. The present study provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy of an
      online default option in enhancing the nutritional quality of online grocery purchases in
      individuals with food insecurity.

      In behavioral economics, the default option refers to the option a consumer selects if no
      active choice is made. This study aims to determine whether the use of a default prefilled
      online grocery shopping cart results in the purchase of healthier food items in individuals
      with food insecurity, compared to nutrition education. The default approach, a non-monetary
      intervention that manipulates choice architecture, improves food choice behaviors in
      individuals facing significant financial constraints. The intervention is potentially broadly
      scalable via online platforms.

      It was hypothesized that the default option effectively increases the nutritional quality of
      foods purchased online, compared to nutrition education.

      Fifty participants recruited from food pantries in New York in 2018 were randomized to: (1)
      review nutrition information before selecting groceries for a week using a local grocery
      store's online shopping and delivery service (n = 23) or (2) modify a default prefilled
      online shopping cart containing groceries that meet nutritional guidelines according to their
      personal preferences (n = 27).

      Primary outcome measures capture the nutritional quality of groceries purchased. Our primary
      nutritional outcomes include servings of whole grains fruits and vegetables, fiber, daily
      calories, fat, saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol content.
