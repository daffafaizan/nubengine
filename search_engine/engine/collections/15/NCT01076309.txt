      surgeon because Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) might occur. However, the question
      is whether this has any practical implication for the outcomes of surgery. In this study we
      investigate whether cornea is damage during surgery on Tamsulosin patient. In an
      observational study 30 cataract patients taking Tamsulosin is compared to 30 patients not
      taking Tamsulosin, but otherwise similar. Number of patients is based on power calculation.

      Cornea is examined by specular microscopy.
