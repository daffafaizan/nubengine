      accuracy of PET-acetate imaging in the assessment of response of persons undergoing
      first-line docetaxel for CRPC. If successful, the current research could lead to the
      incorporation of PET-acetate into future study protocols where continuation of chemotherapy
      is based on early PET-acetate results, provided that effective second-line therapy options
      are available (which is an expectation for the near future, based on several ongoing and
      presented phase III trials).
