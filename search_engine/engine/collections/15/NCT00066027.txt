      can reduce alveolar bone density loss in postmenopausal osteopenic women with periodontitis
      and not on hormone replacement therapy (i.e., estrogen deficient). The effects of LDD on
      alveolar bone height loss, progressive periodontal attachment loss, systemic bone mineral
      density, gingival crevicular fluid biochemical markers of collagen degradation and bone
      resorption and serum biomarkers of bone formation, bone resorption and inflammation also will
      be assessed. In addition, another objective is to determine if the microbial effects obtained
      with LDD over two years are equivalent to a placebo control. This clinical trial involves two
      clinical sites: the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry and Stony
      Brook University School of Dental Medicine. A total of 128 postmenopausal osteopenic women
      with periodontitis between the ages of 45 and 70 at the time of telephone screening will be
      randomized to LDD or placebo groups and subjects will be followed for two years.
