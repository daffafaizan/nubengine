      To determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP
      adenovirus in combination with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and valganciclovir (vGCV) prodrug
      therapy and standard chemoradiation. Fifteen to 30 subjects (5 cohorts of 3 - 6 subjects
      each) with non-metastatic, unresectable pancreatic cancer will receive a single intratumoral
      injection of the Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenovirus at one of five dose levels (1 x 10e10
      vp, 3 x 10e10 vp, 1 x 10e11 vp, 3 x 10e11 vp, 1 x 10e12 vp) under endoscopic ultrasound
      (EUS)-guidance. Beginning three days later, subjects will receive 3 weeks (15 days) of 5-FC
      and vGCV prodrug therapy concomitant with a 6 week (30 day) course of capecitabine
      chemotherapy and 54 Gy conformal radiotherapy.

      The primary endpoint is toxicity at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints are: 1) tumor
      (radiological) response, 2) time to disease progression, 3) survival, 4) persistence of
      Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenoviral DNA in blood, 5) infectious Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP
      adenovirus in blood, and 6) HSV-1 TK gene expression in the pancreas.
