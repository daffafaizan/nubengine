      inclusion/exclusion criteria, a first baseline assessment will be conducted. Within one to
      two days, a second set of baseline data will be collected for performance measures. Subjects
      will then be randomly assigned to be fitted with C-Brace or to continue wearing the current
      KAFO/SCO. After fitting, an accommodation period follows that will last up to 14 days prior
      to the initial home use. The first follow-up data collection will occur after three months of
      the initial home use period. Afterwards, the patients will cross over to KAFO/SCO or C-Brace,
      respectively. The participants who were fitted with C-Brace will cross over to KAFO/SCO and
      vice versa. Another accommodation phase will be offered for both C-Brace and KAFO/SCO wearers
      to ensure that subjects can properly use both devices before the cross-over home use period.
      The second follow-up data collection will occur after 3-months of the cross-over home use
      period. At the end of the study, the patients can choose to keep the C-Brace for up to 24
      months until reimbursement or to return to their original KAFO/SCO.
