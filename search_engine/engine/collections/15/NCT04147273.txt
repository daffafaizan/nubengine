      shortcomings compared to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We aimed to compare these two
      methods and used blood glucose measurements in venous blood (IV) as a reference. Postprandial
      blood glucose levels were measured after 50 g oral glucose load and after the consumption of
      a portion of different foods containing 50 g of carbohydrates. We also evaluated the
      associations between postprandial glucose responses and the clinical characteristics of the
      participants at the beginning of the study. Incremental area under the curve (AUCi) of
      postprandial blood glucose was calculated for 1 h (AUCi 0-60) and 2 h (AUCi 0-120). Despite
      considerable inter-individual variability of postprandial glycemic responses, CGM evaluated
      postprandial glycemic excursions which had comparable results compared to standard blood
      glucose measurements under real-life conditions.
