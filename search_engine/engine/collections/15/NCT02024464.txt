    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-masked, randomized clinical trial comparing
      Cataract Extraction (CE) + Hydrus Microstent to CE surgery + iStent implant for the reduction
      of intraocular pressure in patients with a positive diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma,
      pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, or pigmentary dispersion glaucoma with an operable cataract.
      Eligible patients will be scheduled for cataract surgery. At the conclusion of successful
      cataract surgery and the placement of a posterior-chamber IOL, qualified subjects will be
      randomized to receive either the Hydrus Microstent or the iStent implant. Post-operative
      follow-up visits will be conducted at regular intervals.
