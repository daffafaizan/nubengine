      the peritoneal cavity (inside surface of the abdomen) and can be found with gall bladder,
      liver, colon, appendix, ovarian, pancreas, mesothelioma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, rectal,
      small bowel and stomach cancers. It broadly includes multiple tumors that develop in and line
      the peritoneal abdominal cavity and linings. These tumors may be difficult to completely
      remove surgically and may recur despite conventional systemic chemotherapy, thereby resulting
      in poor patient outcomes. In preclinical studies, GL-ONC1, an oncolytic vaccinia virus, has
      shown the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 30
      different human tumors. A Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of
      GL-ONC1 intravenously administered to patients with a variety of solid tumor entities has
      shown that GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of
      antitumor activity. This additional Phase I/II study seeks to evaluate GL-ONC1 administered
      repetitively every 4 weeks up to 4 cycles via infusion using an implanted catheter in the
      peritoneal cavity. In Phase I, patients will be individually assessed for safety and dose
      limiting toxicity. The study aims of Phase II portion are continued collection of safety
      information to better define the tolerability of GL-ONC1, as well as viral replication and
      the action or effect of GL-ONC1 in humans at the selected dose level and dosing schedule for
      future trials. Throughout both phases of the study, anti-tumor effects will be evaluated.
