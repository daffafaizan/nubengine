      of age with a primary diagnosis of ADHD free of other major psychopathology. The six-week
      treatment phase will be proceeded by a 1-3 week screening phase.

      The study cohort will consist of 10 children with ADHD combined type and 10 children with
      ADHD predominantly inattentive type who complete the study.

      Cognitive measures will be assessed prior to APZ therapy and after 6 weeks of APZ treatment.

      Safety assessments and measures of ADHD symptomatology will be collected prior to and during
      APZ therapy.

      While receiving APZ treatment, patients will be seen at baseline, Week 1,2,3,4, and 6.
