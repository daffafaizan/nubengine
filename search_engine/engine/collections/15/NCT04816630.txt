      that best identify patients with COVID-19 disease who tested SAR-CoV-2 positive by standard
      of care (SOC) COVID-19 testing.

      A feasibility study of consecutive adult patients who presented to the hospital with symptoms
      suggestive of COVID-19 or respiratory infection and whose standard of care testing involves a
      CBC-DIFF and microbial testing including RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be enrolled. This
      study will evaluate MDW and other CPD parameters performance in COVID-19 patients and the
      ability of MDW to identify RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients as well as potential added value
      to RT-PCR tests of MDW. A minimum of 50 COVID-19 positive and 150 COVID-19 negative patients
      meeting inclusion criteria will be evaluated. Patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19
      and who have RT-PCR test samples drawn will be retested on the DxH900 hematology analyzer to
      capture baseline MDW results. In addition, a retrospective data extraction will be performed
      for those patient samples tested during the Post Market study during the COVID-19 pandemic
      that meet the revised study population.
