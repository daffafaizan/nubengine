      receive at least four rounds, and state that they notice thinking or memory problems during
      their first two cycles of chemotherapy. Patients will be given FACT-Cog PCI (Version 3).
      Patients that score less than 63, a score that reflects moderate to severe cognitive
      problems, are confirmed eligible. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 in blocks of 4.

      Treatment will begin at the start of the third cycle of chemotherapy and continue for 9
      weeks. Thyroid hormone testing will be conducted at baseline and at the end of week 6 for
      patients with a history of thyroid disease.

      Patients will receive ashwagandha 500 mg po BID or placebo. The investigators and
      participants will be blinded to group assignment.

      Endpoint testing including the FACT-Cog PCI and total score, Hopkins verbal learning test,
      trail making test (abstraction and executive function), and Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE)
      will be administered at baseline and after 9 weeks of treatment. Six months after stopping
      the study, patients will receive a link to a REDCap database to complete the FACT-Cog and
      state whether they used ashwagandha once they completed the study.

      Active study participation will be for 9 weeks.
