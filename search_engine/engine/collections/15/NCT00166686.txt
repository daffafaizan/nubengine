      has improved dramatically over the last decades and is expected to continue to rise as a
      result of improved treatment. The increased survival in pediatric oncology, however, has been
      associated with an increased recognition of neurobehavioral sequelae of cancer and its
      treatment. Current understanding of the incidence, pathogenesis, and natural history of these
      neurobehavioral abnormalities is limited and considerable individual variation in the
      presence and severity of these complications has been noted. Central nervous system (CNS)
      abnormalities associated with childhood cancer and its treatment have been demonstrated on at
      least three levels which may be interrelated: neurobehavioral abnormalities, brain imaging
      abnormalities, and neurotransmitter abnormalities.

      Patients will be randomized to either clonidine or placebo. Study medication will be
      administered in a double blind fashion beginning with a four-week dose titration period
      followed by a four-week maintenance period. Total duration of dosing is 18 weeks. Patients
      who derive a benefit from clonidine administration may continue for an additional 30 weeks of
      therapy. PK samples will be collected at weeks 9 and 18.
