      incidence of surgical site infections at the groin after vascular procedures is between 3%
      and 30%. This incidence is up to five times higher than the expected incidence of infection
      in clean cases. Risk factors for postoperative surgical site infection in patients undergoing
      vascular surgery may include age, co-morbidities, use of prosthetic grafts and repeat
      operations.

      A systematic review in 2011 concluded that arginine supplemented diets among perioperative
      patients were associated with a reduced rate of surgical infection and reduced overall length
      of hospital stay.

      The study aims are to determine if taking an oral nutritional supplement reduces the rate of
      wound complications post lower limb revascularization.
