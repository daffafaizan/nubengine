      biochemical evidence of ongoing coagulation activation, sickle cell disease (SCD) is often
      referred to as a hypercoagulable state. However, the contribution of coagulation activation
      to the pathogenesis of SCD remains uncertain. While the majority of clinical studies using
      anticoagulants have shown no convincing benefit in the prevention or treatment of acute pain
      episodes, most of these studies were small and poorly controlled. Furthermore, because the
      acute pain episode appears to result from the occlusion of postcapillary venules by the
      interaction of red blood cells and other cellular elements with the vascular endothelium and
      subendothelial matrix proteins, it may not be the ideal clinical endpoint for assessing the
      effect of anticoagulation in SCD patients. Pulmonary hypertension (PHT), a common
      complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and with histopathologic
      findings of in situ thrombosis involving pulmonary vessels, represents a clinical endpoint
      that is likely due, at least in part, to increased thrombin generation, and may therefore be
      used to evaluate the contribution of coagulation activation to the pathophysiology of SCD.
      Twenty patients with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) or sickle beta zero thalassemia (Sickle beta
      zero thalassemia) and mild PHT who meet the eligibility requirements will be enrolled, 10
      patients to receive anticoagulation with warfarin and 10 to receive placebo rfor 12 months of
      treatment.
