      healthcare professionals and biomedical engineers. This prototype software (run on a mobile
      device) retrieves patient results from various laboratory and clinical databases (securely
      within the Trust firewall) and displays this to the clinician making the prescribing
      decision. Furthermore a machine learning algorithm is applied to the data, and similar
      anonymised historical cases (and the antimicrobials prescribed and the clinical outcomes) are
      also displayed to the clinician to further inform their decision making. The prototype has
      been designed for use in intensive care, where the risk of infection is high, but through the
      research project detailed here, the software will be developed and validated across other
      areas of hospital patient care. Furthermore there is a key need to engage patients with how
      decisions are made around antimicrobial prescribing. The investigator propose to adapt the
      prototype to meet these needs. This system should improve patient safety and help preserve
      the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials
