      intervention groups.The patient participants will be children anywhere on the spectrum of
      mild to severe AD and they will be stratified into four strata: a) Those with severe AD and
      no medical intervention escalation, b) Those with mild AD and no medical intervention
      escalation, c) Those with severe AD and medical intervention escalation, and d) Those with
      mild AD and medical intervention escalation. Group 1 will be a paper handout for group 1 and
      an educational video for group 2 as a form of TPE. Subjects will be recruited in clinic after
      they are screened for AD during their regular dermatology appointment. The research team will
      provide the patient and parent with a brief introduction to the study, what it involves for
      the patient, any foreseeable risks, and the compensation. If they agree to participate, a
      consent/permission form will be given to the parent/guardian to sign. After an initial
      evaluation of the patient's AD, subjects will receive an initial survey and POEM
      questionnaire on an iPad via RedCap that will address the condition of their AD. The patient
      will be administered a form of TPE as the intervention. The intervention will first be
      viewed/read in clinic, followed by a brief set of questions from the research team to
      determine the amount of information retained on an immediate level. A follow-up appointment
      will be scheduled for the patient. Group 2 will receive a slip of paper with a link to the
      videos, so the TPE will be accessible outside the clinic.
