    
      A retrospective study will be conducted using prospectively collected hospital inpatient data
      over a duration of over 5 years (Jan. 1, 2010 - June 30, 2015) using a large US electronic
      health database (Cerner HealthFacts; Kansas City, MO). Patients who underwent a qualifying
      cardiac surgery (verified through use of selected valid International Classification of
      Diseases-9 procedure codes and/or Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes) will be
      included. Each patient's cohort designation will be defined based upon whether he/she did or
      did not receive a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) for monitoring purposes. Propensity scores,
      which take into account patient and hospital demographics, patient comorbidities, surgical
      type (isolated coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], valve, aortic surgery, multi-procedures,
      other complex nonvalvular procedures and heart transplants), and pre-operative condition (via
      an adapted EuroSCORE II) will be utilized to "match" patients who received a PAC for
      monitoring purposes with those who did not, to form a matched study cohort. Clinical outcomes
      will be monitored through index visit discharge and up to 90 days post index visit discharge.
