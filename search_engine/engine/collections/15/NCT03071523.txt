    
      Two arms RCT will be conducted as followed:

      Group A (intervention):

      Full-thickness crestal incision will be made over the edentulous ridge followed by one
      full-thickness vertical incision on the buccal side. On the buccal side, full thickness
      mucoperiosteal flap will be raised with horizontal incision 1-3 mm in depth performed in the
      buccal flap. On the lingual side, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated until
      reaching the mylohyoid line. A band of connective tissue continuing with the epimysium of the
      mylohyoid muscle is usually located in the first molar area, and is1 to 2 cm wide in a
      mesiodistal direction. This band is inserted into the inner part of the lingual flap
      approximately5 mm from the crest in an apical direction. A blunt instrument will be inserted
      below that connective band, and, with gentle traction in the coronal direction, this muscular
      insertion should be detached freeing the lingual flap from the mylohyoid muscle. Then
      Xenograft and Ti-mesh will be used to augment the defective site and the flap will then be
      sutured with interrupted sutures.

      Group B ( control ):

      Full-thickness crestal incision will be made over the edentulous ridge followed by one
      full-thickness vertical incision on the buccal side and a full thickness flap will be raised.
      Xenograft and Ti-mesh will be used to augment the defective site then incremental incisions
      of 1-3 mm into the periosteum and submucosa will be used to advance the muco-periosteal flap.
      The flap will then be sutured with interrupted sutures.
