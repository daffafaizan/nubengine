      The investigators have developed [68Ga]CBP8, a gallium-68 labeled collagen binding PET
      imaging probe, which selectively binds collagen type I. Collagen deposition is a pivotal
      event in several human conditions including radiation induced lung injury and in response to
      radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer. The investigator's studies in murine models of lung
      injury including radiation induced lung injury showed that [68Ga]CBP8 binds collagen with
      high affinity and has excellent pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles with high target
      uptake and low retention in background tissues and organs. [68Ga]CBP8 was shown in a mouse
      model to be effective for detecting lung fibrosis. [68Ga]CBP8 showed high specificity for
      pulmonary fibrosis and high target:background ratios in diseased animals. In addition,
      [68Ga]CBP8 could be used to monitor response to treatment. Ex vivo analysis of lung tissue
      from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) supported the animal findings.

      The investigators have conducted preliminary studies in humans with IPF and demonstrated a
      significant increase in [68Ga]CBP8 signal in subjects with IPF vs healthy controls.

      The investigators thus aim to evaluate [68Ga]CBP8 in human subjects with radiation induced
      lung injury and in patients undergoing radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer:

      To establish the ability of [68Ga]CBP8-PET to detect radiation-induced fibrosis in lung or
      pancreatic cancer patients through the course of disease development with repeated measures,
      and correlate signal with standard measures of radiation induced tissue injury such as HRCT
      or MRI.
