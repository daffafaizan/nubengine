      risk of developing a delay in the process of consolidation or a complete failure of it
      (pseudoarthrosis) depending on location , severity of trauma on bone, soft tissue and
      vascular structures Some of these cases are refractory to all treatment methods available
      today, requiring numerous interventions with the potential risk for recurrent infections that
      they carry. For this reason, its treatment remains a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon.

      Recent advances in knowledge of cellular and molecular biology related to the mechanism of
      bone repair and biomaterials science have been joined in a new discipline called tissue
      engineering, its implementation in clinical practice is being done so progressive.

      Cell therapy based on the use of adult stem cells (MSCs) derived from autologous bone marrow,
      introduces new applications for the repair of fractures including pseudoarthrosis and
      avascular bone necrosis.

      Its mechanism of action does not focus only on their local action, but also in the release of
      signaling molecules with autocrine and paracrine action through recruitment and activation of
      endogenous MSCs to osteoblastic differentiation and bone tissue regeneration.

      On the other hand, the seeding of MSCs on biomaterials (natural or synthetic) is more
      effective, to facilitate adherence, proliferation and extracellular matrix production in the
      area where implanted.

      Today, the investigators can say that there are experimental and clinical evidence supporting
      the effectiveness of the method.

      The investigators have designed a phase II clinical trial to check the feasibility of this
      approach.
