      not have any clinical signs or symptoms and traditional measures of ovarian reserve, such as
      basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone may be within the normal range. However, there may be
      alterations in the luteal or follicular phases(shortened follicular phase and luteal
      insufficiency) due to compromised follicle competency and alterations in the H-P-O axis.
      Therefore this aim uses novel methodology to identify subtle changes in the reproductive
      endocrine axis which may have important implications for reproduction and may signal
      reproductive senescence. Compared to yearly follicular measures of reproductive hormones,
      daily urine hormone analysis provides a more integrative assessment.

      Three groups of subjects will be recruited:

      Group 1: Otherwise healthy, mid-reproductive aged women between the ages of 20 and 35 years
      previously exposed to high dose alkylating agent therapy (or have an alkylator score of 1 or
      more), and at least 1 year from cancer treatment.

      Group 2: healthy, mid-reproductive aged women between the ages of 20 to 35 who have not been
      exposed to cancer therapy.

      Group 3: healthy, late reproductive aged women between the ages of 43-50 who have not been
      exposed to cancer therapy, nor have a history of infertility.

      Subjects in all groups must have regular menstrual cycles every 21-35 days, and have a uterus
      and both ovaries. Each participant will complete daily urinary collections for 2 menstrual
      cycles to assess reproductive hormones. The ultimate goal of this work is to better estimate
      the reproductive window, or time to menopause.
