      individuals with and without diabetes who are physically active and exercising for health
      benefits. The investigators hypothesize that insulin requirements will be inversely related
      to intensity of activity and an algorithm will be able to detect physical activity and
      automatically adjust insulin doses. Once such an algorithm has been determined for an
      individual, it can be applied to future similar situations, but ideally the algorithm will be
      dynamically refined based on closed-loop feedback information.
