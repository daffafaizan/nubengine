      one of the most important of these factors is patient expectations. In order for patients and
      health professionals to have the same priorities and meet the same realistic goals, it is
      necessary to understand what patients expect. Lumbar spine surgery expectations scale was
      created by Mancuso et al. The aim of this study was to determine the Turkish validity and
      reliability of Lumbar Spine Surgery Expectations Survey developed by Mancuso.
