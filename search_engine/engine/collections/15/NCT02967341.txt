      chromatographic (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Unbound concentration will be
      determined by adjusting the pH of the plasma samples to physiological pH (7.4) in a CO2
      incubator, followed by ultrafiltration and extraction of ciprofloxacin from the ultrafiltrate
      (as described above) prior to injection onto the HPLC system.
