    
      The study will be performed on patients who accept cardiopulmonary by-pass surgery, the
      conscious openness to participate in the study.Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking
      habits, diagnosis, additional diseases, drugs used, surgery, intervention, anesthetic agents
      used in induction and dyspepsia, peroperative supportive treatments, left ventricular
      ejection fraction, post operative blood and TDP amount CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass) time
      (min), Cross clamp time (min), cardioplegia amount and type, analgesic name and dose made,
      duration of operation, name of postoperative and perioperative support treatments ,
      perioperative and post operative intake and urine output,postoperative extubation time,
      intensive care day of hospitalization, day of hospitalization will be recorded.The study was
      planned in 3 groups.Group 1 mechanical ventilator closed group (mechanical ventilator off)
      FiO2; 50%, Flow: 2 L / min. 2 Group Tidal Volume 3-4ml / kg (TV), FIO2 50%, Flow: 2L / min,
      Frequency; 10-12 applied group. 3. Group Tidal Volume 3-4 ml / kg, PEEP: 5 cm H2O pressure,
      FIO2 50%, Flow: 2 L / min, Frequency:Planned to be the 10-12 applied group.Pre-operative,
      operative (After the cross clamp is removed) and postoperative (postoperative 24th hour)
      blood will be collected from patients participating in the study.Thiol / Disulphide, MDA,
      TAS, TOS, Catalase and Glutathione Peroxidase will be studied. All patients should be
      premedicated with 0.1 mg / kg midazolam.Fentanyl (5-8 Î¼g / kg), and rocuronium (0.5 mg / kg)
      will be used for induction of anesthesia. During anesthesia, 2% sevoflurane will be
      used.Arterial cannula to be inserted.Central venous catheter and urinary catheter will be
      placed. 3 - 5 mg / heparin and cardioplegia will be applied.The active clotting time (ACT)
      will be kept above 400.Heparin 1: to be neutralized with 1.3% of the Protamine.In the
      postoperative period, all patients will be transferred to the intensive care unit.
