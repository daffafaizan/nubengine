      mellitus (T2DM), but often at the expense of weight gain. Insulin-induced weight gain is
      obviously undesirable in an already overweight population and may negatively affect blood
      pressure, lipid levels, inflammatory and fibrinolytic parameters, adipocytokines and also
      deter further optimization of insulin therapy. It is unknown what determinants predict
      insulin-induced weight gain in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The aim of this study therefore, is to assess determinants of insulin-induced weight gain in
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a retrospective and cross-sectional study (Jansen HJ et al.,
      submitted) two extreme subgroups were identified (subjects with a weight gain above 80th
      percentile) and subgroup non-weight gainers (subjects with a weight gain below the 20th
      percentile). It was found that the gainers had less energy expenditure after initiation of
      insulin therapy than non-weight gainers. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to
      detect an association between energy expenditure and weight gain
