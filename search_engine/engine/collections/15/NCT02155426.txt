    
      This is a prospective observational non-intervention study evaluating the dynamic CTC count
      during the chemotherapy and targeted-therapy. Patients provide written informed consent and
      pass the screening. Peripheral blood will be drawn before and after the treatment.
      Relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome will be analysed. The time points of
      blood drawing are set as following: for patients receiving chemotherapy, once prior to 1st
      cycle of chemotherapy, once 3 days prior to 2nd cycle of chemotherapy, posterior to 3th cycle
      (or less than 4th cycle) of chemotherapy and once when progressive disease (PD); for patients
      receiving targeted-therapy, once prior to treatment, once 1 month after treatment, and once
      when PD. The clinical outcome of treatment will be ultimately obtained.
