      area-adjusted left ventricular mass in anthracycline-treated survivors of childhood cancer.
      II. Determine whether improvement in ventricular function achieved by enalapril is sustained
      and alters the course of late cardiotoxicity. III. Determine the impact of enalapril therapy
      on quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized study. Patients are
      stratified based on the cumulative anthracycline dose, age at cancer diagnosis, and the
      duration of time since cessation of anthracycline therapy. Patients are administered
      enalapril or placebo by mouth bid. Patients undergo a series of cardiac tests after
      administration of drug. Follow-up occurs at 2, 6, and 12 months and every year thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 75 patients in each treatment arm will be accrued.
