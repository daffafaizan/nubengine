      interventional technique in ACS patients found to have refractory thrombus during PCI.

        1. Primary Objectives To evaluate intra-procedure efficacy of using Solitaire in ACS
           patients with refractory thrombus.

        2. Secondary Objectives To evaluate clinical efficacy of using Solitaire in ACS patients
           with refractory thrombus, up to one year post-procedure.

      To evaluate safety of using Solitaire in ACS patients with refractory thrombus.

      The target enrolment is 51 patients diagnosed with STEMI, NSTEMI or UA and found to have
      refractory thrombus during PCI. Eligible patients will be identified at the ED or Inpatient
      ward of the 5 participating hospitals. The projected enrolment period is for two years and
      follow up for one year. A screening log will be maintained at each site to keep record of
      patients who were eligible for the study but not enrolled, to establish any selection bias.
