      groups that use hemoclips for this purpose.

      The aim of our study is to analyze whether the use of hemoclips reduces PPB complications. It
      is a prospective, randomised study of patients with pedunculated polyps larger than 10mm. The
      patients were included in two groups (hemoclip before polypectomy -HC- and standard
      polypectomy -SP-)
