      bone chips will be collected with a bone scraper, then a specially manufactured machine
      titanium tenting screw is used to fasten the ring block to the alveolar ridge. Two or three
      ring blocks is screwed according to the defect. Then resorbable collagen membrane is fixed to
      the alveolar ridge instead of the titanium-reinforced e-PTFE and equally autogenous and
      xenograft bone particles is packed around the screw to fill the defect area completely.
      Extreme care is taken to avoid autogenous particles drifting distally toward the area of the
      block. The barrier membrane was then closed over the block and particulate graft and fixed by
      bone tacks. Then periosteal releasing incision is done to allow tension free adaption of the
      mucoperisteal flap.
