      myocardial infarction (MI) is of special significance, as the heart muscle cannot regenerate
      so a region's necrosis leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. In the last few years, new
      treatments have been developed for the acute phase of myocardial infarction.We have managed
      to slow down disease progression with these new treatments, but it continues to the
      development of end stage heart failure. This study tries to determine the benefit of cell
      cardiomyoplasty with autologous myoblasts in patients with old MI.
