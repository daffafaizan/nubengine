      diagnosed with breast cancer and 5 diagnosed with benign breast disease) reinforced the need
      for online information during the breast diagnostic process. The focus group reviewed online
      CHESS-Mammo module and suggested minor changes to content. Part 2 (Evaluation) will enroll
      130 women in study and compare one group (65 participants) who receives access to CHESS-Mammo
      to another group of women (65 participants) who receive an email message containing screening
      mammography information. Both groups in Part 2 will be evaluated for health information
      competence, psychological distress, and patient satisfaction with physician through
      questionnaires. An evaluation of the group that accesses the CHESS-Mammo website will be
      done. The reason for conducting part 2 of this study is to allow greater insight into the
      clinical application of a novel Interactive Cancer Communication Systems (CHESS-Mammo) early
      in the diagnostic workup of breast cancer. By doing this project, we may achieve an important
      new way of implementing CHESS-Mammo in the clinic.
