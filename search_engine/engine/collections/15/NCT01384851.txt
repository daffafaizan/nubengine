      individuals in certain situations, for example with the use of computers, in overheated or
      air conditioned workplaces and in conditions of low humidity. The most common ocular
      complaints associated with these environments are burning, dryness, stinging, and grittiness.
      Although the exact cause of these symptoms is unknown, it is thought that increased tear
      evaporation rate due to low humidity plays a vital role. The changes in tear film physiology,
      which occurs in these environments, have traditionally been dealt with by the use of eye
      drops (particularly the highly viscous variety), which have been shown to be an effective
      therapeutic option in the treatment of environmental dry eye disease. Previous studies of the
      use of eye-drops of various formulations has shown improvements in tear physiology in mild to
      moderate dry eye patients with their use in both acute and chronic application protocols. In
      this study, an attempt was made to relate the effects on tear physiology induced by
      variations in environmental conditions to the beneficial effect produced by the use of
      eye-drops.
