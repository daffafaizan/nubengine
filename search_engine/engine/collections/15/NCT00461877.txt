      infections from new sex partners is largely unknown. This is a pilot study of predictors of
      HR HPV infections in two populations of women aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 65 who have used
      internet dating websites in the past year. 400 women will be recruited and mailed kits for
      self-collecting vaginal specimens for HPV DNA testing. Women will self-collect two sets of
      vaginal specimens four months apart, and complete sexual behavior questionnaires at the time
      of each self-collection. If new HPV infections associated with recent new partners are
      detected in these women, this pilot data will be used to develop a larger longitudinal study
      of the acquisition and natural history of HR HPV infections in older women. This information
      is important for developing guidelines for HPV vaccine implementation and cervical cancer
      screening guidelines in populations of older women.
