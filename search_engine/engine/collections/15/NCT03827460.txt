      drinking. In laboratory animals, short-term abstinence increases alcohol consumption, with
      repeated deprivations leading to disordered drinking. In a preliminary study, the
      investigators found that men and women differed in how their motivation to drink alcohol
      changed after a short period of abstinence. The investigators hypothesize that this
      difference may affect their transition to alcohol use disorders. The objectives of this
      application are to characterize the human post abstinence response, and use identical alcohol
      exposures to study the mechanisms underlying identified sex differences. In addition, the
      investigators will complete a 2 year prospective study of natural drinking patterns to assess
      how self-reported abstinence intervals influence drinking trajectories. The long-term goal of
      this project is to inform alcohol use disorder treatment and to design and test novel
      interventions using the laboratory model of post-abstinence response. There is a critical
      unfilled need to understand sex differences in disease progression, and this lab-based
      assessment coupled to longitudinal follow-up provides the rigorous experimental design to
      begin to meet that need. This project will increase scientific knowledge by advancing the
      translation between preclinical and clinical models, eventually informing sex-specific
      intervention and prevention strategies for problematic drinking and establishing a model to
      test those interventions..
