    
      Refractory status epilepticus (SE) develops in 31%-44% of patients with SE, with a mortality
      of 16%-23%. Coma induction is advocated for its management. Propofol and barbiturates are the
      most used agents, but no comparative study has been performed. In consideration of the
      uncertainty regarding the relative effectiveness, despite several retrospective data, a
      prospective investigation is needed.

      The objective is to assess the effectiveness (SE control, adverse events) of a first course
      of propofol versus barbiturates in the treatment of refractory SE, in adults with refractory
      SE not due to cerebral anoxia.

      Comparison: Coma induction with standardized doses of propofol or barbiturates titrated
      towards burst-suppression on EEG, then assessment of the proportion of patients achieving a
      control of SE.
