      risk behaviors among adolescents. However, longitudinal studies of parent-adolescent
      communication on the subject of health risk behavior such as alcohol, tobacco and other drug
      use (ATOD) remain relatively scarce, and none of this kind of work has been done among
      Chinese sample. Such information is urgently needed given the increasing trend of drug use
      among adolescents in Hong Kong, and the severe burden of morbidity and mortality related to
      ATOD.

      The study aims to examine parent-children communication in relation to health risk behaviors
      and to explore the potential efficacy of a brief intervention which is designed to assist
      parents of primary school children to communicate with their children about issues in the
      prevention of health risk behaviors. The efficacy of the intervention will be compared with a
      waiting-list control group using a randomized controlled trial. There will then be two
      telephone follow-ups to reinforce learnt strategies and skills for home practice in between
      the two workshops. There will also be assessments post-intervention and at 1 year follow-up.
      Evaluation focus groups will also be conducted after the intervention program.
