      patients with accurate and reliable hemodynamic monitoring. Radial Artery Catheterization is
      the currently recommended placement site.

      In patients undergoing cardiac or aortic surgery, placement of a radial KTA is sometimes
      difficult, with a failure rate of around 15%. It is also a source of local complications and
      prolongation of the anesthetic duration.

      There is no predictive diagnostic test for failed radial KTA placement in anesthesia.

      Accurately predicting the failure of radial catheterization by echography will, in the
      future, make it possible to offer "at risk" patients an immediate catheterization in an other
      site as for example brachial site.
