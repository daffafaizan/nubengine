      regions of the brain known to be involved in sensory and affective-attentional dimensions of
      pain processing. These results, in agreement with previous functional magnetic resonance
      imaging reports, confirm the hypothesis of central sensitization, which provides the
      rationale for prescription of centrally acting analgesic agents in patients with severe FM.
