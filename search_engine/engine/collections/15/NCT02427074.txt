    
      Patients diagnosed with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, refractory or intolerant to medical
      treatment, are randomly assigned (after signing a consent form), to receive one of two
      percutaneous procedures. The patients are evaluated a week before and a week, a month, two
      months, three months and six months after the surgery.

      The questionnaires (Short-Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire - SF-MPQ, Douleur
      Neuropathique - DN4, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory - NPSI, Brief Pain Inventory - BPI,
      Global Clinical Impression - GCI, Hospital Anxiety and Depression - HAD, Brief World Health
      Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - WHOQOL-brief, Pain Catastrophizing Scale - PCS)
      and tests (Quantitative Sensory Testing - QST, olfactory threshold - OT - and discrimination
      - OD, taste threshold - TT, and salivatory quantification - SQ) are applied as follows:

        -  Pre-op evaluation: SF-MPQ, DN4, BPI, NPSI, HAD, WHOQOL-brief, PCS, QST, OT, OD, TT, SQ.

        -  First visit post-op: SF-MPQ, BPI, NPSI, GCI

        -  Second visit post-op: SF-MPQ, BPI, NPSI, GCI

        -  Third visit post-op: SF-MPQ, BPI, NPSI, GCI

        -  Fourth visit post-op: SF-MPQ, DN4, BPI, NPSI, GCI, WHOQOL-brief, HAD, PCS, QST, OT, TT,
           SQ.

        -  Fifth visit post-op: SF-MPQ, DN4, BPI, NPSI, GCI, WHOQOL-brief, HAD, PCS, QST, OT, OD,
           TT, SQ.

      Patients with pain recurrence are excluded after the last visit attended. An exploratory
      analysis is made with 30 patients for a proper sample size calculation during the study.
