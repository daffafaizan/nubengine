      etanercept in Chinese RA and AS subjects. Total of 600 subjects (300 RA subjects and 300 AS
      subjects) will be enrolled in the study. If the true rate of an adverse event is no less than
      0.5%, with sample size of 600 subjects, this study will have 95% probability to detect at
      least one occurrence of the adverse event. The study prematurely discontinued on January 15,
      2013 due to slow enrollment and low adherence of etanercept. It should be noted that safety
      concerns have not been seen in this study and have not factored into this decision.
