    
      To compare (low contrast) visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) - both at
      intermediate distances under nighttime driving conditions in a driving simulator between
      patients with bilateral EYHANCE IOLs OR bilateral conventional monofocal IOLs. Visual
      function testing in the driving simulator will be assessed without AND with (static) glare.

      Additionally: Assessment of individual response times, scanpath characteristics, evaluation
      of test retest reliability and self-evaluation of (intermediate) vision and visual impairment
      related to glare.

      Simulator

      Patients are instructed to drive with a constant speed of 40 km/h on a virtual parcours
      (straight lane). For testing of either (low contrast) visual acuity or contrast sensitivity,
      8-position LANDOLT C's are presented at three locations (within the simulator car, AUDI A4,
      Ingolstadt/FRG):

      (i) At the center of the instrument panel (distance 0.xx m) (ii) At the center of the
      navigation monitor (y.yy m) (iii) At the center of the rear monitor (z.zz m) A high
      resolution acoustic attention guidance for immediate gaze direction of the patients towards
      the three above-mentioned visual stimulus locations (i-iii) is mandatory.

      Patients responses are recorded and response times can be extracted from the recordings.

      Clinical ophthalmological-optical examinations

        -  Medical/ophthalmological history

        -  (Uncorrected and Best-corrected) visual acuity (RE,LE,BE) with remote and intermediate
           (66cm) 8 position LANDOLT C's.

        -  LANG I stereotest (near distance)

        -  Ocular alignment & ocular motility

        -  Efferent & afferent pupillomotor status

        -  Mesopic contrast sensitivity without/with glare (Optovist, VISTEC Inc./Olching/FRG)

        -  Intraocular straylight perception (Q-Quant, OCULUS Inc, Wetzlar/FRG)

        -  Slit lamp (anterior segment)

        -  Ophthalmoscope (central fundus and fixation)

             -  Primary objectives: log visual acuity (logVA) at preset low contrast level of 1:2.7
                (logCS = 0.2) AND log contrast sensitivity (logCS) at a preset visual acuity level
                of 0.1 = 2/20)

             -  Secondary objectives: test retest reliability (as operationalized by LOA = limits
                of agreement) AND response time (i.e. time interval between onset of stimulus
                presentation and final response) AND scanpath characteristics (fixation duration,
                fixation stability, annotation to regions of interest; saccade amplitude)
                self-evaluation (questionnaire, using visual analogue scales = VAS)

      SHAPIRO WILK test (statistical testing for proving/disproving normal distribution)
      Descriptive statistics (either MEAN, standard deviation, in case of normally distributed data
      - else, MEDIAN, inter-quartile range (IQR).

      Assessment of test/retest reliability: BLAND ALTMAN plots, limits of agreement (LOA)
      Between-group comparison: t-test (unpaired samples), in case of normally distributed data -
      else, WILCOXON signed-rank test
