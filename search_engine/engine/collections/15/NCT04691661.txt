      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to learn if Radotinib can be potential therapeutic
      agents for the treatment of PD.

      Radotinib has been approved by Ministry of Food & Drug Safety of Korea to treat Chronic
      Myeloid Leukemia (CML) but it has not been approved for PD.

      In nonclinical efficacy study, therapeutic effect of Radotinib HCl, c-Abl inhibitor, which
      exhibits improved pharmacokinetic properties and BBB penetration compared to nilotinib and
      other c-Abl inhibitors, was tested in a preclinical α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) model
      of sporadic PD. As a result, the treatment of Radotinib HCl protects the α-synuclein
      PFFs-induced neuronal toxicity, reduces the PFFs-induced LB/LN-like pathology, and inhibits
      the PFFs-induced c-Abl activation in neurons. In vivo studies demonstrate that administration
      of Radotinib HCl prevents dopamine neuron loss and behavioral deficits following α-synuclein
      PFFs-induced toxicity. Taken together, these findings indicate that Radotinib HCl has
      beneficial neuroprotective effects in PD and provides strong evidence that selective and
      brain permeable c-Abl inhibitors can be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of PD.

      These data are very compelling to evaluate the effects of Radotinib in a phase II,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with PD.
