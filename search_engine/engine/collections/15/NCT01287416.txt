      residing on the reserves will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Exclusion criterion: Exclusion criteria for the study include being less than 16 years of
      age, prior training in SafeTALK or ASIST, being an elected official in a First Nations
      community, and inability to read or write.

      Primary outcome: Skills in Suicide Intervention: Suicide Intervention Response Inventory.The
      Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI) will be used to detect enhancement of
      intervention skills in participants. The SIRI is a self-administered test that was designed
      to measure competence in choosing appropriate response to a series of clinical scenarios with
      suicidal individuals. Research on the SIRI has shown its good psychometric properties,
      freedom from social desirability effects, and responsiveness to training in suicide
      prevention. It contains 25 items, each of which consists of a "client" remark and two
      "helper" responses. Responses are judged based on response options made by highly expert
      suicidologists. The SIRI has shown good internal consistency with alpha of 0.834, and good
      test-retest reliability.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  Knowledge about suicide, attitudes toward suicide, and self-reported preparedness to
           intervene with suicidal behavior will be measured by a series of questions that were
           developed by LivingWorks Inc.

        -  Gatekeeper behaviors will be measured similar to questions utilized by Wyman in the
           school-based study that assess how many people had the person asked others about
           suicide.
