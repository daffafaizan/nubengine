      treated with multimodality therapy which may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
      While long-term disease control is excellent, these patients remain at risk for early and
      late toxicities partially from radiation. There have been no significant changes to
      traditional photon radiation fields, which encompass the post-operative bed, anterior
      abdomen, and vertebral body. Proton beam radiation using pencil beam scanning, which is
      characterized by Bragg peak dose deposition and high conformality of dose to target regions,
      is ideally suited to treat the retroperitoneum. This pilot study evaluates pencil beam
      scanning proton therapy (PBS-PT) to:

        -  result in low acute gastrointestinal toxicity in patients receiving radiation therapy
           for renal tumors as measured by laboratory evaluations, clinician-assessed, and patient
           reported health related quality of life outcomes

        -  decrease the duration of radiation therapy

        -  compare doses to organs at risk (OARs) using PBS-PT as compared to traditional photon
           fields
