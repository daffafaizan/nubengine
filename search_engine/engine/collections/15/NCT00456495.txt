      to be effective in treating exudative macular degeneration. Its analog, Avastin has also been
      employed to treat macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and wet age related
      macular degeneration. Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A
      (VEGF-A), which has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular
      angiogenesis. Binding to VEGF-A prevents ranibizumab's interaction with VEGFR-1 and -2
      receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, thereby reducing proliferation, vascular
      leakage, and angiogenesis.

      Given that conjunctival tumors require the formation of new blood vessels to supply the
      proliferating cells, we propose a study to evaluate the effect of subconjunctival ranibizumab
      as a primary intervention in patients with conjunctival tumors.
