    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a pharmacometric model to predict jawbone zoledronic acid (Zol) concentrations
      in oncologic patients by conducting a prospective cohort study of Zol pharmacometrics in
      BRONJ patients, measuring drug in plasma, urine, and jawbone tissue obtained during surgical
      treatment for BRONJ.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To clinically assess and validate our predictive pharmacometric model, and develop a risk
      model for BRONJ in oncologic patients receiving intravenous Zol.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive zoledronic acid IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
