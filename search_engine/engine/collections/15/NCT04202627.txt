    
      Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) 2i is an autosomal recessive form of LGMD that is due
      to missense mutations in the FKRP gene. Patients develop progressive proximal muscle weakness
      that leads to loss of ambulation. Patients will also commonly develop a cardiomyopathy and
      respiratory compromise.

      There are promising new therapies that have been developed and as a result therapeutic trials
      are approaching.

      The rationale for this study is to define appropriate COAs for LGMD 2i, which will facilitate
      therapeutic development and ensure properly powered clinical trials. In addition, measurement
      of dystroglycan in muscles represents a potential muscle biomarker that could be used in
      early phase clinical trials as a measure of target engagement. The clinical utility of
      changes in dystroglycan has not been validated in human samples.
