      pulp capping agent. Group II: BIODENTINE GROUP: Vital Pulpotomy will be done using Biodentine
      as pulp capping agent. Group III: PRF + MTA GROUP: Vital Pulpotomy will be done using PRF and
      Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as pulp capping agent. Group IV: PRF+ BIODENTINE GROUP:
      Vital Pulpotomy will be done using PRF and Biodentine as pulp capping agent Patients were
      assessed at 1 day,3 months, 6 months and 9 months postoperatively for pain, pulp sensitivity
