    
      Phase I study, open, dose escalation, in adult patients with advanced solid tumours, to
      evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending PDM08 doses
      administered twice a week cycles of 4 weeks.

      After checking the safety of the first drug doses, a new dose escalation was proposed and
      approved by the Ethic Committee and the Medicines Agency.

      This clinical trial is carried out in adult patients with advanced solid tumours whose
      disease has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which there is no standard
      antineoplastic therapy, or are refractory to it.

      In pharmacodynamic non clinical studies, PDM08 presented antitumour activity against
      different tumour models including, renal, colon, lung, prostate and breast cancer models.
