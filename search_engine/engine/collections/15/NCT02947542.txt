    
      The aim of the present trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one-catheter concept
      using the BLK (Terumo, Somerset, USA) or the Tiger catheter (Terumo, Somerset, USA) compared
      to the standard Judkins catheters in diagnostic coronary angiography by the transradial
      access. Patients with stable angina pectoris will be randomly assigned to coronary
      angiography performed with the BLK (Group I), Tiger (Group II) or Judkins catheters (Group
      III). Primary endpoint is the time duration (sec) that is necessary to perform complete
      coronary angiography including 6 different projections for the left-coronary system and 3
      different projections of the right-coronary-system. Secondary endpoints will cover safety and
      imaging quality of the different catheter systems.
