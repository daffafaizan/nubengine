      cancer cells in culture that has been added into blood. We would like to study if this method
      can measure FR in plasma and serum obtained from patients with ovarian cancer. We would also
      like to analyse plasma and serum samples obtained from healthy volunteers to determine if
      they have any appreciable levels of FR, which can then be compared to the measurements
      obtained from cancer patients.
