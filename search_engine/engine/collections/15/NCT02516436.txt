      subjects. The study includes a Screening period of up to 3 days and a 2-day, double blind
      induction phase (subjects confined to the clinic). Screening and the first day of treatment
      (Day 1) may occur on the same day or Screening may occur up to 3 days prior to Day 1.

      Opioid dependent subjects who provide informed consent at the Screening visit; have a
      Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) total score â‰¥12; and meet other entry criteria are
      eligible for enrollment into the study. Subjects will be confined to the clinic beginning on
      Day 1 (optional confinement on Day -1) and will remain there for up to 48 hours after
      administration of the first study drug dose.
