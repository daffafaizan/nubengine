      by liver or kidney transplant participants. Participants will have been on a stable dose of
      Advagraf and deemed clinically stable for a period of 3-6 months and attend a routine
      out-patient follow-up visit to receive their usual oral dose of commercial Advagraf.
      Participants will be asked to provide 1 whole blood venepuncture sample and 1 whole blood
      finger prick MITRA sample at pre-dose and at approximately 1 and 3 hours post-dose.
      Participants will be kept at the study site for an extra 1 hour to ensure post-sampling
      safety and will be discharged thereafter.
