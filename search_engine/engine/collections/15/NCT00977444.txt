      status measure. It probes clinically important patient relevant symptoms in the areas of
      pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. It
      consists of 24 questions in three separated subscales (5 questions on pain subscale, 17
      questions on physical function subscales and 2 questions on stiffness subscale), each scored
      in analog scale from 0 to 10 points (0 representing no pain, 10 representing extreme pain).
      Each subscale score was weighed 10 points, thus 30 was the maximum punctuation for WOMAC
      total score.

      The Lequesne index is a 10-question interview-style survey given to patients with
      osteoarthritis of the knee. It has 5 questions pertaining to pain or discomfort, 1 question
      dealing with maximum distance walked, and 4 questions about daily activities. The total
      questionnaire is scored on a 0 to 24 scale, with lower scores meaning less functional
      impairment.
