      include PET as well as acquisition of structural and functional MRI. Task-specific glucose
      metabolism will be quantified with the radioligand [18F]FDG. Gray matter volume and white
      matter microstructure will be assessed with T1-weighted and diffusion weighted MRI,
      respectively. Functional imaging will focus on functional connectivity during rest and task
      as well as cerebral blood flow as acquired with ASL.
