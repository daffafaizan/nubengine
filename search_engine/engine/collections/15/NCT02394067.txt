      undergo an ophthalmologic investigation, and a lumbar puncture, both of which are necessary
      for diagnosis of IIH. MRI is done as a standard of care to rule out other etiologies of
      raised intracranial pressure. Our patients will require four MRI/MRVs. The first MRI/MRV is
      standard of care scan. The second MRI/MRV will be on the day of the lumber puncture,
      immediately following the procedure. The third MRI/MRV will take place when significant
      reduction of clinical papilledema has taken place (about 3-6 months), and a forth MRI will
      take place one year after the initial presentation or with symptom resolution, whichever
      comes first. Radiological findings will be compared at all stages to determine if transverse
      venous sinus stenosis can be reversed with standard of care medical treatment.
