      operating room during surgery rather than waiting until the recovery room as is our standard
      of care. After assurance that both mom and newborn are stable, the newborn will be placed
      across the mother's chest and covered with a blanket to help maintain body temperature. The
      skin to skin contact is maintained throughout the remaining surgical time and then continued
      into the recovery room. The subjects are seen post delivery day 1 for evaluation of their
      pain and satisfaction with care using a 0-100mm sliding VAS scale, with 0=not satisfied at
      all or no pain at all through 100 = total satisfaction and most severe pain ever.
