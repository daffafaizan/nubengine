      that it may reduce craving in rat models of alcohol use disorder. Investigators' previous
      studies of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) with work therapy have shown efficacy with
      newly recovering Veterans with AUD compared with work therapy alone. The current study
      combines Donepezil and CRT in an open-label trial to learn whether the combination of
      Donepezil + CRT may improve neurocognitive functioning and decrease alcohol use in Veterans
      with alcohol use disorder who have mild cognitive impairment (AUD-MCI). The study will
      determine the acceptability and adherence to treatment and provide preliminary evidence for
      efficacy. The study will recruit 15 newly recovering Veterans individuals with AUD-MCI for a
      13-week, open-label, single-arm pilot study with sobriety and cognitive assessments at
      baseline and at 13-week follow-up. Primary outcome variables will be a Clinical Global Index
      of AUD recovery and a Global Cognitive Composite of MCI related neurocognitive assessment.
