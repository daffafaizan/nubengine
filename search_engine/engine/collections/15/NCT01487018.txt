      can be considered a formidable challenge. Even to the skilled surgeon, over-or
      underestimation of the displacement is likely to occur, leading to an unsatisfactory result
      caused by over- or undercorrection.However,The development of Computer-Assisted Navigation
      technology Offers new opportunities in the treatment of such deformities. With the help of
      navigation system,pre- and intraoperatively,the objective of any supporting medical device
      for reconstruction of the orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex would be visualization of the
      real and desired positions of the zygoma. In this randomized controlled trial, we would like
      to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a new method for planning and realizing zygomatic
      osteotomies in cases of established post-traumatic deformities using computer assisted
      navigation.
