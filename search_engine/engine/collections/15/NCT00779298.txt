      abdominal surgery or diabetes mellitus, were assessed by using a blinded crossover trial. The
      subjects were examined regarding blood glucose levels and GER after ingestion of 150g WWB or
      RWMB on two different occasions after an overnight fast. GER was measured using a
      standardized real time ultrasonography. GER was calculated as a percentage change in antral
      cross sectional area 15 and 90 minutes after the finished meal with WWB and RWMB.
      Finger-prick capillary samples were collected before and 40, 60, and 90 min after the start
      of the meal to measure blood glucose levels.
