      therapeutic alternative to surgical valve repair in patients who are at high risk and
      unsuitable for surgery.

      The PMVR procedure, however, is typically performed under general anaesthesia. It has
      recently been shown in a first approach that performing the MitraClip® in deep sedation is
      feasible; however safety parameters and a direct comparison to general anaesthesia are still
      missing The aim of this study is to investigate the safety of deep sedation in patients
      undergoing the PMVR procedure and to evaluate how deep sedation in comparison to general
      anaesthesia influences procedural time and in-hospital stay.
