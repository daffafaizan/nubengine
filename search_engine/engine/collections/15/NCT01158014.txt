      additional technique to prevent recurrence which may be as high as 50%.

      Suturing a conjunctival auto-graft has become one of the most popular and effective methods
      in preventing recurrence. However suturing requires long operative time (10-20 minutes with
      removal alone less than 5 minutes) and requires sutures removal after 1-2 weeks which is very
      inconvenient to the patient.

      Using Fibrin Glue (Quixil) has been used in several places in pterygium surgery and we
      believe it will be as effective as suturing the graft, will use much less OR time (reduce
      surgery time from 40 minutes to 20-25 minutes) and will be less expensive since 2 ml glue
      (around 80US$) suffice for 10 cases, while one vicryl suture costs around 34 US$.
