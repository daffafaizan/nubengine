      Evaluate the impact of the HEPA interventions on: 1.) The proportion of children meeting the
      PA Standard (i.e., â‰¥60min MVPA/d) while attending summer day camp; 2.) The proportion of
      foods (e.g., fruit, vegetable, water) children and staff bring and consume at the summer day
      camp that meet the HE Standards; and 3/) Changes in children's age-sex specific BMI
      percentile from the start to end of summer

      Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HEPA intervention

      Evaluate the maintenance of the HEPA intervention in summer day camps
