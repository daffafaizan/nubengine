    
      Open-label, Phase 4 study in subjects who are currently participating in the long-term
      follow-up study (ie, AUX-CC-860) in the United States, Australia, or Europe and who have
      recurrence of contracture (ie, joint contracture increases by at least 20 degrees compared
      with the Day 30 value after the last injection in a Phase 3 Auxilium-sponsored study and a
      palpable cord present) in a joint that was effectively treated (ie, reduction in contracture
      to 5 degrees or less 30 days after the last injection) with AA4500 in a Phase 3
      Auxilium-sponsored study.

      Subjects who experience recurrence of contracture in one or more effectively treated joints
      may be enrolled in this retreatment study after the investigator determines subject
      eligibility and after informed consent has been obtained. The investigator will treat the
      cord affecting the recurrent joint with up to three injections. Only one recurrent joint will
      be treated in this study.
