      (CD). Many vasopressors have been used for prevention of post-spinal hypotension (PSH) during
      CD; however, the optimum protocol for prophylaxis is not established yet. Phenylephrine (PE)
      is a popular vasopressor used in obstetric anesthesia; however, its use is limited by its
      marked cardiac depressant nature. Norepinephrine (NE) is a potent vasopressor characterized
      by both α adrenergic agonistic activity in addition to a weak β adrenergic agonistic
      activity; thus, NE is considered a vasopressor with minimal cardiac depressant effect; these
      pharmacological properties would make NE an attractive alternative to PE. In this study, the
      investigators will compare continuous variable infusion of both drugs (PE and NE) with doses
      of 0.75 mcg/Kg/min and 0.05 mcg/Kg/min respectively for prophylaxis against PSH during CD. We
      used Norepinephrine Bitartrate 8 mg ampules which contains norepinephrine base of 4 mg.
