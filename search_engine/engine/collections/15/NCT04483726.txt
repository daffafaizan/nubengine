      minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) as compared to open distal pancreatectomy
      (ODP) for benign and pre-malignant disease. In the literature and in a recent pan-European
      survey, about one third of pancreatic surgeons expressed concerns regarding the oncologic
      safety (i.e. radical resection, lymph node retrieval and survival) of MIDP in pancreatic
      cancer. Most surgeons stated that a randomized trial assessing oncologic safety in MIDP vs
      ODP for pancreatic cancer is needed.

      Objective: To compare MIDP with ODP regarding radical resection rate for pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the pancreatic body or tail.

      Study design: A pan-European, randomized controlled, multicenter, patient-blinded
      non-inferiority trial. This protocol was designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines1.
      Pathologists judging the primary endpoint will be blinded for the surgical approach (MIDP vs
      ODP). A blinded adjudication committee will assess all endpoints.

      Study population: Two groups of 129 patients (258 in total) with an indication for elective
      distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy because of proven or highly suspected PDAC.

      Intervention: Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (either laparoscopic or
      robot-assisted)

      Control: Open distal pancreatectomy

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is the microscopically radical (R0, >1mm)
      resection rate. Main secondary outcomes are survival, lymph node retrieval, intraoperative
      outcomes (such as blood loss, operative time and conversion), postoperative outcomes (such as
      complications, time to functional recovery and hospital stay) and quality of life
