      psychological health.

      Ba Duan Jin, a traditional Chinese health-preserving technique, combines techniques
      regulating body, breath and spirit. The effects of Ba Duan Jin on patients with symptoms of
      depression and anxiety are yet to be further investigated.

      The present pilot clinical study aims to apply Ba Duan Jin to patients with symptoms of
      depression and anxiety, and to evaluate the psychological effects.

      Participants allocated to the Health Education Group take part in the 16-week health
      education including work, rest, diet and other basic programs according to the different
      conditions of participants. Participants allocated to the Ba Duan Jin Group take part in the
      16-week Ba Duan Jin plus health education program. The study plans to enroll 60 participants
      (30 for Ba Duan Jin plus health education program, and 30 for health education program),
      expecting that Ba Duan Jin has a better effect on improving psychological condition.
