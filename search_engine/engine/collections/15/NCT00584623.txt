      swallowing studies: videofluoroscopy and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES).
      Specifically, the timing of swallowing events will be correlated between teh two studies. In
      addition, the pharyngeal constriction ratio (a validated measure of pharyngeal strength on
      videofluoroscopy) will be compared with the pharyngeal squeeze maneuver (an assessment of
      pharyngeal strength on FEES), with the hypothesis that there will be a strong correlation
      between PCR and pharyngeal squeeze.
