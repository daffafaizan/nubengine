      steroid dependent form of nephrotic syndrome at the end of the first manifestation. An
      additional blood volume will be sampled in patients and controls during a scheduled
      biological check-up for the initial disease. Genetics factors will be checked using a DNA
      chips devoted to the response to steroid therapy and viral genome of EBV, CMV, HHV7 will be
      searched for using PCR reaction in total blood DNA extract.
