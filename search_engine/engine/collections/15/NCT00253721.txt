        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intra-arterial melphalan when given in
           combination with BBBD in patients with primary or metastatic central nervous system
           (CNS) malignancy.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of melphalan given with BBBD in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of melphalan.

      Patients receive intra-arterial mannitol with BBBD followed by intra-arterial melphalan over
      10 minutes on days 1 and 2*. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 monthly courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .

      NOTE: *Patients with gliomas localized to the posterior circulation (i.e., brain stem
      gliomas) receive melphalan on day 1 only.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year; every 6
      months for the next 2 years; then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
