    
      The primary study objective is to compare implant survival with the Titanium Zirconium
      (Roxolid™) implant compared the Titanium grade IV (SLActive®) implant between baseline
      (surgery) and 10 years.

      The following outcome parameters will be evaluated at 5 and 10 years post surgery for the two
      different implant types Straumann® Bone Level SLActive, diameter 3.3 mm, Titanium-Zirconium
      (Roxolid®) vs. Straumann® Bone Level SLActive implant, diameter 3.3 mm, Titanium Grade IV:

        -  Implant survival

        -  Implant success according to Buser et al. (1990)

        -  Crestal bone level change measured by Orthopantomogram (OPT)

        -  Soft tissue health

        -  Clinical measurements

        -  Prosthetic parts assessments: Success and maintenance

        -  Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL)

        -  Product Safety (Adverse events and device deficiencies)
