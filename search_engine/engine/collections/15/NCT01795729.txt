      therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of the primary endpoint of the study assessed 1
      year after randomization.

      Objectives: To demonstrate the superiority of the interventional management on top of optimal
      medical therapy over optimal medical therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of the
      primary endpoint of the study assessed 1 year after randomization

      Design : Multicenter, prospective randomized 1 :1, open-label blinded endpoint study

      Target population : Heart transplant recipients, aged ≥18 years, without coronary artery
      disease-related symptoms, with angiographically significant coronary artery stenoses (≥50%
      anatomically adequate for a revascularization by coronary angioplasty with stent
      implantation, with no contraindication to dual antiplatelet therapy associating aspirin and a
      P2Y12 inhibitorfor a duration of 12 monthsand with ni grade IA ACC/AHA indication for
      revascularization

      Inclusion period: 12 months (may be extended based on the inclusion rythme)

      Maximum duration of participation for patients : 13 months

      Total duration of the study : 37 months

      Primary endpoint : The composit of death, myocardial infarction, retransplantation,
      implantation of transitory or definitve ventricular assist devices, new or worsening heart
      failure, graft failure and/or a decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction of at least
      25% compared to baseline.The occurrence of any event qualifying for the primary endpoint will
      be assessed by a Cox survival analysis stratified on center.The primary endpoint will be
      assessed 12 months after randomization.

      Secondary endpoints : Any of the individual events defining the primary outcome at 1 year

      Number of patients to be included and power calculation : 80 patients per group. A 1 year
      primary endpoint rate of 30% in the active and 50% in with an inclusion period of 24 months
      and alpha=5% warants a 90% power using a cox model.
