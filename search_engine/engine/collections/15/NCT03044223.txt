      T-lymphocytes (Hotchkiss et al., 2003). Macrophages and monocytes are supposed to be
      essential for the septic reaction to Gram-negative bacteria (Hotchkiss et al. 2003).
      Generally, there are two dominant types of macrophages: the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage
      and the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage (Mantovani et al., 2006). Similar to this macrophage
      characteristics, monocytes can also be categorized into pro-or anti-inflammatory. These
      macrophage/monocyte phenotypes can be differentiated in vitro from freshly isolated human
      blood monocytes using either GM-CSF giving raise to M1 macrophage/monocyte or M-CSF resulting
      in M2 macrophage/monocyte (Mantovani et al., 2006; Neu et al., 2013). Brunialti et al. (2012)
      have already demonstrated that the population of antiinflammatory M2 monocytes in septic
      patients is bigger than the pro-inflammatory M1 population. However, the authors did not
      further analyze the underlying mechanisms of M2 polarization nor did they identify the
      sepsis-causing pathogens.

      In the present study, monocytes and macrophages of patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA)
      sepsis are characterized by their surface marker expression profile via flow cytometry and
      cytokine pattern by ELISA in vivo and after ex-vivo LPS stimulation. In addition, an ex-vivo
      model system for PSA induced sepsis is validated. Blood of critically ill patients in the ICU
      infected with PSA is sampled to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Blood
      monocytes are analyzed for surface marker expression to determine the relative proportions of
      M1 and M2 monocytes in these patients and in healthy controls by flow cytometry
