      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess changes in immune parameters prior to radiation, post radiation and post
      nephrectomy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess surgical parameters for partial or radical nephrectomy post SBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT on day 1 and undergo partial or radical nephrectomy on day 29.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
