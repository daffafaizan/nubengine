    
      This is a prospective multicenter observational study with annual follow-up assessments over
      3 years.

      Gait is assessed by an inertial device (BTS G-WALK). G- WALK is an easy-to-use solution to
      obtain accurate, objective and quantitative spatial-temporal gait data. The device is a
      wireless system consisting of an inertial sensor composed by a triaxial accelerometer, a
      magnetic sensor, and a triaxial gyroscope that positioned on lumbar/ or sacral segments
      allows a functional gait analysis.

      Cognitive performance is evaluated with a neuropsychological battery designed to assess
      memory, executive /attention, and visuospatial domains.
