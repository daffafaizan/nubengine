      cell specificity and is unreliable for coronary imaging because of high background signals
      from the myocardium. Upregulation of somatostatin receptor subtype-2 (SST2) occurs in
      activated macrophages, offering a novel inflammation imaging target. 68Ga-DOTATATE, an SST2
      PET tracer with low myocardial binding, shows promise for imaging coronary inflammation.
      Having previously demonstrated increased 68Ga-DOTATATE signals in coronary atherosclerotic
      lesions post-MI, we now aim to study the natural history of residual arterial inflammation in
      non-culprit arteries and better understand how 68Ga-DOTATATE signals relate to plaque
      morphology, progression and rupture.
