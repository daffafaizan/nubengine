      Aim 1: Develop a psychoeducational intervention (PEI) for high-risk breast cancer survivors
      about genetic counseling (GC) and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC).

      Part 2: Intervention Pilot

      Aim 2: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a PEI from the perspective of the BC
      patients and health care professionals.

      Exploratory Aim 3: Estimate the preliminary efficacy of the PEI compared to standard clinical
      care. We hypothesize that women in the intervention group will have higher uptake of GC,
      greater increases in knowledge, and more perceived benefits related to GC compared to the
      control group.
