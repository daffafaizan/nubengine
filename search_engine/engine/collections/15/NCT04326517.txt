      emphysematous pyelonephritis from a single tertiary care institution in the north of Mexico
      in the period of 2011-2021. The diagnosis of emphysematous pyelonephritis is confirmed by
      computed tomography. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, therapeutic management, and outcomes
      will be collected. Variables will be analyzed to determine factors associated with admission
      to intensive care unit and mortality. Urine cultures will be analyzed and drug resistance
      profile will be determined using microdilution plate. Clinical and demographic
      characteristics will be analyzed using Chi square test for categorical variables, and T-test
      for numerical variables. Statistical significance is set at p<0.05. Statistical analysis will
      be performed with the SPSS software version 20.0.
