      to ambulate 50 feet unaided. Each stratum is block randomized.

      Patients are randomly assigned to surgery plus intensive physical therapy versus intensive
      physical therapy alone.

      The surgical procedure is a selective dorsal rhizotomy. Physical therapy (PT) includes
      passive and active range of motion, facilitation of isolated muscle control, transitional
      movements, strengthening, transfer skills, and gait training. The PT schedule is 2-hour
      sessions 5 days a week for 1 month, 1-hour sessions 5 days a week for 5 months, then a
      standard therapy program for the remainder of the study (total of 6 months). Parents
      supervise exercise on non-PT days.

      Patients are followed at 6, 12, and 24 months.
