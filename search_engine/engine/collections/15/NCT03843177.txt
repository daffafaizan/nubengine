      techniques in measuring radiological hallux valgus angle, this study followed the
      recommendation from the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society. The longitudinal axis of
      the first metatarsal and that of the first proximal phalanx were formed respectively by 2
      reference points marked on each of the two bones. The reference points on the first proximal
      phalanx were 1/2 to 1 cm proximal or distal to the articular surface while the reference
      points on the first metatarsal were 1 to 2 cm proximal or distal to the articular surface.

      The active maximum dorsiflexion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was measured with
      goniometer on weight-bearing. The bisection was carried out under a weight-bearing condition
      to avoid error due to soft-tissue movement when participants changed from a non
      weight-bearing position to a weight-bearing position.
