      resources to seek treatment for their HIV care and substance use. The goal of STRIDE2 is to
      examine if there are differences in HIV, drug use, and other outcomes between individuals
      receiving treatment versus individuals actively using, not actively using and not in
      treatment, and individuals on Methadone, Suboxone, or in some other treatment.
