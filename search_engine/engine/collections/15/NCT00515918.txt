      and children before pre-school age are at highest risk. Data from animal models provide
      evidence that early ID affected developing brain in specific regions and functions by varies
      processes include myelination, dopamine neurotransmitter system, and neurometabolism. These
      impacts appeared differential at different time of brain development and different brain
      regions, depending on the timing of ID. The reversibility of these effects also appeared to
      depend on the timing of ID. This project uses innovative neuropsychologic/ neurophysiologic
      and behavioral techniques, such as event-related potentials(ERP), ABR and VEP, to study brain
      functions and behavior related to ID including sensory ,motor, cognitive and social
      /emotional functioning, and address unanswered questions about brain and behavior impacts of
      different timing of ID(pre- and /or postnatal ID) in the human infants. This research has the
      potential to understand reversibility of effects depending on timing of ID and treatment as
      well as basic understanding of mechanism of impact of ID in human developing brain. It may
      also have important implications with regard to policy of interventions for different timing
      of ID, and improve children early development and the quality of population.
