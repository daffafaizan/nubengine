      assessment screening tool (rFAST) for use with individuals who have advanced cancer and are
      receiving care in either an active treatment or palliative setting.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The three tools (tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion) in the rFAST are each defined by
           the same six dimensions: decline in stamina, decline in cognition, decline in sleep
           quality, diminished social network, and increased emotional reactivity

        2. The five subscales of the tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion scales are internally
           consistent.

        3. Tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion are distinct states that are manifested by unique
           patterns of scores on their 6 subscales

        4. The mean POMS-Vsf scores of individuals who meet the definition of fatigue will be lower
           than the mean POMS-Vsf scores of individuals who meet the definition of tiredness and
           higher than the mean POMS-Vsf scores of individuals who meet the definition of
           exhaustion.

      Objectives

        1. To examine the factor structure of the tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion scales of the
           rFAST.

        2. To examine the internal consistency of the 5 subscales within the tired, fatigue, and
           exhaustion scales.

        3. To compare actual rFAST scale scores to hypothesized scale profiles for tiredness,
           fatigue, and exhaustion.
