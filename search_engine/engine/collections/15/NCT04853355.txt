      2020 with the diagnosis of Diabetic Macular Edema. Each patient was noted to have
      pachychoroid, choroidal hyperpermeability, and most important resistant to multiple anti-VEGF
      and steroid intravitreal injections, and have moderate vision loss. In addition, despite the
      fact that we use anti-VEGF medications, we do not know the levels of VEGF in the eye, nor do
      we have an explanation for the inability to respond to these drugs. This study will determine
      the degree of VEGF concentrations, response to anti-VEGF treatments, and determine biomarkers
      of inflammation as a means for explaining the cause of treatment resistance. Subsequently,
      another pathological process will be treated with spironolactone to see if the degree of
      contribution of choroidal hyperpermeability to the exudative process.
