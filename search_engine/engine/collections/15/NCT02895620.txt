           Three 50 mL fresh urine samples will be collected in sterile containers according to
           Cepheid instructions of use:

             -  the "baseline sample" before the first BCG instillation,

             -  the "study sample" taken during the initiation course of treatment instillations,
                preferably at the 4th or 5th instillation of BCG therapy,

             -  the "follow-up sample" at the time of the first follow-up cystoscopy, approximately
                3 months after the last BCG instillation of the initiation course.

           Xpert® test results will be qualified as positive or negative, according to Cepheid
           instructions for use.

           Samples tested positive at baseline will not be included in the analysis and the
           patient's participation in the study will be discontinued.

           Samples obtained in patients with no recurrence at follow-up cystoscopy after the
           initiation course will be considered for analysis.

        2. Threshold of detection of theXpert® Bladder test:

             -  One urine sample of a patient tumor free (negative Xpert test) under BCG treatment
                will be spiked into 3 log dilutions of the 2 distinct tumor cell lines SW780 and
                BE(2)-C (100, 1000, and 10000 cells per ml).

             -  A mix of fresh and frozen cells from en bloc harvested tumors from distinct donors
                will be tested at the set concentration in BCG urines from distinct patients.
