    
      This will be a prospective, randomized, active-controlled study of 224 eyes of patients with
      the diagnosis of TRD secondary to PDR. Participants will be screened for eligibility.
      Eligible patients will be examined at baseline to determine their ocular condition and
      randomized into 2 arms. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the study arm.

        1. Control arm: PPV without pre-operative bevacizumab (Sham injection).

        2. Study arm: Pre-operative bevacizumab (3-5 days) before PPV.

      In the study arm, an intravitreal bevacizumab injection at a dose of 1.25 Âµg/0.05 mL will be
      scheduled 3 to 5 days before minimally invasive vitreoretinal surgery (MIVS).

      The purpose of the current study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of an
      intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab as a pre-operative adjunct to PPV in eyes
      with TRD secondary to PDR.
