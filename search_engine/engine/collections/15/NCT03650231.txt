      which EBV diagnosis was requested. The serological diagnosis of EBV infection was performed
      in the Amiens University Hospital virology laboratory (France). The median age of patients
      was 34 years (mean: 38 years, range: 3-82 year) with a sex ratio of 50%. Sixteen of the 91
      samples concerned children (<15 years).

      This study compared the performance of three automated immunoassays, Architect (Abbott),
      Immulite (Siemens) and Liaison (Diasorin), for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology. Ninety-one
      serum samples collected in Amiens University Hospital were analyzed for the presence of Viral
      Capsid Antigen (VCA) IgG and IgM and Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) IgG. The agreement
      between the three assays was calculated for each marker individually and for determination of
      the EBV profile, based on interpretation of the combination of these three EBV markers.
