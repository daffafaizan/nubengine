      cord. Illnesses or injuries that typically cause spasticity include cerebral palsy, stroke,
      multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. Common treatments for
      spasticity include physical and occupational therapy as well as oral medications such as
      baclofen, injected medications such as botulinum neurotoxin, intrathecal medications and
      surgical procedures. The approach to the treatment of spasticity is comprehensive in nature
      and these therapies have been widely applied to a broad population of patients including
      children, adults and older adults.
