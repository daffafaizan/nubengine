      tolerated dose (MTD) of combretastatin A4 phosphate in patients with advanced solid malignant
      tumors. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of combretastatin A4 phosphate. III. Assess the
      effects of combretastatin A4 phosphate on tumor blood flow using PET and MRI scanning
      techniques, and establish the dose at which these effects occur. IV. Recommend a dose of
      combretastatin A4 phosphate for phase II evaluation based on tumor blood flow effect and the
      MTD. V. Evaluate possible antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive IV
      combretastatin A4 phosphate over 10 minutes once a week for 3 weeks. Patients not
      experiencing unacceptable toxic effects begin individual dose escalation, receiving a maximum
      of 3 dose levels with 2 weeks of rest between each dose level. Dose escalation stops when 2
      patients have experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular dose level. Once DLT
      is established, at least 6 patients are treated at a lower dose to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose. Patients may receive up to 6 courses of 3 infusions each. Patients are
      followed for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
