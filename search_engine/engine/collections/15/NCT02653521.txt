      cancer. 80 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer will be treated with 3D-CRT(three
      dimensional conformal radiotherapy, 3D-CRT)/IMRT(intensity modulated radiotherapy, IMRT),
      dividing to experimental group and control group (40 patients each). All patients are
      kVCT(kilo-voltage computed tomography, kVCT) scanned weekly(the fifth fraction in a week) and
      CBCT (cone beam computed tomography, CBCT) scanned per fraction before treatment. Irradiated
      dose distribution of each patient is calculated using the CBCT images corrected with
      validated modelling and accumulate the volumetric dose for all PTV(planning target
      volume,PTV) and OARs(organs at risk, OAR) using deformable registration algorithm. For the
      experimental group, replan the treatment when the target volume is not covered by the
      prescribed dose or OARs is overdose beyond the action level to achieve an optimal dose
      distribution. Conversely, no action is taken in the control group and the original plan will
      be used for the full treatment course. Dosimetric parameters (such as the ratio of target
      coverage, the mean dose of OARs, etc) ,treatment toxicities (such as radiation pneumonitis
      and esophagitis), PFS（Progress Free Survival,PFS）and OS（Overall Survival, OS）of the two
      groups will be analyzed and compared in the study.
