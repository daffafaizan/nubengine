      expansion. Part B will either be initiated if RP2D reached in Part A, or not initiated if
      RP2D was not reached in Part A. Part A has been designed to identify the recommended dose of
      combination of toripalimab plus chidamide for further clinical evaluation based upon
      assessment of the safety and tolerability data collected during the first 28 days.
      "3+3"design was used in the dose finding cohort. If RP2D was reached in Part A, eligible
      patients would be enrolled and receive toripalimab (240mg q3w, intravenously) plus chidamide
      (RP2D, twice a week) till disease progression (PD) withdraw of consent, or unacceptable
      toxicity.
