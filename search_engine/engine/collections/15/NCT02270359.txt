      for cath will be enrolled. Those who have no obstructive CAD on clinically indicated coronary
      angiography, defined as no stenosis of >50% in any major epicardial vessel, will undergo
      coronary OCT just after the clinically indicated diagnostic angiogram, and CMR within 1 week,
      typically within 72-96 hours. Participants will be followed for clinical events for at least
      1 year. 20 fully eligble participants will be recruited at NYU Langone Medical Center and
      Bellevue Hospital Center among a projected 200 enrolled patients.
