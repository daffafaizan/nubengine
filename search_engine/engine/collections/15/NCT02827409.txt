    
      All subjects will receive delayed cord clamping. One group (short-delay) will receive up to
      one minute of delayed cord clamping and then will be placed either on the mother's abdomen or
      the life-start trolley if extensive resuscitation is required.

      The second group will receive delayed cord clamping for at least 5 minutes and continue until
      the baby has established breathing without additional support or is stable on respiratory
      support (no longer received mask PPV for at least 1-2 minutes, i.e. stable on CPAP or
      intubated). The subject will initially be placed on the mother's abdomen or if the subject
      needs extensive resuscitation they will be moved to the LifeStart bed to receive
      resuscitation measures.

      In either group if the baby is deemed to be unstable (by medical team) to be on the
      life-start trolley the cord will be clamped and the baby will be moved to an adjacent warmer
      for resuscitation.
