      I. To assess progression-free survival (PFS) measured at 16 weeks following initiation of
      once daily continuous oral therapy with OSI-774 in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess objective response rate, rate and duration of stable disease, time to
      progression, median and overall survival in this patient population, and any changes in tumor
      perfusion based on functional CT imaging.

      II. To correlate response with patient characteristics including: age, disease stage (TNM,
      Okuda [6]), viral hepatitis status, pathologic grade of cirrhosis, Childs-Pugh status,
      Performance Status, serum values of: alpha feto-protein, bilirubin, transaminases, albumin;
      EGFR expression score by IHC; and development of skin rash during therapy.

      III. To determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of OSI-774 in this patient
      population.

      IV. To determine the safety and tolerability of OSI-774 in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to epidermal growth factor receptor expression
      (low, 0-1+ vs high, 2-3+).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
