    
      A cluster randomized controlled trial that was designed to include two groups (control (n =
      111) and intervention (n = 109) groups), and pre- and post-test procedures were conducted.
      The participants were Prolanis T2DM patients who attended four primary health-care centers
      (Puskesmas) in Makassar City, South Sulawesi, Indonesia from August 2017 to August 2018. The
      intervention group received systematic counseling for 6 months. The data were collected using
      the Bahasa Indonesia version of the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L)
      questionnaire and were analyzed using EQ-5D preference weight for each health state with the
      Indonesian EQ-5D-5L value Set. Furthermore, the EQ-5D index and the EQ-5D VAS score were
      calculated and HbA1c levels were assessed.
