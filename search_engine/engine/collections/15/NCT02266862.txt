      angular displacement before and after fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (FEVAR) using CT
      with end-inspiration and end-expiration CT images before and after repair. The investigators
      would then locate the renal artery segment with maximal angular displacement on each and
      describe any changes. Because these patients would be getting pre and post-surgical CTs as
      part of standard of care, there would be no added charge to obtain the information for the
      study. There would be, however, minimal increased radiation exposure resulting from the extra
      scan being performed during end-expiration and the patients would have to consent to the
      slight added risk to participate.
