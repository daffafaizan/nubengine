    
      The purpose of this study is to validate the clinical performance of EarlyTect Colon Cancer
      test which is measuring Syndecan 2 methylation status in stool DNA to detect CRC. Syndecan 2
      (SDC2) is a newly developed methylation biomarker for colorectal cancer diagnosis.
      Methylation status of SDC2 gene in stool DNA is determined by methylation specific qPCR.
      Sensitivity and specificity will be determined by comparing Stool DNA test from healthy
      subjects, CRC patients, and other group including polyps and other diseases.
