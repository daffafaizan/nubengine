    
      We have identified a group of patients with refractory asthma who have ongoing eosinophilic
      airway inflammation despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids.

      Traditional inhaled steroids have a relatively proximal airway distribution which may lead to
      inadequate treatment of the distal airways.

      We aim to demonstrate that a steroid inhaler with a smaller particle size which targets the
      distal airways can be a useful additional treatment option in this group of patients.
