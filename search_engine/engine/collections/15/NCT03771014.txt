      failure by attenuating the development of severe and persistent weakness and impaired
      physical function seen in these patients.

      Muscle wasting occurs early (within 12 hours) and progresses rapidly after ICU admission.
      Patients may suffer from consequent physical impairment for months or years following their
      discharge.

      ICU based rehabilitation has the potential to improve physical function outcomes, through
      mitigating muscle wasting.

      The investigators have successfully introduced a very early ICU mobility program in their
      institution, which results in increased ventilator free days and reduced length of ICU stay.

      The primary aim is to investigate whether this method will work in other ICUs. EMPRESS will
      test the feasibility of running this intervention as an RCT. The results and a concurrent
      process evaluation will inform the design of a future, multi-centre randomised controlled
      trial.
