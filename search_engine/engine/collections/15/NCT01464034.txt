      dose of the combination of carfilzomib and pomalidomide with dexamethasone (CPD) in patients
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma followed by a phase II expansion at the MTD to
      evaluate efficacy. The study will explore the efficacy of CPD including overall response,
      time to progression, progression free survival, and time to next therapy.
