      people at risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Because the PC is affected very early in the
      course of AD and the region may have reduced function even prior to the onset of symptoms,
      further understanding of its functional role and its relationship to other brain regions may
      be helpful in detecting AD earlier and in monitoring disease progression and treatment. This
      project examines the role of the PC and its connections to other brain regions using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique that allows us to examine the brain
      at work during tests of memory and decision-making. The main goal is to see if functional
      connections between brain regions are modulated by risk for AD.
