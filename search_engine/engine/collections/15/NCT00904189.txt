      dispersion device (RDD) in a terrorist attack or accidental exposures to sources of ionizing
      radiation, it is advantageous to use multiple methods to assess the dosimetry of individuals
      exposed to this radiation (4). These methods should include a physical assessment of the
      dosimetry at the exposure site to, 1) identify the type of radiation (e.g., gamma rays,
      neutrons or radioisotopes), 2) evaluate the distribution of radioisotopes and/or
      radioactivity at the site, and 3) determine the location of exposed individuals to the source
      of radiation. For individuals affected by the radiological incident, the monitoring of their
      clinical signs and symptoms is important for determining whether acute symptoms of radiation
      sickness are being presented and if immediate medical intervention is required. However, it
      is recognized that an invaluable aid for the clinical management of exposed individuals is
      the use of biomarkers that can be readily obtained from the exposed individual and used for
      assessing dosimetry (4,9). Biomarkers that are most useful to the physician are those
      produced or expressed within minutes to hours following exposure. With the dosimetry provided
      through these early phase biomarker measurements, the physician can better assess the
      clinical signs that are presented by an exposed individual and better determine the need and
      course of treatment.
