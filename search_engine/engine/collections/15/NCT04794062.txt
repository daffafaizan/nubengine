      of myocardial injury (heart injury) of the participants recovered from the novel coronavirus
      infectious disease (COVID-19). Participants with signs of myocarditis (pericarditis) and/or
      myocardial fibrosis, and with a threat of heart failure development and other outcomes are
      selected into this study. In this cohort the percentage of participants having myocardial
      injury based on the level of high-sensitivity troponin, echocardiography (decreased Left
      Ventricle Ejection Fraction, abnormalities of wall motion, Right Ventricle dysfunction,
      increased size of heart chambers above referential values, presence of pericardial effusion),
      cardiac MRI with contrast enhancement (presence of edema on T2-weighted images, presence of
      early and late gadolinium enhancement phenomenon, local motion abnormalities, increased size
      of heart chambers above referential values, presence of pericardial effusion). At 6 months of
      the dynamic follow-up, MRI with contrast enhancement will be repeated in the participants
      with established myocardial injury at inclusion to assess the percentage of the participants
      having ongoing myocardial injury.

      The secondary goal of the study is evaluation of quality of life of the patients recovered
      from the novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) by the means of EQ-5D and/or DASI
      questionnaire using the descriptive system of 5 components of quality of life related to the
      wellbeing, and visual analogue scale.
