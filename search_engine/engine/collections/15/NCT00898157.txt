    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To construct tissue microarrays (TMA) using tissue samples from older patients with
           diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with standard CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) with or without rituximab on clinical trial
           ECOG-E4494.

        -  To allow this TMA resource to be included in a large international effort (the Lunenburg
           Lymphoma Biomarker Consortium [LLBC]), partnering with several other similar randomized
           trials (EORTC, HOVON, GELA, MINT) in order to properly power and bring standardization
           to the study of biomarkers in lymphoma.

        -  To evaluate the clinical impact and prognostic importance of a number of biomarkers,
           including Bcl-2, Bcl-6, CD10, FOXP1, MUM1, Ki-67, CD5, and HLA-Dr.

        -  To determine the prognostic impact of clinical International Prognostic Index (IPI)
           variables in a large international study.

        -  To determine the relationship between different biomarkers and clinical predictors.

        -  To establish the TMA (using tissue samples from patients treated on clinical trial
           ECOG-E4494) as a resource for future ECOG-driven studies and for validation of novel
           biomarkers as they become recognized and available.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (CHOP chemotherapy
      [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone] or CHOP-like chemotherapy vs
      CHOP chemotherapy with or without rituximab).

      Tissue microarrays will be constructed using tissue samples previously collected from
      patients treated on clinical trial ECOG-E4494. Tissue microarrays will be used for biomarker
      studies.
