      T-cells for the immunotherapy of neuroblastoma. The CAR T-cell trials employing second
      generation receptors and lymphodepleting conditioning regimes have produced objective
      clinical responses in patients with relapsed leukaemias. The current trial aims to evaluate
      similar CAR T-cells but directed against the antigen GD2. Neuroblastoma is well suited to
      this form of targeted therapy because of the homogeneous and almost universal expression of
      GD2 on the surface of neuroblastoma cells, and because of the poor prognosis of eligible
      patients.

      1RG-CART will be administered intravenously. As the CAR T-cells are designed to survive and
      proliferate on encountering antigen, no direct relationship is anticipated between cell dose
      and either efficacy or toxicity. Rather, clinical benefit is more likely to be observed in
      those patients in whom in vivo expansion successfully occurs. A possible key determinant of
      expansion will be prior lymphodepletion of the patients. For this reason this trial is
      designed to evaluate a phased introduction of lymphodepletion in successive patient cohorts,
      rather than T-cell dose escalation. Only if there is insufficient expansion of T-cells
      following full lymphodepletion will the T-cell dose be escalated.
