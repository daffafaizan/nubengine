    
      Screening Visit:Initial screening evaluations including physical examination, medical
      history, and clinical laboratory assessments will be conducted to determine study
      eligibilities during a routine clinic visit at the UPMC HVI, CLC or inpatient at UPMC
      Presbyterian. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be entered into the study.

      Day 1: This study visit will occur on the same day subjects are scheduled for their
      clinically indicated right heart catheterization or who volunteer for a research right heart
      catheterization for this specific study. Subjects on oral background PAH therapy (ETRA or
      PDE5I) will be instructed to hold their regimen on the day of the study visit.

      Subjects will receive nebulized AIR001 doses escalated based upon safety and tolerability.
      The dose of inhaled nitrite will be delivered via electronic nebulizer. During the study
      right heart/pulmonary artery hemodynamics will be measured as well as noninvasive systemic
      blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be tested for the changes in pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR) using standard clinical protocol hemodynamic recordings of right atrial,
      right ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures, in addition to cardiac output at time
      zero,

      3 Day phone follow up

      30 Day follow up visit: All subjects enrolled in the study will be followed for 30 days (+/-
      5 day window) after completion of the study treatment. A physical exam and clinical labs will
      be obtained at this visit.
