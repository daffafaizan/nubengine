      and Carboplatin are two of the best partners with high pCR. The significant efficacy and good
      safety profile of HerceptinÂ® combination with taxane as adjuvant treatment on EBC are
      accepted; 1 year of Herceptin as adjuvant treatment is one standard therapy. This study is
      one small Phase II trial to explore the efficacy and safety of QW and Q3W of PCH as
      Neoadjuvant treatment, we only plan 60 pts and the trend of the two curves is anticipated
