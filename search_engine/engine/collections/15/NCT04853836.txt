    
      Patients ages 18 to 90 years with confirmed history of COVID-19 (positive nasopharyngeal swab
      for SARS-CoV-2) and subjective olfactory dysfunction persisting ≥ 90 days after follow-up
      negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab are eligible.

      All patients will undergo nasal endoscopic examination to look for presence of polyps,
      masses, anatomic blockage, or other pathology which presence will require exclusion from the
      study. Patients then will be evaluated at the baseline with Sniffin' Sticks (Burghardt®,
      Wedel, Germany) prior to initiating olfactory training and/or supplement treatment/nasal
      spray (T0). Three groups received weekly olfactory training, and patients in the supplement
      group additionally received a daily oral tablet that contained PEA 700 mg and Luteolin 70 mg
      (Glialia ®, Epitech pharmaceutical, Milano, Italy), while the one in spray group -nasal
      cortisone.

      Assessment of olfactory function will be repeated at 30 days, 60 and 90 and 120 days
