    
      Specific objectives:

        -  To develop the infrastructure and instruments for setting-up a European, long-term
           registry of paediatric patients treated with modern external radiotherapy techniques ;

        -  To assess the incidence and severity of late health outcomes, primarily endocrine
           dysfunctions, cardiovascular toxicities, neurovascular damages, and subsequent primary
           neoplasms, in relation to the dose-volume distribution to non-targeted organs and
           tissues, radiation delivery technique and beam quality factors, and potential modifying
           factors (i.e. age at exposure, genetic predispositions, comorbidities, and systemic
           treatments including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and hormonal drugs)
           that may underlie differences in individual susceptibility for these outcomes ;

        -  To assess societal aspects of advances in radiotherapy, primarily health-related quality
           of life and academic achievement, in paediatric patients treated with modern external
           radiotherapy techniques.

      Secondary scientific objectives:

        -  To assess multidimensional fatigue in paediatric patients treated with modern external
           radiotherapy techniques, and identify clinical and therapeutic determinants of fatigue;

        -  To improve estimation of patient-specific doses to the whole body and non-targeted
           organs and substructures from different radiotherapy delivery techniques;

        -  To investigate radiation-induced cellular responses and biological mechanisms related to
           the occurrence of vascular diseases and subsequent primary neoplasms in samples of blood
           and saliva ; to identify biomarkers of susceptibility and health effects ; to evaluate
           differences in disease biomarkers in relation to the radiation delivery technique and
           beam quality factors ; to explore the relevance of the use of saliva as a biosampling
           method for paediatric cohorts regarding feasibility and the quality and reproducibility
           for different measured biomarkers.

      Secondary strategic objectives:

        -  To promote sustained collaborative research activities for improvement of patient care,
           and inform health care providers and policy makers on the clinical and social impact of
           advances in radiotherapy in paediatric settings;

        -  To serve as a pilot for a future long-term pan-European registry of children and
           adolescents treated with particle and photon beam therapy, including a biobank of saliva
           and blood samples collected before and after treatment;

        -  To contribute in future collaborative projects with existing cohorts or registries in
           Europe

        -  To contribute in future international research studies on late outcomes of modern
           radiotherapy techniques for management of paediatric cancers
