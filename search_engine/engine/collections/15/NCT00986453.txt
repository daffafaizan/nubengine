      from both female breasts for therapeutic or cosmetic indications. The purpose of the breast
      reduction is to decrease the weight of the breasts and restructure the breast tissue for a
      more favorable appearance. Typically, a scalpel is used for the skin incision and a
      traditional electrosurgical device is used to cut away any excess tissue.

      The PEAK PlasmaBladeâ„¢ uses pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy and a highly-insulated handpiece
      design to enable precision cutting and coagulation at the point of application. The
      PlasmaBlade has received FDA clearance for use in plastic, general, and ear, nose, and throat
      (ENT) surgery, and has demonstrated a significantly reduced thermal injury profile in incised
      tissue compared to traditional electrosurgical devices. It is hypothesized that this benefit
      may improve the post-operative outcome of patients undergoing bilateral breast reduction.

      A total of forty-five (45) subjects were enrolled into the study. Forty-three (43) underwent
      bilateral breast reduction, and two (2) subjects were withdrawn prior to surgery. Enrollment
      and surgeries took place between 18 September 2009 and 12 August 2011. Potential subjects
      were screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study protocol and were
      required to provide informed consent prior to enrollment. Following enrollment, subject
      operative sites were prospectively randomized to the SOC or PlasmaBlade (PB or PEAK) study
      groups and scheduled for bilateral breast reduction. Subjects were unaware of which device
      was used on which breast. Subjects were required to attend two follow-up visits after
      surgery, approximately one and six weeks following surgery.
