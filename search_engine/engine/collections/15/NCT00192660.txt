      changes in composition of fat throughout the body (loss in some areas and accumulation in
      others), elevations in blood lipids and abnormalities in glucose metabolism. The resulting
      syndrome is known as "HIV associated lipodystrophy" or HIVLD. In HIV negative populations,
      such abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism are associated with an increased risk of
      developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study is to characterize the changes
      that occur in body composition and metabolism with antiretroviral treatment and compare them
      to changes in fat tissue structure and function and surrogate markers for cardiovascular
      disease.
