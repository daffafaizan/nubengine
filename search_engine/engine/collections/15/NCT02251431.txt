    
      Primary Aim

      Among adult individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and at risk for diastolic heart
      failure (DHF) and mildly reduced renal filtration function (Type 4 cardiorenal syndrome), to
      evaluate the quantitative impact on the MISS (myocardial injury summary score) cardiac
      biomarker score, cardiac fibrosis by MRI, cardiac strain by ultrasonography and strain rate
      imaging, and KISS (kidney injury summary score) kidney biomarker score after 38 weeks of
      treatment with exenatide extended-release or placebo.

      Secondary Aim

      To evaluate the inter-relationships between demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables
      (MISS score, KISS score) and of progressive cardiac fibrosis as assessed by MRI, strain-rate
      imaging, and in adult individuals with T2DM and at risk for DHF (Type 4 cardiorenal
      syndrome).
