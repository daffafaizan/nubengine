    
      The primary objectives - To improve the specifications of the OctavaPink test and the
      OctavaBlue test. The current specifications being

        1. For the OctavaPink - 95% specificity and 50% sensitivity.

        2. For the OctavaBlue - 50% specificity and 95% sensitivity.

      The study will be considered as successful in any of the below options -

        1. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaPink chip will maintain specificity of at
           least 95% and increase the sensitivity to at least 85%.

        2. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaBlue chip will maintain sensitivity of at
           least 95% and increase the specificity to at least 85%.
