      Alzheimer's disease, but this has not yet been proven in humans. We are looking for
      individuals to participate in this study to see if a cholesterol-lowering medication, called
      simvastatin affects blood flow to the brain, blood vessel function and a substance in the
      spinal fluid related to the changes in Alzheimer's disease.

      The SHARP study included 88 adults ages 40-72 with parental history of documented Alzheimer's
      disease. The study had 9 visits over the course of 18 months. Participants had fasting blood
      tests collected, completed a medical history questionnaire and medication side effect review,
      underwent lumbar puncture procedure, completed memory testing, and had ultrasound and MRI
      procedures. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either simvastatin or a placebo
      each night for 18 months.
