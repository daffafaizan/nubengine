      Primary

        -  Determine whether a change in the formulation alters the pharmacokinetic profile of
           paclitaxel in the plasma of patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic solid
           tumors treated with ABI-007 and paclitaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetic data of this regimen with decrease in the neutrophil count at
           nadir in these patients.

        -  Determine the intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of ABI-007 in these
           patients.

        -  Determine protein binding of paclitaxel via measurement of Î±-1-acid glycoprotein and
           serum albumin levels in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study.

        -  Courses 1 and 2: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and ABI-007 IV over 30
                minutes on day 22.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV over
                3 hours on day 22.

        -  Courses 3 and beyond: All patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
           repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
