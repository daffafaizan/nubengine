      subjects with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma. Subjects will receive rituximab by
      IV infusion over several hours once a week for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy as
      repeat course of the same dose and schedule rituximab at 6, 12, and 18 months.

      This was a single-arm study with multiple treatment periods added by amendment (ie, Secondary
      Group), with results reported by treatment period. As this was always considered a single-arm
      study, there was no intent to report the results for the initial treatment period separately
      as the Initial Group vs the Secondary Group.
