      effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-6). Specific inhibition of these
      cytokines with newer, parenterally administered biologic agents has revolutionized the
      treatment of RA. Apremilast is a novel, orally administered drug which approaches the
      reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines via inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4).

      Apremilast, Acetamide, N-[2-[ (1S)-1-(3-ethoxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)
      ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-1,3-dioxo-1H-isoindol-4-yl] is a phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor
      under development for use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

      PDE4 is one of the major phosphodiesterases expressed in leukocytes. Inhibitors of PDE4 cause
      accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn activates
      protein kinase A and other downstream effectors, resulting in inhibition of pro-inflammatory
      cytokine transcription and other cellular responses such as neutrophil degranulation,
      chemotaxis, and adhesion to endothelial cells.

      In human cellular models, apremilast inhibited production of inflammatory mediators such as
      TNF-α, IL-12, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-8, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and the adhesion molecule
      CD18/CD11b (Mac-1).

      Apremilast has also been shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory agent in several animal
      models of inflammation.
