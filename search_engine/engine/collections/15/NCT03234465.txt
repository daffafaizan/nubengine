    
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, multi-center trial in which
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or AG013. AG013 is a
      mouth rinse formulation of Lactococcus lactis strain sAGX0085, deficient in the gene coding
      for thymidylate synthase and producing human TFF1 (Trefoil Factor 1).

      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study. To protect subjects from
      unanticipated safety risks, enrollment and treatment in the double-blind study will continue
      until 10 subjects on AG013 have been recruited. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
      review safety data after these 10 subjects on AG013 have completed study treatment. If there
      are no safety signals identified, the study will continue to recruit the planned number of
      subjects.

      There are 4 study periods as described below: screening, active treatment, short term
      follow-up and long term follow-up. The screening phase will be no longer than 4 weeks. The
      active treatment phase will be between 7 and 9 weeks depending on the subject's prescribed
      CRT (chemoradiation therapy) plan. The short term follow-up phase will be 4 weeks in
      duration. The long term follow-up will continue until 12 months post CRT. Oral mucositis (OM)
      assessments will begin at the start of CRT and continue until the subject has completed short
      term follow-up or until the OM resolves (as defined by a WHO (World Health Organization)
      score of â‰¤ 1), whichever comes first. Long term follow-up will continue for 12 months to
      assure that AG013 does not adversely impact the tumor response to anti-neoplastic therapy.
