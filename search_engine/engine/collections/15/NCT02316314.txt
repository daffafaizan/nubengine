      modalities: hand crank exercise, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, echocardiography
      (ECHO), and serum measurements of cardiac status, including high sensitivity troponin, a
      measure of cardiac myocyte damage; N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide
      (NTproBNP), a measure of heart failure; and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), a general measure
      of muscle damage. While there have been individual studies of some of these modalities, there
      are no studies that correlate these parameters and it is not known which parameters are more
      sensitive to cardiac dysfunction. This preliminary study will help define the parameters most
      useful in assessing the cardiac involvement in FRDA. In addition, the study will investigate
      noninvasive tests and procedures that may serve as biomarkers for the neurologic disease. In
      other neurological diseases, non-invasive examination of the number and structure of nerve
      cells in the cornea has been assessed as an indication of disease progression.
