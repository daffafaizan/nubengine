      Elbow when used in primary or revision total elbow replacement by analysis of standard
      scoring systems, radiographs, and adverse event records.

      The safety of the device will be monitored using the frequency and incidence of reporting
      adverse events.

      The performance of the device will be evaluated by assessing the pain and functional
      performance, survival of the device, patient health status, and radiographic success of the
