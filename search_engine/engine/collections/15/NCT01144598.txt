      non-interventional, multi-center format in Turkey. As this is a post marketing observational
      study, Abbott is not involved in the product supply since the drug is being used according to
      the approved marketing label and is to be prescribed by the physician under usual and
      customary practice of physician prescription.

      Subjects will be recruited from rheumatology outpatient clinics of university hospitals
      and/or private offices.

      Patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis who had received at least one disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drug, who are already employed at a paid work and able to provide disease
      history data will be included.

      Patient data will be collected with a single visit. During the single visit, all required
      demographic and clinical data will be recorded on the case report forms by the investigators
      and every subject will be asked to fill out the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment
      questionnaire and the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index.
