      particular the infants admitted to the NICU, are at higher risk of MEs as compared to the
      adult and pediatric population. Moreover adverse events (ADEs) occur more frequently and may
      be particularly severe in neonates.

      Several strategies have been tried in order to decrease the incidence of MEs in the NICU.
      Among these, some studies investigated the effectiveness of CPOE in reducing MEs in
      hospitalised patients. However, results have been inconsistent. So far, no study investigated
      the association of CPOE + BCMA in neonates.

      The investigators designed a monocentric prospective pre and post-intervention observational
      study to investigate the efficacy of the CPOE plus BCMA as compared to paper order entry in
      reducing MEs in the NICU population.
