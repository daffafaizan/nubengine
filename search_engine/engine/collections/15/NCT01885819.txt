      autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells administered to 20 patients with disease
      modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-resistant Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have been
      nonresponsive to at least one course of one DMARD selected from a group comprising of: gold
      salts, leflunomide, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine.

      The primary objective of safety will be defined as freedom from treatment associated adverse
      events for the period of one year. The secondary objective of efficacy will include
      evaluation at baseline and at months 1, 2, 3 and 6 of efficacy endpoints of CRP, ESR,
      anti-citrulline antibody, RF, Quality of Life Questionnaire, 28-joint disease activity score
      (DAS28), European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria and immunological
      parameters.
