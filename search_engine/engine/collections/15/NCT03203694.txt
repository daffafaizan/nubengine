      founded on rodent studies, hence the urgent need for human studies, especially in patients
      with type 2 diabetes (T2D). For example, it remains unknown if increased walking, the most
      common form of physical activity, enhances skeletal muscle vasodilator actions of insulin in
      T2D. In addition, the molecular mechanisms by which exercise improves vasoreactivity to
      insulin have not been examined in humans. The investigators propose that in T2D patients who
      are sedentary (i.e., the vast majority), increased leg blood flow with walking or local
      heating signifies a vital strategy to correct vascular insulin resistance. This study will
      establish whether increased physical activity and associated hemodynamic forces (e.g., shear
      stress) are a direct form of vascular medicine in humans.
