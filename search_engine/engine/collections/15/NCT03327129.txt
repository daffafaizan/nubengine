      risk for suicidal behaviour, illustrating the need for more comprehensive biomarkers for
      clinicians to guide their treatment approach and for new treatment avenues. Current theories
      of suicide have suggested the importance of an individual's capability for suicide in
      predicting suicide attempt or death. Building on this, Yovell and colleagues (2016) provided
      important preliminary data that the opioid system affects suicide risk, but the neural
      mechanisms and their relationship to capability for suicide are unclear. The goal of the
      proposed research is to identify the neural network underlying capability for suicide using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to determine if it can be a target for
      identifying high-risk individuals and for intervention.
