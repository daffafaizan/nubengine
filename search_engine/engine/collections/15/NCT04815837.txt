    
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate prevalence of uptake of Human
      Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination after exposure to health promotion among men who have sex
      with men in Hong Kong within a 12-month project period.

      Inclusion criteria are Hong Kong Chinese speaking males aged 18-45 years old and
      self-reported having had oral or anal intercourse with at least one man in the last six
      months. Those who have ever received HPV vaccination are excluded.

      Participants are recruited through outreaching in gay venues, online advertisement and
      referral made by peers and non-governmental organization. With verbal informed consent,
      participants completed a baseline survey through telephone. They are then exposed to online
      interventions including: 1) watching an online video, 2) receiving a discount coupon to
      receive HPV vaccination at collaborative private clinics, 3) visiting the project webpage,
      and 4) receiving follow-up reminders 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 months after the baseline survey.

      All participants are followed up by telephone 12 months after the baseline survey to access
      the primary outcome.
