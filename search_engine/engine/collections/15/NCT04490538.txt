      function is the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). It is measured in apical
      four chamber view by conventional M-mode imaging. Other echocardiographic parameters of right
      ventricular systolic function (Fractional Area Change; Tricuspid Lateral Annular Systolic
      Velocity; Right Ventricular Index of Myocardial Performance) are evaluated in apical four
      chamber view as well. However, this view might not be clearly visible in the clinical setting
      of critical illness and subcostal view is often preferred for its higher quality.
      Unfortunately, conventional M-mode can not be used for measurement in this view but
      anatomical M-mode imaging can. Therefore, the investigators decided to evaluate whether TAPSE
      measured in subcostal view by anatomical M-mode (sTAPSE) correlates with conventional TAPSE
      and whether reliably reflects systolic right ventricular function.
