      have been examined for their ability to block or substitute for the action of the naturally
      occurring steroids. On occasion, these substances have both effects, depending on the tissue
      that is examined or on the physiology of the person receiving the agent. The development of
      these kinds of compounds, called selective hormone receptor modulators, may provide new
      treatments that are targeted to specific organs or tissues. One example of these compounds is
      the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene, which blocks estrogen action at the
      uterus, and acts like estrogen at the bone, allowing its use in post-menopausal women as
      estrogen replacement therapy without requiring progesterone.

      This study evaluates the progesterone receptor modulator CDB-2914. Earlier studies using
      single doses of this compound show that it can slow ovarian and uterine development during
      the menstrual cycle, and can induce menses, depending on when it is given during the
      menstrual cycle.

      Many steroids have an improved bioavailability when given in a micronized formulation.
      Previous studies with CDB-2914 have used crystalline powder up to a dose of 200 mg. We wish
      to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of crystalline and micronized CDB-2914, 10 mg. The
      drug will be given as a single oral dose and blood will be drawn frequently over 12 hours and
      then daily for five days for measurement of the compound.
