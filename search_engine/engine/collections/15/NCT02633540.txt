      T1-2N0 glottic cancer. This technique involves treatment of the entire larynx for tumors that
      are small and limited. Although technological advances now allow radiation oncologists
      selectively to target and avoid adjacent sub-portions of any organ, these tools have not been
      applied T1-2N0 glottic cancer due to the perceived low toxicity of standard therapy. However,
      radiotherapy for early glottic cancer is not without functional side effects and it is not
      known whether post-treatment function after whole larynx radiation is superior to a more
      targeted surgical approach.

      This is a phase II study to treat unilateral glottic cancer (Stage T1a and T2aN0) with
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). In view of the anticipated small volume of
      disease at presentation and need to limit the potential for a "marginal miss", treatment will
      include the entire involved vocal fold, anterior commissure, and the anterior 1/3 of the
      contralateral vocal fold thus sparing the contralateral arytenoid cartilage and musculature
      ("contralateral arytenoid sparing IMRT"). In addition, we propose to perform sophisticated
      objective and patient reported measures regarding speech outcomes for two years after the
      completion of therapy at specified intervals, to better gain an understanding of the effects
      of therapy. Our findings will have the potential to dramatically advance the field of early
      larynx cancer therapy by demonstrating the efficacy of limiting the volume of uninvolved
      larynx that receives radiation and comprehensively assessing the functional outcomes of said
      therapy.
