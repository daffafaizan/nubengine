    
      Enrolled patients will have the CNAP sited in the post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) and it
      will stay on their arm until at least 12 hours have passed. The device will collect
      continuous heart rate, blood pressure, and nominal cardiac output; it also derives a range of
      values from these measurements. There is minimal risk attributable to the use of the CNAP
      device. These devices are already in routine clinical use in the UK in intensive care units,
      high-dependency units and operating theatres.

      To reduce burden on the patient, no additional HR/BP monitor is required and whenever the
      usual care team would like to know the HR or BP these values will be displayed. The
      additional parameters (related to measurement of cardiac output) will not be shared with the
      clinical team - they will remain blinded to these data because otherwise there is the risk
      that they would use this additional information to alter clinical management.

      Medical notes will be examined to provide information about demographics, physical
      characteristics (height, weight), and previous medical history - please see case report form
      (CRF, appendix 1) for more details.

      There are no blood tests, or other acquisition of biological samples.
