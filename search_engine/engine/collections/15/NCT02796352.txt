    
      This is a phase II study of high dose bolus interleukin-2 (HD IL2) in patients with advanced
      inoperable stage III or stage IV melanoma who have prior anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

      Each course consists of 2 cycles of HD IL2 as follows: high-dose IL2 at 600,000 IU/kg is
      given intravenously (IV) every 8 hours for up to 14 doses (one cycle), followed by a rest
      period of 1-2 weeks and readmission for a second HD IL2 cycle for up to 14 doses (second
      cycle).

      The planned treatment consists of 3 courses (6 cycles) of HD IL-2. Response assessment will
      occur at the end of each course of therapy and patients without evidence of disease
      progression (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, RECIST, version 1.1) or limiting
      toxicities will be offered additional courses of treatment of HD IL2 for a maximum of 3
      courses.
