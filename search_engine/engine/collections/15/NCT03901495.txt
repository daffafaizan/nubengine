      increase the quality of medical consultations by providing physicians with an exhaustive,
      high-quality, standardized anamnesis and differential diagnosis. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to establish whether an AMHTD of interest, "Diaana", allowed the
      physician to establish a more precise differential diagnosis.

      A single-center, unblinded, 1:1 parallel pseudo-randomized efficacy trial will be performed.
      No follow-up is necessary, because patients are seen once and all data are collected on this
      time. The study will take place in the emergency outpatient unit of Geneva University
      Hospital and include patients suffering from symptoms covered by Diaana.

      Patients in the intervention group will fullfil Dianna. Then, the resident physician will
      read Diaana summary, perform his consultation, and fullfil case report form, including his
      differential diagnosis. Then, the senior physician will see the patient and establish the
      gold-standard differential diagnosis. In the control group, the residents will directely
      establish a differential diagnosis, without the help of Diaana.
