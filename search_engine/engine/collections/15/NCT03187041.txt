      of common elastic tourniquet methods for blood draws. Specifically, the study will
      investigate whether the surface pressures produced by blood draw tourniquets when applied by
      experienced phlebotomists are significant enough to penetrate to deeper tissue near bone
      where major arteries and nerves lie. By relating factors including tourniquet width and
      patient arm circumference to our surface pressure measurements and comparing our results to
      previous literature, the investigators hope to determine the safety of current blood draw
      tourniquet procedures.

      In addition, the investigators will track changes in skin surface pressures over time to
      determine if prolonged exposure to these tourniquet pressures has the potential to
      permanently affect nerve function and muscle in tissues near bone.

      Hand sensation will be investigated during a prolonged tourniquet application trial of the
      study to test the effects of the generated pressures on median, ulnar, and radial nerve
      viability over time.
