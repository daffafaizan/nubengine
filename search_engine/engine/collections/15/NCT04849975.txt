      presentation, a radiological pelvimetry is performed to evaluate the measurements of the
      pelvis and decide on the appropriate mode of delivery.

      Several imaging modalities are used, including pelvic computed tomography (CT),and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis.

      CT scan has the disadvantage of maternal irradiation and MRI has the disadvantage of an
      inaccurate morphological analysis.The EOS® system is an imaging tool used in radiopediatric
      to allow precise morphological analysis of bone masses with minimal irradiation.

      The quality of the morphological analysis and measurements provided by the EOS® imaging
      system is the reason for proposing this study comparing the pelvimetric measurements obtained
      by MRI and by the EOS® imaging system.
