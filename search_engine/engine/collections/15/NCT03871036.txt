    
      This trial will include metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients who progressed during or
      after treatment with anti-PD(L)1 therapy and have been treated by a platinum-containing
      regimen, or are cisplatin-ineligible.

      A run-in safety phase will be followed by a non-comparative 3-arm randomized study with a
      Simon's 2-stage optimal design.

      Screening:

      Before enrollment, patients will need to complete the following screening procedures (among
      other assessments):

        -  Baseline evaluation by CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (<4 weeks)

        -  Laboratory assessment

        -  Tissue biopsy (in at least 6 patients per arm)

      Run-in phase-1 (R1): n=3 patients will be treated with:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 75 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45

      Run-in phase-2 (R2): n=3 patients will be treated with:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 225 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45

      Run-in phase-3 (R3): n=2 x 3 patients will be randomized over 2 arms:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45 OR

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 75 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-5

        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)

      Run-in phase-4 (R4): n=3 patients will be treated with:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 300 mg once on day 1 of cycle 2

        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)

      Enrollment will start with the first run-in cohort (R1) and will be halted after inclusion of
      the 3rd patient, until 60 days after start of treatment of this patient. Stopping rules are
      defined in the section 6.3 of the protocol. In case unexpected toxicity occurs (either as
      defined by the stopping rules or otherwise unexpected severe toxicity), the study team will
      discuss with the IDMC whether expansion to include 3 additional subjects is warranted. If no
      unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the 3rd
      patient of R1, enrollment for R2 will begin in a similar fashion. If 2 or more
      nonhematological toxicities as described in section 6.3 "Definition of DLT" occur in R1 or
      R2, enrollment will be suspended until the IDMC has formulated an advice. After this advice,
      the sponsor will decide on continuation.

      If no unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the
      3rd patient of R2, the study will continue with a third run-in cohort (R3) where patients
      will be randomized over 2 arms (R3A and R3B), n=3 per arm. If no unexpected toxicity has
      occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the 3rd patient in arm R3A, this arm
      will be continued into the main study phase (as Arm A). If unacceptable toxicity is observed
      at either 225 mg or 750 mg of tremelimumab during one of the run-in cohorts, a lower dose
      level can be used in the main study. In addition, after completion of R3A and continuation in
      the main study phase, a control arm (Arm C) will be initiated where patients will be treated
      with tremelimumab monotherapy (without paclitaxel).

      If no unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the
      3rd patient of R3B, enrollment for run-in cohort R4 will begin in a similar fashion as
      described for the earlier run-in cohorts. Expansion arms A and C will be paused while this
      cohort is enrolling. If no unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation
      of treatment of the 3rd patient of R4, enrollment for arm R4 will be continued into the main
      study phase (as Arm B). If unacceptable toxicity is observed at 300 mg of tremelimumab in
      combination with 1500mg durvalumab, arm B, combining paclitaxel, tremelimumab and durvalumab,
      will be discontinued.

      Main study:

      Arm A:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45

      Arm B:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 300 mg once on day 1 of cycle 2

        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)

      Arm C (control arm):

      • tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 1-5 and then every 12 weeks until week 41

      Enrollment will be halted when 12 patients are enrolled in each arm; this will include
      patients treated in R3 at the dose level used in the main study. These patients will be
      included in the efficacy analysis.

      After the last patient has had the second evaluation scan, the Objective Response Rate (ORR)
      of each treatment arm will be evaluated. If one or more of the experimental arms has ≥2
      responses, the study team will discuss continuation of one of the experimental arms to n=20
      with the IDMC. In case 2 responses are seen in one of the arms prior to the second evaluation
      scan of the last patient, a decision on expansion of that arm may be recommended earlier.
