      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or marrow transplantation on the outcomes of treatment
      related mortality, response, relapse, survival, and event free survival for patients with
      advanced multiple myeloma.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow (BM) collection and infusion are
      performed according to standard practice. Patients undergo total marrow irradiation (TMI) bid
      for 3 days. Busulfan is administered every 6 hours on days -6 to -3. PBSC or BM is infused on
      day 0. Interferon alfa is administered subcutaneously on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
      beginning on day 80. Interferon therapy may continue in the absence of graft versus host
      disease or disease progression. Patients are followed on days 56 and 84, then every 6 months
      for 2 years, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued over 3 years.
