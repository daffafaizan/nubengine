      body mass, total body weight, functional capacity, appetite, and fatigue in patients with
      weight loss due to advanced malignancy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral megestrol once daily. Patients
      also begin progressive resistance training 3 days a week. Treatment/exercise continues for 12
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or progressive weight loss (greater than 5
      pounds or 5% or more over first 4 study weeks).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
