      medications and deliver diabetes self-management education (DSME) among adults with type 2
      diabetes presenting to the emergency department (ED) with uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The
      primary hypothesis was that there would be improvement in HbA1c.

      A 4 week, randomized controlled trial provided algorithm-based antihyperglycemic medications
      management, survival skills DSME and navigation to primary care for ED patients with BG >
      200mg/dL. Medications were titrated and DSME delivered by endocrinologist-supervised
      certified diabetes educators. Controls received usual care.
