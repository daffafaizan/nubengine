    
      DABISURV study consists in an analyze of a cohort of patients with AF who have received at
      least one prescription Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) - reference group - or of dabigatran in
      the French National Health Insurance System.

      The uptake of dabigatran is followed for detecting hemorrhagic events or AMI associated with
      this molecule among first users.

      The ability to detect quickly substantial ADR of new drugs is of critical importance to
      public health in order to facilitate timely public health response. If the public health
      surveillance models are found useful for this topic, then semi-automated procedures would be
      needed to detect ADR associated with new generation anticoagulants in medico-administrative
      databases. If the public health surveillance models are found not useful for the detection of
      ADR, the cohort study itself will provide essential data on the safety profile of dabigatran.
