      incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) after myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced intensity
      conditioning (RIC) Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), using matched
      sibling or unrelated donor. In this study, the research team hypothesizes that longer term
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibition through treatment with tocilizumab by repeated dosing would
      mediate a beneficial effect not only on the risk of aGVHD, but also on chronic GVHD. This
      will be achieved by administering an additional dose of tocilizumab at Day +100 post-alloHCT,
      besides the pretransplant dose, as done in our previous clinical trial, thereby providing
      total prophylaxis against both acute and chronic GVHD.
