      a beating heart and the variations in hemodynamics that can occur when performing this type
      of procedure the incidence rate of cardiac arrhythmia occurring during and after surgery is
      one of the major complication in open heart surgery. in addition , intraoperative hemodynamic
      disorders, caused by changes in plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine after
      surgical stimulation , are some of challenges for patients undergoing off-pump coronary
      artery bypass surgery. hemodynamic disruption leads to myocardial ischemia, resulting in
      increased incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality.

      stellate ganglion is formed by the fusion of inferior cervical and first thoracic sympathetic
      ganglia and is located behind the subclavian artery and anterior to the first rib. the
      inferior cervical cardiac nerves arise from the medial aspect of the stellate ganglia and
      provide the cardio-accelerator nerve fibers to the cardiac plexus. stellate ganglion
      stimulation augments peak systolic pressure, and the enhanced myocardial contractility is
      secondary to stimulation by postganglionic nerve fibers which traverse from stellate ganglion
      down the great vessels and along the coronary arteries into the myocardium.the blockage of
      inferior cervical cardiac nerves is responsible for the bradycardia seen following SGB. SGB
      has been shown to prevent and control perioperative hypertension induced by increased
      sympathetic activity.
