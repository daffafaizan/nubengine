      medication with side effects. Memantine has beed shown to be associated with less agitation
      and a recent study by forrest pharmaceuticals failed to recruit. We will perform a 12 week
      rct in 164 patients to test this hypothesis in a locality with no competing studies and in a
      clinical setting where the drug is not often used. We will compare with placebo and also use
      a rescue protocol derived from international best practice.
