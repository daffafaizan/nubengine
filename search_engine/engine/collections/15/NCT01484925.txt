      esophagus that will help physicians better understand and manage this condition. Currently
      there is very little understanding as to how Barrett's esophagus develops and why some people
      with Barrett's esophagus go on to develop esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      develop a better understanding of how these processes occur. The investigators also hope to
      use the information from this study to identify new molecular markers that the investigators
      can use to better determine who will or will not go on to develop esophageal cancer. Patients
      who have been diagnosed in the past with Barrett's esophagus will be asked to participate.
      Patients without Barrett's esophagus will be asked to take part so that the investigators can
      compare tissue from patients without the conditions to those with the conditions.
