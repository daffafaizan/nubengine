      number of interventions delivered during a certain time period. More specifically, the RCT
      will examine:

        -  The effect of Continuous Medical Education (CME) to PHC providers

        -  The effect of financial reimbursement to PHC providers as a pay-for-performance of brief
           alcohol interventions

        -  Whether an alternative internet based method of delivering brief intervention can
           increase the proportion of patients reached

        -  If one implementation strategy will give an added value to one already enforced.
