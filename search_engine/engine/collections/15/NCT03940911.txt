        1. • To study for the first time the implication of the objective skeletal muscular impact
           in fatigue during SA.

        2. • To better characterize the skeletal muscle impact of SA;

        3. • To characterize the evolution of the fatigue and the muscular impact under anti-TNFα
           treatment and the predictive factors of response,

        4. • To identify new therapeutic targets for these two complications of SA, which currently
           have no specific treatment.
