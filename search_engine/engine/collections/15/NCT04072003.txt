      this study. The target lesions of patients need to be true coronary artery bifurcation
      lesions (Medina 1,1,1 or 0,1,1). After angiography, patients will be randomly assigned to
      intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) - guided and coronary angiography (CAG)- guided groups. The
      random number of patients will be generated by the central computer random system, and the
      random will be stratified according to the study sites. In coronary angiography(CAG)-guided
      group, two-stent technique will be used(the exact two-stent technique used was left to the
      operator's discretion). In intravascular ultrasound(IVUS)-guided group, minimal lumen
      area(MLA) in ostium of side branch will be measured by intravascular ultrasound(IVUS). If
      minimal lumen area(MLA)<4mm2, two-stent technique will be used(the exact two-stent technique
      used was left to the operator's discretion) and intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) will be
      repeated at the end of the procedure. If minimal lumen area(MLA) >=4mm2, one-stent technique
      will be used and intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) will be repeated. If minimal lumen area(MLA)
      in ostium of side branch is still >=4mm2, the procedure will be ended. If minimal lumen
      area(MLA) in ostium of side branch become <4mm2, the following interventional strategy will
      be left to the operator's discretion( balloon inflation, drug-eluting balloon, or switch to
      two-stent technique). Again, intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) will be repeated at the end of
      the procedure.
