      in clinical practice to address myofascial imbalances, including muscle spasms to improve
      thoracic cage excursion. Prior research has demonstrated that manual approaches applied to
      the thoracic cage have positive results with lung function and reducing inflammation.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disabling and progressive neuro-degenerative disorder.
      Morbidity and mortality are frequently associated with pulmonary dysfunction in patients with
      PD. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) have been utilized to document respiratory impairment in
      PD patients. Researchers estimate that 89% of people with PD have speech and voice disorders
      including disorders of laryngeal, respiratory and articulatory function.

      These authors hypothesize that performing OMM on the thoracic cage of PD subjects will show
      improvement in PFT, chest expansion, and speech production. Subjects with PD meeting the
      criteria for the study will be randomly assigned to either an OMM treatment or light touch
      control group. Each subject will be involved in one treatment visit. During this visit, the
      following will be measured before and after OMM or light touch procedures: maximal and
      minimal chest circumference; sound pressure, duration, and perceptual measures during
      sustained vowel phonation and Rainbow Reading; Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory
      Volume/1 second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Forced Expiratory Flow 25%-75%
      (FEF25-75%), and Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV). Data analysis will be performed with
      SPSS using Analysis of Covariance to measure significance.
