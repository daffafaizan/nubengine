    
      This is a screening protocol. This protocol allows two functions: 1) the protocol allows
      physicians in the Suburban/NHLBI Cardiovascular Imaging program to evaluate patients referred
      to the program with clinically indicated studies and research studies. 2) It is also designed
      to determine if patients may be suitable candidates for one of our NHLBI research protocols.

      Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age referred for possible cardiovascular
      disease will be enrolled in the protocol for a period of one year. At one year, patients will
      either be: 1) transferred to one of our specific research MRI or CT protocols, 2) removed
      from the screening protocol and made inactive, or 3) re-enrolled on the screening protocol
      with the patient s consent.
