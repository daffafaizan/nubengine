      IIIA-N2 disease. However, this subgroup is heterogeneous, with lymph nodes that are only
      microscopically invaded to those that are radiologically visible with bulky ipsilateral
      mediastinal lymph node involvement. Surgical resection in selected patients results in 5-year
      survival rates of 7-24%.

      The standard treatment for locally advanced clinical N2 disease is definitive concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy or induction chemotherapy (Â± radiation) followed by operation. However, in
      some patients, N2 status could be confirmed only after curative operation without any
      evidence of N2 diseases through preoperative evaluation methods (CT, PET, mediastinoscopy).
      We usually define those N2 disease found only after curative operation as microscopic N2, and
      do adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. However, little data
      about the adjuvant therapy for completely resected N2 disease have been available, Hence, we
      propose a randomized phase II study of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy
      alone in completely resected microscopic N2 NSCLC.
