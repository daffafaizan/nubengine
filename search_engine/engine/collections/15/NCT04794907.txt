      treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Examples
      include but are not limited to: describing the incidence, prevalence, and severity
      distribution of DR and AMD in the overall population and subgroups; diagnosing specified
      severity thresholds for DR and AMD; predicting the development and progression of DR and AMD
      for the overall population, subgroups, and individuals; and recommending tests and treatments
      to prevent or delay the progression of DR and AMD for the overall population, subgroups, and
      individuals.

      Data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively.
