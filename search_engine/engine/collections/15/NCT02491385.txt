    
      Postoperative ileus (POI) is a prolonged inhibition of coordinated bowel activity after
      surgery. Half of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery experience POI making it one of
      the limiting factors for early recovery.

      The pathogenesis of POI is multifactorial, and includes neurogenic, inflammatory and
      pharmacological mechanisms. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) can induce sympathetic block,
      attenuate inflammatory reaction and limit use of systemic opioids. In addition, sympatholysis
      induced by TEA can improve microcirculation of bowels and parasympathetic activation can
      increase gastrointestinal motility.

      However, studies comparing TEA and iv-PCA on POI are rare in major upper abdominal surgeries.
      This study, therefore, compares TEA and iv-PCA in terms of bowel function recovery as a
      primary endpoint in major upper abdominal surgeries. Secondary endpoints are side effects and
      hospital stay.
