      I. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab combined with lenalidomide in patients with
      previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) (determined by progression-free survival [PFS]
      at 2 years).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide in patients with
      untreated follicular lymphoma.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide in subjects
      with follicular lymphoma as assessed by complete remission (CR) at 30 months, overall
      response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS), and overall
      survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate prognostic and predictive biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 of
      course 1 and day 1 of courses 2-6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 30 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with CR or complete remission unconfirmed (CRu) may receive
      up to an additional 12 courses of lenalidomide.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 18 months
      and then every year for up to 2 years.
