      response is pivotal to the pathogenesis of liver disease. HBV specific T-cell function is
      impaired in patients with chronic HBV infection characterized by low levels of antiviral
      cytokines, impaired cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, and persistent viremia. However, the
      mechanism underlying this T-cell malfunction in chronic HBV infection has not been completely
      understood.

      The biomedical research on the samples obtained during this study will include, among other
      studies, advanced flow cytometry to study the Treg and activation markers, negative
      regulatory molecules and phenotype of CD4 and CD8 subsets using the extended panel markers
      developed at VGTI Florida. Additional antibody panels for measuring functional CD4 responses
      by ICS, DC subsets, activation, and signaling pathways by phos
