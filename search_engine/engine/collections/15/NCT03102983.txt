      Phase 1: The Gipsa-Lab Laboratory's Department of Speech and Cognition. This first visit will
      make it possible to make recordings of their vowel productions and to verify that the
      participants correspond to the criteria necessary for the study (passing the Edinburgh manual
      laterality test and auditory thresholds checked using a " An audiogram). It will also be an
      opportunity to provide them with the consent documents and the fact sheet, which will give
      them time to read it before the MRI exam. The duration of this first visit will be
      approximately 1 hour.

      Phase 2: fMRI review in the 3Tesla MRI Unit at the Grenoble University Hospital Center.
      Participants will first undergo a medical examination in order to verify their absence of
      contraindication to the MRI examination. At the end of this medical examination, the consent
      of participation will be signed. The participants will then be able to carry out the MRI
      examination for a duration of about 1h15, then the behavioral judgment test of perceptual
      distance. The total duration of this second visit will be approximately 1h45.
