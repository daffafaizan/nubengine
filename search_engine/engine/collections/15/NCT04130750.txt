      resectable and improve breast conservation rate. Patients with triple negative or Her2
      enriched subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy would have better survival.
      But the overall pCR rate of breast cancer was about 20%. And patients with luminal like
      subtype were less reactive for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Improving pCR rate maybe could
      achieve better survival. So, different methods have tried to improve pCR rate.Drug
      sensitivity screening in vitro for different chemotherapy drugs was a promising method for
      improving pCR rate. But there was no method could select effective drugs accurately until
      now. This study will explore whether drug screening by culturing breast cancer cells in vitro
      from breast cancer tissue could improve pCR rate compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      depend on physician's choice. 200 breast cancer patients who were candidates for neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy will be allocated to two group. One group with 100 patients will receive
      neoadjuvant cheotherapy according physician's choices. Another group with 100 patients will
      receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy according results of drug sensitivity results by in vitro
      cell culture. pCR rate will be compared between two groups to explore whether drug
      sensitivity screening could improve pCR rate.
