      500 SLE patients. Low-dose IL-2 is defined as 100IU IL-2 injected subcutaneously every other
      day for two weeks, followed by two-week break as one treatment cycle, and at least three
      weeks.There will be 250 patients in low-dose IL-2 group which treat with IL-2 combined with
      steroid and immunosuppressor. Non-IL-2 group is only treat with steroid and immunosuppressor.
      These patients are followed by every one month until get infected, otherwise, patients will
      be followed for two years. We focus on the type, positive microorganisms, grade and treatment
      of infection. Then, we will compare the differences of above parameters between these two
      groups.
