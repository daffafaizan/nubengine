      Local ethical committee approval will be obtained before the trial starts. Laboratory tests
      (complete blood count, glucose, creatinine, platelets, lipid profile) were performed for all
      patients. These tests provided an important overview of patient health and a baseline for
      analysis of the prognosis of PRP use. The process for obtaining PRP basically consists of
      collection of a 20-mL sample of blood, centrifugation of this sample for 8 min, isolation of
      a 1-mL aliquot of plasma collected near the erythrocyte fraction. Surgical procedure
      includes: surgical exploration and injection of PRP to stimulate bone regeneration within the
      bony cavity . Bone repair was assessed by panoramic X-rays obtained at 2, 4, and 6 months
      postoperatively. Bone density was measured by area histogram analysis.
