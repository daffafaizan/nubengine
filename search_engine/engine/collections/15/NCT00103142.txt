      Primary

        -  Compare 2-year disease-free survival of patients with completely resected hepatic or
           pulmonary metastases secondary to colorectal cancer treated with adjuvant vaccine
           therapy comprising vaccinia-Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-mucin 1 (MUC-1)- Triad of
           costimulatory molecules TRICOM vaccine (PANVAC-V) and fowlpox-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM vaccine
           (PANVAC-F) administered with autologous dendritic cells or with sargramostim (GM-CSF).

      Secondary

        -  Compare the rate and magnitude of immune response, as determined by enzyme-linked
           immunosorbent spot (ELISpot), in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain leukocytes for generation of autologous
           dendritic cells (DC). Patients then receive autologous DC loaded with
           vaccinia-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM (PANVAC-V) vaccine subcutaneously (SC) and intradermally (ID)
           on day 1 and autologous DC loaded with fowlpox-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM (PANVAC-F) vaccine
           subcutaneously (SC) and intradermally (ID) on days 28, 56, and 84.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive PANVAC-V SC on day 1 and PANVAC-F SC on days 28, 56, and 84.
           Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC into the same injection site once daily
           on days 0-3, 28-31, 56-59, and 84-87.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (36 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
