    
      The study is designed as a phase III, randomized, partially double-blinded, active controlled
      study with two groups of infants receiving vaccines at the ratio of 2:1 (liquid formulation
      of ROTAVIN to frozen formulation ROTAVIN-M1), to compare their immunogenicity and safety. Two
      doses of vaccine will be administered 8 weeks apart with the first vaccine administration
      between 60-91 days of age. All childhood vaccines as per the Expanded Program for
      Immunization of the Government of Vietnam (including Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis,
      Haemophilus influenzae type b and Hepatitis B vaccine (DTwPHib-HepB), and Oral Polio Vaccine
      at at 2, 3 and 4 months of age) will be allowed as per the immunization schedule.

      Active surveillance for vaccine reactogenicity (solicited reactions) over the 7-day period
      after each vaccination, unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for 4 weeks after each vaccination
      and serious adverse events (SAEs) including intussusception over the period between first
      vaccination and four weeks after the last vaccination will be conducted for all infants.

      This trial will generate immunogenicity and safety data which would be submitted to Ministry
      of Health in Vietnam for license of new formulation of ROTAVIN vaccine.
