      will determine eligibility. All eligible subjects will be invited back for a third and a
      fourth visit.

      Screening Period (Visits 1 and 2) - For All Subjects Eligible subjects will be identified
      during the initial screening procedures with measures of spirometry, hyperresponsiveness to
      methacholine, complete history, physical examination, allergen skin test, and mannitol cough
      challenge. The screening procedures will be conducted over 2 separate visits.

      Effects of Salbutamol (Visit 3 and 4) - For Healthy Control Subjects, Twenty subjects with no
      evidence of asthma will return for visit 3 and 4. These visits must be at least 24h apart and
      no longer than 7 days. Health controls will first receive salbutamol 2.5mg or saline placebo
      via a nebuliser and 15 mins later the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) measured.
      Subjects will then undergo a mannitol cough challenge exactly like the previous mannitol
      cough challenges. These data will be used for determining the effects of salbutamol on
      mannitol-induced cough.

      Visit Windows Each visit must be separated by a minimum of 24 hours, and a maximum of 7 days.
      Study visits can be performed in the morning or afternoon, however for each subject the
      timing should be consistent with Visits 2 at the same time of day Â± 2 hours
