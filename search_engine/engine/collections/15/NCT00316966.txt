      outcome. We recently found 30% under nutrition in 200 inpatients aged 65 and older.
      Interestingly few, if any, of these patients recieved nutritional intervention while
      hospitalized.

      Objectives: 1. To develop models for nutritional intervention among under nourished elderly
      inpatients.

      2. To determine the impact of the intervention programs and compare them to standard care.
      Prospective outcomes include health care use, health and nutritional status and dietary
      intake in the year following hospitalization.

      3. To assess the cost-effectiveness and clinical feasibility of the nutritional interventions
      proposed.

      Methods: Patients over 70 years of age, admitted to the Internal Medicine Department at
      Soroka University Hospital will be screened for nutritional risk. Patients at risk will be
      randomly allocated to 3 groups: standard care, in-hospital intensive intervention and
      in-hospital and community intensive intervention. In the year following their
      hospitalization, health status, health care use, quality of life and nutritional status will
      be assessed using validated tools.

      Importance of the study: Under nourished patients are at increased risk for medical
      complications and increased duration of hospitalization, both of which raise the cost of
      care. Intensive nutritional intervention may reduce length of stay and thus costs. A
      formalized intervention plan is crucial for efficacious cost-effective care. We feel that
      acute hospitalization is a window of opportunity for initiating long-term nutritional advice
      and follow-up.
