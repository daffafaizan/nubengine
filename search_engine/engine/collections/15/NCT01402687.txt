      will return the collection kit in a paid, pre-addressed mailer to the laboratory at
      Biomodels. The laboratory will isolate and store the DNA located in the cells of the saliva.
      A portion of this DNA will be used to analyze the different forms of genes. The remainder of
      the DNA will be destroyed when this study is completed. Biomodels will not be provided with
      patient identifiers.

      The investigators will also collect information from medical records, including information
      about diagnosis, treatment, stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation outcomes. This
      information will be de-identified.
