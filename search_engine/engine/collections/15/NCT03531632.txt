    
      This study is an open-label, Phase 1b/2, dose escalation and cohort expansion study designed
      to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor
      activity of MGD007 and MGA012, administered in combination by IV infusion, in patients with
      histologically proven, relapsed/refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma, irrespective of
      the KRAS and MMR status of their tumors.

      The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase to determine the MTD or Maximum Administered
      Dose (MAD; if no MTD is defined) of the combination, followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to
      further define the safety and initial antitumor activity of the combination with the doses
      established in the Dose Escalation Phase.
