    
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, longitudinal study of the natural history and
      function of patients with MTM. The study duration is 36 months. The enrollment period will be
      12 months and each patient will be assessed over 24 months. Data will be analyzed at baseline
      and annually thereafter and reports will be prepared based on these analyses. A final report
      will summarize findings after all patients have completed 24 months of follow-up. Assessments
      performed in this study will be based on the age and ambulatory status of the patient. The
      assessments will also be adjusted to account for the variability in both phenotypes and age
      of the patients who may participate in this study. Patients will be evaluated at Baseline,
      Month 6, Month 12 and Month 24. It is anticipated that approximately 60 patients from the
      United States, Canada and Europe will be included in this study.
