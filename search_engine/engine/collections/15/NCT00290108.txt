      lead to a reduction of up to 50% in the dose of propofol required to achieve the onset of a
      clinical endpoint of anesthesia (i.e. loss of consciousness) when titrating to effect.
      Therefore, it has been concluded that a slow injection requires a smaller dose of propofol as
      the graded effect is weakened by fast injection. This conclusion contradicts pharmacologic
      considerations, that a fast injection would lead to a higher peak concentration and in
      consequence, to a higher peak effect at the effect side, the brain.

      The present study was designed to measure the Electroencephalogram (EEG) peak effect of a
      propofol bolus (2 mg/kg) injected with different infusion rates.

      Although it is known that propofol has cardiovascular effects, the influence of injection
      rate on these cardiovascular changes is less clear. Others found that faster injection rates
      of propofol caused greater reductions in blood pressure. Other similar studies have shown no
      difference in blood pressure for different injection rates. An additional aim of this study
      was therefore to investigate the influence of different injection rates on hemodynamic
      parameters.
