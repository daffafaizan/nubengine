      thromboembolism, length of hospital stay and both pulmonary and general post-operative
      complications. Ambulation is also a main tenant of a fast-track recovery protocol known as
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), which is commonly used among colorectal surgical
      practices and being implanted across other surgical practices. Despite evidence supporting
      its benefit, early ambulation has been identified as the one of the most difficult clinical
      interventions to enforce and to measure.

      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate whether the use of wireless activity
      tracking device (Fitbit) with 5 daily reminder alarms will increase daily ambulation on
      postoperative day 0 until post operative day 9 or hospital discharge (whichever occurs
      first). Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of Fitbit as a motivating factor
      on the frequency of postoperative ileus, time to return of bowel function, number of venous
      thromboembolism (VTE), pneumonia (PNA) and other pulmonary complications, number of code
      Medical Emergency Team (MET) alerts, and overall cost saving.
