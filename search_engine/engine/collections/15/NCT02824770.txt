      approved by Eskisehir Osmangazi University Ethics Committee. Forty consecutive patients, aged
      18-65, who will undergo elective major abdominal operations will be enrolled in the study
      after obtaining informed consent. All patients will receive adequate postoperative pain
      management with the Pain Buster Â® system and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA).
      The patients will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group.
      The control group will receive the usual care. The patients in the experimental group will be
      screened in the side-rooms where normally the patients who either have infections or are at
      risk of infection, are nursed. The study intervention will include dimming the lights to 40
      lux and closing the doors of the side-room to decrease the noise level below 40 decibels (dB)
      between 11:00 p.m.-5:00 a.m.
