      results in intraoperative hemodynamic changes of the blood pressure - both Systolic Blood
      Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) reading.
      Differences would also be expected for Heart rate (HR), Airway pressure and the usage of
      Adrenaline, Noradrenaline and Dobutamine.

      Patients who had cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were screened and enrolled from
      4/7/2019 to 30/4/2020. Inclusion criteria for patients were normal preoperative hemoglobin
      level, normal preoperative platelet count, no known defect of the coagulation system, and
      patients with unimpaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/kg/min). The patients
      were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, patients with known defect of the
      coagulation system, renal impairment, previous vasectomy, allergy to fish or unable to give
      consent form.

      The study carried out as a parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation
      ratio. Patients were screened for eligibility in the wards before being invited to
      participate in the research. After the invitation, the study was explained to patients. Those
      who agreed to participate in the study were asked to sign the consent form.
