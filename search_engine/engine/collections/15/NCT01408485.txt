      receive ablation therapy for typical atrial flutter using the TherapyTM Cool FlexTM Irrigated
      Ablation System. Historical data from combined published (PMA P060019 Cool Path) and reported
      (IDE G090109 Cool Path Duo) Atrial Flutter studies will be used to determine performance
      goals for study endpoints.
