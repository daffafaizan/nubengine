      foam padding, Velcro tape and stretchable wide waistbands. The 3D printable materials can be
      very versatile in terms of properties and can be further finished with an epoxy resin or
      thermoplastics. Different compositions and structures of knitted fabrics will be used in
      different areas of the proposed bodysuits to provide a close fit, high breathability and
      effective pain management due to extra support. The fastening system includes a magnetic
      zipper and pulley system that can be adjusted by pulling on knobs. The pulley system contains
      a microadjustable dial, super-strong lightweight lacing, and low friction lacing guides.
