    
      -  Controlled pilot study to determine whether there exists, at a molecular level, a
           predisposition to the development of tracheomalacia and subglottic stenosis. Thirty
           patients will be divided into 2 groups of 20 patients (study patients) and 10 patients
           (control group). Both groups will undergo bronchoscopy and airway biopsy

        -  The study is a pilot study to evaluate alterations in the airway matrix, growth factor
           levels, and vascular structures.in patients with tracheobronchomalacia and subglottic
           stenosis

        -  Bronchoscopies will be performed in the West Procedure UnitPulmonary Special Procedures
           Unit or in the operating room (depending on the clinical indication and patient
           scheduling) at the BIDMC after informed consent is obtained.

        -  Patients will receive topical upper airway anesthesia with lidocaine and intravenous
           conscious sedation with fentanyl and midazolam as per standard of care

        -  Biopsies will be performed according to standard protocols.

        -  Biopsies will be performed: 2 samples will be sent for pathology as part of clinical
           care and 2-3 samples used for research analysis.
