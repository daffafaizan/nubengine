    
      Multi-center, prospective, single-arm study. The Study will take the form of a User
      Evaluation. The Evaluation will require the user to perform several standardized functions
      (e.g. peripheral lesion sampling, lymph node sampling). In addition, users will be asked
      about other potential techniques that fall within the intended use of the device.

      The evaluation will be conducted in patients who are indicated for procedures that fall
      within the intended use of the device. Examples of such patients include:

        -  Patients who have been recommended for bronchoscopy for the purpose of obtaining a
           biopsy sample of a central or peripheral pulmonary lesion.

        -  Patients who have been recommended for bronchoscopy for the purpose of diagnosing
           mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

        -  Patients who have been recommended for bronchoscopy for the purpose of lung fiducial
           placement.
