      function and reduces quality of life. Pain severity correlates with reduced measures of daily
      functioning, and overall health status.

      The sphenopalatine ganglion, located in the posterior part of the middle nasal turbinate, is
      involved in the pain associated to TN, by blocking the sphenopalatine ganglion relieves
      patients from the symptoms. However, methods currently in use to accomplish this are either
      cumbersome for the patient or invasive regarding the puncture of structures.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Tx360™, a new nasal applicator
      device, in the treatment of TN. The Tx360™ is a single use nasal applicator that can reach
      the sphenopalatine ganglion area. It is designed to dispense medications through a flexible
      canula.

      The patients with TN will receive a 0.5 mL spray of local anesthetic on the ganglion area,
      and measure the change in pain intensity and quality of life.

      We are expecting that this new device will provide at least the same pain relief as the
      previously described approaches. However, this nasal applicator is intended to be an easy and
      non invasive method for office use.
