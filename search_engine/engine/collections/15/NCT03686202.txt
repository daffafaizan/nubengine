      body. The gut is densely colonized by the microbiota which aids in the digestion. Animal and
      human observational and experimental evidence show a link between gut microbiota and the
      activation, regulation and function of the immune system. Pre-clinical studies in mouse
      models have linked the gut microbiota to efficacy of anticancer therapies. Microbial
      Ecosystem Therapeutics (MET) is a new treatment approach developed as an alternative to fecal
      transplantation. MET consists of a defined mixture of pure live cultures of intestinal
      bacteria isolated from a stool sample of a healthy donor.

      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and engraftment (cumulative
      relative abundance) of MET-4 strains when given in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors (ICIs).
