      (RSDN) as an adjunctive treatment for patients with either ischemic or non-ischemic
      cardiomyopathy undergoing catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The proposed
      study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized control trial. Patients undergoing VT
      ablation will be randomized to either VT ablation alone or VT ablation + RSDN.
