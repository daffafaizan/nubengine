      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving Lutetium 177 (177Lu)-PSMA outside of a
      clinical trial to assess "real world" anti-tumour utility. The primary objective is to assess
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate to 177Lu-PSMA in men with mCRPC.

      Patients with mCRPC who have have progression or intolerance on a novel anti-androgen
      targeted agent (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and/or apalutamide) will be eligible for the
      study.

      The investigators intend to evaluate the safety of 177Lu-PSMA, in addition to determining
      patient PSA progression-free survival (PFS), objective radiographic response rates and
      overall survival (OS). Health-related quality of life (QoL) and pain will also be observed.
      Additional objectives are to identify biomarkers and assess the relationship between PSMA and
      F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET/CT)
      parameters associated with clinical outcomes.
