      clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of early (< 96 h) intravenous paracetamol
      in prophylactic closure of ductus arteriosus in extremely premature (gestational age <28+0
      wk, ELGA) or low birth weight (<1000 g, ELBW) infants. The infants born extremely preterm or
      low birth weight are a focus of the study, since a small phase 2 study on paracetamol failed
      to demonstrate contraction of ductus arteriosus.

      In the investigator's previous cohort of ELGA/ELBW infants, the numbers of patients who
      needed any therapies for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were 29 (23%) in the paracetamol
      exposed group, and 90 (54%) in the control group. As demonstrated in a phase 2 study, the
      early paracetamol treatment induced the closure of ductus arteriosus: the mean (SD) ductal
      closure age was 177 (338) h in the whole paracetamol group. However, in the subgroup of ELGA
      infants born before 28 gestation weeks (n=14), the mean (SD) ductal closure ages in the
      paracetamol and placebo groups were 491 (504) h and 858 (719) h, respectively.
