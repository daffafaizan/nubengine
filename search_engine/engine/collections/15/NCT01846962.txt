    
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by significant eosinophilic infiltration of
      esophageal mucosa, leading to tissue damage and consequently to esophageal symptoms. The
      clinical presentation in childhood often mimics gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      sometimes in association to feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. Later in life, the
      most common symptoms are dysphagia and food impaction, due to esophageal dysmotility. The
      progression of a non-recognized, untreated disease, is thought to lead to chronic esophageal
      inflammation with fibrosis and stenosis. Diagnosis requires multiple esophageal biopsies (at
      least 4 in both proximal and distal esophagus, regardless of gross appearance of mucosa) to
      demonstrate a mucosal infiltrate of at least 15 eosinophils for high power field (HPF) in
      patients with a normal pH study or refractory to acid-suppression therapy. Although the
      endoscopic examination may be unremarkable, endoscopic features of EoE have been well
      characterized and include: linear furrowing, concentric rings (thachealization), white spots
      (eosinophilic abscesses), Schatzki ring, strictures, and linear superficial mucosal tears
      occurring after introduction of the endoscope.
