      these Canadians will aim to continue working over the next 10 years. However, the impact of
      arthritis on aging Canadians compromises their ability to continue working. By 2031, over 2
      million Canadians aged 45 to 64 years will have arthritis. We aim to boost the ability of
      older adults with the most common arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), to engage in the workforce
      for as long as they desire. Identifying strategies to promote productivity among older
      workers with knee and hip OA will be of great public health significance in the coming
      decades. However, we face two challenges. First, obesity among sedentary workers is a risk
      for worsening knee and hip OA. Second, large occupational loads on the knee and hip worsen
      OA. Exercise has the most promise in addressing these challenges because it reduces pain and
      sick time, and improves mental health. Thus, there is a call for studies examining exercise
      for the aging worker with knee and hip OA. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact
      of an OA-specific leg strengthening exercise program, delivered within the workplace, on
      mobility, pain, physical capacity, and resilience among older workers with knee or hip OA.
