      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the activation of PI3K/AKT and mTORC 1 in leukemic blasts.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of everolimus at different concentrations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive primary induction therapy comprising daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days
      1-3, cytarabine IV over 24 hours on day 1, and oral everolimus on days 1 and 7. Patients with
      more than 5% blasts on day 15 receive a second induction course comprising daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV on days 17 and 18 and cytarabine IV twice daily on days 17-20.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 3 months.
