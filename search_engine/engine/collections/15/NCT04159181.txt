      secretion of gastrointestinal peptides.

      We aim to determine the contribution of the colon to the fasting and postprandial release of
      gut peptides such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Young healthy men
      will be examined on three occasions at a clinical research Facility after an overnight fast.
      On one occasion the colon will also be emptied using a cathartic (picoprep). On two occasions
      an oral solution of lactulose will be administered to stimulate fermentation by colonic
      bacteria.
