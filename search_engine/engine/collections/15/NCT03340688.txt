      increased perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity. No therapy has proven effective in
      preventing preterm birth in twins. The transvaginal cervical length (TVCL) performed before
      24 weeks have been determined to be the best tool to identified women with twin pregnancy at
      risk of preterm birth (PTB). When short TVCL is identified before 24 weeks, the risk of
      preterm birth is 60%-70% for TVCL ≤25mm and 80%-90% for TVCL ≤15mm. There are a small number
      of case reports of cervical cerclage in twin pregnancies with cervical length ≤15mm that
      suggest decreased preterm birth by 80%. The investigators' objective is to determine if
      ultrasound indicated cerclage in reduces the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks
      and improve perinatal outcome in asymptomatic women with twin gestations and cervical length
      ≤15mm between 16 to 23 6/7 weeks of gestation.
