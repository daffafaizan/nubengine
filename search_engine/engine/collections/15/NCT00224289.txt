      efficacy profile. Its effect is mediated by an increase in uveoscleral outflow, due to
      enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix within the ciliary muscle. Since the amount
      of extracellular matrix within the human eye increases with age, and uveoscleral outflow
      decreases with age, it would be expected that there should be a difference in the efficacy of
      latanoprost in patients of different ages. This has not been demonstrated in studies
      assessing the overall effect of latanoprost across adult age groups using multivariate
      analysis. (Camras CB et al, 1996).

      However, a difference in timing of onset of drug effect may get overlooked in clinical
      studies and in clinical practice as well, as patients tend to be seen from two to eight weeks
      after initiation of treatment, by which time any differences in response time may have
      already occurred and leveled off.

      To our knowledge, there are no studies specifically looking at the timing of onset of drug
      effect of latanoprost in different age groups. Because of the theoretical plausibility of
      this effect based on the mechanism of action of latanoprost, this represents an opportunity
      to further elucidate the characteristics of this medication in a manner which has clinical
      and scientific relevance.

      Our aim is thus to determine if there is a difference in timing of onset of the ocular
      hypotensive effect of latanoprost in glaucoma patients of different age groups.
