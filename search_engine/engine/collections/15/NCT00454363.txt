      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) (complete and partial response) of GW786034
      (pazopanib hydrochloride) 800 mg administered orally once daily in patients with advanced low
      or intermediate grade carcinoid tumors (in carcinoid cohort).

      II. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) (complete response and partial response)
      of GW786034 800mg administered orally once daily in patients with advanced low or
      intermediate grade pancreatic islet cell carcinoma (in islet cell cohort).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) duration of GW786034 800mg administered
      orally once daily in patients with low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of GW786034 800mg administered orally once daily
      in patients with low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      III. To explore the effect on tumor blood flow as determined by functional computed
      tomography (CT) of GW786034 800 mg orally once daily in patients with low grade
      neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      IV. To assess the trough level of GW786034 800 mg orally once daily in patients with low
      grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 90 days for up to 18 months.
