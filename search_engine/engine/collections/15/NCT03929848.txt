      injury of tracheal mucosa, which is about 20-30 mmHg. However, higher cuff pressure that
      20-30 mmHg might be required to prevent gas leakage during general anesthesia for
      laryngomicrosurgery.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the required cuff pressure to prevent gas leakage from
      mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia for laryngomicrosurgery, and there will be
      no damage from the required cuff pressure because of short time of surgery.
