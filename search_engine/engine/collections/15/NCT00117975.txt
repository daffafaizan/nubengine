    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall and complete response rate in patients with previously untreated
           CD20-positive bulky stage II or stage III or IV follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
           treated with rituximab and galiximab.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate Fc receptor polymorphism profiling with response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy (month 1): Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and
           galiximab IV over 1 hour on day 3, 8, 15, and 22.

        -  Extended induction therapy (months 3, 5, 7, and 9): Beginning in month 3, patients
           receive rituximab and galiximab as above on day 1. Treatment repeats every 56 days for 4
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 months for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 51 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
