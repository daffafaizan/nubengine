      elderly with mild cognitive impairment. In this pilot study, the investigators studied
      whether a sensorimotor(SMR)/theta NF training could improve cognitive performance and brain
      electrical activity in a sample group of elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment.
      Twenty participants performed an electroencephalography recording, a battery of
      neuropsychological tests before the neurofeedback training program (T0), following the
      neurofeedback training program (T1) and 1-month follow-up (T2).
