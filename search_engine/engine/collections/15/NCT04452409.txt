      conditions where there is accumulation of excess fat in the liver of people who drink little
      or no alcohol. The most common form of NAFLD is a non serious condition called fatty liver.

      NAFLD is part of the metabolic syndrome characterized by diabetes, or pre-diabetes (insulin
      resistance), being overweight or obese, elevated blood lipids such as cholesterol and
      triglycerides, as well as high blood pressure. A few studies have suggested that weight loss
      may be associated with regression of fat within the liver. Therefore, the most important
      recommendations for people with fatty liver are to lose weight if they are overweight or
      obese, increase their physical activity, follow a balanced diet and unnecessary medications.

      Several studies have investigated low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or light-emitting diode
      (LED) therapy and have made advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms LLLT
      in biological systems. Few studies explain the effect of low level laser therapy on liver
      enzymes and non alcoholic fatty liver risk factors (as obesity).So, our goal was to perform a
      randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of the LLLT on lipid profile, body
      weight and liver enzymes
