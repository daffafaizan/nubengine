      experienced by a participant depend to some extent on their responses to earlier phases.
      Ultimately, this design yields a number of practice relevant pathways and endpoints, each of
      which has a testing rate associated with it.

      Phase-I is initial screening for risk status, collecting background data, and ascertaining
      whether there has been recent independent HIV testing. If there has been independent testing,
      information about the independent testing is collected and the participant's involvement is
      complete.

      Those who are not independent testers enter Phase-II. Phase II will include: randomization to
      opt-in vs. opt-out conditions; a survey asking about reasons for acceptance or
      non-acceptance; participating in a focus group in which participants who have not accepted
      HIV testing (non-accepters) and those who accepted (accepters) will be asked to discuss their
      health beliefs related to HIV prevention, barriers and reasons for testing/not testing; then
      (5) after the focus group is complete, privately offer another testing opportunity to
      non-accepters, under the same opt-in or opt-out strategy to which they previously were
      randomized. The design was selected in order simultaneously answer a number of questions that
      we believe will be important for engineering a testing and prevention strategy suitable for
      testing in a subsequent study: (1) identify key attitudes, beliefs and knowledge (survey);
      (2) contrast opt-in and opt-out strategies (randomized trial); (3) generate qualitative data
      about reasons for decisions in the women's own words (focus group); and (4) identify any
      incremental benefit related to peer discussion.
