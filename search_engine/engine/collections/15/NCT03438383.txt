      related complications of MOP undergoing OBS through a randomized sham-controlled design was
      investigated. Bi-PAP was applied at individualized pressures in order to optimize respiratory
      support and sham Bi-PAP was also used in order to neutralize possible placebo device related
      effect and researcher related bias.

      The investigators hypothesized that the use of Bi-PAP at individualized pressures in MOP
      undergoing OBS, ameliorates postoperative respiratory function as well as diminishes related
      pulmonary complications, postoperative pain and duration of hospitalization. Primary
      endpoints were the difference in pre- and postoperative measurements of certain pulmonary
      function parameters (forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity
      (FVC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and
      the incidence of certain pulmonary complications postoperatively (hypoxemia, atelectasis,
      lower respiratory tract infections). Secondary endpoints were postoperative pain and days of
      hospitalization.
