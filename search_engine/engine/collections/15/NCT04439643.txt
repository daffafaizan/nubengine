      morphology and composition assessment of CTA which has been validated by histology, applied
      to representative cohort of patients. Generalizability of models is enhanced by using
      validated rather than only raw image inputs. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data is
      collected for enrolled patients as well as last known well dates.
