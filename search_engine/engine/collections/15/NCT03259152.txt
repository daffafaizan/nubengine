      defined by Cooper and Travers, can produce pulmonary metastasis, albeit rarely (1-6%). GCTb
      constitutes 5% of primary bone tumors and 20% of benign bone tumors. Histologically, the
      tumour consists of a proliferation of mononuclear cells, accompanied by a population of
      non-neoplastic osteoclast-like giant cells and mononuclear osteoclast precursors. Currently,
      it is thought that proliferating neoplastic cells produce a number of cytokines and
      mediators, including the receptor activator of nuclear factor Îº-B-ligand (RANK-RANKL) system,
      that recruit osteoclast precursors and induce their maturation into multinucleated
      osteoclast. The standard management of GCTb is based on surgery with several local adjuvant
      treatments like methacrylate cement, phenol or cryotherapy to reduce the risk of recurrence,
      while bisphosphonates are used in some cases to decrease bone resorption and for pain relief
      in inoperable tumours or metastatic disease. In the last 5 years the use of denosumab, a
      fully human monoclonal antibody already licensed for postmenopausal osteoporosis and
      prevention of skeletal related events in bone metastases from solid tumours, has been
      introduced in the treatment strategy of GCTb. In this study we examined the clinical,
      radiological, histological and underlying mechanism features of a series of GCTb, before and
      after denosumab administration, comparing baseline and resection specimens. Moreover, we
      examined the safety of the drug and on the angiogenesis through the determination of
      microvascular density (MVD).
