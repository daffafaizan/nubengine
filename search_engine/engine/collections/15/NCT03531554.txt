      deficient (VLCADD) patients. Failing muscle ATP homeostasis, due to impaired fatty acid
      oxidation, is the most likely cause. Therefore, supplementation with an alternative energy
      substrate to boost ATP homeostasis, such as an exogenous ketone ester (KE) drink, could be a
      therapeutic option. Previous results suggest that KE is preferentially oxidized in the
      tricyclic acid (TCA) cycle and improves physical endurance in athletes. Our primary objective
      is to test if KE boosts muscular ATP homeostasis in VLCADD patients to establish a rational
      basis for therapeutic use.

      VLCADD patients will be included in a randomized, blinded, placebo controlled, 2-way
      cross-over trial. Prior to each test, patients receive a KE drink or an isocaloric
      carbohydrate equivalent, and completed a 35 min cycling test on an upright bicycle, followed
      by 10 minutes of supine cycling inside a MR scanner. The protocol will be repeated after at
      least one week with the opposite drink.
