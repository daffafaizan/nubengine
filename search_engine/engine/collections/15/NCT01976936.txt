      stroke. The time window for enrollment will be within 0-24 hours of symptom onset. For
      patients who are found with the stroke on awakening, it will be assumed that the stroke
      occurred the last time that the patient was known to be normal. All patients will be
      identified by the stroke acute care team in the emergency room of the participating centers,
      or in some cases, on the floor services of the hospital (i.e., for patients with stroke
      occurring in hospital). If preliminary data indicate that the patient meets eligibility
      criteria the patient (or legally authorized representative) will be approached about
      participation in the study, and consent obtained. Surrogate consent will be allowed at
      centers at which this is permitted according to regulations. Patients who are consented
      through a surrogate and subsequently regain capacity, will be approached and reconsented to
      continue in the study.

      The intervention chosen for this trial is either (1) placebo for patients not taking a statin
      at the time of admission OR lovastatin 80 mg in place of their regular statin for patients
      taking a statin (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin,
      lovastatin) at time of enrolment VERSUS (2) oral lovastatin at dosage of 640 mg daily for 3
      days. The time of first dose will be considered time 0. Patients will be administered the
      total daily dose in four daily divided doses (i.e., QID schedule). After the initial 3 days
      of acute dosage, all patients will receive statin therapy at the discretion of their treating
      physician.
