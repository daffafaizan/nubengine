      automated/electronic NPC capability (eNPC). This protocol is for Phase 2, in which the CI
      multimodal brain function biomarker will be extended (Algorithm Development) with the
      inclusion of an automated ocular function measurement (AOFM), to expand the capability in the
      characterization of concussion. The study will also expand the range of applicability of the
      CI to ages 13-50 years old. Phase 2 will also include norming of eNPC across the age range.
      Phase 3 of the project will validate the algorithms developed in Phase 2, using the same
      protocol.
