    
      This is a randomized, 2-arm, Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study to compare the safety and
      efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan versus the physician's choice (2:1) in HER2-low,
      unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer participants.

      The Sponsor proposes to define a new HER2-low population in this trial including tumors with
      IHC 1+ and IHC 2+/ISH- HER2 expression.
