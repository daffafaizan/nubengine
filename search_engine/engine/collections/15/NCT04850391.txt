      pattern and obesity, or gut microbiota and obesity, but not the cross-talk of all these
      factors in the same individual or population. Therefore, we need a multifactorial approach to
      get a more deep insight on the obesity and weight regulation. Further, novel cost-effective
      tools to advance lifestyle changes are needed. Emerging evidence suggests that novel
      countermeasures, such as modulation of the timing of food intake, may be effective strategies
      in weight control and prevention of obesity. The goals of the proposed study are 1) to
      provide scientific basis for the relationship between subjective sleep quality, diurnal
      eating pattern, gut microbiome, and obesity, 2) to develop and test a pragmatic,
      cost-effective new tool to advance lifestyle changes using E-health approach, and 3) to
      compare differences in subjective sleep quality, diurnal eating pattern and gut microbiome at
      baseline 4) to compare changes induced by the E-health intervention among the three study
      groups and participants with different work schedules.
