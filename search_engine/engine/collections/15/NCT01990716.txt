      understanding the relative importance of the lipid compounds, especially 5,6-EET, in
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

      Using mass spectrometry, 5,6-EET and other 33 lipid metabolites will be quantified in situ in
      colonic biopsies from IBD patients and from control patients. We will compare quantities of
      5,6-EET in inflammatory and non-inflammatory zones of biopsies from IBD patient to biopsies
      from control patient. We will establish a cluster of lipid compounds associated with
      pathological activity. We will determine the exposed profile of receptor lipid mediators
      expressing to the 5,6-EET lipid compound and one of its signalization.

      All data will be submit to statistical analysis to confirm relevance.

      We expect this pilot study to help us define 5,6-EET and other components of the same
      metabolic family as markers for IBD activity. It could point lipid mediators and their
      receptors as potential new therapeutic targets.

      It will increase our knowledge on current treatment efficiency by evidencing lipid markers
      for the inflammatory condition.
