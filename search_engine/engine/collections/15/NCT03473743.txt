    
      This open-label (all people know identity of intervention) and multicenter (when more than
      one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to establish the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for erdafitinib and cetrelimab and/or platinum (cisplatin or
      carboplatin) chemotherapy, and the safety of erdafitinib in combination with cetrelimab and
      platinum chemotherapy in Phase 1b and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RP2D of
      erdafitinib plus cetrelimab versus erdafitinib in Phase 2 in participants with advanced
      urothelial cancer with select fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene alterations.
      Participants enrolled in Phase 1b erdafitinib + cetrelimab cohort may have received any
      number of lines of prior therapy, and participants enrolled in Phase 1b erdafitinib +
      cetrelimab + platinum chemotherapy cohort will have had no prior systemic therapy for
      metastatic disease and participants enrolled in Phase 2 will have had no prior systemic
      therapy for metastatic disease and will be cis-ineligible. Part 1 (Phase 1b: Dose Escalation)
      will identify safety and RP2Ds of erdafitinib + cetrelimab and erdafitinib + cetrelimab +
      platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy, and Part 2 (Phase 2: Dose Expansion) in
      which the erdafitinib monotherapy and the RP2D regimen of the erdafitinib + cetrelimab
      combination are evaluated to further characterize safety and clinical activity. The study
      will be conducted in 3 phases: screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Study
      evaluations include efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, biomarkers,
      and safety.
