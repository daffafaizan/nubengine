      in the second decade of life. The prevalence increases rapidly with increasing age. As
      life-expectancy increases in CF, CF-related diabetes will be diagnosed more frequently in the
      future. Negative consequences of secondary diabetes in cystic fibrosis include:

        -  Catabolic metabolism

        -  Weight loss

        -  More frequent / more severe infections

        -  Deterioration of pulmonary function

        -  Reduced life-expectancy

        -  Diabetic micro vascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)

      Up to date, no data are available to answer the question, whether secondary diabetes in CF
      should always be treated by insulin therapy. Several centres report the successful management
      of CF-related diabetes using oral anti-diabetic drugs at least for some years. Oral therapies
      would be less invasive for a patient group which is highly traumatised by a very demanding
      therapy (multiple drugs including antibiotics, pancreas enzymes, bronchodilators, mucolysis,
      in addition to physiotherapy, regular inpatient iv-antibiotic therapy etc, finally lung
      transplants in a subgroup of patients).
