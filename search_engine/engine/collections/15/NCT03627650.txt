      fat grafting on scar formation in early skin-grafted deep burn wounds.

      Methods: Included patients received split-thickness skin grafting procedures for deep burn
      wounds less than 3 months ago. A homogenous scar area in each patient was divided into two
      equal parts. One part was treated with transcutaneous sharp needle autologous fat grafting,
      the adjacent part with transcutaneous saline injection as control. Results were evaluated by
      clinical assessment with scar scale questionnaires, histological examination, and objective
      scar assessment with Cutometer, Mexameter, Tewameter and Corneometer.
