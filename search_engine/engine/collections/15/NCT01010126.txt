      I. To determine the response rate and progression-free survival at 6 months in patients with
      endometrial, ovarian, hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoid or islet cell cancer.

      II. To determine the toxicity of the combination of temsirolimus and bevacizumab in patients
      with endometrial, ovarian, hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoid or islet cell cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect blood and tumor specimens from all patients entered on the trial for possible
      future analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
