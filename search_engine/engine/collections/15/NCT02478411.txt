      critically ill subjects. However, there are few studies comparing cycloergometric
      physiotherapy and conventional physiotherapy in intensive care subjects under mechanical
      ventilation. The most relevant of these studies conducted by Burtin et al showed beneficial
      effects of cycloergometric treatment. However, the duration of the physiotherapy sessions in
      this study differed between groups as cycloergometric group received a double daily dose of
      treatment. It is known that the intensity of physiotherapy also affects the functional and
      motor status.

      For this reason, the investigators designed a randomized controlled study with early
      cycloergometric or conventional treatment, with the same intensity between groups to analyze
      objective functional and motor endpoints.
