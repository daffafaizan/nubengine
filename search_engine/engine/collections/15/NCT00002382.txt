    
      Patients who no longer benefit from existing antiretroviral therapy and who are not currently
      enrolled in ongoing saquinavir trials are eligible for this compassionate treatment program.

      Patients may be registered with the program through their physicians, who will be responsible
      for supervising the administration of treatment; following guidelines for saquinavir dose
      interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation; and assessing patient progress throughout
      the duration of the study. Access to saquinavir will be determined by a lottery system; 60
      percent of the program slots will be reserved for patients with CD4 counts of 50 or less and
      the remaining 40 percent of the slots will be devoted to patients with CD4 counts between 51
      and 300.
