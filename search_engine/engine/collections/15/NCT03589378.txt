      condition due to coagulant disorder immunoparalysis to infection. For this reason the
      extracorporeal therapies for the treatment of septic shock with MODS have become widespread
      in the ICU and, at the same time, new extracorporeal depurative techniques have been
      developed for the removal of inflammatory mediators. One of these techniques is therapeutic
      plasma exchange (TPE) that remove pathologically elevated cytokines and simultaneously to
      replace protective plasmatic factors. other techniques is coupled plasma-filtration
      adsorption (CPFA) that uses a sorbent once the separation between plasma and blood has been
      obtained with a plasma filter. The others is Plasma dialysis filtration(PDF) that can remove
      inflammatory mediators for patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PEAF (coupled therapeutic plasma exchange
      adsorption diafiltration )for treating septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
      patients in ICU.
