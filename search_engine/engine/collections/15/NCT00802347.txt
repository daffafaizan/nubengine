      pathophysiology appears to be primarily related to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury resulting
      from organ preservation between the times of harvesting from the donor and reperfusion
      following vascular reanastomosis in the recipient.

      I5NP is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that is being developed for the prophylaxis of
      delayed graft function (DGF) in patients receiving renal transplants.
