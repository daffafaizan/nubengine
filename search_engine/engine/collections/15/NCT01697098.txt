      preterm delivery plays an important role for obstetrics and neonatal care. Many studies have
      shown that maternal administration of glucocorticoids has a significant beneficial effect in
      decreasing the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in infants delivered at 28-34
      weeks of gestation.
