      subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD. One group will receive 0.5 mg.
      ranibizumab intraocularly initially. This will be repeated monthly for 3 months total and
      then as needed over the period of one year. The other group will receive Reduced Fluence-PDT
      (25 Joules) followed by 0.5 mg. of ranibizumab intraocularly on the same day. The second
      group will receive the combination of ranibizumab and RF-PDT as needed over a period of one
      year. Re-treatment will be determined by the individual investigator based on visual acuity,
      retinal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein
      angiography. Visual acuity and OCT measurements will be performed by masked examiners.
