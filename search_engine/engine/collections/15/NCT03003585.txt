    
      Material and Method: Total of 54 American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade 1-2, Mallampati
      score 1 or 2, age between 18 to 65 patient planned to undergo nonopthalmic surgery will be
      included to study. Patients with glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and pulmonary
      diseases, American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade III and IV, body mass index more than
      35, difficult intubation, undergo obstetrical surgery and propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium
      contraindicated will be excluded from the study. Patients will be divided randomly into 2
      groups as direct laryngoscopic and fiberoptic intubation group. Patients will be
      preoxygenated with %100 O2 for 3 minutes then anesthesia will be induced using propofol 2 mg
      / kg, fentanyl 1 mcg/kg, and rocuronium 0,5 mg / kg in both groups. After 3 minutes mask
      ventilation, patients will be intubated (women with No:7-7,5, men with No:8-8,5 intubation
      tube). Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, peripheral
      oxygen saturation,perfusion index will be recorded and intraocular pressure measured by
      ophthalmologist by tonopen device will be recorded pre-induction (basal), after induction,
      1,2,3,5 minutes after intubation, respectively. Period between handling of laryngoscope or
      fiberoptic device after termination of mask ventilation and obtain end tidal CO2 will be
      accepted as application time and recorded. Study will be terminated after 5th minute values
      taken.
