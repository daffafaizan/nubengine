      To compare the completeness of history taking by physicians and by a computerized system
      interacting directly with the patients. Historical data recorded in the patient record,
      including the discharge letter, were compared with the history acquired by computer-based
      interview of each patient.

      Patients:

      100 inpatients presenting at the RBK for the first time and treated in the departments of
      nephrology and cardiology.

      Methods:

      The information obtained by the computer based system is compared with the information
      acquired by conventional history taking. Study endpoint is the comparison of historical data
      organized according to the elements in a standard medical history on a patient-by-patient
      basis.

      Study procedure After informed consent of the patients the procedure of history taking is
      performed by the physician according to the guidelines of the RBK. Within 2 days thereafter
      the patient is interviewed with help of the CLEOS system [a computer-based, history-taking
      program] with the support of a study nurse. The physician will be informed about the results
      immediately after completion of the questionnaire.

      Data of medical significance were extracted from the official hospital chart and the
      computerized history by clinically experienced physicians and tabulated on a
      patient-by-patient basis. data elements were compared across each category of the history for
      each patient interviewed. The relevance of the differences of the information obtained by the
      two systems was rated by an independent reviewer.
