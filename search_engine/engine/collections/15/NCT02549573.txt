      currently using APOKYN. Those subjects who satisfy all eligibility criteria will be
      randomized to 2 treatment groups:

        1. "APO+" (APOKYN treatment before the PT Intervention Visit) and;

        2. "APO-" (APOKYN treatment withheld before the PT Intervention Visit).

      The study will have:

        -  Baseline Assessment Visit(s) - 1 day at Investigator's clinic and PT clinic

        -  APOKYN Response Verification Visit - 1 day

        -  PT Intervention Visits - for 6 weeks

        -  End-of-study Assessment Visit(s) - 1 day at Investigator's clinic and PT clinic All
           subjects will participate in a standardized PT intervention. In both treatment groups,
           ALL subjects will arrive for the PT Intervention Visit in an "end-of-dose-off" motor
           state. The "end-of-dose-off" motor state will be achieved by the subject withholding
           his/her carbidopa/levodopa dose and APOKYN dose for at least 3 hours before the PT
           Intervention Visit. It is hypothesized that the outcome of PT will be improved when
           subjects are in the "on" motor state during PT Intervention visits compared with being
           in the "end-of-dose-off" motor state during PT Intervention visits.
