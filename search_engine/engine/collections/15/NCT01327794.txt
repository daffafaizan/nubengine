      Primary Objective

        -  To measure baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in a cohort of patients
           with advanced pancreatic cancer enrolled in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)
           study 80303 and evaluate the association between vitamin D status and overall survival
           (OS) or progression free survival (PFS).

      Secondary Objective

        -  To evaluate the association between common germ-line single nucleotide polymorphisms
           (SNPs) in the vitamin D pathway genes and 25(OH)D levels in patients with advanced
           pancreatic cancer.

        -  To evaluate the interaction between serum 25(OH)D levels and germ-line SNPs in the
           vitamin D pathway genes in predicting OS in advanced pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived serum samples are analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels by competitive
      chemiluminescence immunoassay. Results are then compared with the germ-line single nucleotide
      polymorphisms from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and patients' clinical data.
