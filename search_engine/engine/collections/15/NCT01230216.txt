      coronary artery disease. The goal of blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease
      is recommended to control below 140/90mmHg. However, the effect of intensive blood pressure
      control compared to standard blood pressure control is still unknown. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control compared to standard
      blood pressure control on progression of coronary atherosclerosis by intravascular ultrasound
      in hypertensive patients with coronary atherosclerosis after 18 months. The goal of systolic
      blood pressure is under 120mmHg in intensive blood pressure control group and under 140mmHg
      in standard blood pressure control group. The design of this study is randomized control
      study.
