      high-intensity and resistance exercise performance. Until now the major limitation to NaHCO3
      supplementation has been the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Therefore, this study aims
      to examine the effect of chronic, progressive- dose NaHCO3 ingestion on physical capacity,
      body composition and concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained
      athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.
