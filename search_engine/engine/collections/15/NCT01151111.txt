      participate in this study aimed to examine a possible beneficial effect of relaxation guided
      imagery on motor fluctuations. The study will include a baseline period two sessions of
      relaxation and a follow-up period. The relaxation sessions will be conducted individually. In
      one session patients will hear relaxing music and in the second they will undergo relaxation
      guided imagery. After each relaxation session patients will receive a CD with either relaxing
      music or RGI to listen to at home. They will be asked to fill out a diary at baseline and
      after each session. Before and after each relaxation session patients will be examined
      according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the examination will be
      videotaped. All patients will continue to receive the usual care from their medical
      providers. The main measure is change in UPDRS and secondary measure is change in daily OFF
      time.
