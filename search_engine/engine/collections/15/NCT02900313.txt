      admitted in our center after cardiac surgery. AKI is define according to KDIGO criteria and
      classified in the groups of severity according to the Cr elevation and the need of renal
      replacement therapy. Serum Cr and Ph are measured at baseline before surgery , at ICU
      admission, every 12 hours until ICU discharge and every 24 hours until hospital discharge. To
      evaluate the predictability of Of Ph to diagnose AKI, the postoperative Ph percentage of
      maximal elevation (%EPh) will be calculated. Then the diagnostic performance of %EPh wil be
      assessed by calculating the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to
      determine an optimal threshold with sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and
      negative predictive value.
