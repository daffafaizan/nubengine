      an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This headache may last years, severely affecting
      quality of life. Laboratory evidence suggests that the persistent headache may be a result of
      a maladaptive neuroinflammatory response to the hemorrhage injury that is more vigorous than
      necessary. The goal of this study is to measure key immunomodulators in the blood and the
      cerebrospinal fluid of these patients in order to determine the magnitude and dynamics of
      their neuroinflammatory response. In addition, the investigators will collect and analyze
      observational data about the success of medications to treat headache, with a specific focus
      on the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone, in managing acute headache pain and preventing
      the development of persistent headaches in patients after SAH.
