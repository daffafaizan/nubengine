      on two posterior teeth with proximal caries, in a split mouth design. 25 patients will be
      included in the study. The teeth will be randomized into two groups according to the
      application mode of universal adhesive material.

      Group 1: the universal adhesive will be used in etch-and-rinse mode Group 2: the universal
      adhesive will be used in self-etch mode. The US Public Health Service criteria (secondary
      caries, anatomical form, surface roughness, marginal integrity, marginal discoloration and
      retention) will be used for clinical evaluation of atraumatic resin restorations. The
      restorations will be evaluated at baseline and 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th months. Intra-oral
      photos will be taken directly after treatment and at control appointments to evaluate
      discoloration and seconder caries under magnification.

      The data will be analysed statistically using Fisher's Exact Test; and the Kaplan-Meier and
      Wilcoxon method will be used to estimate survival percentages.
