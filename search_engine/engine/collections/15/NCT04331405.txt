      Randomization was performed using envelope method (50 envelopes including Cell Therapy and
      Standard Therapy, 25 of each).

      20 patients with severe scute contusion spinal cord injury (cervical, thoracic and lumbar
      cone segments) were included into the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: pilot group
      (n = 10) obtaining standard conservative therapy and 4 i.v. infusions of Human Allogeneic
      Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (hUCBMCs) (~ 300 M in 100 mL) and control group (n =
      10) obtaining standard conservative therapy only. Cell Therapy was initiated in patients
      within 3 days after SCI episode after primary surgical decompression and/or stabilization was
      performed. Patients inclusion decision depended on meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      and informed consent signed.

      hUCBMC samples were prepared in the specialized laboratory and transported to the hospital
      immediately within 2 hours. Cells infusions were performed following 3 tests for biological
      compatibility and potential intolerance for each patient.

      All four infusion were performed during in-hospital treatment. Observational period reached 1
      year after SCI. All included patients were examined daily during in-hospital treatment
      following 4 times within observational period (1 year).

      All adverse events and potential complications were analyzed within 1 year after SCI using
      CTCAE v5.0 classification.

      Outcome parameters were analyzed at the end of observation and examined using standard
      statistical instruments.
