      are cancer survivors who underwent oropharyngeal/laryngeal surgery and must rely on AAC
      systems such as text-to-speech applications or artificial voice prostheses as substitutes for
      their natural voice. Yet most of these devices struggle to convey the expressive attributes
      of speech (prosody), leading to poor comprehension and a lack of emotional content. The
      clinical trial will investigate the feasibility of MyoVoice-a novel AAC device that uses
      surface EMG signals to extract patterns for understanding vocabulary and expressive
      attributes from articulatory musculature during silently mouthed speech-to effectively
      restore conversational capabilities for individuals living with vocal impairments due to
      surgical treatment of laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers. Patients who underwent a total
      laryngectomy will be asked to communicate with a conversational partner by silently mouthing
      words using MyoVoice. The device performance will be evaluated in terms of its ability to
      accurately and quickly translate articulatory muscle activity into audible speech. MyoVoice
      will also be compared to that of conventional electrolaryngeal speech aids (i.e., artificial
      larynx) to evaluate device ease-of-use, functional efficacy, and social reception.
