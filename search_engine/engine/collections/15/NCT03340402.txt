    
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which means this is the first time investigators are
      examining this study intervention in participants with triple negative breast cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved proton radiation for your
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The investigators believe that proton radiation administered in higher doses over a shorter
      time period may help stop cancer from growing while protecting the normal tissue cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are researching how well proton radiation works in
      treating this type of breast cancer. Proton radiation is currently used in other types of
      breast cancer and the investigators believe that the higher doses of proton radiation
      administered over a shorter time period may lead to maximum efficacy in treating this type of
      breast cancer.
