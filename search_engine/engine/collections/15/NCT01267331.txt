      surgical myocardial revascularization procedures, but still remain symptomatic despite
      optimal medical therapy. Cell therapy with autologous bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) is a
      novel therapeutic strategy being tested for surgical treatment in patients with severe,
      chronic ischemic heart disease.

      This research study is being performed to find out more information about the safety,
      feasibility, and efficacy of direct intramyocardial injection of autologous BMC on the
      myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function as an adjunctive therapy (compared to
      placebo) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). The heart function
      evaluations will be performed by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cMRI at baseline and
      during 6 months follow-up.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the effect of intramyocardial injection of
      autologous BMC on functional class (angina/heart failure), global and cardiovascular
      mortality, and major adverse cardiac events after undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.
