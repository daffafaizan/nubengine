      viable testicular sperm from men with NOA, but no RCT are available in the field. This
      randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial sought to evaluate whether the testicular sperm
      retrieval rate could result higher in NOA patients treated with follicle-stimulating hormone
      compared to placebo-treated NOA subjects.
