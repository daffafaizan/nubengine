      traumatic brain injury, are one of leading causes of chronic disability world widely and it
      is expected to substantially increase over the next two decades. Among various sequalae,
      dysphagia can be observed in about 40% -60% of post-stroke patients and 20% -30% of them
      might suffer from recurrent aspiration pneumonia and may inhibit recovery and can even lead
      to death. Recovery after brain lesions can be explained by specific molecular events. It is
      proven that Genetic polymorphisms associated with impaired neural repair or plasticity might
      reduce recovery from stroke. Not only for the motor recovery, but genetic polymorphism is
      also crucial for the recovery of swallowing after stroke, however, only limited amount of
      studies are available. Therefore, it is urgent to determine whether the recovery of
      swallowing disorders after stroke is affected by the inherent polymorphism of the patient,
      whether the degree of recovery and brain plasticity associated with swallowing depend on the
      gene characteristics and polymorphism of the patient and whether recovery in swallowing
      parallel to the recovery observed in other functional areas (ie. hand recovery, truncal
      control recovery, ADL recovery).

      Based on the results of this study, results will be expected to help provide genetically
      tailored diagnosis and prognostication according to the gene polymorphism of the patient.
      Optimized treatment of the patient is expected to contribute to prevention of respiratory
      complications and improve functional outcome related to swallowing after stroke.
