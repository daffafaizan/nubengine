      pregnancy. This is a particularly stressful situation for the expecting parents, since their
      need for a final diagnosis is frustrated for a potentially extended period on time which may
      span over several weeks. The emotional impact of this complication can be devastating,
      resulting frequently in depression and anxiety which may last for several months.

      In an attempt to allow for an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of first trimester
      miscarriage, multiple circulating placental biomarkers have been tested over last years.
      However, their potential usefulness in an everyday clinical setting remains unclear.

      The investigators propose a single-center observational prospective cohort study in an in
      vitro fertilization (IVF) setting. All recruited consenting patients will collect blood
      samples on a day of the first pregnancy test (12-14 days after embryo transfer) and at the
      time of the first (at 5 weeks plus 4-5 days of gestational age) and second (at 7 weeks plus
      4-5 days of gestational age) ultrasound scan to determine the circulating placental
      biomarkers concentrations in order to predict the pregnancy outcome (spontaneous miscarriage
      versus evolutive pregnancy) until the first obstetrical ultrasound, performed between 11
      weeks and 13 weeks plus 6 days of gestational age.
