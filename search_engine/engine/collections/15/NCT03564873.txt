      using omacetaxine and azacitidine. Phase I features dose escalation, where patients will be
      assigned to one of three cohorts to receive different doses of omacetaxine with the standard
      dose and schedule of azacitidine, over a 28 day cycle. Phase II features the maximum
      tolerated dose from the Phase 1 study.
