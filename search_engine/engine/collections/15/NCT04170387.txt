      functional problems of upper limbs. It works by moving passively the patient's fingers in a
      gradual way (with different speeds) in all directions of space, which is innovative compared
      to similar machines already on the market.

      The device consists of an electrical supply unit and two handling units made of 10 silicone
      tips of different sizes for the placement of fingers and it works with a six-minute pre-set
      program. It has obtained patent and certification mark and it has been used in the
      rehabilitation of patients with joint stiffness induced by specific working activities, as
      musicians.

      After the treatment these patients reported a remarkable improvement of motor skills and
      articulation of fingers, in addition to a parallel improvement of cognitive abilities such as
      concentration, visual acuity and mnemonic learning.

      In sight of this, the aim of the study is to establish whether the application of this
      treatment in a small group patients affected by fibromyalgia and cognitive impairment is able
      to improve some aspects of the cognitive dysfunction measured with appropriate functional
      tests and comparing the results with a control group of patients not affected by this
      condition.
