      groups. It delivers a high radiation localised to the prostate gland. The effects of this on
      fertility have not been systematically studied. An increasing number of younger men for whom
      fertility is an issue are being diagnosed with prostate cancer and may be offered
      brachytherapy amongst their treatment choices. This study therefore addresses this issue with
      a systematic evaluation of sperm count and quality before and after both high dose rate and
      low dose rate brachytherapy.
