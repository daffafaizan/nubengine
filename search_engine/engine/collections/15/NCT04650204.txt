      I. Demonstrate the efficacy and safety of perampanel (PER) on seizure frequency in adult
      patients with biopsy-proven high-grade glioma and focal epilepsy compared with alternate
      anti-seizure drugs (ASDs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the change in neurocognitive function and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      progression over the course of PER treatment with a daily dose of 4 mg (up to -8mg) in
      patients with biopsy-proven high-grade glioma and focal epilepsy compared with alternate
      ASDs.

      II. To identify a biomarker-specific response to seizure-reduction in patients treated with
      PER in patients with a biopsy-proven high-grade glioma (i.e., IDH-mutant versus [vs]
      wildtype).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive perampanel orally (PO) once daily (QD) 40 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B: Patients receive ASD per standard of care for 40 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
