    
      Tracheostomy Care of Patients:

      The tracheostomy care of all patients included in the study will be the same as any other
      tracheostomy patient in the hospital, as directed by the tracheostomy care nursing policy.
      Before study procedure, inner cannula is to be checked to ensure it is not clogged with
      secretion, any secretion is to be removed with suction.

      Decontamination methods:

      Patients may fall under group A or group B as determined by the random allocation.

      Patients in decontamination group A: Detergent

      Pre Decontamination:

        -  The inner cannula care will be removed using aseptic precautions.

        -  10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface in an uniform manner over
           30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure that the entire inner
           surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.

        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of
           colony counts.

        -  Small proportion of pre decontamination samples will be randomly selected for typing and
           naming of organisms.

      Decontamination:

        -  Inner cannula will be cleaned with commercially available tracheostomy cleaning fluid /
           powder (Ex: Trachoe - Kapitex healthcare, UK).

        -  The cleaning is done as per manufacturers recommendation.

      Post Decontamination:

        -  Using aseptic technique, 10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface
           in an uniform manner over 30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure
           that the entire inner surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.

        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of
           colony counts.

      Patients in decontamination group B: Water

      Pre Decontamination:

        -  The inner cannula care will be removed using aseptic precautions.

        -  10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface in an uniform manner over
           30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure that the entire inner
           surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.

        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of
           colony counts.

        -  Small proportion of pre decontamination samples will be randomly selected for typing and
           naming of organisms.

      Decontamination:

      â€¢ Inner cannula is cleaned as per the current tracheostomy care guidelines as directed by the
      Nursing Policy for Tracheostomy Care, Changi General Hospital. Only Sterile water is
      recommended as per the policy.

      Post Decontamination:

        -  Using aseptic technique, 10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface
           in an uniform manner over 30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure
           that the entire inner surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.

        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of
           colony counts.

      Crossover of Patients:

      To avoid the influence of confounding covariates, we propose to have a cross over study. The
      cross over patient will act as his own control. The selected patients will be randomly
      allocated to sequence AB or BA in 1:1 fashion using permuted blocks with different block
      sizes. The subjects and lab operators will be blinded to the block size and randomization.

      The change of sequence A > B and B > A will take place only after minimum of 24 hours after
      the first part of sequence has been completed. Exclusion criteria will still be applicable
      after completion of one part of the sequence. Small proportion of pre decontamination samples
      will be randomly selected for typing and naming of organisms.

      Lab Method for Colony Counts:

      From the flush solution, 100 microlitres and further sequential serial dilutions of 1:10 (in
      saline) are cultured directly onto blood agar plates. After 72 hours aerobic incubation at
      35oC, all plates are examined and growth from plates with 10 to 100 colonies per plate are
      counted. Total bacterial growth will be expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml.

      Small proportion of pre decontamination samples will be randomly selected for typing and
      naming of organisms.
