      sarcomas, no guidelines nor randomized prospective clinical trials on this topic exist. Thus
      the management of RIS and PIR is challenging. The only curable modality in non-metastatic
      RIS/PIRS is radical resection with wide negative margins. The role of secondary radiotherapy
      in locally advanced RIS/PIRS is unclear, mostly due to the concerns about possible severe
      side effects after re-irradiation.

      The addition of deep hyperthermia to irradiation and in the prolonged gap between the end of
      moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (with or without integrated boost) and surgery may
      allow obtaining the long-term local control with the maintenance of a good treatment
      tolerance Hyperthermia is a method of increasing the temperature in the tumor to damage
      cancer cells with minimum injury to the normal cells. It should be combined with another
      treatment modality (radio- or chemotherapy) rather than used alone. Its efficacy was proven
      in clinical trials. Treatment tolerance is usually very good.
