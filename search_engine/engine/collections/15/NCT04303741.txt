    
      This a phase II, open-labeled, multi-centered, single-arm, investigator-initiated clinical
      trial to assess the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combination with apatinib and
      eribulin in female patients age of 18 to 70 with advanced TNBC, and previously treated with
      at least one line of systemic therapy in the advanced setting. Prior therapy
      (adjuvant/neoadjuvant/advanced) must have included an anthracycline and a taxane. The number
      of patients to be included is 18-46 patients (Simons two stage design). The primary objective
      is to assess the overall response rate (ORR). All enrolled patients will be treated with
      camrelizumab 200mg (iv. 3mg/kg for patient whose weight is below 50kg) on day 1 of each
      21-day cycle, and apatinib 250mg daily (po, d1-d21), in combination with eribulin mesylate at
      1.4 mg/m2 (iv.) on day 1 and day 8 of every 21-day cycle.
