      Interferon alpha therapy, the retrospective part of the study includes the data of the
      patients retrieved from medical records from the period from September 2006 till January

      therapy were defined by normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and absence of
      detectable serum HCV RNA at the end of treatment (48 weeks). Relapsed responders to therapy
      were defined by normalization of serum ALT and absence of detectable serum HCV RNA at the end
      of treatment but with an increase of the serum ALT and the presence of HCV RNA at follow-up
      72 weeks). Non-responders were defined by elevated serum ALT and the presence of HCV RNA at
      the end of treatment. All patients will sign a written informed consent to share in this
      clinical registry by their data and biological samples. Sub-studies will be conducted on
      subgroups of patients sharing in this main study after signing a written informed consent.
