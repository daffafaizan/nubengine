    
      To assess and compare the effects of administration of Cissus quadrangularis (Linn) and a
      Cissus quadrangularis /Irvingia gabonensis combination on body weight blood pressure, fasting
      blood glucose, plasma total and LDL cholesterol in 72 overweight and obese subjects.

      The study was a 10 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, involving 72
      obese or overweight participants. Participants were randomly divided into three groups (24
      participants/ group):

      Group 1 - Placebo; Group 2 - Cissus quadrangularis (CQ); Group 3 - Cissus quadrangularis and
      Irvingia gabonensis (CQ-IG).

      The placebo (250mg) or active formulations ((150 mg CQ and 250 mg CQ-IG) were administered
      twice daily before meals. Weight as well as fasting blood was taken at baseline, and at 4, 8
      and 10 weeks.

      No major dietary changes or exercises were suggested during the study.
