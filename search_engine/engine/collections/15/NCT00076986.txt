      IL13-PE38QQR is a tumor-targeting agent administered by a continuous infusion directly into
      the brain around the cavity where the tumor has been removed. Through previous research, this
      Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma.

      The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial
      toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor
      like a "key to a lock," allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor
      cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be
      damaged by the drug. The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly
      into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed
      from 2-7 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug
      solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4
      days.

      The GLIADEL速 Wafer is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed GBM. Patients
      receiving GLIADEL速 will have wafers placed at the time of surgery to remove tumor.

      Eligible patients enrolled in the PRECISE trial will be randomly assigned to receive either
      IL13-PE38QQR or GLIADEL速 Wafer. Patients will have a 2 out of 3 chance to receive
      IL13-PE38QQR and 1 out of 3 chance to receive GLIADEL速 Wafer.
