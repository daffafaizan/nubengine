      design. Approximately 200 generally healthy adults meeting the necessary inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled so that 180 subjects (60 per treatment group) would reasonably be
      expected to complete the study. Subjects will have their oral soft/hard tissues assessed and
      will be evaluated for sensitivity levels at Screening (visit 1), Baseline (visit 2), Week 1,
      Week 2, Week 4 & Week 6. During the first two weeks of the study, subjects will be instructed
      to brush their teeth for one minute in their usual manner, twice daily using the provided
      standard fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will return for the Baseline exam and, upon
      qualification with entry criteria, will be assigned to one of three treatment groups.
      Qualified subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth two times daily for one minute in
      their usual manner using the provided standard fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will be
      instructed to rinse twice daily, after brushing, with the provided mouthrinse for 60 seconds
      using 10 ml or 20 ml (depending on the treatment group), for 6 consecutive weeks.
