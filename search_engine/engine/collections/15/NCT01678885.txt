      completing Phase I, and eight weeks completing Phase II (the weight loss phase of the study).
      Then, participants will return to the center at months 6 and 12 for a follow-up visit. During
      these visits, body weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be recorded, and questionnaires
      about eating attitudes and habits will be collected and assessed.
