      riboflavin supplementation on chronic plaque psoriasis. Up to fifty volunteers with chronic
      plaque psoriasis will be recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled 28 week prospective
      study with cross-over of both the intervention and control groups at the 12 week time mark.
      There will be a 4 week washout period when subjects crossover. Riboflavin will be dosed 400
      mg by mouth daily versus placebo. Throughout the study the investigators will perform both
      clinical and laboratory assessments to measure response.
