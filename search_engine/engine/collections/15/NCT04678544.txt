      effects, including alopecia. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a common and distressing
      side effect of many chemotherapy drugs. In previous study, more than half of the breast
      cancer patients experienced higher distress due to CIA during cancer treatment, and this
      distress was strongly associated with negative body image, overall health status, and
      psychosocial well-being. Recently scalp cooling has been known to be one of the effective
      options for hair loss prevention. However there was little information regarding the effect
      on prevention of permanent CIA(PCIA). This study aims to examine the impact of scalp cooling
      on prevention of PCIA as well as CIA.

      Female adults who are newly diagnosed with stage 1-3 breast cancer and aged less than 70
      years will be screened for plan of undergoing Adriamycin or/and Taxane regimen as neoadjuvant
      or adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to intervention or
      control groups (2:1 ratio). Patients in intervention group will have applied scalp cooling
      during 4 or 6 cycles of their chemotherapy whereas participants in control group will be
      observed.

      The objective of the study is to examine whether Paxman scalp cooling system is effective in
      reducing PCIA in women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. In
      addition, impact of Paxman scalp cooling on prevention of CIA, alopecia-related distress,
      quality of life and patient-reported alopecia related side effect will be also explored.
