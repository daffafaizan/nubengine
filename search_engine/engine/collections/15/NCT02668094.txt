      groups (each n=40) receiving intravenous lidocaine 40mg (group L), oral pregabalin 75 mg
      (group LP), and oral pregabalin 150 mg (group HP) as pretreatment, followed by injection of
      25% of 2 mg/kg propofol. Pain was assessed by a four point scale (0=no, 1=mild, 2=moderate,
      3=severe pain).
