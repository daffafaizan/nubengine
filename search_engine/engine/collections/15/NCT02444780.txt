      and inflammatory processes [6,7]. This surgical stress response resembles the catabolic
      stress which is found in other forms of critical illness. We did not measure plasma glutamine
      before surgery so it is unknown whether the plasma glutamine level was already low before
      surgery in these patients or that the lowering of plasma glutamine level is a consequence of
      surgery. Most of the patients in the elective surgery group in our study underwent cardiac
      surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass; it is known that extracorporeal circulation
      induces an inflammatory response but there are no clinical data on the effects on plasma
      glutamine or on post-operative course in relation to plasma glutamine levels [8,9].
