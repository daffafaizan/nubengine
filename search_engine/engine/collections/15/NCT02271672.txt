      circumferential waist reduction following 4 treatment sessions delivered once a week over a
      4-week period. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      treatment after 30-day and 90-day Follow Up in achieving waist circumference reduction of ≥3
      cm across the waist line relative to the base line assessment and their mean waist
      circumferential reduction is ≥1 cm than the average circumferential reduction of sham group.
