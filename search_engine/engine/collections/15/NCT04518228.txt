    
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of antiretroviral (ARV) and
      anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs administered during pregnancy and postpartum.

      This study is comprised of five components which in turn are comprised of arms specific to
      each drug or drug combination being evaluated:

        -  Component 1 (Arms 1.1, 1.2. 1.3. 1.4. and 1.5): Pregnant women living with HIV (WLHIV)
           receiving oral ARVs and no TB drugs, and their infants.

        -  Component 2 (Arm 2.1): Pregnant WLHIV and HIV-uninfected women who received
           long-acting/extended release ARVs during pregnancy, and their infants.

        -  Component 3 (Arms 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3): Pregnant WLHIV receiving ARVs and first-line TB
           treatment, and their infants.

        -  Component 4 (Arm 4.1): Pregnant WLHIV and HIV-uninfected women receiving second-line TB
           treatment, and their infants.

        -  Component 5 (Arms 5.1, 5.2. and 5.3): Postpartum WLHIV breastfeeding while receiving
           oral ARVs, and their infants.

      Each arm will open to accrual independently and will accrue independently over approximately
      36 months from the first enrollment in each arm.

      No ARVs or TB treatment drugs are supplied as part of this study. All drugs under study are
      provided by non-study sources.

      Participants in Component 1 will be followed up to 12 weeks after delivery for mothers and up
      to 24 weeks after birth for infants. Participants in Component 2 will be followed up to 5
      weeks after delivery for mothers and infants. Participants in Components 3, 4, and 5 will be
      followed up to 24 weeks after delivery for mothers and infants.

      Study visits may include:

        -  Component 1: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at second
           trimester (2T), third trimester (3T), delivery, and 6-12 weeks post-partum (PP). Infant
           clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth and 5-9 days after birth.

        -  Component 2: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at delivery.
           Infant clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth, 5-9 days, and 12-16 days
           after birth. Maternal and infant breast milk transfer PK sampling at 5-9 days, 12-16
           days, and 3-5 weeks after delivery.

        -  Component 3: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at second
           trimester (2T), third trimester (3T), delivery, and 2-8 weeks post-partum (PP). Infant
           clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth and 5-9 days after birth. Maternal
           and infant breast milk transfer PK sampling at 5-9 days, 2-8 weeks, and 16-24 weeks
           after delivery.

        -  Component 4: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at second
           trimester (2T), third trimester (3T), delivery, and 2-8 weeks post-partum (PP). Infant
           clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth and 5-9 days after birth. Maternal
           and infant breast milk transfer PK sampling at 5-9 days, 2-8 weeks, and 16-24 weeks
           after delivery.

        -  Component 5: Maternal and infant clinical evaluations and breast milk transfer PK
           sampling at 5-9 days, 2-12 weeks, and 16-24 weeks after delivery.
