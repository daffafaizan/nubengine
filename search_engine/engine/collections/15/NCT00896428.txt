      which is related with an increase proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Recently, using BSM
      cells obtained from severe asthmatics, we have demonstrated that such an increase
      proliferation was induced by an activation cascade (Trian, J Exp Med, 2007). It first started
      with a gallopamil-sensitive calcium influx which induced the activation of calcium-calmodulin
      kinase IV (CamK-IV). CamK-IV then enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis through the subsequent
      activation of various transcription factors including PGC-1Î±, NRF-1 and mt-TFA. BSM cell
      proliferation was mainly mitochondria-dependent in vitro in severe asthma whereas that of
      controls was virtually mitochondria-independent. However, in vivo effects of gallopamil
      remain to be investigated. We will thus enrol 32 severe asthmatic patients in a phase 2
      randomized double blind study against placebo and evaluate the effect of gallopamil on BSM
      remodelling. Since inflammation also activates mitochondrial biogenesis in BSM cells, we will
      initially optimized asthma treatment for 3 months by both controlling co morbidities and
      decreasing bronchial inflammation using exhaled NO and eosinophil count within the induced
      sputum. We will then perform fiberoptic fibroscopy before and after 12 month treatment with
      gallopamil.
