    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, parallel, open-label, positive-controlled
      clinical trial. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the early bactericidal activity,
      safety and tolerability of WX-081 patients with drug-naive&susceptible and drug-resistant
      tuberculosis. and the efficacy in participants with drug-resistant tuberculosis.

      This trial will be divided into core research stage (stage 1) and extended research stage
      (stage 2). During stage 1, a panel of 44 participants with drug-naive&susceptible
      tuberculosis will be randomized to receive either WX-081(including 3 groups:150mg qd, 300mg
      qd, 450mg qd. n=12 per group) or standard treatment (n=8) for 2 weeks, and then followed by a
      follow-up period of 2 weeks. A panel of 40 participants with drug-resistant tuberculosis will
      be randomized to receive either WX-081 (400mg qd, n=20) or bedaquiline (400mg qd, n=20) for 2
      weeks. During stage 2, the 40 participants with drug-resistant tuberculosis will receive
      WX-081(150mg qd) + MBT treatment (ie. multi-drug background treatment) and bedaquiline (200mg
      tiw) +MBT treatment for 6 weeks respectively, and then followed by a follow-up period of 4
      weeks.
