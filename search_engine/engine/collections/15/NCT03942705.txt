      can be performed in a high percentage of women, using HPV DNA of self-collected vaginal
      samples, provided by women attending either chamas (community groups) or in their own homes.
      HPV DNA testing will be used to triage women for a secondary screen by visual inspection with
      acetic acid (VIA) in a local clinic. The investigators will determine if HPV DNA testing,
      performed on self-collected vaginal swabs, is acceptable, feasible, and sensitive and
      specific in detection of high-grade cervical lesions among Kenyan women, compared to the
      current standard of care. In addition, women will bring their children to be vaccinated
      against HPV in these community meetings, using the standard of care for the approved HPV
      vaccine available in Kenya.

      The investigators will test this approach by completing the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the percentage of women attending community meetings who will
      provide self-collected vaginal swabs for HPV DNA testing.

      Specific Aim 2. Following HPV DNA screening using self-collected swabs, determine the
      percentage of these women who will attend the local clinic.

      Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the statistical correlation between HPV DNA testing of
      self-collected vaginal swabs and VIA (as all women in this pilot study will undergo VIA).
