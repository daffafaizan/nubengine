      chronic respiratory failure receiving domiciliary NPPV. In addition, their health status,
      psychological status and sleep quality seem to be highly disturbed due to severe respiratory
      insufficiency. Therefore, in the present study, we aim to examine (1) contributive factors to
      health status based on baseline data, (2) whether patient reported measurements such as
      health status, dyspnea and psychological status would predict patient's future outcomes, and
      (3) how they would change for 3 years as compared to physiological measurements.
