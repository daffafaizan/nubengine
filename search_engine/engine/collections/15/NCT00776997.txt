      to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) is laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. This surgical
      procedure continues to be the prevalent non-medical treatment option for GERD patients,
      despite several important limitations. First, it is a very traumatic procedure, requiring
      portions of the stomach to be dissected and then wrapped around the tubular esophagus,
      creating permanent anatomic alterations. Secondly, it can create significant side effects,
      such as gas bloat syndrome, the inability to belch and the inability to vomit.

      The intent of the LINX System is to allow a surgeon, using existing laparoscopic techniques
      and instruments, to augment a weak LES and restore the defective barrier at the
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). This defect of the GEJ is the source of abnormal reflux. The
      LINX device is an expandable string of individual titanium beads with magnetic cores. The
      device is laparoscopically placed as a ring around the lower esophageal sphincter. The
      magnetic attraction of the beads augments the esophageal sphincter's ability to resist
      gastric pressures that cause reflux. At rest, the LINX device encircles the sphincter with
      each bead resting against an adjacent bead, to avoid compression of the tubular esophagus.
      When swallowing, higher pressures are created, allowing the magnetic bond between beads to
      break, and the LINX implant to expand radially. This serves to preserve swallow and other
      physiologic functions, such as belching and vomiting, and avoids the side effect of
      post-prandial bloating. The device can be placed with minimal dissection, preserving anatomy,
      and is also removable, if necessary. This provides important benefits as it preserves the
      native anatomy, unlike the Nissen procedure.
