      inadequately resuscitated, when deciding when to continue resuscitation despite a central
      venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) > 70% associated with elevated blood lactate levels.

      Under steady states of both VO2 and VCO2, P (v-a) CO2 was observed to increase in parallel
      with the reduction in cardiac output. However, spontaneous breathing and hyperventilation may
      reduce PaCO2 and prevent the CO2 stagnation-induced rise in PvCO2.

      To date,these studies of ∆PCO2 and respiratory rate in septic shock patients Under Volume
      Mechanical Ventilation are rarely.
