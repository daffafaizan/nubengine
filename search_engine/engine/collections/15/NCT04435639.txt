      visit over a 3 week period: participants will receive manual lymphatic drainage for 40
      minutes. They will then put on an Adjustable Compression sleeve (Juzo varocare adjustable
      compression system). Patients will be re-measured before the fourth treatment and again on
      session 6. At this point patients will receive a standard arm compression sleeve. This will
      be worn in alternation with their adjustable compression sleeve over the following 6 months.
      Patient will have their limb volume re-measured at the 6 month review.
