      site in Vietnam. Following a screening period, healthy eligible subjects (n = 402) were
      enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Sci-B-Vac OLD BTG, or Sci-B-Vac NEW
      SciGen, or Engerix-B.

      The study was conducted in two stages, approximately a year-and-a-half apart. In the first
      stage (Stage I) beginning in March 2006, Sci-B-Vac (OLD BTG) vaccine was compared to
      Engerix-B; and in the second stage (Stage II) beginning in November 2007, the Sci-B-Vac (NEW
      SciGen) vaccine was compared to Engerix-B. The subjects assigned to the Engerix-B group were
      equally divided between the stages, 67 subjects in the Engerix-B group in Stages I and II,
      respectively, for a total of 134 subjects. Immunogenicity evaluations for Stage I data
      (Visits 5 and 6) were conducted together with Stage II data.
