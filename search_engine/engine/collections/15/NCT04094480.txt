      acute appendicitis, especially in the obese, elderly, and in cases where the diagnosis is
      uncertain . There are clear benefits with the laparoscopic approach in terms of decreased
      pain and faster recovery than the open approach . However, disadvantages like a higher
      incidence of intra-abdominal collection, longer operating time, and higher costs have been
      documented. These may be dependent on the technique of appendicular stump closure. Therefore,
      the technique for appendiceal stump closure is crucial in laparoscopic appendectomy.

      Laparoscopic appendectomy was first described by Semm in 1983 and is currently preferred
      approach for an appendectomy for many surgeons. Numerous methods of stump closure have been
      used, like intracorporeal suturing of the stump endoloop application, endostapler application
      LigaSure customized titanium clip application, and, more recently, using nonabsorbable
      plastic clips . Many of these techniques are either time consuming or expensive, or not
      available universally.
