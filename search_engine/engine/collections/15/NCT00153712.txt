      ulcers are relatively common in the West (11%-44%). It is uncommon in Hong Kong (4%).
      Significant number of these patients with non-NSAID, non-Hp bleeding ulcers had co-morbid
      illness and many had life-threatening conditions. Our recent study showed that there is an
      increasing incidence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), non-Helicobacter
      pylori (Hp) bleeding peptic ulcers. There is no datum on the natural course of these patients
      and this is our aim to have this observational study.
