      intensive care units (ICU) will be collected from medical records to evaluate current pain
      management practices. An algorithm, which is developed by a group of resource persons, is
      educated to the staff in three of the ICUs. The staff will also receive training and guiding
      in the use of the algorithm and the different pain assessment tools. Then the algorithm will
      be implemented and used in all the consecutive ICU patients. Post-test data is then collected
      in the three ICUs. In the fourth ICU, which will be used as a comparison unit, the same
      post-test data will be collected at the same time as data in intervention ICUs were
      collected. The algorithm will not be introduced here.
