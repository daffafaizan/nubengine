    
      DBPR108 is a potent dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor. This study will be run in four parts to
      characterize the Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) potential of DBPR108 with the expected
      concomitant drugs (Metformin hydrochloride, Glibenclamide, Valsartan, Simvastatin) in Healthy
      Subjects. Each part of this study consists of a screening period (Day -14 to Day -1), a
      baseline period (Day -1), a treatment period (Day 1 to Day 9), and a follow-up visit on Day
      15. Approximately 14 subjects will be enrolled in each part of this study.
