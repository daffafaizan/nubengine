    
      Study DE020 was a multicenter, open-label continuation study for patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis who had participated in a prior Phase 1, 2, or 3 adalimumab study in the United
      States or Canada, had a favorable safety and efficacy profile when treated with adalimumab,
      and met the eligibility criteria for the continuation study. Participants received
      subcutaneous injections of adalimumab every other week (eow) or monthly based on the
      adalimumab regimen received in the prior study (i.e., participants who received monthly
      dosing in the prior study began the continuation study on monthly dosing; all other
      participants began adalimumab dosing at eow intervals). Participants who maintained an
      American College of Rheumatology 50% (ACR50) response for 2 consecutive visits could have
      their dosing interval lengthened to a monthly dosing schedule. Safety and efficacy data were
      collected over 520 weeks (10 years). Both safety and efficacy data were analyzed using all
      participants who received at least 1 dose of open-label adalimumab in the 10-year
      continuation study DE020 (the Full Analysis Set, n=846). Three patients who entered the
      continuation study but were never dosed were excluded from all analyses.
