      completion of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In most cases, protamine is given in amounts
      sufficient to neutralize the total dose of heparin.9 This dose is usually calculated with a
      ratio of 1.3mg protamine for every 100U heparin given.10 In the literature, reported doses of
      intraoperatively administered protamine range from 0 to 8mg per 100U of heparin. Given in
      excess, protamine can, in addition to complement activation and hemodynamic instability,11
      induce platelet dysfunctions.12-16 The latter significantly increases both the cost and
      morbidity of cardiac interventions as it is one of the main causes of postoperative bleeding.
      The optimal protamine/heparin ratio is difficult to individualize for each patient because of
      the great interpatient variability in heparin's metabolism4-7 and of the absence of
      correlation between ACT and heparin's plasma concentration.8 Consumption of heparin may vary
      from 0.01 to 3.86U/Kg per minute during CPB.30 The exact concentration of remaining
      circulating heparin at the end of bypass is not easily obtained.
