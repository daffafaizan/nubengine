      percent. HIV-infected adults co-infected with HCV appear to have accelerated HIV disease
      progression. There is little data on HCV prevalence in the pediatric HIV-infected population.
      This substudy will provide estimates of HCV prevalence among HIV-infected children and
      determine the need for future HCV natural history and treatment protocols. In addition, this
      substudy will archive samples from patients for future testing for other hepatitis viruses
      such as hepatitis G virus (HGV or GB virus C).

      Patients participating in PACTG 219C are selected randomly to enroll into PACTG P1028S.
      Patients who agree to participate have a single blood draw for HCV antibody (Enzyme
      Immunoassay-EIA) testing and HCV RNA (Polymerase Chain Reaction-PCR) testing. An additional
      blood draw is necessary in the case of discordant results between the HCV EIA and HCV PCR.
      HCV-negative patients have 1 study visit. Patients with positive HCV test results have 2
      visits. Patients with discordant HCV test results have 2 or 3 visits.
