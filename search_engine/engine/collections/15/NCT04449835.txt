      prior to procedure and 6 post their procedure). Study visits will be conducted via telephone
      by a third-party CRO and independent clinical research coordinators. Participants will be
      verbally consented and then evaluated via telephonic study visits at baseline (prior to
      procedure) and at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post their Intracept Procedure.

      Primary and secondary objectives are based on patient reported outcomes for functional
      improvement, pain reduction, and physical and mental health pre and post procedure. The
      registry will also look at utilization of injections and pain interventions/surgery for
      treatment of low back pain post Intracept.
