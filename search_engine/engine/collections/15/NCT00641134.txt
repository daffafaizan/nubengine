      cardiovascular disease, and no information is available on maintenance of results achieved
      with CR over the medium- and long-term periods. As long-term adherence with exercise programs
      after comprehensive CR is generally poor, with only 30% reporting regular exercise at
      12-month follow-up, guidelines recommend the implementation of methods aimed at improving
      adherence with such programs. The applicability to older pts of Home-Based exercise programs
      aimed at enhancing the adherence with prescriptions and maintaining the physiological
      benefits attained during the in-Hospital training period, is a further issue still to be
      clarified. The goal of this study is to determine in pts older than 75 years the medium- (6
      months) and long-term (12 months) effects of a Home-Based exercise program after in-Hospital
      comprehensive CR, as compared with usual care, on exercise capacity, health-related quality
      of life and health care services utilization.

      Pts older than 75 years who are candidate to an in-Hospital comprehensive CR program after
      acute coronary syndromes (ACS), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cardiac surgery
      (coronary artery by-pass graft and/or valvular surgery), will be screened for eligibility in
      the trial, and will be enrolled provided they do not meet any of the exclusion criteria. At
      baseline, at completion of CR program, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up, the following data
      will be assessed in all enrolled pts:

        -  functional capacity, expressed as total work capacity (TWC, watt) and maximal aerobic
           capacity (peak VO2, ml/kg/min) during a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test

        -  endurance, expressed by the distance covered during a 6-minute walk test (6MWT)

        -  lower limb muscular strength, measured with an isokinetic dynamometer

        -  health-related quality of life (SF 36 questionnaire)

        -  utilization rates of health care services

      At discharge from in-Hospital CR program, pts will be randomly allocated to:

        1. Home-Based exercise program, consisting of a prescription of a specific set of exercises
           detailed and actively recorded in a log book, with one reinforcement session at the
           Rehabilitation Centre each month for the first 6 months.

        2. Usual care, consisting of recommendation on usefulness of physical exercise and standard
           follow-up visits and functional assessment at 6 and 12 months.
