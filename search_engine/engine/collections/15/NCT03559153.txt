      position, will be included. disabled employees will not be included.

      Sample size: The prevalence of complaints and pain intensity in the arm, neck and shoulder
      regions, in addition to the lumbar region. A statistical power of 80%, Î± = 5%, sample loss of
      15% will be considered for the sample calculation. The reduction expected of the prevalence
      of musculoskeletal complaints and pain will be 20%. Therefore, it will be necessary to
      perform the study 286 workers, allocated in control group (CG), intervention groups (IG),
      passive rest break - Shiatsu - Quick massage (SGM); and comparative group using active rest
      break - Compensatory exercise program(CE).

      the outcomes will be evaluated at the individual level, since they reflect aspects of
      workers' health. Data on outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 4 months.
      After a period of 4 months, the sector that received only a break or massage can receive work
      gymnastics, if the hypothesis of this study is confirmed on the effectiveness of the exercise
      on the other interventions. Both groups of workers will be followed up in a longitudinal
      study in subsequent months and compared to the other workers identified, within the
      established criteria for risk analysis, for 4 months.

      Primary outcome: The occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms (pain, tingling or numbness) will
      be evaluated by means of the Nordic Questionnaire for Musculoskeletal Symptoms The intensity
      of the pain will be evaluated by the Verbal Numerical Scale of Pain23. It is an 11-point
      scale, in which 0 means "no pain" and 10 means "worst possible pain".

      Secondary outcomes: 1) Work ability index (WAI) to identify the worker's perception at the
      moment or in the near future; 2)
