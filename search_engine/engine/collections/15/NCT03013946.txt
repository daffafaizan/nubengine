      to a reactive approach, which is considered the standard of care.

      Patients in the Coaching Arm A will be trained continuously at personal interactions of coach
      and patient (Face-to Face meetings as well as telephone contacts). The patient is educated on
      nature and severity of treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAE) of the Sunitinib-Therapy.

      Quality of Life (QoL) is assessed during sunitinib treatment in both arms (Arm A Coaching and
      Arm B non Coaching).
