      trademark) in patients with neovascular AMD. This will be done by assessment of vital signs,
      physical examination, laboratory blood tests and adverse events. Possible adverse events
      include: eye irritation/discomfort, redness/itching eye, eye dryness, abnormal sensation in
      eye; lens clouding; pain/irritation at injection site; increased tear production; 'floaters';
      sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, joint pain, flu, fatigue, breathlessness, dizziness,
      pale skin, anxiety, cough, nausea and allergic reactions.

      Because PF582 is very similar to Lucentis it is expected to have similar adverse effects.
