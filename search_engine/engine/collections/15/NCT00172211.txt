      stress, as a result of reduced anti-oxidant systems and increased pro-oxidant activity.
      Enhanced oxidative stress in uremic patients increases the risk of atherosclerosis and
      cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, bioincompatibility of dialysis therapy further
      increases oxidative stress. High concentration of glucose, high lactate, low pH, and/or high
      concentration of glucose degradation products (GDP) are known as bioincompatible factors and
      believed to increase oxidative stress in peritoneal dialysis patients. A more biocompatible
      dialysis solution, i.e., neutral pH, containing physiologic concentration of bicarbonate and
      low concentration of GDP has been developed. There is a growing body of in vitro studies
      showing this neutral bicarbonate containing dialysis solution more biocompatible compared to
      conventional solutions. However, its effects on oxidative stress in peritoneal dialysis
      patients are not reported yet. On the other hand, insulin resistance is associated with
      cardiovascular disease, and it is very common in uremic patients. Some animal studies
      suggested that reduced oxidative stress enhanced insulin sensitivity, and the effects of
      reduced oxidative stress in human have not been extensively investigated. Previous studies of
      Physioneal®, a kind of more biocompatible dialysis solution which contains bicarbonate, have
      revealed advantages of improved infusion pain, more efficient acid-base control, increased
      ultrafiltration, and reduced peritonitis duration. The comparison of oxidative stress and
      insulin resistance before and after using Physioneal®, may help to elucidate the possibly
      beneficial effects on uremic patients, which frequently suffer from increased oxidative
      stress and insulin resistance.
