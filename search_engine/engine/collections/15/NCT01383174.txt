      intervention for newly diagnosed Latina breast cancer patients. In our prior work, the
      investigators established the appropriate content of the intervention, the need for early
      intervention, and the value of culturally competent peer support. In this study the
      investigators will adapt an evidence-based CBSM intervention designed to meet these needs.
      This study will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a wait-listed usual care
      control group to adapt the intervention and test its effectiveness in improving breast cancer
      specific quality-of-life, and decreasing anxiety and breast cancer specific distress. The
      new, adapted intervention will be called "Nuevo Amanecer" (A New Dawn).
