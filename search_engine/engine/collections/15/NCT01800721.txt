    
      The primary objective of this funded research is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of
      an experimental behavioral intervention that will train African American men who have sex
      with men (AA MSM) to 1) conduct peer health education, 2) to promote HIV risk reduction among
      their social network members, 3) promote HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) among
      their social network members and 4) recruit social network members for VCT. Index
      participants are African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who are randomized to
      either a peer education intervention or comparison condition. After the baseline is complete,
      index participants refer social network members (i.e. network participants) to the research
      clinic for HIV antibody testing. In addition, a subset of network participants participate in
      the longitudinal portion of the study.
