      physiological instabilities, and the use of high numbers of invasive catheters. Relatedly,
      patients with trauma have high rates of major disability and frequently require protracted
      rehabilitation with prolonged periods of recovery. Recently, it has been found that the use
      of progressive early mobilization (EM) protocols may minimize the functional declines
      experienced by patients in general during intensive care unit (ICU) stays, but few studies
      have investigated the effects of such protocols on trauma patients in particular. In
      addition, prior early mobilization studies have found that the survivors of trauma often
      experience a greater incidence of neurological injuries than other critical care patients.
      However, no randomized controlled trials thus far have utilized objective evaluations to
      measure the influence or effect of progressive EM protocols on the functional recovery of
      trauma patients. Therefore, we aim to explore the effects of using a progressive EM protocol
      in a trauma ICU on the functional mobility of trauma patients.

      Objective: The goals of this proposed research study are (1) to investigate the feasibility
      of using a structured progressive EM protocol for patients with trauma in a trauma ICU and
      (2) to determine the effectiveness of the progressive EM protocol, which is designed for
      implementation with trauma patients, on the functional and in-body outcomes of such patients.

      Research methods: The study will be a single-blind, randomized controlled trial with a
      blinded assessment at the end of the follow-up period.
