      in many countries. Most of these (75%) are in the low and middle income countries (LAMIC) and
      globally suicide is the second leading cause of death in young people 15-29 years of age.
      There is no official data on suicide from Pakistan, a conservative South Asian Islamic
      country with historically low suicide rates. Both suicide and attempted suicide are illegal
      acts, as well as socially and religiously condemned, however, there is accumulating evidence
      that suicide rates have been gradually increasing in Pakistan over the last few years.

      The culturally adapted psychological intervention C-MAP utilizes problem solving components
      within a brief intervention that can be widely utilized in clinical practice. Our previous
      pilot trial in Karachi shows the efficacy of CBT based intervention(C-MAP) in people who had
      recently self harmed.The findings from this work have highlighted the applicability of such
      an intervention to health services in Pakistan for patients who present after a self-harm
      episode
