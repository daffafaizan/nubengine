      or adjacent to the GI or respiratory tracts by means of a miniprobe inserted through an
      endoscopic needle. The fundamental technology, as well as the principle of operation of nCLE,
      is substantially similar to pCLE.

      endoscopic fine needles are used during EUS-FNA procedures to puncture solid organs such as
      the pancreas, in order to get tissue or fluid for diagnostic purposes. There are different
      calibers of endoscopic nee-dles used. The most commonly used calibers for EUS-FNA procedures
      are 22G, 19G, and 25G needles. The nCLE Confocal Miniprobe is compatible with the 19G-type
      needle only. It is expected to help to differentiate the different types of lesions,
      especially for cysts, leading to better patient management. Microscopic tissue information in
      real-time in vivo during an EUS-FNA procedure may allow better differentiation between
      mucinous and non-mucinous cysts for instance.
