      disease or troponin negative unstable angina undergoing elective PCI, to obtain the
      information on the safety and effects on various pharmacodynamic markers, of three doses of
      argatroban in combination with clopidogrel and aspirin, and to assess the results of
      argatroban and unfractionated heparin, both used in combination with clopidogrel and aspirin,
      on clinical outcomes, adequacy of anticoagulation, various pharmacodynamic markers
      (approximately 35 patients per group).
