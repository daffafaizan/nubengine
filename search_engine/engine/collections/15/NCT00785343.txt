        -  Motor function will be significantly greater for the patients in the robotic training
           group as measured by standard clinical evaluations.

        -  Functional independence gains will be similar for both groups because the robotic
           therapy is not task-specific for activities of daily living (ADL).

        -  Robotic training will reduce pain and spasticity more effectively than conventional
           therapy alone, due to increased number of movements performed during the robotic
           training.

        -  Muscle activation patterns for patients receiving robotic training will show decreased
           agonist/antagonist co-contraction and less erratic muscle activation.

        -  Robotic training patients will demonstrate significantly greater ROM, movement accuracy
           and higher movement speed during exercises performed as part of robotic training. For
           robotic exercises performed only as part of the robotic assessment, these improvements
           will be significantly less than those for practiced movements.
