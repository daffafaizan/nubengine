      reconstruction are closely related to prognosis and nutritional status. Therefore, it is
      essential to choose. At present, more and more clinical centers tend to choose Roux-en-Y (RY)
      reconstruction after total gastrectomy, which are prone to a variety of complications, and
      seriously affects the quality of life, such as malnutrition. There is argument over whether
      functional jejunal interposition is better than those with Roux-en-Y After total gastrectomy
      for gastric cancer. How to improve the nutritional status of the patients following total
      gastrectomy with gastrointestinal reconstruction arouses people's attention. The purpose of
      this study was to evaluate differences of the nutritional status in patients undergoing
      functional jejunal interposition and Roux-en-Y after total gastrectomy.
