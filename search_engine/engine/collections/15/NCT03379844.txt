      â€¢ To establish the safety and toxicity profile of holmium radioembolization in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate efficacy of holmium radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma without
           curative treatment options in a non-comparative phase II study.

        -  To evaluate tumor marker response.

        -  To evaluate Quality of Life (QoL).

        -  To evaluate biodistribution / dosimetry.

        -  To evaluate hepatic function.

      Study design: Multi-center, interventional, treatment, non-randomized, open label,
      non-comparative, early phase II study. The study is a collaboration between UMC Utrecht and
      Erasmus MC Rotterdam. Recruitment and treatment of patients will take place in both centers.

      Intervention: Holmium radioembolization will be performed via a catheter during angiography.
