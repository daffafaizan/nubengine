      of the standard LMA, LMA Unique TM,with the air-Q ILA-SP in pediatric patients. Oropharyngeal
      leak pressure is commonly used as an indicator of airway seal adequacy. Similarly, flexible
      fiberoptic bronchoscope examination is often employed to assess proper placement of airway
      devices. We hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the ILA-SP will be superior to the
      LMA upon initial device placement, and ten minutes after device placement. Airway leak
      pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at which equilibrium is reached.
      Ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, and complications (airway related,
      gastric insufflation, trauma) will also be assessed.
