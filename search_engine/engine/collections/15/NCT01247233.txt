    
      Following breast conservative surgery, patients will be stratified according to the following
      prognostic factors using a minimisation technique: age (<70 vs â‰¥70), HER2 status (HER2+ vs
      HER2-), hormonal receptor status (RH+ vs RH-) and lymph node invasion (pN0 vs pN0i+).

      Patients will be allocated to receive either standard treatment, hypofractionated treatment
      or APBI.

      Radiation therapy should be started between 4 and 12 weeks after the last surgery.

      Patients treated with standard whole breast irradiation will receive a total dose of 50 Gy in
      25 fractions, 2 Gy per day, 5 days a week. The boost of 16 Gy will be delivered in 8
      fractions for all patients after completion of the 50 Gy, without interruption. All patients
      will receive one fraction per day, 5 fractions a week.

      Patients treated with hypofractionated irradiation will receive a total dose of either 40 Gy
      (in 15 fractions, 2.66 Gy per day) or 42.5 Gy (in 16 fractions, 2.65 Gy per day) 5 days a
      week.

      Patients treated with APBI will receive a total dose of 40 Gy in 10 fractions, delivered
      twice a day over a time period of 5-7 days. Each daily dose must be separated by 6 hours.

      Patients will be followed at 3 and 6 month after the last dose of irradiation, at 12 months
      after the date of last surgery and then on a yearly basis during 10 years.
