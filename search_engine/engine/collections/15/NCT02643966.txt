      in screening for breast cancer. In particular, there is interest in investigating the value
      of using WBUS as an adjunct (supplementary imaging) to Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)
      based screening of women with dense (heterogeneously or extremely dense) breasts or as a
      primary screening examination in this group of women. Women scheduled for their routine
      mammography that includes a DBT exam who agree to participate in the study and sign informed
      consent will undergo (at the same visit) DBT imaging as part of their clinical exam and whole
      breast ultrasound (WBUS) each year for three rounds of screening plus one year of follow-up.
      The DBT images and WBUS will be interpreted independently by two experienced radiologists
      under standard clinical screening procedures. One radiologist will interpret the DBT and the
      other radiologist will interpret the WBUS. Using a modified "LOGICAL OR" approach
      women/subjects may be recalled for further diagnostic work-up (examinations). If a subject is
      recalled, she will then follow the standard/routine clinical procedures for follow-up and the
      investigators will verify outcomes. If neither radiologist recalls the subject, then the
      subject will follow conventional management and the investigators will verify outcome. The
      findings from the DBT and WBUS examinations, as well as any resulting follow-up, will be
      collected, recorded and analyzed.
