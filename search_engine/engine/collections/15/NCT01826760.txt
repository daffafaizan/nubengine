      worldwide. HBV is one of the leading causes for rapid deterioration of liver function, which
      is a serious condition termed as "acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)" with high mortality.
      There is a high prevalence of HBV in Asian developing countries where acute-on-chronic
      hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF) accounts for more than 70% of ACLF and almost 120, 000
      patients died of ACHBLF each year. The transplantation of liver is the basic and strong
      effective therapeutic option for ACHBLF patients. However, liver transplantation is difficult
      to be extensively applied due to the shortage of liver donors and other socioeconomic
      problems. Thus, an early predictive model, which is objective, reasonable and accurate, is
      necessary for severity discrimination and organ allocation to decrease the mortality of
      ACHBLF.

      MELD-based scoring systems still failed to predict the mortality of a considerable proportion
      of patients and their predictive accuracy was not satisfying enough.

      The ANN is a novel computer model inspired by the working of human brain. It can build
      nonlinear statistical models to deal with the complex biological systems. In the recent
      years, ANN models have been introduced in clinical medicine for clinical validations,
      including predicting the hepatocellular carcinoma patients' disease-free survival and
      preoperative tumor grade, predicting the mortality of patients with end-stage liver disease
      and identifying the risk of prostate carcinoma.
