    
      Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant metabolic disorder characterized
      by markedly elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL), premature onset of atherosclerosis, and
      development of xanthomata. There are two distinct subpopulations that have a high unmet
      medical need due to the lack of alternative therapy: homozygotes, who have two defective LDL
      receptor (LDL-R) genes, and heterozygotes with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) on
      maximally tolerated therapy. Treatment for FH is directed at lowering plasma levels of LDL-C.

      Mipomersen is an antisense drug targeted to human apolipoprotein B (apoB), the principal
      apolipoprotein of atherogenic LDL-C and its metabolic precursor, very low density lipoprotein
      (VLDL). Mipomersen is complimentary to the coding region of the messenger ribonucleic acid
      (mRNA) for apo-B. Inhibition of apo-B would be expected to impair VLDL synthesis and result
      in lowered levels of LDL-C.

      In early clinical trials, mipomersen has been shown to reduce levels of LDL-C to recommended
      target levels in some participants.

      This was an open-label extension study, which consisted of a â‰¤2-week screening period, up to
      3 years of treatment with mipomersen, and a 24-week post-treatment follow-up period. Patients
      who participated in Cohorts A, B, or C in study 301012-CS9 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      mipomersen 200 mg once a week (QW) or 200 mg mipomersen every other week (QOW) for up to 3
      years. Patients randomized to mipomersen 200 mg QOW were allowed to receive mipomersen 200 mg
      QW at the Investigator's discretion after the first 52 weeks of the treatment period.
      Patients who participated in study 301012-CS8 or Cohort D of study 301012-CS9 received 200 mg
      mipomersen QW for up to 3 years.
