      institutions in Wuhan, China. Nucleic acid testing was completed on January 10, 2020, which
      was confirmed to be caused by 2019-novel coronavirus. In 2020, the World Health
      Organization(WHO) named the virus 2019-novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV). The WHO announced that
      the pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV is officially called COVID-19. Today, more than 70,000
      cases have been confirmed and more than 2,000 patients have died.

      At present, the epidemiological characteristics, laboratory indicators, imaging features and
      clinical treatment effects of COVID-19 should be reported, but the sample size is small.
      Large sample studies are still needed to further confirm COVID-19 's disease progression,
      clinical characteristics, disease severity and treatment effects, so as to provide a
      scientific basis for future clinical treatment. Therefore, it is particularly important to
      further review the relationship between the characteristics and prognosis of such patients.
