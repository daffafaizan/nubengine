      infection, especially aspergillosis. The serious side effects of voriconazole include liver
      function abnormality, encephalopathy, etc. Recently, the several studies showed that the
      blood level of voriconazole is variable and it is associated with drug side effect and
      treatment outcome. However, there is no randomized controlled study which proves that
      therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole can improve the clinical outcome in routine
      clinical practice.
