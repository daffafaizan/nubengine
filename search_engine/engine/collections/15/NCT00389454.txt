      clear. Recently a new COX isoenzyme was identified and termed COX 3. In humans this isoenzyme
      is most abundant in cerebral cortex and heart. Inhibition of COX-3 could represent a primary
      central mechanism by which acetaminophen decrease pain and possibly fever (10). An effect on
      of acetaminophen on presynaptic 5-HT(2) receptors in the hypocampus has been demonstrated
      (11) suggesting again that the primary effect of acetaminophen is in the CNS.

      Many studies (12-16) described the pharmacokinetics of oral and rectal acetaminophen in
      infants and neonates. Yet, the data on acetaminophen concentrations in the CSF is very
      limited. Two studies in adults (17;18) used intravenous propacetamol and described
      concentrations of acetaminophen in the plasma and CSF. Acetaminophen was detected as early as
      15 minutes after the administration and reached peak concentrations in the CSF at the 4th
      hour. A small study (19) of nine children who had indwelling ventricular drains found that
      cerebrospinal fluid concentrations lagged behind those of plasma with an equilibration half
      time of 0.72 h. This study did not describe CSF concentrations in neonates and used a dose of
      40mg/kg, which is higher than the recommended dose in children. To the best of our knowledge
      there is no data on acetaminophen CSF concentrations in neonates.

      The objective of the current study is to describe concentrations of acetaminophen in the CSF
      of infants after single administration of acetaminophen. A better understanding of the
      pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen and its penetration into the CSF will enable us to better
      predict the effects of this commonly used drug.
