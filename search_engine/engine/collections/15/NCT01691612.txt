      in asthma by examining Pin1 and related pathway activation in BAL-derived eosinophils after
      house dust mite allergen challenge. The investigators will perform segmental allergen
      challenge. BAL and lung biopsy of the allergen-challenged segments will be performed 48 hr
      later and activation of Pin1 and related pathways will be examined.
