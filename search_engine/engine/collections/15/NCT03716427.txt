    
      This is Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-sequence drug-drug interaction study to
      determine the effect of CT1812 (560 mg) once daily on the pharmacokinetics of 4 probe drugs
      (tolbutamide, midazolam, dextromethorphan and omeprazole).

      Each subject will qualify for entry into the study within 35 days before admission to the
      clinical unit. Subjects will check into the clinical unit on Day -3 for baseline assessments.
      Each subject will receive a single dose of each of the probe drugs on Day -2 as a 'cocktail'.
      A single dose of CT1812 and each of the probe drugs will be co-administered on Day 6. On Days
      1 through 5, subjects will receive a single daily dose of CT1812.
