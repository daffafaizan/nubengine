      size is calculated on the hypothesis that the experimental treatment will increase the 3
      months response rate up to 21% (by 3 folds, based on the 7% reported in Scheinberg et al
      [17]). Under these assumptions, the sample size to reject the null hypothesis is n=96
      patients for each treatment arm, increased by 4% for possibly not evaluable patients (total
      number of 200 patients, 100 each treatment arm). Statistical design for sample size
      calculation: increase from 7% (control arm) to 21% (investigational arm) in 3 month complete
      response rate (two-sided binomial test); alpha-error 0.05; power 0.8.
