      mechanically ventilated, the efficacy and safety of two body positions in reducing incidence
      of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The semi-recumbent position prevents gastro-oropharyngeal
      aspiration of bacteria laden gastric contents and the "gastro-pulmonary" route of
      colonization. The lateral-Trendelenburg position aims to promote outward drainage of
      bacteria-laden oropharyngeal secretion, while avoiding bacterial translocation from the
      oropharynx into the lungs.
