      prior to arthroscopy by the infusion of 10cc sterile saline into the knee joint followed by
      the immediate withdrawal into the syringe, and storage at -80Â°C in a tube containing a
      protease inhibitor. At 12wk post-operative a 10cc lavage is performed on the knee that
      underwent surgery. Clinical findings for each sample are quantified using gold-standard
      symptom severity questionnaires.

      The specimens will be analyzed for 31 potential biomarkers using a multiplexed immunoassay
      panel, the results of which will be compared with pre- and post-operative clinical findings
      and radiographic imaging. Plans do not currently include microarray analysis, but this may be
      later included.
