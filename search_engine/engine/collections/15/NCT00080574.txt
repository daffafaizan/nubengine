      resulting in augmentation or attenuation of the action of either compound. Phase I drug
      metabolism is mediated mostly by enzymes belonging to the cytochrome p450 superfamily.
      Studies in animals and cell cultures have shown that thyroid hormones play an important role
      in the constitutive expression of the p450 enzymes, thus potentially altering the metabolism
      and the effects of a variety of drugs. P-glycoprotein is expressed in the major organs
      associated with drug absorption, distribution, and elimination from the body (e.g. intestine,
      kidney, liver, skin, and the blood-brain barrier). Expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein in
      humans also appears to be influenced by thyroid hormones. We intend to study the effect of
      thyroid hormones on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein by
      using a five-drug cocktail (caffeine, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam, and
      fexofenadine) administered in patients with thyroid cancer, both on thyroid hormone
      suppression therapy (in conditions of subclinical hyperthyroidism) and off this treatment (in
      conditions of hypothyroidism) at the time of their routine radioactive iodine scan.
      Additionally we will perform two skin biopsies in order to assess the pattern of expression
      of metabolic enzymes and drug transport proteins on and off thyroid hormone suppression
      therapy.
