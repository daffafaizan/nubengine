      standard local protocols. However for AFCD group, the sheaths were removed 2 hours after PCI
      instead of conventional 6 hours. To standardize compression times, AFCD were applied to
      patient and complete femoral artery compression were applied for 5 minutes, followed by a
      gradual release of pressure till distal pulse is palpated. Each patient received a minimum of
      13 minutes of compression, with further compression applied only if full hemostasis had not
      been achieved at that point with maximum of 30 minutes.
