      cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) with pentoxifylline - an inhibitor of cytokine production. The 6
      month mortality, the proportion of transplanted patients, the occurrence of complications
      (bacterial infection, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding),
      plasma cytokine levels and fibrotest - a marker of fibrosis - will be also studied. This is a
      multicenter double blind randomized trial with a placebo.

      All adult patients with severe cirrhosis might be randomized after written consent. Patients
      with severe carcinoma, intolerance or contraindication to pentoxifylline will not be
      included. Patients receive either pentoxifylline or placebo 3 times a day for 6 months. Three
      hundred and forty two patients are necessary to decrease mortality rate by 50% at 2 months in
      a beta risk of 10% and an alpha risk of 5%. Patients will be seen every month.
