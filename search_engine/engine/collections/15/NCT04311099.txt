      standardized protocols of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) have significantly improved
      patient outcomes and LOS. Better pain management has the potential to further improve these
      outcomes. Since the introduction of ultrasound-guided abdominal wall blocks, much research
      has been done in that field, but no consensus has been reached concerning the optimal block
      technique; where to and when to inject the block, or which drug to use. Newly published
      randomized controlled trials show interesting results regarding the L-TAP which has several
      advantages to the US-TAP, including the ease of performance, less dependency on specialized
      skills or equipment and avoidance of intraperitoneal infiltration. but these results need to
      be solidified with multicentre trials. Besides optimizing postoperative pain management,
      better block techniques could potentially decrease LOS in patients after minimally invasive
      colorectal surgery.
