      group of 50 knees (approximately 50 subjects) will have a surgical method that uses
      mechanical alignment (alignment based on how the leg and knee joint move) to determine the
      proper position of the knee replacement device. The other group of 50 knees (approximately 50
      subjects) will have a surgical method that uses anatomical alignment (alignment based on how
      the anatomy/structure of the leg and knee joint) determine the proper position of the knee
      replacement device. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Clinical and
      functional tests will be conducted pre-operatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12
      months to determine overall knee function. In addition, a CT scan will be completed
      pre-operatively and at 6 weeks to assess changes in alignment.
