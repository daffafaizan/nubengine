      prescription. The justification of this study's scientific merit comes from the lack of
      literature and the need for research in this area. There have been multiple studies that have
      shown different exercise modality treatments for common musculoskeletal (MSK) complaints
      significantly improve both disability and overall quality of life. Despite the evidence of
      the short and long term effectiveness of exercise based therapies, there is a general lack of
      confidence of residents in prescribing and teaching patients rehab exercises.Additionally,
      many of the patients seen in the University of Florida (UF) Family medicine residency program
      cannot afford or do not have time to attend physical therapist led rehab sessions. This makes
      physician led education and the ability of prescribing exercise based treatments for
      musculoskeletal (MSK) complaints a very important component of patient care.
