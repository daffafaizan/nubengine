      prevent knot slippage.

      One common problem that arises from use of these materials is the discomfort caused by the
      knot pricking through the skin. Although this is a common problem after cesarean section, it
      is often overlooked and only very few preventive techniques have been described.

      This study is to assess the efficacy of burying knots beneath the rectus sheath during
      cesarean sections in reducing post operative pain and discomfort.

      Type of Study : A randomized controlled clinical trial. Study Setting :this study will be
      conducted at the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Ain-Shams University Maternity
      hospital.

      fulfilling the inclusion criteria, attending to Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital,
