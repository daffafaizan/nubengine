      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of rituximab, when administered with standard prednisone
           treatment, in maintaining a platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm³ at 6 months without further
           therapies (e.g., splenectomy or other salvage therapies) in patients with immune
           thrombocytopenic purpura.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess efficacy of this regimen in preventing spontaneous bleeding events in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral prednisone once daily on days
      1-14 followed by a taper to day 56. Treatment is administered in the absence of disease
      relapse or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
