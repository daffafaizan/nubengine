      to manage stress in the workplace and to increase the effectiveness of the intervention will
      use an APP and a Conversational Agent (CA) an Artificial Intelligence (AI).

      The purpose of the smartphone Application (APP) and CA will be to help people identify their
      thoughts, help them understand their emotions and the events that generated them.

      The data collected and analyzed will be integrated into artificial intelligence to improve
      understanding of what people are writing.

      Based on these analyses, it will be possible to identify the many different variables that
      interact in cases where a subject shows signs of stress related to adapting to change in the
      work environment and possible resilience factors that contribute to decreasing the state of
      stress.

      Tests will be administered at the beginning, at the end of the meetings, and 3 months after
      the end of the sessions. Subjects will be divided into various groups to understand whether
      APP and CA have a significant impact in increasing psychological well-being and stress coping
      strategies.
