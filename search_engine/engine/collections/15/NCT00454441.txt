        1. To determine the effect of MF101 (a combination of Chinese herbs) compared to placebo on
           change in sleep quality utilizing baseline and follow-up actigraphy obtained from a
           subset of approximately 90 women enrolled in the randomized, double-blind,
           placebo-controlled Chinese Herbs for Menopausal Symptoms (CHIMES) trial.

        2. TO identify the correlates of sleep quality as assessed by actigraphy in women with
           frequent hot flashes. We will evaluate demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, medical
           and gynecologic history and hormonal factors that may relate to the actigraphic measures
           of sleep quality, including self-reported measures of sleep.
