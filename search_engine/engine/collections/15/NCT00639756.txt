      containing 200 g fructose) for 2 weeks. Half will receive allopurinol mg/day (randomized). At
      the end of 2 weeks we measure a variety of parameters including fasting glucose and insulin
      levels (with calculation of HOMA index), serum lipids (including triglycerides and LDL/HDL
      cholesterol), sitting blood pressure, serum uric acid, weight, and various other measurements
      (C reactive protein, adiponectin and leptin levels, and urate redox products). Primary
      endpoint is insulin resistance. Secondary endpoints are blood pressure, lipids, uric acid,
      weight.
