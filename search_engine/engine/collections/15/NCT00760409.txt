      has been treated changes in appearance. These changes in appearance can make it hard to
      determine if a brain tumor has come back at the same site or if it is radiation injury. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if certain MRI imaging sequences (pictures) are more
      helpful to the physicians in determining if the tumor has come back or if it is radiation
      injury.
