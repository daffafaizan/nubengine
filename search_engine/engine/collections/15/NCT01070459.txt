      capacity. The etiologies of which are assigned to physiologic changes in paretic muscle, gait
      deficits and disability-related deconditioning. This declares that stroke patients live an
      inactive lifestyle and therefore stay cardiovascular risk patients.

      The usefulness of aerobic training on aerobic capacity is recently been proved in clinical
      stroke research. However, no study can shown the long-term effect of aerobic exercises. Also
      the effect of aerobic exercises on daily functioning, fatigue and depression in stroke needs
      to be established.
