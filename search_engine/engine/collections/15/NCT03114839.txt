      upper gastrointestinal microbiota profiles in healthy male subjects before and after
      consumption of a probiotic drink containing LcS.

      This study is explorative in nature. This pilot-study is used to explore trends in microbiota
      profile shifts in the small intestine. In addition, the investigators would like to explore
      whether these microbial shifts are similar to those observed in fecal samples. Information
      derived from this pilot-study can be used to design future intervention studies focusing on
      either the effect of probiotics on microbial shifts in the small or large intestine.
