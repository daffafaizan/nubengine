    
      PRO 140, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for treatment
      experienced adult HIV-1 patients infected with CCR5-tropic virus. These patients must
      demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy and have
      documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one ART drug within three drug
      classes (or within two or more drug classes with limited treatment option). The options may
      be limited as a result of drug antiviral class cross-resistance, documented treatment
      intolerance, documented objective assessments such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (e.g.
      high creatinine at baseline, limiting treatment options due to potential for toxicity), past
      adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions or neuropsychiatric issues that could
      limit use of currently approved drugs. Study population includes treatment-experienced
      HIV-infected patients with CCR5-tropic virus who demonstrates evidence of HIV-1 replication
      despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to
      ART drugs within three drug classes (or within two drug classes with limited treatment
      option). The primary objectives of the trial are to assess the efficacy, clinical safety and
      tolerability parameters of PRO 140 in combination with failing ART during the initial
      one-week treatment period, and in combination with Optimized Background Therapy during the
      subsequent 24-week treatment period.
