    
      In this study, the investigators seek to investigate biological aspects in patients receiving
      targeted treatment for rare subtypes of cancer of the Gastrointestinal.

      The targeted treatment will be given as per standard of care. Translational blood samples
      will be drawn pre-treatment, before the third cycle of chemotherapy, and hereafter
      corresponding to the planned imaging during treatment and follow up.

      The total cell free DNA will be quantified in all samples. The samples will be analyzed for
      tumor specific mutations such as the KRAS, BRAF, and NRAS oncogenes, by ddPCR. Circulating
      tumor DNA will also be identified by hypermethylation markers, and a focused panel of next
      generation sequencing can be applied. The samples will also be analyzed for immune-related
      biomarkers.

      The investigators expect to include up to 130 patients.

      This is a purely observational translational study. Results will be analysed in relation to
      outcome data.
