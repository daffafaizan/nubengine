      patients with suboptimal stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal
      cancer treated with a 24 hour vs 96 hour infusion of paclitaxel (TAX) followed by cisplatin.
      II. Determine the incidence and severity of adverse events, including catheter complications
      and drug toxicity, for the 96 hour infusion of TAX. III. Compare the relationship between
      plasma TAX concentrations, toxicity, and response to both infusion schedules in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized into one of
      two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously over 24 hours followed
      by cisplatin IV over 2 hours. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously over 96
      hours followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 324 patients will be accrued for this study over 4.5 years.
