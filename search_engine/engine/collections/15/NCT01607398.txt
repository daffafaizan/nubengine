    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm, parallel-group,
      12-week-treatment study in Japanese patients with COPD.

      At Visit 1, patients confirmed to be fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and not meeting
      any of the exclusion criteria will start the 4-week run-in period. During the entire study
      period, including the run-in period, the only drug allowed to use in addition to the study
      drug will be oxitropium (short-acting anticholinergic drug) as relief medication. At the end
      of the run-in period (Visit 2), subjects eligible for randomisation will be evenly randomised
      to one of the following two treatment groups and start the 12-week treatment period.

        -  ADOAIRÂ®250 one inhalation twice daily from the DISKUS inhaler

        -  Placebo one inhalation twice daily from the DISKUS inhaler

      Study completers will be defined as subjects who have completed all examinations,
      assessments, and study procedures in the study period, including the run-in period and the
      follow-up period. At completion/discontinuation of the treatment period, subjects will be
      switched to appropriate COPD treatment at the discretion of the investigator (or
      subinvestigator).
