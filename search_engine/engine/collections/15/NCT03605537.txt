    
      Objective: To determine the utility of mometasone eluting stents in the treatment of choanal
      atresia.

      Setting: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Division of Pediatric
      Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery

      Study Design: Randomized, single blind control trial

      Methods: This study will be a randomized, prospective single-blinded control trial. Inclusion
      criteria will include all subjects less than 11 years of age who are diagnosed with either
      unilateral or bilateral choanal atresia. Following enrollment, the patients will be
      randomized to either a control arm (no stent) versus an intervention arm (placement of drug
      eluting stent). Subjects will then undergo surgical repair of the choanal atresia with either
      no stent or a drug eluting stent placed. Multiple postoperative nasal endoscopies will be
      performed to assess size which will be reviewed and graded by two independent reviewers.

      Analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis and multivariate analysis will be performed.
