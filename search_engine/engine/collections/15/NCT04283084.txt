      For this independence, it is necessary to have adequate balance and coordination. Without
      adequate balance and coordination, it is not possible to walk neither even to stand. Movement
      is the basic living unit of an organism. Balance and coordination are of great importance for
      smooth, fluid and convenient action. In the clinical settings individuals are given exercises
      in different ways to increase their balance and coordination to protect them from injuries
      and to gain their independence. Nowadays, in order to adapt to the future, technological
      devices that can analyze and improve balance and coordination are being developed. The
      adequacy of the devices or systems developed for this purpose is also discussed. Most of the
      systems available on market only provide balance training by moving the floor, while others
      aim to contribute to balance by stimulating joint proprioception with a vibrating ground.
      This project aims to develop equipments that will provide balance and coordination trainings
      to guide the user through visual, auditory and mechanical feedback, develop a software which
      will record, analyze and evaluate the trainings given while ensuring that this equipment
      works systematically, carry out clinical studies to investigate the effectiveness of this
      developed system in healthy people.
