      the physical, psychological and social well-being, of obese patients who have sought weight
      loss treatment. To do so, it will implement a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) with
      motivational enhancement strategies specifically designed to target weight maintenance. It is
      hypothesized that the maintenance-oriented CBT approach will result in sustained weight loss,
      as well as improved physical, psychological and social well-being.
