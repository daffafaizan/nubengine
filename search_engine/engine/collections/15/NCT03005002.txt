      I. Establish the safety of durvalumab and tremelimumab following radioembolization with
      selective internal radiation (SIR)-Spheres in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS)
      metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver.

      II. Determine the hepatic response rate of SIR-Spheres followed by durvalumab and
      tremelimumab in patients with MSS metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the overall
      treated population.

      II. Describe the overall response rate of the treated population. III. Describe the
      extra-hepatic response in the treated population (abscopal responses).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe intra-tumor immune alterations following SIR-Spheres, and following durvalumab
      plus tremelimumab in comparison to baseline through serial hepatic metastases biopsies.

      II. Describe the immune alterations in the blood following SIR-Spheres and following
      durvalumab plus tremelimumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and tremelimumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at week 17, patients receive
      durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 9 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
