    
      Epidural anesthesia will be performed at L2 level and sitting position in all patients.
      Patients will be measured and recorded for optic nerve sheath diameter at 15 min (T2), 30 min
      (T3) and 60 min (T4) immediately after epidural anesthesia (T0) and after epidural
      anesthesia.. Measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter will be done with the help of a
      linear probe without applying high pressure to the eyeball while the patient is in supine
      position and the eyelids are closed. The optic nerve sheath diameter will be measured 3 mm
      beyond the optical disc. The measurements shall be applied in both transverse and sagittal
      planes for both eyes and the arithmetic mean of the four measured values.
