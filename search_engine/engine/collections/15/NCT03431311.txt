      options will be offered the treatment. These patients have a poor prognosis, and there is a
      strong need for improved therapy.

      The patients will be given adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with Radium-1 TCR+ T cells transiently
      redirected against the TGFÎ²RII frameshift antigen which is expressed in MSI+ colon cancer.
      The first report on TCR therapy in colon cancer was targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
      where some evidence of clinical response was seen, but the T-cell function may have been
      inhibited due to the necessity to resolve the severe colitis which occurred due to the
      presence of CEA in normal cells in the colon. This demonstrates the feasibility of T-cell
      therapy in metastatic colon cancer, but also the limitations of targeting CEA as an antigen.
