      personalized Neurofeedback Training device ADHD@Home versus Methylphenidate in the treatment
      of children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

      Furthermore, it is aimed to learn more about the mechanisms underlying NeuroFeedback.

      The study is prospective, multicentric (9 centres), randomised, reference drug-controlled.

      ADHD@Home is a neuromarkerTM-based personalized medicine device to treat children suffering
      from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD) with Neurofeedback Training (NFT) based
      on real time electroencephalography (EEG) signal.

      Neurofeedback Training is based on direct training of brain function, by which the brain
      learns to function more efficiently. For each session of the ADHD@Home solution, the child is
      trained to modulate his brain activity in a serious game, which is a real-time metaphor of
      the EEG biomarker that needs to be 'normalized', following a typical operant learning
      process.
