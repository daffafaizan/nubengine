      evidence is scarce. The trial will in a randomized fashion evaluate the study hypothesis at
      an organizational level and not confined to specific diagnosis. The hypothesis to be tested
      is to confirm or reject the equal effectiveness of an Observational unit compared to a
      traditional ward for organizing in-hospital care.There are established eligibility and
      exclusion criteria based on clinical experience. Endpoint is length of stay and readmission
      within 30 days. In addition the study will give information on the use of diagnostic and
      treatment resources used and collect some basic demographic variables.
