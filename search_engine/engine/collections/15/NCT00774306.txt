      other blood components which could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, however,
      more research is needed. Individuals with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage traditionally are
      treated with seizure medicines, but it is not clear which one is best, or if any such
      medication is necessary at all.

      This study is intended to find out if certain seizure medications raise levels of cholesterol
      and other blood components which could lead to an increased risk of heart attacks and
      strokes.

      In this study, 200 people with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage will be randomized to treatment
      with one of three different seizure medicines-phenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam-or to
      receive no seizure medication at all. In each participant, cholesterol and other blood
      markers that relate to heart attack and stroke risk will be measured shortly after hospital
      admission and again 8 weeks later. At the 8-week point most participants will have their
      seizure medication discontinued, and the same blood tests will be repeated.

      Information from this study could lead to changes in how seizure medications are prescribed
      both in the subarachnoid hemorrhage population and in other people who are prone to seizures.
