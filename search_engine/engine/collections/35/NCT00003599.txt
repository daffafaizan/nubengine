      isotretinoin decreases the incidence of Grade II and higher toxicity of isotretinoin when
      administered to former and current smokers. II. Determine the compliance rate of isotretinoin
      of smoker and former smokers with or without AT over a six month period. III. Determine the
      feasibility of recruiting former and current smokers with or without AT over a six month
      period. IV. Determine the effect of isotretinoin administration on serum retinol and
      retinol-binding protein levels in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified by smoking
      status (current smoker vs former smoker) and age (less than 50 vs 50 and over). Patients are
      randomized to be take alpha-tocopherol (AT) orally and isotretinoin orally daily (arm I) or
      isotretinoin orally plus AT placebo orally daily (arm II). Treatment in each arm continues
      for 6 months. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 7 months from start of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 300 patients (150 per arm) accrued into this study over an
      estimated 9 months.
