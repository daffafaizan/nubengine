    
      This is an open label, multicenter, phase I study of adoptive immunotherapy with enriched and
      expanded autologous natural killer (NK) cells for patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) in complete hematologic remission (CHR) but with persistent/recurrent minimal
      residual disease (MRD) â‰¥60 years or not eligible for other post-CHR treatment modalities.

      The study will investigate the safety and tolerability of a new type of NK-based
      immunotherapy based on the infusion of escalating doses of ex-vivo expanded autologous NK
      cells in Ph+ ALL patients. A maximum of 6 patients will be enrolled in two different steps.
      No conditioning therapies will be administered before the infusion of the expanded NK cells.
      Patients may receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) maintenance.
