      during sleep, resulting in substantially reduced (hypopnea) or complete cessation (apnea) of
      airflow despite ongoing breathing efforts. OSA has long been recognized as a heterogeneous
      disorder with potentially multiple contributing pathophysiological causes but with
      significant impact to perioperative morbidity. Various OSA phenotypes exist but, the
      predominant feature is a narrow and collapsible upper airway anatomy and is an interplay
      between pharyngeal soft tissue, genioglossus muscle tone and the bony anatomy and accounts
      for up to two-thirds of the variation in the AHI. Identification of moderate-severe OSA is
      crucial to prevent potential life-threatening cardiopulmonary complications
      perioperatively.(1) However, a large proportion of patients with OSA remain undiagnosed at
      the time of surgery.(2) Current screening tools are mainly questionnaire based and are
      largely sensitive but not specific (3) resulting in many false positives, unnecessary
      increased resource utilization, cost burden, and legal implications. Gold standard laboratory
      polysomnography(PSG) study is expensive and not widely available. Point-of-care ultrasound
      (POCUS) is a readily available, portable, noninvasive tool that has been used for airway
      evaluation and may be useful for OSA screening.(4-8) Study investigators want to evaluate the
      various POCUS measures of OSA in the perioperative population and correlate these
      measurements with the PSG based severity of OSA (based on apnea-hypopnea index -AHI) to find
      out the best measure or a combination of measures to diagnose the incidence and severity of
      OSA.
