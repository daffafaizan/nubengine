      care settings who are suspected to have KS on clinical grounds and for whom skin punch biopsy
      and histopathological examination is indicated as part of standard of care. Patients will be
      evaluated with both the gold standard for diagnosis of KS (skin punch biopsy followed by
      histopathology) and portable confocal microscopy.
