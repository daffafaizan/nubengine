    
      In this non-dispensing trial, each participant wore 4 pairs of color contact lenses (gray,
      blue, green, hazel) sequentially for less than 10 minutes each in a contralateral fashion
      (test lens in one eye, control lens in the other eye). Randomization took place for each of
      the 4 pairs of lenses as to which eye (left or right) wore the test and which wore the
      control. Participants were selected based on eye color (dark vs light/medium). The primary
      analysis population (AP1) was pre-specified as participants of any eye color who habitually
      wore FRESHLOOKÂ® COLORBLENDS lenses in one of the four colors tested in this trial. Pair 1
      lenses were dispensed per the participant's habitual lens color.
