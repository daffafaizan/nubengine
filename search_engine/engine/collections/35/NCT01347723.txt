      I. To record the types of patients that we treat, along with the reported efficacy and
      potential toxicity associated with scrambler therapy.

      II. To get experience with patient reported outcome measurement tools that we use in this
      trial, including a report of analgesic use.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo scrambler therapy for 30 minutes daily for up to 10 consecutive
      days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed up for 10 weeks.

      III. To explore neurologic testing changes in patients receiving scrambler therapy.
