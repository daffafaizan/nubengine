      most of the cases.

      The use of an endophenotype characterized in a family presenting numerous bipolar sufferers
      enable to reflect the expression of simpler genetic variants than those involved in the
      disease, and might enable the identification of genes involved in the etiopathogenesis of
      this endophenotype.
