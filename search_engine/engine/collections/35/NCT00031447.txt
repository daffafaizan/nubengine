      births in the United States. This study will be a placebo-controlled Phase III evaluation of
      suppressive therapy with oral Acyclovir suspension following neonatal HSV infections limited
      to the skin, eyes, and mouth (SEM). This study will evaluate the efficacy of long-term
      suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir in infants with SEM disease. It will determine if
      suppressive oral acyclovir therapy improves neurological outcome in infants following SEM
      disease. Only infants with SEM disease will qualify for this study. After qualifying for the
      study and obtaining informed consent, the infant will complete 14 days of intravenous (IV)
      Acyclovir (20 mg/kg/dose given every 8 hours). Patients will be randomized to receive
      suppressive oral Acyclovir versus placebo only if they continue to meet all study inclusion
      criteria at the completion of the IV therapy. This study will be double-blinded and placebo
      controlled. At the time of randomization, the patient will be placed in 1 of 2 groups (oral
      suppressive Acyclovir versus placebo). If a patient in either group has a cutaneous HSV
      recurrence, open-label oral Acyclovir (80 mg/kg/day divided into 4 doses per day) will be
      provided for 5 days. During the time of administration of open-label oral Acyclovir, study
      drug will be withheld. All children will be followed at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of
      age. Physical examination, hearing assessment, and retinal examination will be performed at
      each follow up visit. Standardized neurologic evaluation will be performed at 12, 24, 36, 48,
      and 60 months of age.
