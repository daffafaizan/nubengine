      image-guided localization system to aid with drill positioning for screws during
      intramedullary nailing distal interlocking. It is hypothesized that this system will aid in
      identification of the distal holes leading to reduced exposure to radiation. The SURESHOT
      System provides information to the surgeon that is used to place surgical instruments
      utilizing electromagnetic tracking data obtained intraoperatively. It is indicated for long
      bone fractures treated with intramedullary nailing in which the use of stereotactic surgery
      may be appropriate. The hypothesis is that using the TRIGEN SURESHOT™ Distal Targeting System
      will allow accurate distal locking while effectively decreasing the amount of radiation
      exposure compared to the standard instrumentation process.
