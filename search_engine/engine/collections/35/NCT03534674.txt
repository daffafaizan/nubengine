    
      This is a randomized non-blinded single centre prospective clinical trial designed to
      validate whether a single oral loading dose of 100,000 IU vitamin D3 prior to allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) can achieve optimal 25 hydroxy-vitamin
      D3(25-OH-D3) levels (>75nmol/L) at one month post aHSCT, and maintain adequate levels for at
      least three months, compared to our standard practice of 2000 IU vitamin D3 daily.

      84 patients will be enrolled. Following completion of all baseline data collection,
      participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or the control group on the
      admission day for aHSCT

      Patients in the intervention group will receive a single oral loading dose of 100,000 IU
      vitamin D3, with subsequent vitamin D3 2000 IU daily. Patients assigned to the control group
      will receive our current standard of care, 2000 IU vitamin D3 daily.
