      organized through the computer. The hCG group- will be triggered for final follicular
      maturation with high dose hCG (500 mcg)-38 hours prior to oocyte aspiration, and the Double
      trigger Group- will receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (Decapeptyl 0.2mg)
      40 hours prior to oocyte aspiration and hCG (250mcg) 34 hours prior to the oocyte aspiration.
      All patients will be supplemented with the same progesterone preparation( Crinone gel 8% once
      a day) for luteal support. Women that suffer from vaginal spotting or vaginal bleeding during
      the luteal phase will receive supplementation of Geston 50MG intramuscular once every 2 days.

      At the day of oocyte aspiration, blood will be drawn for serum LH, FSH, estrogen (E2) and
      progesterone. Moreover, clear follicular fluid will be collected and tested for LH, FSH, E2
      and progesterone levels.
