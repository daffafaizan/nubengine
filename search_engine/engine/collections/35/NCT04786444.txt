      investigating three Lots of VLA1553. Overall, approximately 393 healthy subjects aged 18 to
      45 years will be enrolled into the study, approximately 131 subjects per VLA1553 Lot.
      Subjects will be block-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into the three study arms to receive one
      of three Lots of VLA1553 as a single i.m. vaccination. The primary objective is to
      demonstrate Lot-to-Lot manufacturing consistency of VLA1553 28 days following vaccination.
