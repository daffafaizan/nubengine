      contralesional homologs of Broca's area.

      In the present randomized controlled trial, investigators will perform fNIRS prior to rTMS
      treatment to select the stimulation method. Stimulation site (perilesional or contralesional)
      and frequency (excitatory high or inhibitory low) will be determined by activation pattern
      from the fNIRS with language task in individual patients.

      The patient who shows a dominant neural activity at perilesional Broca's area on fNIRS
      scanning will be randomly allocated into two groups: high frequency stimulation group and
      sham stimulation group. If a patient shows a dominant neural activity at contralesional
      homologs of Broca's area on fNIRS scanning, the patient will be allocated to a low frequency
      stimulation group.
