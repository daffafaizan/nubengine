      Phase. The Pretreatment Phase lasted no longer than 28 days. Informed consent was obtained
      and protocol eligibility and disease characteristics were established prior to treatment. The
      Treatment Phase consisted of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. The Treatment Period
      of the Treatment Phase began at the time that the first participant began study drug
      administration and ended at the time when all participants enrolled completed 8 cycles of
      treatment or discontinued study treatment prior to the eighth cycle (ie, time of data cutoff
      for the primary study analysis [Primary Completion Date]). All participants then entered the
      Extension Phase. The Extension Phase consisted of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period.
      The Extension Phase began immediately after the Treatment Phase ended and included all
      participants that were either still receiving treatment or in follow-up. The time of data
      cutoff for the primary study analysis occurred when all subjects in the study completed 8
      cycles of treatment or discontinued study treatment prior to the eighth cycle.
