      the time of PCNL will: 1. decrease blood loss and related complications, and 2. decrease
      infection-related complications by providing the ability to an accurate collection of urine
      for culture and initiating appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to definitive stone
      management. In addition, we seek to determine whether renal puncture under fluoroscopic vs
      ultrasonic guidance is associated with less blood loss. Although retrospective studies have
      shown some benefit to placing the nephrostomy tube prior to surgery in terms of decreased
      blood loss, there are no well-designed, prospective studies comparing the two treatment
      approaches. We seek to determine which treatment approach is safer, more efficacious, and
      more cost-effective through a prospective, randomized trial.
