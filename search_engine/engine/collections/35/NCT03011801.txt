      the development of later child psychopathology. Accumulating evidence from naturalistic
      observational studies documents that fetal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is
      associated with risk for later child mental health problems. Maternal depression is one of
      the most common prenatal complications with approximately 40% of women experiencing elevated
      levels of depressive symptoms. The majority of past research has been correlational, so
      potential causal conclusions have been limited. This project will break new ground by testing
      the hypothesis that manipulating maternal depressive symptoms will benefit infant outcomes.
      In this project, maternal depressive symptoms will be reduced using brief interpersonal
      therapy (IPT), a well-established and efficacious treatment, and testing whether this
      reduction leads to an improvement in the development of infant mechanisms associated with
      risk for later psychopathology. The investigators propose to assess 300 pregnant women who
      report elevated levels of depressive symptoms and their infants. Prior to the intervention,
      maternal measures of depressive symptoms will be collected. Then half of the women will be
      randomized to receive IPT and the other half will receive enhanced usual care (TAU). After
      completion of the intervention, maternal measures will be collected longitudinally through 14
      months postpartum. Infants will be evaluated at birth and two other times. Infants will be
      assessed across four units of analysis (brain structure and function, physiology, behavior,
      and maternal-report).
