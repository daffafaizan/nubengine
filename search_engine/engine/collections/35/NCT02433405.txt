      Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology whose age and sex were matched.

      According to study design, subjects were divided into three groups based on their periodontal
      parameters. Patients suffering from chronic periodontitis formed the group 1 (n: 20),
      patients with plaque induced gingivitis formed the group 2 (n:20) and periodontal healthy
      patients were inserted in group 3 (n:20).

      After gently drying the area, GCF was sampled with filter paper using the intracrevicular
      method (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, New York, USA).Two milliliters (ml) of
      peripheral blood was collected from each individual with sterile syringe from the antecubital
      fossa by venipuncture, and to separate serum component sample centrifuged at 3000g for 5 min,
      and immediately stored at -40°C until assayed.

      The quantity of Fetuin-A and SAA protein concentration in the samples were analyzed by
      sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures using commercially available
      kits.

      The Spearman's rank correlation test was used to detect the relationship between GCF and
      serum SAA and Fetuin-A with GI and CAL. All tests were performed using statistical software
      (SPSS Inc., version 22.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The mean ± standard deviation with mean rank
      values were calculated for each parameter, based on the patients as the statistical unit. P <
      0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
