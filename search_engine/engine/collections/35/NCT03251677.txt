    
      A prospective randomized open-label study was conducted. Women >18 years of age undergoing
      TLH because of benign indications were recruited. Patients were randomized for either TLH
      (Group I, 40 cases) or minilap hysterectomy (Group II, 40 cases) through 4-5cm abdominal
      Pfannenstiel incision.

      Inclusion criteria were mobile uterus with benign lesion and with a size up to 12 weeks
      gestation. Exclusion criteria adopted were patients with enlarged uterus < 12 weeks,
      suspected malignancy and large adnexal masses (>5cm). Peri-operative outcomes were compared.

      Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients and the Departmental Ethical
      Committee approved the study. Patients from OB/GYN Mansoura University Hospital were
      enrolled. All the operations were performed by at least one of the consultants included as
      authors in this study.
