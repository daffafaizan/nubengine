      situation as traumatic and stressful. Long term consequences such as fatigue, anxiety,
      depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress are reported among 30-50 percent of the
      caregivers of critically ill patients. The need for supportive interventions is called for.

      The overall goal of this project is to improve the support for caregivers of intensive care
      patients. A systematic intervention for individual support of caregivers, The Caregiver
      Pathway Intervention, has been developed with a multidisciplinary approach, based on existing
      evidence, through interviews with former caregivers, workshops with health care personnel and
      user input and testing. The intervention consist of mapping of caregivers' prioritized
      symptoms, needs and preferences with a digital assessment tool, followed by a meeting with a
      nurse to address these issues, a structured conversation at discharge, and an invitation to a
      follow-up conversation 4-6 weeks after discharge/patients death.

      The aim of the project is to test the efficacy of The Caregiver Pathway Intervention among
      caregivers at the ICU in a randomized controlled trial, using outcome measures such as
      symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety/depression, cost-utility measures and
      health-related quality of life. The participants will be randomly assigned to The Caregiver
      Pathway Intervention or the follow-up as usual group. Both groups will receive outcome
      measures at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months.
