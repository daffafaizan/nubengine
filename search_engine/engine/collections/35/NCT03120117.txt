      test, supine (lying down) versus standing cough test and sitting versus the standing cough
      test performed at a constant bladder volume; empty in the office and full in the operating
      room. Secondary objective is to test if the intra-operative standing cough test at fullness
      correlates with long term success of the sling surgery.
