      called an echocardiograph (echo) to analyze how muscles in the heart are functioning. This
      model incorporates how the heart muscle functions on a cellular level along with the overall
      functionality of the heart.

      We hypothesize that this model will measure the specific properties of the heart muscle that
      affect their ability to contract and relax. This study will determine whether these
      properties will be different in patients with DHF compared to healthy controls. We also
      propose that these abnormalities in the heart muscle will correlate with the patient's degree
      of heart failure and their prognosis when doctors evaluate using standard clinical tests.

      This study will be conducted at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). 40 subjects
      will be enrolled, 20 healthy controls with no history of heart disease and 20 subjects who
      have been diagnosed with diastolic heart failure. Healthy controls will be required to
      undergo 1 echocardiograph procedure at UNMC. Subjects diagnosed with DHF will be required to
      undergo 6 echocardiograph procedure over the course of 2 years.
