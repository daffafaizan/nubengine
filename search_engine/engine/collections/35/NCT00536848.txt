      also affected with a great burden of other infectious diseases. Relatively few patients have
      access to anti-retroviral treatment and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that causes
      their immune system to deteriorate. Prevention of infectious diseases among HIV patients is
      of great importance and makes the immune system deteriorate less rapidly. The track record
      for probiotics to prevent and alleviate infectious diarrhea is impressive. So, the use of
      probiotics among HIV patients is a logical step and could be an adjunctive tool for
      physicians to halt the decline of the CD4 count.

      Another important application for the use of probiotics is in the treatment of bacterial
      vaginosis (BV). BV is a vaginal infection, caused by a group of pathogens, which is extremely
      common, and estimated to occur in 50% of black African women. In the US, the prevalence is
      29%, which again is extremely high. This infection makes a woman more vulnerable to
      contracting sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Having BV is also a risk factor
      to transmit HIV to a partner or a newborn. Conventional antibiotic treatment of BV has a cure
      rate of 40% among black African women. A recent study shows that combining the probiotic
      strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 with an antibiotic has a
      cure rate of 88%.
