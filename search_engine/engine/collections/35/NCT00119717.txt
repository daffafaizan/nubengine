    
      The study is a prospective, controlled, randomized, single-blind, multi-center study of
      NeuroFlo treatment plus standard medical management versus standard medical management alone.
      Randomization will be 1:1 and stratified to ensure equivalent patient distribution between
      treatment and control for the following key parameters:

        1. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline (stratify <10, 11-18)

        2. Time from symptom onset (TFSO) to time of baseline NIHSS evaluation (stratify <5 hrs, or
           â‰¥5 hrs).
