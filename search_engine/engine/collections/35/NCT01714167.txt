      a life-long process of clinical support. However, even with rehabilitation therapy, 50% to
      95% of stroke survivors remain impaired. There is thus a great need for new therapeutic
      developments for patients with disability after stroke, which is largely unexplored.
      Regenerative cell-based therapies offer long-term hope for many patients with stroke, as stem
      cells might be possible for dead or injured neural cells to be replaced after acute stroke.
      In this study, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intracerebral
      transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic
      stroke. The neurological outcome will be determined after transplantation.
