      combination with cyclophosphamide, we propose a Phase II trial of 4 cycles of weekly nab
      paclitaxel combined with cyclophosphamide. The favorable toxicity profile for weekly nab
      paclitaxel, in addition to its demonstrated superiority over standard paclitaxel in
      early-stage breast cancer, makes it an ideal taxane to evaluate in this setting. In this
      study, nab paclitaxel will be administered once weekly, in combination with q3wk
      cyclophosphamide. By using this combination therapy method, the goal of this study is to
      maximize the opportunity to demonstrate improved tolerability of adjuvant nab paclitaxel
      using a weekly dosing schedule in combination with q3wk cyclophosphamide.

      In this study, patients who demonstrate FISH or IHC3+ HER2 positivity and adequate cardiac
      function will also receive treatment with trastuzumab in addition to the nab paclitaxel /
      cyclophosphamide combination therapy. Trastuzumab will be administered IV using an 8 mg/kg
      loading dose on Day 1 of the treatment period. If no toxicity occurs, subsequent doses of
      trastuzumab will be administered IV as a 6 mg/kg dose approximately every 21 days for a total
      of 52 weeks (thus, maintenance therapy with trastuzumab will continue after the 12-week
      period of combination therapy with nab paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide/trastuzumab has ended).
