      at risk for severe bacterial and fungal infections. These opportunistic infections can result
      in prolonged hospital stay, increases costs and greater mortality. Voriconazole has now been
      recommended as the first line agent for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Retrospective
      observational studies of voriconazole serum concentration suggest that serum concentration
      correlate with toxicity and clinical response. These observations were however made in small
      series of patients and data were collected retrospectively. These inherent methodological
      flaws make it impossible to draw definite conclusions about the effect of voriconazole serum
      level monitoring on the outcome of IA, and therefore considered insufficient proof to
      recommend voriconazole concentration determination in blood as standard of care. The impact
      that so called serum concentration guided dosing of voriconazole will have on treatment
      success can only be evaluated through a prospective randomized clinical trial.

      For this purpose, we designed a prospective stratified cluster randomized cross-over trial of
      therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with haematological disease who have developed IA.
      The order of periods (TDM or standard of care, each 12 months) will be randomized per centre.
      During the TDM episode, the voriconazole dosage will be adjusted to achieve trough blood
      concentrations in a predefined window of 2-5 mg/L. A sample size of n=192 is needed to detect
      a 20% absolute reduction in the number of treatment failures (40% to 20 %) compared to
      control.
