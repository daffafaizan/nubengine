      microvasculature function. Since the retinal vessels are not under direct sympathetic
      control, this vascular bed is an ideal location to examine local mechanisms of vascular
      regulation(i.e. metabolite/endothelial and myogenic). Based on previously published data on
      animal and human responses, the central purpose for the proposed research is to compare the
      retinal and brachial vasodilatation responses in healthy subjects using the Dynamic Vessel
      Analyzer (DVA). Our rationale for this proposal is to better understand retinal blood flow in
      healthy individuals, gain insight into vascular reactivity in different vascular beds, and
      lastly to establish standards and reproducibility of DVA Measurements.
