    
      BACKGROUND:

      The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is now identified as a marker of
      alveolar type I cell injury. RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that acts as
      a multiligand receptor and is involved in propagating inflammatory responses. While the
      precise function of RAGE remains unclear, the elevated levels of RAGE, and its soluble
      isoform sRAGE, correlate with severity of ALI/ARDS in human and animal studies, and RAGE
      levels could reflect impaired alveolar fluid clearance. Frequently, the biology of RAGE
      coincides with settings in which ligands of the receptor accumulate, especially in a
      proinflammatory environment. More work is needed for us to understand the mechanisms by which
      RAGE is regulated during ALI/ARDS, especially with regard to the expression of its soluble
      forms and the involvement of its potential ligands.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This observational prospective clinical study will describe and compare soluble forms (sRAGE,
      esRAGE) and ligands of RAGE (HMGB-1, S100A12, AGEs) levels in the alveolar edema fluid and in
      the plasma from ICU patients enrolled within the first 24 hours after onset of ALI/ARDS, and
      from patients under mechanical ventilation (control group).

      Edema fluid and plasma samples will be collected simultaneously on day 1, day 3 and day 6, in
      order to describe kinetics of evolution of soluble forms and ligands of RAGE levels.
      Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid samples will be collected in intubated patients only, and
      blood samples will be simultaneously gathered from indwelling arterial and central venous
      catheters. The concentrations of soluble forms (sRAGE, esRAGE) and ligands of RAGE (HMGB-1,
      S100A12, AGEs) will be measured in duplicate by ELISA.
