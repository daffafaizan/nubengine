      department of Prof. Michallet to assess the impact of prescribing ESAs (epoetin beta and
      darbepoetin) for these two distinct patient populations. A significant improvement in QOL
      during the six-month follow- up was observed in both groups. The effectiveness of the ESA on
      the red cell recovery and the reduction of red blood cell transfusions was established by
      comparing the evolution of Hb and transfusion needs of the population under ESA to a matched
      population. Moreover, no significant difference in the occurrence of thromboembolic events in
      survival and progression-free survival was observed between the ESA group and the control
      group.
