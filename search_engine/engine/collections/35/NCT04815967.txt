    
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of
      a single-dose of MYOBLOC over a 1-year duration in adult subjects with upper limb monoplegia
      or hemiplegia spasticity due to stroke or TBI, followed by an open-label extension safety
      study of multiple doses. The primary goal is to assess the efficacy of MYOBLOC versus placebo
      in the treatment of adult upper limb spasticity. The secondary goals are: to establish a safe
      and efficacious dose of MYOBLOC (administered intramuscularly as a single total dose, to
      assess the duration of therapeutic response of MYOBLOC after a single administration, and to
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of MYOBLOC after multiple administrations at
      13-week intervals over a minimum duration of 1 year.
