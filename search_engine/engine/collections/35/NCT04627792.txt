      completed the interview in Phase 1 and expressed interest in participating in an
      intervention. The investigators will use a switching replication design in which fifty
      guardians will be randomly assigned using a lottery to receive the intervention and fifty
      will be assigned to a group who will receive the intervention at a later time point.127 The
      latter group will serve as a control in the first part of the intervention plan, and the
      roles will be switched in the second part. The investigators will initially propose 4
      intervention sessions, each comprised of 2 meetings, lasting 1.5 hours each for 25 guardians.
      Two sessions will be conducted concurrently for Group 1 (n=50) followed by 2 sessions
      concurrently conducted for Group 2 (n=50). The program outcomes - guardian recognition and
      knowledge of CAMH problems, the perceived need for CAMH services, and willingness to use
      accessible CAMH services - will be measured with the same instruments administered in Aim 1
