      patients undergoing abdominal surgery in whom caloric targets cannot be met by enteral
      nutrition alone.

      This is a randomized and controlled trial comparing early initiation with late initiation of
      parenteral nutrition.

      Early-initiation group: patients will be randomized to initiate parenteral nutrition in the
      2nd day after surgery.

      Late-initiation group: patients will be randomized to initiate parenteral nutrition in the
      7th day after surgery.

      Calculations regarding the caloric goal included protein energy and were based on corrected
      ideal body weight, age and sex. When oral or enteral nutrition covered 80% of the calculated
      caloric goal, parenteral nutrition was reduced and progressively stopped.
