      blood flow using phase-contrast cine MRI, 2) intestinal motility (peristalsis) using dynamic
      cine MRI, and 3) bowel wall perfusion and molecular water diffusion. Precise objective
      measurements of diseased bowel blood flow (in ml/min) and bowel motility (in contractions per
      minute) are not currently used in the clinical care of CD patients, while diffusion-weighted
      imaging is typically used in a qualitative manner. None of these techniques have been
      evaluated for predicting eventual response to therapy or correlated with endoscopic mucosal
      healing in pediatric or adult CD.
