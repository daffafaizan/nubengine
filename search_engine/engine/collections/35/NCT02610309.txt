      with little or no intervention provided in the Emergency Department (ED), and disposition,
      usually to an inpatient psychiatry unit. The Family Based Crisis Intervention (FBCI) is an
      emergency psychiatry intervention designed to sufficiently stabilize suicidal adolescents
      within a single ED visit so that they may return home safely with their families. The
      intervention works intensively with both the adolescent and the family, so that the caregiver
      has the knowledge and skills to help the adolescent after discharge.

      In this study, suicidal adolescents (ages 13-18) and their families presenting for
      psychiatric evaluation to a large pediatric ED were randomized to receive FBCI or treatment
      as usual (TAU). Patients and caregivers completed self-report measures of suicidality, family
      empowerment, and satisfaction with care provided at pre-test, post-test, and 3 follow up
      time-points over a one-month period. Clinicians contacted the adolescent and caregiver at
      these timepoints to administer the questionnaires and assure safety planning was being
      carried out.
