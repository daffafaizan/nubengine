      future. The specific aims of this project are to investigate the effects of a 12-week
      programme with cardiorespiratory exercise and Chinese herbal medicine on recovering COVID-19
      patients and to collect qualitative and quantitative data to examine loneliness, anxiety,
      depression, quality of life, and mental health. A further aim will be to examine how Chinese
      herbal medicines, gut microbiome, and its metabolites regulate immune function, intestinal
      permeability, and possibly autoimmune deficiency (AID) in the pathological
      recovery/rehabilitation process.

      In this multicenter, triple-blinded, randomized, parallel groups, controlled clinical trial,
      we will recruit adult patients with COVID-19 who have been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis
      and have been discharged from the hospital in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland.

      A total of 172 eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into four groups:
      cardiorespiratory exercise plus Chinese herbal medicines group, cardiorespiratory exercise
      group, Chinese herbal medicines group and waiting list group for 12-week (3 months) with
      12-week follow-up period.

      A 4-week pilot study will be conducted to test patient recruitment and maintenance, data
      collection, instrumentation, and to observe the adaptability and practicality of the
      intervention.Amendments will be made if necessary.
