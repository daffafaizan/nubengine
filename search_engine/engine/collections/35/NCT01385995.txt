      glucose tolerance. This is a randomized, double-blind cross-over study of subjects with sleep
      apnea (apnea hypopnea index > 15) and impaired glucose tolerance. Subjects will be randomized
      to 8 weeks of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or sham-CPAP, followed by the
      alternate therapy after a one month wash-out. After each treatment, subjects will undergo
      2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing, polysomnography, actigraphy, and measurements of
      indices of glucose control. The investigators intend to analyze the changes in glucose
      metabolism and insulin sensitivity in patients with sleep apnea with CPAP intervention.
