      of 30 patients aged 40-70 will be included. Within 48 hours of the event, blood inflammatory
      biomarkers, and scalp hair sample for cortisol will be taken. All recruited patients will
      undergo full neurological examination and the severity of the stroke will be rated using
      NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale). 3 months and one year later neurological
      examination and rating of neurological disability will be determined using Rankin Scale.
