      versus tactile treatment (T) will be compared in an open, randomized, semi-cross-over
      case-control design study. The second phase includes the responders from the initial
      treatment (M or T), the duration of the initial treatment effect will be observed, and the
      effect of a second round of similar treatment will be registered.

      Phase one: The study patients will be randomized for M or T treatment. The main outcome
      variables will be gathered before the initial randomization and after an initial treatment
      period of three weeks. Non-responders (NR) will be allocated for an immediate second
      three-weeks treatment period of combined treatment (M+T); the responders (R) of the M, T and
      M+T enter the second phase of the study. The M+T non-responders discontinue the study.

      Phase two: The responders will be observed for a period of maximum three months. When
      symptoms of phantom limb pain and/or CRPS resume, the patients will undergo a second
      treatment period with the same treatment as during phase one. The duration of the second
      treatment period will be maximum three weeks, but each patient may decide to interrupt the
      treatment at an earlier stage if he finds the effect satisfactory. The main outcome
      indicators will be gathered at the start and the end of the second treatment period.

      The study closes at the end of the second treatment period. For both study phases the
      treatment effects will be compared between the strata and also inside each stratum, using
      each patient as his own control.
