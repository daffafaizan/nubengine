    
      HCC is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide.Selected patients with HCC are candidates
      for potentially curative therapy, such as hepatic resection and liver transplantation.
      Nevertheless,tumor recurrence is 70 % at 5 years after resection and 15-30 % after liver
      transplantation,leading to tumor-related death.MVI is currently one of the most critical
      factors predictive of HCC recurrence.There are no approved effective interventional measures
      to improve the outcome of this patients with MVI.The purpose of this study is to explore the
      validity and safety of sorafenib and TACE for MVI in HCC patients after radical resection.The
      candidates will be assigned to sorafenib group (about 30 cases),TACE group (about 30
      patients) and control group (about 30 cases)ï¼Œaccording to the willingness of the subject.All
      patients will be followed up for 3 years and Recurrence-free survival and overall survival
      will be recorded.
