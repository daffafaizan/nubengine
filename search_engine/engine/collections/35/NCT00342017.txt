      immune response to mycobacterial antigens or the clinical expression of tuberculosis, this
      study proposes to assess the skin test reactivity to tuberculin (PPD) in a community in which
      intestinal helminth infection, filarial infection and tuberculosis co-exist. Once baseline
      data are obtained, all those who are PPD negative (but who harbor helminth parasites) will be
      randomized to receive either anthelminthics or placebo twice over a six week period. One and
      4 months following the last dose, change in PPD status will be assessed as will the
      intestinal and filarial parasite burden. By assessing these changes, the influence of
      intestinal helminth or filarial infection on the cellular immune response to Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis can be determined.
