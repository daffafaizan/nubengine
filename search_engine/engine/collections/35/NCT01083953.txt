      reflexes have returned. However, the appropriate timing for removal remains controversial. A
      more frequent incidence of airway hyperreactivity and complications has been reported by some
      studies when the LMA was removed in the awake state versus the anesthetized state. Techniques
      that reduce the time from LMA removal to the return of protective airway reflexes would
      minimize the risk of aspiration, contamination, or airway obstruction.

      With increasingly common use of Supreme LMA in anaesthetic practice, a safe and suitable
      depth for removal of the Supreme LMA requires research.

      Thus the determination of the optimal end-tidal concentration of commonly used volatile
      agents ie. Sevoflurane and Desflurane for Supreme LMA removal requires research, both for
      patient safety and minimising anaesthetic costs in dealing with airway complications.
