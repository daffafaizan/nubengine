      Unfortunately, despite aggressive surgery, radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy, the
      prognosis for this disease is poor. It is our hypothesis that GBM is a "local" disease
      wherein treatment failure is due to failure to eradicate tumor cells in the pathways along
      which the tumor eventually spreads (the "border zone").

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment volume escalation will be successful at
      improving overall survival in patients with GBM when appropriate targeting and precision dose
      delivery is performed in a single treatment session. The 'border zone' of the tumor will be
      targeted for SRS (defined as a combination of the MRI volume of gadolinium enhancement plus
      up to 2 cm of the surrounding T2 volume). This represents the volume of tumor infiltrated
      white matter and is the route of GBM spread. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been used with safety and clinical success with
      concomitant chemotherapy in solid tumors, including GBM.

      The investigators further hypothesize that a combined approach of SRS with this VEGF
      inhibitor will be an effective strategy for GBM because bevacizumab will maximize the effects
      of radiation in the treated volume and potentially reduce radiation toxicity in the adjacent
      brain.
