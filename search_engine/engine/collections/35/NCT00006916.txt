        -  Determine the median survival time of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial
           glioblastoma multiforme treated with radiotherapy followed by sustained release
           intratumoral bleomycin.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Within 4 weeks after surgical resection, patients receive radiotherapy daily 5 days a week
      for 6 weeks.

      Within 2-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy or at disease progression during
      radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical implantation of a modified Ommaya reservoir within
      the central area of the tumor. Patients then receive sustained release bleomycin
      intratumorally via the reservoir once a week for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 months.
