      positive (or chromosome negative and Bcr/Abl positive) chronic phase chronic myelogenous
      leukemia who are refractory to or intolerant of interferon alfa. II. Provide expanded access
      of this treatment to these patients. III. Confirm the rate of complete and major cytogenetic
      response in patients treated with this regimen, as demonstrated by a decrease in the
      percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive cells in the bone marrow. IV. Evaluate the
      improvement of symptomatic parameters in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an expanded access, multicenter study. Patients receive oral STI571 daily.
      Treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who respond after 12 months may continue with therapy.
