      phone app and an actigraphy device with a connected scale. During the first segment, of one
      month's duration, subjects will use the app, actigraphy device, and scale. Next, over an
      interphase period of up to 6 weeks, subjects will only use the app. During this time, the app
      will be modified based on data collected during the first segment. Finally, during the second
      period, also of one month's duration, subjects will use the modified app, actigraphy device,
      and scale.
