      endoscopic and laparoscopic images, evaluated by a third-party. The study will include 25
      total consecutive cases of individuals undergoing a planned laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (GB). The GB procedure will be performed according to institutional standard-of-care
      and all subjects will undergo standard preoperative evaluation as well as post-operative
      care.
