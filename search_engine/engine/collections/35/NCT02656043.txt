    
      Phase 1/2 study enrolling up to 60 healthy volunteers followed by approximately 150 subjects
      with acne vulgaris. Data from Phase 1 stage will be reviewed before progressing to Phase 2.

      Phase 1 is an open label study to determine safety, tolerability of XPF-005 topical gel and
      exposure of XEN801 (active ingredient). Up to 5 cohorts of 12 healthy volunteers will each
      receive different dose volumes of XPF-005 gel or Placebo gel on their face and back for 14 or
      21 days. Safety assessments are completed and PK samples are collected at study visits.

      Phase 2 is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study to determine
      safety, tolerability, efficacy of XPF-005 topical gel and exposure of XEN801 (active
      ingredient). Approximately 150 subjects with acne vulgaris will apply XPF-005 or matching
      placebo gel on their face for 12 weeks. Safety and efficacy assessments are completed and PK
      samples are collected at study visits.

      Safety assessments include local skin tolerability assessments, vital signs, physical
      examination, 12-lead ECG, safety laboratory blood and urine and adverse event reporting.

      Efficacy assessments include acne lesion counts and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA).
