      a 14-day efavirenz intake preceding period in order to evaluate the risk of achieving sub
      therapeutic concentrations of TMC125 when switching straight from efavirenz containing
      regimens

      Safety and tolerability of medications will also be assessed by questions, physical
      examination and laboratory parameters. These will be performed at regular intervals during
      the drug study.
