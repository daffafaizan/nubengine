      determined by multiple factors, necessitating the use of numerous molecular biomarkers to
      precisely assess male reproductive potential. The study has reported that the lipids are
      special interest as fertility markers and therapeutic targets not only due to their functions
      in sperm, but also because they are sensitive to external and environmental signals.

      Sperm samples from infertile patients after IVF ( normal fertilization group, n=25; low
      fertilization group, n=25) were collected. Following standard density gradient separation
      operating procedure, the sample were incubated in 37°C, 5%CO2, for 3 hours. The sample
      included 10x10^6 spermatozoa after sample preparation and aliquots in 100 μL PBS were
      analyzed for lipid composition using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to
      mass spectrometry. Lipid compositions and levels were compared between the two groups. The
      results will describe the composition and contents of lipids linked to capacitation of sperm,
      opening a new possibilities for the development of male fertility diagnostic tools and
      culture media formulations to improve sperm quality and enhance fertilization result.
