      reduction in numerous cardiovascular disease risk factors. The cellular programs activated by
      caloric restriction are similarly turned on in preclinical studies in response to a 24-hour
      fast. We have found that a beneficial effect of 24-hour fasting is that it blunts the
      activation of a component of the immune system, termed the Nod-like receptor family protein 3
      (NLRP3) Inflammasome. This inflammasome, as a mediator of sterile inflammation, is associated
      with the development of diabetes and atherosclerosis. At the same time, we found that
      refeeding after the 24-hour fast significantly increased NLRP3 protein levels, IL-1Beta, and
      TNF signaling, and that fasting blunted the NLRP3 inflammasome response, in association with
      the activation of a fasting sensing protein called SIRT3. Interestingly, a recently
      discovered naturally occurring form of vitamin B3, called nicotinamide riboside (NR), has
      been found to activate SIRT3. We found that NR reproduces the NLRP3 inflammasome blunting
      effect of fasting when administered to primary human monocytes/macrophages in culture.
      Putting this together, it would be interesting to evaluate whether the administration of NR
      to human subjects would replicate the fasting blunting effect on the NLRP3 inflammasome.
      Interestingly, at the same time, it has recently been found, in a preclinical study, that the
      NLRP3 protein can orchestrate differentiation of naive T- cells into Th2 cells. We therefore
      propose to more broadly examine the effects of NR administration on myeloid and lymphoid cell
      biology in healthy volunteers.
