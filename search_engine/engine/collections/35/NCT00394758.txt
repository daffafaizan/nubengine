      intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is not well defined. Laser vaporization and ultrasonic
      surgical aspiration are both accepted surgical modalities used in the treatment of vulvar and
      vaginal dysplasias, however no prospective study has been done to compare the two procedures.
      The specific aims of this research study include:

        1. To compare the recurrence rate between the use of laser vaporization and ultrasonic
           surgical aspiration in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal dysplasias in a prospective,
           multi-institutional, randomized clinical trial.

        2. To compare healing related complications, post-operative pain, and scarring between the
           two procedures.
