      Cooperative Extension Master Gardener Program. A total of 46 older (≥65 years) cancer
      survivors recently diagnosed with a loco-regionally staged cancer with a good prognosis
      (i.e., ≥ 80% 5-year survival) and with 2 or more physical function limitations will be
      recruited from select rural and urban counties in Alabama and randomized to 1-of-2 study
      arms: 1) an intervention group that receives a 1-year mentored vegetable gardening
      intervention that pairs cancer survivors with certified Master Gardeners, or 2) a usual care
      control group that is observed during the year, but receives the gardening supplies at study
      completion. Aims of this study are to: 1) explore the feasibility and acceptability of a
      mentored vegetable gardening intervention by assessing accrual, retention, adherence,
      fidelity, and possible adverse events, 2) obtain means and precision estimates, and explore
      between-arm differences on pre-post changes in physical function and secondary endpoints
      (e.g., quality of life, fruit & vegetable intake, physical activity, etc.), and 3) to explore
      participant factors associated with program efficacy (e.g., gender, comorbidity).
