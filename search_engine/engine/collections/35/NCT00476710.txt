      as they solubilize dietary lipids and aid their absorption in the digestive tract. While for
      many years bile acids have been characterized by this digestive role, recent research
      indicates that bile acids play other important roles. Because bile acids have been shown to
      act in signaling pathways that affect metabolism, there has been renewed interest in
      investigations of their effects. This study explores potential differences in bile acid
      kinetics based on insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes at baseline.

      Colesevelam HCl is a bile acid sequestrant, which in addition to its primary role in lowering
      serum LDL-C levels, has secondarily been implicated in lowering blood glucose levels. This
      study explores the relationship between insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and changes in
      bile acid pool sizes and kinetics with colesevelam treatment. Isotopically labeled bile acids
      will be administered to subjects before and after treatment with colesevelam and comparisons
      will be made in bile acid pool size, fractional turnover rate, and synthesis rate in the
      three study groups.
