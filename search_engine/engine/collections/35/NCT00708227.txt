      clinical research study is being done to see if an asthmatic's gene make-up (DNA is made up
      of genes) affects the way they respond to a particular asthma medication called salmeterol.
      Certain genes make people tall or short. Certain genes give people brown or black hair.
      Similarly, certain genes may be associated with the way patients respond to asthma
      medications.

      Salmeterol xinafoate (a long acting bronchodilator) and fluticasone propionate (an inhaled
      corticosteroid) are the medicines contained in Advair Diskus. During this study, patients
      with asthma will receive fluticasone inhaler (called Flovent) and Advair Diskus. The
      investigators want to find out if patients with asthma with certain genes respond in
      different ways to the salmeterol in Advair Diskus. The investigators also want to find out if
      patients with asthma with certain genes who are treated with salmeterol for two weeks have
      their airways open up less than usual when they use albuterol.
