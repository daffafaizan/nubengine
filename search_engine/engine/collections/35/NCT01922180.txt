      defined as acute events characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms
      that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and which leads to a change in medication.
      Moreover, these episodes can be classified into mild, moderate, or severe exacerbations,
      following patient's need for medical environment. While the cause of about one-third of
      severe exacerbation episodes cannot be identified, two-thirds are associated with certain
      conditions such as respiratory tract infections (viral or bacterial), air pollution, as well
      as pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pleural
      effusion. As COPD exacerbations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as
      well as with increased healthcare costs, their prevention and treatment are two major
      objectives in COPD management with subsequent requirement for appropriate assessment tools.
      As imaging tool, chest radiography is limited to the detection of pneumonia and pleural
      abnormalities, and only leads to change in managements in a marginal proportion of patients.
      However, while Computed Tomography (CT) scans allows detecting more chest abnormalities, the
      knowledge of CT features at the time of exacerbation is a pre-requisite for determining
      possible role of CT in routine work-up of exacerbation. Nevertheless these features remain
      widely unknown, previous studies having focused on the prevalence of PE. The aim of our study
      was therefore to describe these features by comparing CT scans performed at severe
      exacerbation with control scans.
