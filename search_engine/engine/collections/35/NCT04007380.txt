      autonomic deficit, as well as secondary conditions including SRBDs. The SRBDs include
      central, obstructive and mixed sleep apnea that can occur in up to 50% of the paraplegics and
      up to 91% of the motor complete tetraplegics. Although the frequency of SRBDs after SCI is
      much greater than in able-bodied people, this condition is still a largely under-recognized
      in the SCI population.

      With this, the investigators hypothesize that regular use of CPAP for treatment of
      moderate-to-severe SRBDs in individuals living with SCI significantly improve their fatigue,
      depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive impairment, quality of life, and social and work
      participation. This research project will include: (i) a single-arm clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of nightly use of CPAP for 4 consecutive months in the management of
      moderate-to-severe SRBDs among 24 adults with subacute to chronic, cervical or thoracic,
      complete or incomplete SCI; and (ii) a qualitative study of the challenges experienced by the
      24 people with SCI who undergo an unattended-hospital or home-based sleep study for diagnosis
      of SRBDs followed by CPAP therapy.

      Overall, this clinical study has the potential to ultimately improve fatigue, mood,
      cognition, quality of life, and social and work participation of people living with SCI, by
      examining under-explored links with the SRBDs.
