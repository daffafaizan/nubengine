    
      Each subject will be given an ArivaÂ® Silver Wintergreen lozenge or a Placebo Wintergreen
      lozenge on a random basis.

      Once the lozenge has dissolved in the mouth, subjects will smoke one of their own cigarettes,
      and will answer questions about the experience and their craving for a cigarette.

      After a washout period, each subject will repeat the steps with the second type of lozenge.
