    
      There will be up to 3 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will include 12 subjects
      (9 receiving S-1226 and 3 receiving matching placebo). For each dose level, a sentinel group
      of 2 subjects will be dosed (1 subject with S-1226, 1 subject with placebo) 24 hours prior to
      dosing the rest of the study population.

      It may be necessary to repeat, or modify (decrease) a dose level, and thus an additional
      cohort of up to 12 subjects may be enrolled.
