      during atrial fibrillation indicated a mother reentrant circuit that could be terminated by a
      cavocaval isthmus ablation, thus preventing atrial fibrillation. The objectives of the
      present study were to evaluate the effectiveness of isthmus ablation in preventing atrial
      fibrillation and to identify predictors of its success.
