      breast cancers based on six prospective randomized trials with 20 years of follow-up data
      (Fisher). During lumpectomy, the surgeon removes the tumor and a surrounding rim of normal
      tissue (margin), leaving surgical clips to help designate the resection bed. Radiation
      treatment is directed at the whole breast for 5 1/2 weeks and is generally followed by a 1-2
      week boost directed at the lumpectomy site plus a margin of normal breast tissue. The benefit
      of adding the tumor bed boost, (TBB) has been shown in two studies to decrease local failures
      [Romestaig; Bartelink].

      Studies have evaluated the role of radiation following lumpectomy in very select groups which
      have not been able to define a group who do not benefit from the addition of radiotherapy. In
      the group of patients who received surgery alone, 85% of the breast recurrences occurred in
      the tumor bed. Due to these two facts, radiotherapy directed only at the tumor bed has been
      evaluated. Treating this smaller tumor volume has allowed higher doses of radiation to be
      delivered safely shortening the treatment course from 6-7 weeks to one week.
