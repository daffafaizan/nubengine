      and of high quality. However, over 50% of children admitted to hospital in France and Europe
      will receive an unlicensed or off-label medicine. This occurs for most drugs in children less
      than 6 years of age. They represent a particularly vulnerable subgroup of the paediatric
      population.

      There are major practical and ethical issues in relation to studying medicines in paediatric
      patients aged 5 years or less.

        -  They represent only a small part of the population as compared to older children and
           adults, and the variation of specific types of diseases in this young subpopulation is
           higher than in the paediatric counterpart. There are major differences in drug
           disposition in the different age groups.

        -  There is a need for suitable methodological approaches for clinical trials

        -  There are major ethical issues It is essential, therefore, to recruit children from
           various regions in France in order to obtain a critical sample size of sufficient
           magnitude and to conduct scientific sound studies. This will be achieved by performing
           Pharm A, a population pharmacokinetic study of three different anti infectious agents
           (ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, voriconazole) and identify covariates including
           pharmacogenetic biomarkers that explain pharmacokinetic variability.

      After parental informed consent, sampling strategy will be randomized depending on the drug
      and the age group (2 samples in patients below 2 years and 3 samples in patients from 2 to 5
      years).
