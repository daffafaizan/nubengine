      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of nivolumab and plinabulin.
      (Phase I)

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of treatment with nivolumab with the
      addition of plinabulin in the treatment of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer in the
      second line setting. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), duration of
      response (DOR) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with nivolumab in combination
      with plinabulin.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of plinabulin and nivolumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Patients who have a pre-treatment and/or post cycle one biopsy will have flow cytometry of
      their tissue to identify infiltration of immune cells, rates of expression of programmed cell
      death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death 2 (PD-2) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of plinabulin followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive plinabulin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
