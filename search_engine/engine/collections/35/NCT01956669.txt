      independent from one other. First, an initial 10 subjects were enrolled into each cohort. In
      the event of ≥ 1 response in any of these initial subjects, an additional 10 subjects may be
      enrolled in that cohort to proceed. In the event of ≥ 3 responses, the agent was considered
      effective. However after end of-stage 1, study enrollment stopped due to insufficient
      antitumor activity. Subjects who discontinued study treatment were followed for survival
      status. The study was to continue accruing data and thus, remained open for approximately 1
      year from Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV).
