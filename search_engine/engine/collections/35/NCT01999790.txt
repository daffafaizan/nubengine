    
      After a complete ophthalmic evaluation the recruited patients with inactive graves
      orbitopathy and upper eyelid retraction eligible for the study will be randomly separated in
      two groups.

      The evaluation also includes a face photography in primary position of gaze, a OSDI
      questionnaire, a quality of life questionnaire, schirmmer test, lissamine green evaluation
      and eyelid position measurements.

      In the first group the patients will be submitted to blepharotomy for surgical correction of
      their upper eyelid retraction.

      In the second group the patients will be submitted to a posterior mullerectomy and gradual
      recession of the elevator muscle aponeurosis for surgical correction of their upper eyelid
      retraction.

      The outcomes will be compared between the two groups after a 6 month followup.
