      is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it
      functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients take immunosuppression (anti-rejection)
      drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs are used to prevent
      the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney. All anti-rejection medications have
      unwanted side effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of slowly removing
      tacrolimus, a CNI.
