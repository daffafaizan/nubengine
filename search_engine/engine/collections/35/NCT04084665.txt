      incomplete response to current treatments. Existing immunological studies have found
      dysregulation in the TH17:Treg axis with an increase in inflammatory mediators including
      TNFalpha, IL-17 IL-23 (amongst others) in lesional skin. Multiple cell typesincluding CD4+
      cells, dendritic cells and macrophages infiltrate active lesions of HS and produce this major
      contribution from the Th17 axis.

      One of the main barriers to the development of novel and effective treatments for HS is the
      lack of biomarker(s) of disease activity, as well as our incomplete understanding of the
      pathogenesis of this disease. Markers such as C- Reactive Protein, IL-6, soluble IL-2
      receptor, S100A8/9, lipocalin-2 and the neutrophil/lymphocyte rati7 have been proposed as
      potential biomarkers but lack high specificity and correlation with disease severity. Given
      the pronounced contribution of Th17 pathway (including interleukin-23) in the inflammation in
      HS, further investigation into the role of this axis in the pathogenicity of HS is essential.
