      in older adults. Several factors that predispose falls, such as reduced balance, have been
      documented in people with respiratory disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs, which
      involve customized exercise prescription, are recommended to improve quality of life and
      disease management in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are
      many documented benefits to participation in such programs; however, the impact on balance
      and other falls risk factors has not previously been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to investigate the effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation program on balance and falls
      risk factors in individuals with respiratory disease. This study will enhance the current
      management of respiratory disease by improving our understanding of the effects of pulmonary
      rehabilitation.
