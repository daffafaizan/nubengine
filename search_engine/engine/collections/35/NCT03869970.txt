      determine the benefit of prescribed low-intensity physical activity, behavioral management,
      or both, versus standard rest in acute (24-48 hrs) (Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI)
      patients presenting to the pediatric Emergency Department (ED). Low-intensity physical
      activity (i.e.10,000 steps/day) will be prescribed and monitored in the first week
      post-injury with an actigraph (Fitbit®). Behavioral management will be prescribed using a
      phone app referred to as mHealth (mobile Health, specifically SuperBetter©) that promotes
      mental, physical, social, and emotional resilience. This randomized clinical trial will have
      four treatment groups: 1) activity, 2) mHealth, 3) activity+mHealth, 4) rest. The primary
      study outcomes will be symptoms and recovery by 14 days. All subjects will be assessed via
      phone at 3-5 days and in person at 14 days. The secondary outcomes will be to determine the
      influence of interventions on comprehensive aspects of physiologic recovery and
      patient-centered outcomes; including symptoms at 3 days, neurocognitive, vestibular/ocular
      motor impairment at 14 days, pediatric quality of life measures, time to symptom resolution,
      and return to normal activity via phone survey at 1 and 2 months. The investigators will
      assess symptom, quality of life, and recovery outcomes based on treatment group assignment
      for all subjects and high-risk subjects.
