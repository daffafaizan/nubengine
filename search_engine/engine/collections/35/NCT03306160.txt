      criteria: 1) ESRD treated with hemodialysis for more than 3 months prior to study enrollment;
      2) agree to participate the study and sign informed written consent; 3) available for
      long-term follow-up. The excluding criteria: 1)chronic atrial fibrillation or other cardiac
      arrhythmia; 2) nonfunctional arteriovenous fistula in the contralateral brachial area of the
      one used for dialysis; 3) myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and ischemic stroke during
      the previous month; 4) congestive heart failure class IV based on the New York Heart
      Association classification; 5) malignancy or any other condition with poor prognosis; 6)
      antihypertensive treatment during one month prior to enrollment. After enrollment, every
      patient will receive a question-based interview to obtain medical history and the following
      examinations and tests: anthropometric parameters measurement including body height, weight;
      biochemical tests including vein blood and urine. At the first-time dialysis after
      enrollment, patients will receive 48-hour central and brachial ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring using a well validated and commercial device Mobil-O-Graph (IEM, Germany).
      Brachial blood pressure are measured for each patient before every dialysis for at three
      month. Then one-year and three-year cardiovascular events and deaths will be followed-up. The
      primary outcome measures are as follows: deaths and cardiovascular events including nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or
      resuscitated cardiac arrest.
