      BECOME (Behavior of biomarkers (lipid profile and prolactin) during pregnancy and lactation
      through a biological multi-paradigm model), which already requested and obtained the
      Suitability dated April 28, 2015. Based on it, the development of the current project will be
      the historical memory of FPU Research Fellow (October 2016) The determination of the lipid
      profile in pregnancy is performed through blood tests in each of the quarters.

      A prospective cohort study will be conducted in women during pregnancy and lactation. From
      the first pregnancy visit until the child is six months old. Three prospectives (three annual
      series).

      At least 60 healthy pregnant women and 60 women with a history of risk (20 for each risk) x 2
      series (three years) will be tested, a total of 240-300 women to whom 5 analytical tests
      would have to be performed.

      The researchers will take samples from the breastfeeding workshop of the study groups: Group
      1 of healthy women and Group 2 of women with a history of risk (diabetes, overweight /
      obesity and hypertension) Once all the data have been analyzed, a biological predictive model
      will be developed to establish its relationship with maternal alterations during pregnancy,
      as well as its relationship with lactogenesis in the last days of pregnancy. To this end, a
      computer program will be created where the personal, clinical and triglyceride levels of the
      pregnant woman will be obtained the results of the risk of altered triglycerides in the
      different months of gestation and the measures to be taken as a function of The same, as well
      as to identify the levels of triglycerides in the different maternal pathologies.
