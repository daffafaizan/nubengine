    
      Primary Objective:

      - To assess whether use of preservative free artificial tears following radioactive iodine
      administration will lower the level of radioactive iodine in the tears of patients treated
      with radioactive iodine for thyroid carcinoma.

      Secondary Objective:

      - To evaluate whether artificial tears would be an effective preventative intervention to
      decrease the risk of developing nasolacrimal duct stenosis, which has been associated with
      radioactive iodine administration.
