      a provider-administered nasal swab samples. This was administered with infection control
      protocols utilizing full PPE protection for health providers who would don and doff gowns and
      gloves with each sample acquisition. With an aim to decrease PPE usage and increase
      efficiency, personal protective booths with HEPA-filtered air called "Hexapods" were
      employed, after infection control approval, within the MGH system beginning on April 16,
      2020.

      Ambulatory Care Management at MGH systematically monitors testing completed and PPE usage on
      a weekly basis. Managers in charge of personnel changes shared necessary team structures and
      median salaries for different personnel involved with sample acquisition. MGH Materials
      management were able to report on costs related to consumable supplies used during testing.

      In this investigation, this routinely collected data and averaged timed sample collection
      observations were used to compare before and after the Hexapod utilization.
