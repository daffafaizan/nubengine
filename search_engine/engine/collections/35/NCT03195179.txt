      suprapubic tube (SPT) placement (group 2). The comparison will be between two routinely
      practiced management approaches of urethral injury after pelvic fracture.

      Prior studies demonstrate urethral realignment is associated with a 15% to 50% reduction in
      urethral obstruction, however, it has also been associated with higher rates of incontinence
      and erectile dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that early realignment of traumatic urethral
      injuries after pelvic fracture lowers the incidence of complications like urethral strictures
      and subsequent need for surgeries.
