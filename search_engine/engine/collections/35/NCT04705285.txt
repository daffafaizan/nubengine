      controlled study that compared the effectivity of erbium:yag laser used vaginally versus
      pelvic floor training, coached by a physiotherapist expert in pelvic floor disorders.

      Patients are going to be randomized to pelvic floor exercises (10 sessions) or erbium:yag
      laser (2 sessions), and assess the results at 6 and 12 moths later on.
