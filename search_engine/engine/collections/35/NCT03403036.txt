      moderate-to-severe psoriasis in patients who have previously failed treatment with
      interleukin (IL)-17A therapies. Failure of IL-17A therapy will be defined as previous
      treatment with either secukinumab or ixekizumab for at least 3 months without achieving
      PASI-75 response or a 50% loss of original improvement. Forty patients will be enrolled in
      this 16-week open-label study. Patients will be enrolled at three to four different sites in
      the US. After enrollment, study visits will occur at monthly intervals, with patients
      receiving 210 mg of brodalumab subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, and 2, followed by 210
      mg every 2 weeks. At each visit, patients will be evaluated for change in sPGA (Physician's
      Global Assessment), PASI score, and any signs or symptoms of adverse events. Laboratory
      screening will include tests for tuberculosis and neutropenia. After completion of the
      16-week trial, patients may desire to continue treatment with brodalumab. Efforts will be
      made to provide drug to these study patients, including those who do not have insurance.
