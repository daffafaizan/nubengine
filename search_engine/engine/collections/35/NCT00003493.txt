      with doxorubicin HCl liposome, vincristine, and dexamethasone. II. Define the qualitative and
      quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into newly diagnosed (group A) and previously treated (group
      B) patients. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 2.5 hours, followed by
      vincristine by bolus IV over 5 minutes on day 1. Dexamethasone is administered orally or by
      IV on days 1-4. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses, and 2 courses
      after maximum response unless unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression occur.
      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 33 patients from group A and 34 patients from group B will be
      accrued for this study within 6-14 months.
