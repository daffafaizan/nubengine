      offered participation in an observational, prospective open label trial. Study duration will
      be 6 months.

      Evidence of GSM symptoms will be evaluated by a board certified gynecologist. Upon satisfying
      the prescreen requirements, the patient's information will be forwarded to the
      sub-investigator, who will confirm study eligibility and make the final determination
      verifying the diagnosis of GSM. Participants will be using commercially available Replens
      applied via prefilled applicator into the vagina and coconut oil applied at the vaginal
      introitus and vulva. Both are to be administered by the patient 2 times per week, interval
      between dosing to be approximately 2 days. Patients will be encouraged to apply Preseed,
      coconut oil, or patient's personal lubricant of choice into the vagina prior to sexual
      activity. Patients will record dosing on the Intake Diary. Outcome measures will include:

      Quality of Life DIVA (Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging) questionnaire will be administered
      at Baseline, at month 1, 3 and month 6. The FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index) questionnaire
      will also be used for sexually active patients at the same time points. This is an
      exploratory investigation. A planned paired T test will be applied to analyze the outcome and
      regroup after data has been collected on the first 14 patients.
