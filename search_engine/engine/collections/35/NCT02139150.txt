      protocols that are evaluating treatment response in solid or hematologic malignancies. The
      aim of this protocol is to determine if PET imaging with the proliferation marker 18FFLT can
      monitor changes in FLT uptake parameters, in particular changes in the standardized uptake
      value (SUV), within tumor target lesions.
