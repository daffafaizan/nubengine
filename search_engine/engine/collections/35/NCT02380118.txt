        1. Investigate intramuscular use of sedative drugs within a predominantly Chinese
           population, to address this void in international literature impacting the management of
           acute agitation.

           The multi-centre RCT will determine the safety and efficacy of intramuscular olanzapine,
           in comparison with conventional medicines (haloperidol or midazolam) in a three-arm
           comparison for the sedation of acutely agitated patients in emergency department.
           Specifically, we aim to determine if administration of intramuscular olanzapine (a)is
           more effective than sedation with intramuscular haloperidol or intramuscular midazolam
           alone; (b)is safer than sedation with comparison arms; (c)decreases the amount of
           subsequent redosing or alternative drugs required; (d)is more favourable than the
           haloperidol and midazolam arms with respect to safety, efficacy and adverse events.

        2. Investigate potential variables leading to emergency attendance and/or admission
           requiring parenteral sedation. These may include patient demographics and regular
           medications and adherence.
