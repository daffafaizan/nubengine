      hepatitis B with poor response to other drugs in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      GSK548470 administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily. The target sample size is set at 32
      subjects. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily
      treatment with GSK548470 300 mg in subjects with compensated chronic hepatitis B with poor
      response to other drugs. The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and
      safety of once-daily treatment with GSK548470 300 mg.To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      GSK548470 in the study, subjects receiving a combination of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir
      pivoxil (ADV) will be switched to a combination of LAM and GSK548470, while subjects on
      entecavir hydrate (ETV) with or without ADV will be switched to a combination of ETV and
      GSK548470.
