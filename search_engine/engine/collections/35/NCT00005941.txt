      Primary

        -  Determine the partial or complete response in patients with recurrent metastatic or
           locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical or vaginal carcinoma
           treated with a nonmyeloablative regimen comprising fludarabine and low-dose total body
           irradiation followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation,
           cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and donor lymphocyte infusion.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this regimen induces engraftment and donor chimerism in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the HPV-E6 and HPV-E7 specific T-cell responses in selected patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive conditioning therapy comprising fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2 and low-dose
      total body irradiation on day 0. Filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cells are infused on day 0.

      Patients also receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 35 and then tapered until
      day 56. Mycophenolate mofetil is administered orally twice daily on days 0-27.

      Patients with disease progression and no graft-versus-host disease on day 56 receive
      nonmobilized donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) over 30 minutes on day 65. DLI may be repeated
      every 65 days for up to 4 doses.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, monthly for 6 months, every 6 months for 2 years,
      and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
