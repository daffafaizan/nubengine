      transpulmonary pressure may better direct and optimize mechanical ventilation. Thus, instead
      of limiting mechanical ventilation by plateau pressure, PEEP and Inspiratory pressure
      adjustment would be individualized specifically for each patient's lung compliance as
      indicated by transpulmonary pressure.

      The main goal of this approach is to specifically target transpulmonary pressure instead of
      plateau pressure, and therefore achieve the best Lung compliance with the least
      transpulmonary pressure possible.
