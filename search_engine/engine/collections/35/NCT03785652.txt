      days) and a double-blind treatment period (6 weeks). The first period is the screening and
      washing period, the longest is 14 days and the shortest is 8 days (recommended 8 days), in
      which the enrolled MDD subjects will start a one-week placebo wash period and receive
      prescribed a placebo, 2 pills once a day for 7 consecutive days. The second period was a
      double-blind treatment period of 6 weeks. After the placebo washout period, 260 enrolled
      subjects were randomized into one of 5 study groups in the 1:1:1:1:1 ratio, 4 LY03005
      Extended-release Tablets treatment groups with different dose or 1 placebo group. Subjects
      were given investigatory drug or placebo according to the protocol, 4 pills once a day and
      followed up at the end of 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks.

      Effectiveness of the investigational drug was evaluated using 17 Hamilton Depression Scale
      (HAM-D17), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA),
      Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and Visual Analog Scale-Pain intensity (VAS-PI)
      scores. Safety of the treatment was evaluated by adverse events, vital signs, laboratory
      measurements (blood routine, urine routine, blood biochemistry and serology), 12-lead ECG,
      physical examination, the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) and the Columbia-Suicide
      Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) scores.
