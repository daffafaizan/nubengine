    
      Specific Aim I: Compare the efficacy and effectiveness of 4 financial incentive structures
      for improving "quit rates" (rates of prolonged smoking abstinence for 6 months): (a)
      individual financial rewards, (b) individual deposit contracts, (c) cooperative rewards, and
      (d) competitive deposit contracts

      H1: Compared with usual care, all 4 incentive structures will increase quit rates
      significantly.

      H2: Compared with individual financial rewards of equivalent size and schedule, individual
      deposit contracts, cooperative rewards, and competitive contracts will each increase quit
      rates significantly.

      H3: Group-oriented structures will increase quit rates significantly more than
      individual-oriented structures.

      Specific Aim II: Compare smokers' acceptance of these 4 financial incentive structures for
      smoking cessation

      H4: Uptake rates of reward-based structures will be higher than of structures involving
      deposit contracts.

      H5: Uptake rates of group-oriented structures will be higher than of individual-oriented
      structures.

      Specific Aim III: Identify individual characteristics that modify incentive structures'
      efficacy and acceptance

      H6: Incentives will promote relatively greater quit rates among participants with fewer
      substitute reinforcers.

      H7: Incentives will promote relatively greater quit rates among participants with lower
      incomes.

      H8: Higher-income persons will be relatively more likely to accept incentives requiring
      deposit contracts.
