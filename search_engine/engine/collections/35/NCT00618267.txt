    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of various therapies
      (immunomodulatory as well as immunosuppressive) on ATP levels in CD4+ cells and to determine
      whether the "ImmuKnowÂ®" assay is an appropriate screening tool to assess the immunocompetence
      of potential Tysabri patients.

      Secondary objective is to correlate the expression of ATP in CD4+ cells with CD4+ cell count.

      Tertiary objective is to examine the level of regulatory T-cells (CD4+ and CD25+) in MS
      patients and its possible correlation to the therapy used, and how well a recently proposed
      marker of regulatory T-cells, LAP, correlates with CD25 marker.
