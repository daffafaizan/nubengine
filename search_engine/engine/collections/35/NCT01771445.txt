    
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over, proof-of-concept study.

      The study will consist of one screening visit followed by 3 study visits. During the first
      two study visits, the subjects (20 apparently healthy, lean men) will perform a submaximal
      exercise bout on a treadmill for 60 minutes. Subjects will be randomly assigned into two
      groups consisting each of 10 subjects receiving study medication in a double-blinded, crossed
      over manner.
