      with an injured and dysfunctional diaphragm have greater difficulty weaning from mechanical
      ventilation post-transplant - they become too weak to breathe. However, little is known about
      the pre-transplant predictive factors associated with diaphragm dysfunction . We have
      developed a new technique employing beside ultrasound to measure diaphragm thickness. This
      allows us to observe changes in diaphragm muscle structure and function.

      The goal of the study is to determine whether pre-transplant diaphragm thickness and function
      are associated with diaphragmatic dysfunction after lung transplantation. This will help us
      to confirm the best way to avoid diaphragm injury and to understanding the meaning of
      diaphragm ultrasound images.
