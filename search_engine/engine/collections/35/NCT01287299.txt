      After determining usual dietary intakes, visceral fat thickness, and the metabolic response
      to a 100g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 20 weeks gestation, 45 of the women will be
      randomly assigned to a low glycemic load (GL) diet and 65 women to a regular low fat diet
      (current standard care). They will follow their assigned diet for the last 20 weeks of
      gestation. A dietitian will advise the women and will monitor them throughout the study. At
      28 and 34 weeks gestation, the women will come to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC)
      at San Francisco General Hospital in the fasting state and the hormonal and metabolic
      response will be measured to another 100g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and total body
      fat will be measured. Additional measurements include: 1) longitudinal measurements of
      maternal visceral fat thickness and fetal size and adiposity at 20 and 34 weeks gestation by
      ultrasound, 2) collection of cord blood and placental tissue, and 3) measurement of neonatal
      body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and anthropometry at 2-3 weeks of age.
      Birth outcome data for mother and infant will be collected. To determine the metabolic
      response to the study diet, 25 women from each of the two diet groups will be assigned to a
      metabolic subsample for measuring rates of hepatic glucose production and lipolysis at 34
      weeks.
