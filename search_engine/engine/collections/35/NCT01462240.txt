    
      Survival and outcome data on the NexGen LPS-Flex Porous Femoral Components will be done by an
      analysis of standard scoring system, radiographs and adverse event records. Survivorship will
      be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events, serious adverse
      events, adverse device effects, serious adverse device effects, and unanticipated adverse
      device effects. Outcomes will be measured by comparing the overall pain and function
      performances (based on the Knee Society Scoring System), survivorship, subject quality of
      life and radiographic parameters of study subjects receiving the LPS-Flex Porous Femoral
      Components.
