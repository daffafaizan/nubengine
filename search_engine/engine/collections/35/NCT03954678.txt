      number of health conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke, insulin
      sensitivity, osteoporosis, and depression. Regretfully, despite the evidence supporting the
      benefits of physical activity, greater than half of adults in the United States do not get
      adequate activity and approximately one quarter do not get any activity. As such, many
      people, especially the elderly and those with comorbid diseases, have low levels of physical
      fitness. Additionally, up to 45% of community dwelling older adults are malnourished.
      Patients undergoing surgery with poor exercise tolerance and suboptimal nutritional status
      may be at an increased risk of perioperative complications. Thus, increasing physical
      activity and dietary intake quality prior to surgery is recommended, to hopefully decrease
      these risks. The primary objective is to determine if recommended physical activity or
      dietary intake results in an increase in patient physical function performance and if so, to
      what extent. The secondary goal is to examine if increased exercise or nutrition reduces
      perioperative complications.
