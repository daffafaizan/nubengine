      performance and facilitate or inhibit muscle activity in rehabilitation. A study reported
      that KT application did not change electrical activity in the early period (immediately after
      KT, 5th and 10 minutes after KT). However, another study showed that EMG activity increased
      24 hours after KT application. A study revealed that the KT produced more EMG activity
      compare to placebo taping. In conclusion, the effect of KT on electrical muscular activity
      was arguable in the literature.
