    
      All females ages 18-55 presenting to the UMMC Emergency Department or Urgent Care whose
      provider suspects sexually transmitted infection will be offered study enrollment and be
      randomly assigned to either the control or the experimental group. Both groups will have a
      urinalysis, a pregnancy test, a pelvic exam, and an endocervical sample collected, but the
      experimental group's urine will be used to run the rapid turnaround test (RTAT) instead of
      the standard PCR. Data will be collected regarding provider decision making, length of stay
      in the emergency department, patient satisfaction, clinician satisfaction, further healthcare
      sought by patient, and cost surrounding each treatment.
