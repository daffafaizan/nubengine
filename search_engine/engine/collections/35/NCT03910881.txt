      (PSS) as a tool for self-management of pediatric CF. The PSS includes two components: 1)
      patient-facing: an app with customizable dashboards for tracking patient-generated outcome
      measures and providing personally relevant decision-making support; and 2) clinic-based:
      clinical patient management and technical support. Using a one-group pretest-posttest design,
      we will evaluate the effect of the adapted technology-assisted PSS on patient-reported
      outcomes (PROs). Study hypothesis: Among pediatric CF patients treated at the UAB CF Center,
      the use of technology-aided PSS over 6 months will improve health-related quality of life
      (primary outcome) as well as patient satisfaction, patient activation, and shared
      decision-making (secondary outcomes).
