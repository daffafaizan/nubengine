      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (remission rate) in patients with relapsed or refractory
           B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with bendamustine and mitoxantrone
           hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bendamustine IV over 1 hour on days1-3 and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV
      over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease
      (i.e., complete response or partial response) after 2 courses receive 2 additional courses of
      treatment for a total of 4 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
