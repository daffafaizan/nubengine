    
      The primary purpose of this study is:

        -  to determine if 8 weeks of topical remetinostat gel applied 3 times daily (TID) under
           occlusion will suppress SCC growth

        -  to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of SCCs after 8 weeks of treatment with
           topical remetinostat gel 1%, as measured by at least 30% decrease in greatest area (in
           mm2).

             -  Subjects with at least 1 biopsy-proven cutaneous SCC will be recruited for this
                study.

             -  Subjects will apply remetinostat gel 1% to at least 1 SCC.

             -  Non-invasive cutaneous SCC lesions, including Bowen's disease, are also eligible
                for this study

             -  There is 1 treatment option: Topical remetinostat gel 1% applied 3 times daily.

             -  The study is a single arm, open label design

             -  For purposes of ClinicalTrials.gov, there is no secondary outcome.
