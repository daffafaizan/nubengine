      have been shown to be effective in ameliorating the effects of pulmonary hypertension in
      patients with PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), including inhaled iloprost. However,
      these therapies have not been used extensively in patients with IPF who have pulmonary
      hypertension as a complication. The potential benefits of treatment of pulmonary hypertension
      complicating IPF include: improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics, with reduction in pulmonary
      artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increase in cardiac output.
