      between the ages of 6-17yrs, inclusive will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive
      ganaxolone or placebo treatment for 6 weeks, discontinue treatment and washout for 2 weeks,
      and then cross over to the opposite treatment for another 6 weeks. The primary aim of the
      study is to assess efficacy of ganaxolone treatment compared to placebo on clinical behaviors
      such as anxiety and attention as measured by Clinician's Global Impression-Improvement
      (CGI-I). The key secondary efficacy measure is the Pediatric Anxiety Scale (PARS). Other
      secondary efficacy measures include the visual analog scale (VAS), Anxiety, Depression,
      Attention, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV Questionnaire (SNAP-IV), and
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist- Community Edition (ABC-C). Tolerability and safety will be
      monitored by routine vital signs, physical/neurological exams, ECGs, clinical laboratory and
      adverse event assessments.
