      replacement surgery, and the risk factors for this problematic outcome have been identified.
      Proposed is the development and preliminary efficacy testing of a novel computer-assisted
      cognitive behavioral intervention integrating opioid taper delivered in the four weeks prior
      to surgery to address these risk factors, with the expectation that both the severity of
      post-operative pain and the subsequent incidence of chronic post-surgical pain will be
      reduced. In that chronic post-surgical pain brings with it diminished functionality and
      quality of life, ongoing opioid use, and direct patient costs, it is it is critical that
      interventions aimed at mitigating its development are implemented and evaluated in the
      clinical setting.

      In a sample of adult men and women with chronic pain, on opioid therapy and undergoing a
      planned TKA, the objectives of this randomized clinical trial are to:

        1. Add a motivational interviewing component to a validated computer-assisted CBT
           intervention for chronic pain (PAINTrainer) to encourage opioid tapering in the 4 weeks
           prior to surgery.

        2. Describe the efficacy of the 4-week targeted pre-operative CBT intervention in 75 TKA
           patients to decrease preoperative chronic pain severity, preoperative opioid
           consumption, and symptoms of depression, anxiety and pain catastrophizing prior to
           surgery in comparison to 75 TKA patients randomized to treatment-as-usual.

        3. Describe the effects of a 4-week targeted pre-operative CBT intervention in 75 TKA
           patients on 48hr post-operative pain severity, and 3- and 6-month rates of CPSP in
           comparison to 75 TKA patients randomized to treatment-as-usual.
