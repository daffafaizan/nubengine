    
      Participants aged 16 or older from 14 different countries (Japan, USA, Argentina, Brazil,
      Chile, Mexico, Peru, Taiwan, Thai, South Korea, Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain)
      received a single session of biofield therapy (Okada Purifying Therapy) lasting 30 minutes or
      longer from the volunteer practitioners in their country of residence. Before and after the
      intervention, they reported each severity level of physical pain, anxiety/depression,
      dizziness/palpitation, and overall symptoms. The team compared the improvement/exacerbation
      rate of a single session of biofield therapy between the countries, and examined the adjusted
      odds ratio of the variables associated with the changes in each category of symptoms in a
      real-world setting.
