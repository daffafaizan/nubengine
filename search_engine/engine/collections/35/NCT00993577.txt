      exercises (SS) in the treatment of women with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

      Methods: A total of 24 subjects with TMD were randomized into two treatment groups: GPR,
      where therapy involved muscle global chain stretching, or SS, with conventional static
      stretching. Eight treatment sessions lasting 40 minutes each (weekly) were performed.
      Assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment end, and again two months
      later. Measurements included pain intensity at the temporomandibular joint, headache,
      cervicalgia (visual analogue scale - VAS) and teeth clenching. Additionally,
      electromyographic activity and pain thresholds were measured at the masseter, anterior
      temporalis, sternocleidomastoid, and upper trapezius muscles. Two-way analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc test was used for in-between group comparisons. Significance
      level was 0.05.
