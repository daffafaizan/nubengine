      stomach or the use of certain painkillers (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs).
      However, there has been an increasing trend of peptic ulcer disease with unknown cause
      (idiopathic ulcer) worldwide since the last decade. Studies in North America found that
      idiopathic ulcers accounted for 11% and 44% of all peptic ulcers. A meta-analysis of 7 US
      trials found that 20% of patients with H. pylori-associated ulcers had recurrent ulcers
      within 6 months, despite successful cure of H. pylori infection and no reported use of
      NSAIDs. In a pooled analysis of 6 clinical trials with a total of 2900 patients, 27% of
      duodenal ulcers were not associated with NSAID use or H. pylori infection. The emerging
      problem of H. pylori-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers is not only limited to western
      countries. Previously, H. pylori-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers accounted for less than 5%
      of peptic ulcers in Asia. A recent Korean study reported that the proportion of peptic ulcers
      not associated with H. pylori infection or NSAID use was over 20%.
