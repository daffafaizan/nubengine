      clinically node-negative women with T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, who underwent
      breast-conserving surgery (BCT) with whole breast irradiation (WBRT), had excellent local
      control and survival with SLND alone, even if metastases were found in 1 or 2 SLNs. Recently,
      the long-term follow-up data of the Z0011 study were reported, which demonstrated that the
      10-year OS for patients receiving SLND alone was not inferior to that for those receiving
      ALND.

      This breakthrough result of the Z0011 study led to a change in clinical practice regarding
      the standard management of axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer.

      However, these validation data have been generated in Western populations. As the
      socio-economic profile, life style and culture of Asian are substantially different from
      those of Western, and genetic backgrounds vary to some extent, it remains unclear whether
      results similar to those of the Z0011 study could be achieved in a Chinese breast cancer
      population. In the present study, we prospectively applied the Z0011 eligibility criteria to
      Chinese patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer undergoing BCT, with planned RT.
      The purpose of this study is the clinicopathological relevance of the Z0011 findings for
      Chinese patients with breast cancer, and to verify the feasibility of using the Z0011
      criteria to avoid ALND after positive SLN findings.

      This is a prospective single-arm study, enrolled patients meeting Z0011 inclusion criteria
      and providing consent to receive no additional ALND. Overall survival is the primary end
      point, disease-free survival and occurrence of surgical morbidities a secondary end point.
