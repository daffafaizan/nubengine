      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced urothelial cancer
           treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride with vs without oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerance of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 120 minutes on days 1, 8, and
           15.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
           oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on days 2 and 16.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
