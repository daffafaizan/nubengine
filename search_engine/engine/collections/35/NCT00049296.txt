        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when administered with thalidomide in
           patients with advanced solid tumors, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and safety profile of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response and prolonged freedom from progression in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide twice daily and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once weekly.
      Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and thalidomide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 1 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
