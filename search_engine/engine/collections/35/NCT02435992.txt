      patients will be entered into the trial in 3 separate cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 for
      adults, Cohort 3 for adolescents). Patients from Cohort 1, 2, and 3 in clinical response at
      the end of the IP will proceed through to the Maintenance Period (MP). Patients from Cohort
      1, 2, and 3 who participate in this trial may also qualify to participate in an optional
      Open-Label Extension (OLE) trial.
