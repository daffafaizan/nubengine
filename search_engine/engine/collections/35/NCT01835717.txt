    
      The purpose of Study 45-65 is to assess if:

        -  Endogenous factors (clinical history, risk factors, genetic factors APOE4, etcâ€¦),
           exogenous (socio-demographic, ambient and lifestyle variables) and cognitive reserve
           (including bilingualism) influence cognitive performance.

        -  New and/or updated tests translated and validated in Spanish and Catalan when needed,
           will provide accurate and sensitive measurements of the variability of cognitive
           performance in this target population, representative of the preclinical phase of
           Alzheimer's disease.

      An optional visit is offered to study participants that includes: cerebral magnetic
      resonance, vascular ultrasound and olfactory testing.
