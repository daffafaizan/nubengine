      NET genotype groups for rs11648486 SNP (CC 61%; CT 33%; TT 4%) (e.g., C/C and C/T) will be
      compared to one another in a 2 (NET Genotype: C/C vs. C/T & T/T) x 2 (Medication: atomoxetine
      80 mg/day (~ vs. placebo) x 3 (Drink: Drink 1, 2, and 3) mixed factorial repeated measures
      design using PROC MIXED in SAS by calculating difference scores. Of interest are the possible
      interactions of the NET SNPs and atomoxetine on cue-elicited craving and the rewarding
      effects of alcohol across trials.
