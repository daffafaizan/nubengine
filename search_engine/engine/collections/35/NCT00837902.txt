      in response to β-blockade. The rationale for the study is as follows: Beta-blockers prevent
      the activation of β-ARs and thus form the cornerstone of treatment of pathological states
      such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Functional polymorphisms in
      cardiac beta-receptors have been shown to determine response to β-blocker therapy. A
      physiologic stimulus such as exercise causes sympathetic stimulation and activation of the
      cardiac β-ARs and genotypic differences in response to β-blockers are magnified under states
      of heightened sympathetic activity. Thus, in addition to measuring the response to β-blockers
      at rest, we will also determine the response to β-blockade after sub-maximal exercise on a
      supine bicycle ergometer. Genetic variations that may alter sensitivity to a beta blocker
      will be sought.
