      preceded by a precancerous lesion called an adenoma (commonly known as polyp). Detection and
      removal of adenomas at colonoscopy has been shown to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer.
      The success of the impending colorectal cancer screening programme to reduce cancer mortality
      in an average-risk population depends on optimal adenoma detection at colonoscopy. The
      detection of adenomas has been shown to vary between different endoscopist. Some of the
      factors that have been reported to affect adenoma detection rates included the time spent
      viewing, the adequacy of the bowel preparation and the time spent cleaning the colonic mucosa
      of excess fluid. Careful examination of proximal side of flexures, folds and valves by the
      endoscopist is equally important. However, even with careful examination adenoma detection
      rates have been shown to vary between endoscopist from 8.6% to 15.9%. Previous experience and
      training may be contributed to this difference. Some endoscopist adopt regular changes in
      position during the procedure to maximize distension of the colon. Better luminal distension
      enhances mucosal views for detection of the smaller adenomas. The validity of this approach
      has never been tested and we propose that this factor may contribute to the differences in
      adenoma detection rates.

      Patients will be randomised to either position 1 first then position 2 or vice versa and
      examined twice. During one withdrawal the colon will be examined with the participant in the
      left lateral position only (position 1) or with position changes (position 2)or vice versa.

      May 2007: protocol amendment to include additional prospective analysis using High Definition
      TV (HDTV). No further patient data collection involved.
