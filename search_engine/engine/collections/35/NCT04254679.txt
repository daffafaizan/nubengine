      investigators aim to recruit 80 adult patients at two tertiary hospitals in Montreal.
      Eligibility criteria will span outpatient procedures in abdominal and breast surgery.
      Patients are randomized on a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either opioid (standard care) or
      without opioid (only non-opioid analgesics). Patients will be followed up for 3 months after
      surgery; postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 7 and at 2, 3 and 4 weeks after surgery, and at 3
      months. Assessments will include postoperative pain, physical and mental function, adverse
      drug events, prolonged opioid use and opioid misuse. Feasibility outcomes will include the
      number of patients screened, consented and randomized, adherence with treatment and
      completion of follow-up. Data from this pilot study will inform the calculation of sample
      size requirements for the full-scale RCT. An embedded qualitative study will be conducted to
      help optimize trial design based on clinicians' and patients' perspective.
