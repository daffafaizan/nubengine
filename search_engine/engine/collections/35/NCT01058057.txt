      pre-treatment in patient with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) and chronic statin therapy.

      Two arms:

        1. atorvastatin pre-treatment group (80mg atorvastatin for seven days)

        2. control group (without atorvastatin pre-treatment, chronic statin treatment)

      Primary endpoint:

      Periprocedural myocardial infarction measured by troponin I level (time frame 24 hours)

      Secondary endpoint:

      Periprocedural myocardial infarction measured by creatine kinase myocardial band (time frame
      24 hours)
