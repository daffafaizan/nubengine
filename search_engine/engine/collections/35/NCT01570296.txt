    
      2.1 Primary

      â€¢ The safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of
      gefitinib and BKM120 will be determined.

      2.2 Secondary

        -  The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of gefitinib in combination with BKM120 will be
           determined.

        -  The preliminary anti-tumor activity of gefitinib in combination with BKM120 will be
           determined.

        -  The pharmacodynamic target modulation effects using a hair follicle assay will be
           determined.

      2.3 Exploratory

        -  The role of circulating tumour cells as assessed by a microfluidic device will be
           analyzed and the genetic alterations implicated in lung cancer, including but not
           limited to EGFR mutations, PI3KCA mutations, PTEN loss will be characterized.

        -  The feasibility of detecting somatic mutations from plasma DNA will be ascertained.
