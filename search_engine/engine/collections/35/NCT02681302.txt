    
      This is a phase Ib-IIA study of post-transplant combined check point inhibitors for patients
      with a high risk of relapse (>50%) after an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

      Patients will accrue to study by disease groups and followed separately by group for
      incidence and severity of toxicity, ability to receive intended schedule of combined check
      point inhibitors and for complete response and progression free survival (PFS) rates.
      Complete response and progression free survival rates will be compared to published standards
      for each disease group. Expected PFS at 18 months for all post-transplant groups without
      check point inhibitors is less than 50%. Each group with PFS at 18 months in 4 or more
      patients (57%) will be considered for eligibility in a successor phase IIB expansion trial.
