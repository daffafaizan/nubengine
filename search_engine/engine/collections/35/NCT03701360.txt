      72 hours of symptom onset. It is to mainly observe the patients' prognosis following the
      prescription of clopidogrel resinate and aspirin, collect relevant data and create big data
      for stroke. Based on this data, an AI, using various advanced statistical methodologies and
      deep learning techniques will be developed, and offer information regarding stroke prognosis
      by extracting markers that are characteristic of the relationship between stroke and the
      study drug.

      These analyses and results will include information on which drug regimen will better prevent
      the progression or recurrence of stroke by considering individual patient conditions. This is
      a pragmatic trial based on the prescription and treatment processes of routine clinical
      practice. Thus, there is no major restriction and with only the minimum exclusion criteria in
      place, it does not hinder usual clinical practices. Therefore, selecting and changing a
      patient's antiplatelet agents should be a rational medical judgment made by the patient's
      attending physician. The study will proceed without any major change in the sequence of
      routine clinical examinations, prescriptions, treatments, observations, etc. Provided, the
      process of storing and analyzing relevant information will be added to each study procedure
      in accordance with study methodologies and conditions no other special efforts or limitations
      will be required.

      The data will be collected prospectively, and the AI will generate brain imaging data and
      prognostic indicators for 3-months after stroke has occurred. The performance of the AI will
      be verified with independent test sets.
