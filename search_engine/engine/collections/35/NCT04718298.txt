      introduced to the market has been laparoscopically employed for the repair of one recurrent
      inguinal hernia previously managed with anterior open approach. The scope of this feasibility
      study is to demonstrate that the positive effects of the 3D implant already proven in open
      inguinal hernia repair are also effective or even superior for the laparoscopic of
      recurrent/bilateral inguinal hernias compared to conventional treatment concept.
