    
      The trial includes two parts, namely the efficacy study and immunogenicity bridging study. A
      total of 34020 participants will be enrolled, i.e. 32820 for efficacy cohort, and 1200 for
      domestic immunogenicity cohort in China.

      Efficacy study: Participants will be randomly inoculated with two doses of investigational
      vaccine or placebo according to 1:1 ratio following Day 0-Day 14 immunization schedule and
      will be observed from the first dose of investigational vaccine to collect symptomatic and
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases for the evaluation of the efficacy of the investigational
      vaccine.

      Immunogenicity bridging study: Before inoculating the first dose, 14 days, 6 months and 12
      months after the whole-course immunization, blood samples will be taken for determination of
      neutralizing antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 (ELISA method); and before
      inoculating the first dose, 6 months and 12 months after the whole-course immunization, blood
      samples will be taken for detecting specific T cells with the ELISPOT assay with an aim to
      evaluate immunogenicity and immune persistence.

      Safety observations for all participants will be conducted from the first dose to 28 days
      after the whole-course immunization, and follow-up of SAEs will also be conducted from the
      first dose to at least 12 months after the whole-course immunization to evaluate the safety
      of the investigational vaccine.
