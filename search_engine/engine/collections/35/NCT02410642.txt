      early phases of renal injury. Since the therapeutic window is likely to be in the earlier
      stages before renal injury is manifest, there is a need for novel diagnostic methods. In the
      recent years, several new biomarkers of kidney injury have been introduced. To date, none has
      proven outstanding regarding precision in early detection of AKI. NAG
      (N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase) is a lysosomal enzyme with high molecular weight. Due to its
      size, NAG does not normally pass the glomerulus apparatus, but urine levels are elevated
      after tubulus damage. NAG excretion in urine is seen in AKI after cardiac surgery, exposure
      to nephrotoxic agents and after renal transplantation. However, its role in clinical
      decision-making is yet to be established.

      We aim to study the excretion pattern of urinary NAG during and after cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Association with perioperative variables will be explored.
