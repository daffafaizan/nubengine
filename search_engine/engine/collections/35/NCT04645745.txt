      myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin treatment on HOMA-index improvement in two different
      groups of PCOS patients from the Mexican and Italian population. The addition of
      alpha-lactalbumin helps to increase the intestinal absorption of myo-inositol and
      consequently improve its effect. The scientific evidence so far available shows that these
      two groups of PCOS women have a different genetic, nutritional, and behavioural profile.
      Important factors are body mass index and insulin resistance, both increased in the Mexican
      women, although among them PCOS prevalence is not higher compared to many other populations.
      Therefore, the focus of this study is to check the effects of the combined administration of
      myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin for six months (with a control at three months) e to
      compare these effects between the two groups of patients, monitoring several hormonal
      parameters connected to the menstrual cycle regularization.
