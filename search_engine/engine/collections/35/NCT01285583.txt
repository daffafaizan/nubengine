      has finished participating in the preceding efficacy study (Protocol TRO19622 CL E Q 1015-1).

      The Investigator will explain to the patients the nature of this open-label safety study, its
      procedures, requirements and restrictions so as to obtain their written informed consent.

      Each patient will be treated with olesoxime (TRO19622) until the results of the double-blind
      trial become available with a maximum of 15 months.

      Follow-up visits will take place every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks).

      Safety assessments will be performed at all visits (every 3 months).
