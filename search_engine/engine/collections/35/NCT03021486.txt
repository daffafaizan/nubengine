    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the within-arm effect of haloperidol dose escalation, rotation to chlorpromazine,
      and combination therapy on agitation intensity (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS])
      over 24 hours in patients admitted to an acute palliative care unit (APCU) who did not
      experience a response to low-dose haloperidol.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of haloperidol dose escalation, rotation to
      chlorpromazine, and combination therapy on (1) the proportion of patients with target RASS -2
      to 0, (2) delirium-related distress in nurses and caregivers (delirium experience
      questionnaire), (3) symptom expression (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), (4) delirium
      severity (Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale), (5) the need for neuroleptics, (6) delirium
      recall (Delirium Recall Questionnaire), (7) adverse effects and (8) quality of end-of-life
      (Quality of Death and Dying questionnaire) over time.

      II. Obtain preliminary estimates of the between-arm effect size among haloperidol dose
      escalation, rotation to chlorpromazine, and combination therapy in the first 24 hours.

      III. To assess caregiver and nurse preferences regarding proxy sedation goals. IV. To examine
      the feasibility of novel measures for the assessment of agitation with continuous video
      monitoring.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive haloperidol intravenously (IV) over 3-15 minutes every 4 hours in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive chlorpromazine IV over 3-15 minutes every 4 hours in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III: Patients receive haloperidol and chlorpromazine IV over 3-15 minutes every 4 hours
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
