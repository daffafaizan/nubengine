      women. Exercise is one of the few therapies that can alleviate fibromyalgia symptoms. Despite
      exercise being a major component of rehabilitation, exercise guidelines are unclear, often
      leading to symptom exacerbation and low compliance. Previous research has demonstrated that
      women with fibromyalgia may have different post-exercise pain responses when undergoing an
      exercise task. Factors critical to optimal exercise prescription are not known, including the
      most effective type of exercise, mechanisms responsible for pain relief, and biopsychosocial
      influences. This study investigates the use of exercise as a nonpharmacological pain
      management tool for people with fibromyalgia.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the acute exercise-induced pain response after
      isometric and dynamic muscle contractions in people with and without fibromyalgia. All
      participants will attend up to three sessions with approximately one week between sessions at
      a metropolitan university laboratory setting. Participants will perform different types of
      submaximal exercise for a maximum of ten minutes and complete pain assessments each session.
      Pain and psychosocial influences are measured with multiple established clinical
      questionnaires. Pressure pain sensitivity is tested by application of a mechanical stimulus
      to the arms and legs. To investigate a participant's innate ability to inhibit pain, the
      mechanical stimulus will be assessed with and without limb submersion in a cold-water bath.
      Physical activity is measured via questionnaire and use of activity monitors, while body
      composition is measured with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan.
