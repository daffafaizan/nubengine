      that leads to thickening of the bronchial wall. Computed tomography (CT) is the method of
      reference to quantify bronchial thickness but involves ionizing radiation, thus limiting the
      possibility of frequent and long-term follow-up. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a
      non-ionizing 3D imaging technique. However, lung MRI is technically challenging and is not
      currently used in routine practice. Indeed, both low proton density and susceptibility
      effects lead to a very low signal intensity derived from lung parenchyma. Recently, pulse
      sequences with Ultrashort Echo Time (UTE) have been implemented by the use of half
      radio-frequency excitations and radial projection reconstruction. These UTE sequences make it
      theoretically possible to retrieve more signals from the lung parenchyma. We aim at using 3D
      T1-weighted UTE pulse sequences on a 1.5T magnet (Avanto dot, Siemens) in asthma in order to
      assess bronchial thickness. Thirty patients with asthma including 10 patients with severe
      asthma will be enrolled in this study. All participants will benefit from CT and MRI. Our
      strategy will consist in quantifying bronchial thickness using MRI and CT in those patients,
      testing for correlations between MRI and CT measurements and assessing the reproducibility of
      bronchial thickness assessment using MRI. Our objective is to demonstrate that MRI-UTE pulse
      sequence at 1.5T is accurate and reproducible in evaluating and quantifying bronchial
      thickness.
