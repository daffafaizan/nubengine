    
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo
      controlled trial to evaluate the usefulness of antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid
      in preventing bleeding in patients who are thrombocytopenic due to primary bone marrow
      disorders or chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The results of this study
      will change practice by providing evidence as to whether or not TXA is effective and safe
      treatment when used as an adjunct to platelet transfusion therapy in the thrombocytopenic
      patient.
