      treatment using autologous CD4-zeta gene-changed T cells and/or IL-2 (recombinant
      interleukin2). The treatments that the investigators are studying try to improve the immune
      system by changing some of your T cells so they can find and destroy HIV infected cells (HIV
      is usually able to hide from your T cells). In this study, the investigators are also trying
      to find out if giving you more IL-2 at the same time as gene changed T cells will help the T
      cells to live longer or fight HIV better.
