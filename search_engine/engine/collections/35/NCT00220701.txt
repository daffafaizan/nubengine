      Dysthymic Disorder (low-grade chronic depression), with a 12 week open-label extension phase.

      Flexible dosing to a maximum of 40 mg per day will be used. It is hypothesized that
      Escitalopram will be superior to placebo in improving depression, as well as psychosocial,
      temperamental, and cognitive functioning. Blood cytokine levels will also be measured at
      weeks 0, 12, and 24 to determine their relationship to depressive symptoms and improvement.
