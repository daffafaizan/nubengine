      Disorder (ASD), this trial is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot
      study of intranasal ketamine in 24 individuals with ASD ages 12- 30 years using a novel
      quantitative eye-tracking outcome measure to assess impact of the drug on social impairment.
      Additionally, to develop a ketamine-focused personalized medicine approach in ASD, the
      investigators will include pharmacokinetic, molecular pharmacodynamic, and
      electrophysiological assessments into initial systematic study.
