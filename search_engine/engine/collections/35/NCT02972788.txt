    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if local application of a commercially-available,
      FDA-approved preparation of enamel-matrix protein derivatives is effective in increasing
      clinical attachment levels (primary outcome), as well as alveolar bone (secondary outcome)
      compared to standard mechanical therapy in patients on periodontal maintenance therapy (PMT).
      Subjects will be divided into two groups for additional therapy in a 6-9 mm interproximal
      periodontal pocket at baseline: 1) local anesthesia and mini-flap reflection with subgingival
      mechanical debridement plus application of the enamel matrix protein derivate or 2) local
      anesthesia and mini-flap reflection with subgingival mechanical debridement plus application
      of saline. Samples/measurements will be obtained at the designated experimental site at
      baseline, 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months during PMT: 1) digital radiograph (baseline and 12 months
      only; bone height measurements), 2) presence of explorer-detectable supragingival plaque, 3)
      30-second gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sample (markers of inflammation, bone turnover), 4)
      recession from the cemento-enamel junction, 5) probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing
      (BOP). Following the 12-month visit, the research-specific interventions and measurements in
      the experimental quadrant will be removed from routine PMT.
