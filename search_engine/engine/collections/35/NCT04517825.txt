    
      This is a two-phase study designed to assess measures of feasibility, sustainability,
      acceptability, penetration, and fidelity before and after implementation of a rapid molecular
      HIV-1 viral load testing infrastructure at a level III health center in rural western Uganda.

      In Phase 1, the study team will perform/record the following:

        1. Administer a basic demographic and health questionnaire

        2. Record routine clinical parameters during visit to include:

             1. Current ARV and prophylaxis regimen

             2. Last CD4 and VL, if available

             3. Clinical illness since last visit

        3. Document the amount of time each patient spends in each phase of clinic (i.e. waiting
           room, provider, phlebotomy, waiting for results, adherence counseling).

        4. Measure the number of participants requiring HIV-1 VL testing each clinic day,
           proportion electing to receive results by phone or at next visit.

        5. Patients having blood drawn for HIV-1 VL testing will complete a semi-structured
           interview to explore perceptions of the current testing paradigm when results are
           received.

        6. Provider and laboratory staff will complete a semi-structured interview to explore
           perceptions of the current testing paradigm with emphasis on workload

      In Phase 2, the study team will perform/record the following:

        1. Record routine clinical parameters during visit to include:

             1. Current ARV and prophylaxis regimen

             2. Last CD4 and VL, if available

             3. Clinical illness since last visit

        2. Determine the amount of time each patient spends in each phase of clinic (i.e. waiting
           room, provider, phlebotomy, waiting for results, adherence counseling).

        3. Measure the number of Xpert HIV-1 tests performed, the amount of time laboratory staff
           spends performing the tests and conducting maintenance, the number of tests failures
           and/or invalid tests, and equipment downtime related problems with software or power
           supply.

        4. Measure the number of participants requiring HIV-1 VL testing each clinic day,
           proportion electing to receive results on same day, by phone, or next visit.

        5. Patients having blood drawn for HIV-1 VL testing will complete a semi-structured
           interview to explore perceptions of the current testing paradigm when results are
           received.

        6. Provider and laboratory staff will complete a semi-structured interview to explore
           perceptions of the current testing paradigm with emphasis on workload.
