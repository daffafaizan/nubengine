      in controlling urolithiasis related acute pain. Previous animal and human studies reported
      that combination regimen of ketoprofen and nefopam showed synergistic effect in pain control.
      We hypothesized that using nefopam instead of morphine for ketorolac based combination
      analgesia will produce similar pain reduction without causing opioid-related side effect.
