      dependent fashion. While the primary mechanism of action of this class of agents is the
      increase in the expression of LDL receptor resulting in accelerated clearance of LDL, the
      increase potency of Crestor in comparison to other statins may suggest other mechanisms. We
      propose to study the rate of incorporation of deuterated labeled leucine into VLDL apoB and
      LDL apoB and to determine the effect of two doses of Crestor (5 mg/day and 40 mg/day) on the
      production and clearance of apoB. Participants will be admitted to the General Clinical
      Research Center on three occasions (4 days, 3 nights per admission) for these metabolic
      studies. This is an open-label study design to reflect usual care with the first admission
      taking place while the participant is not on any lipid-lowering therapy. The second admission
      will occur after a minimum of 6 weeks on the low dose (5mg/day). The dose will be increased
      to 40 mg/day at the time of discharge and the third admission will occur after a minimum of 6
      weeks on the higher dose.

      A secondary objective of this study is to examine the rate of production and clearance of
      apoA-I, the major protein in HDL, at the 2 doses of Crestor. In addition to a reduction in
      LDL, Crestor has also been reported to result in a characteristic dose-dependent increase in
      HDL. The mechanism of this increase is not understood.
