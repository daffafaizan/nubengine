      previous viral outbreaks and holds the potential to save lives in the current crisis.
      Recently researchers from China reported satisfactory recovery of critically ill Corona Virus
      Disease 2019 (COVID 19) patients when high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were
      administered.

      Research team at Dow University of Health Sciences has purified immunoglobulin (both SARS-CoV
      2 antibodies and existing antibodies) from convalescent plasma of COVID19 individuals and
      pooled to prepared IVIG formulation to treat severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. To
      evaluate safety of the formulation animal (rats) safety trials and survival of all the
      animals were observed.

      It is intended to assess safety and efficacy of experimental the IVIG treatment in severe and
      critically ill COVID 19 patients through phase I/phase II randomized single blinded clinical
      trial with fifty study participants. FDA outlined criteria for passive immunization using
      convalescent plasma, which will be used for recruiting participants in the study.
