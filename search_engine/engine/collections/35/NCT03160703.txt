      parallel design study will be used to evaluate and compare the stain buildup of two 0.454%
      SnF2/ 5% STP dentifrices of differing abrasivity levels, with a marketed standard fluoride
      dentifrice and a marketed SnF2 dentifrice. Stain will be assessed following a full
      professional dental prophylaxis, at intervals over a 4 week treatment period, using an
      established clinical measure of extrinsic dental stain - the MacPherson modification of the
      Lobene stain index (MLSI). Participants will be stratified by pre-prophylaxis MLSI score
      (total MLSI Area x Intensity (AÃ—I) for the facial surfaces of the 12 anterior teeth) and
      smoking status. The study will be conducted in healthy participants with a propensity for
      extrinsic dental stain (in the opinion of the examiner) on the facial surfaces of the
      anterior teeth.
