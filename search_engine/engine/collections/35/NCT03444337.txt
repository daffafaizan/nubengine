      indicated atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation using FIRM mapping. The purpose of the study is
      to collect additional information before, during, and after the ablation procedure. All
      patients will undergo a contrast-enhance MRI scanning with gadolinium-based contrast agent
      prior to the procedure as it provides a 3-dimensional image of both the left atria and right
      atria. The primary endpoint of this study will be the presence or absence of a correlation
      between micro-anatomic fibrotic tracks, determined by a combination of atrial wall thickness,
      and local scar and fibrosis, and sites of FIRM map indicated rotor activity. Medical
      information will also be collected after the patients 2nd, 3rd and 6 month standard of care
      doctor visits. There are no additional risks associated with this protocol over and above
      that of the standard risk of atrial fibrillation ablation with FIRM, and those associated
      with the standard risk of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast agent, but
      there is a small risk of the loss of confidentiality when participating in an observational
      study. The potential benefits includes the possibility of greater understanding of the
      patient's specific disease state.
