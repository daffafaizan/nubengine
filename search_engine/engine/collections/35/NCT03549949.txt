      physicians per months since April 2017. In June 2018 an article about HHT is planned to be
      published in the journal of the German dental association and the Federal Association of Fund
      Dentists of Germany. This journal is distributed to all dentists in Germany and is a set book
      for them. Total circulation in 2017 was 77,621
      (http://www.aerzteverlag.de/portfolio/fachwissen-medizindental/zm-zahnaerztliche-mitteilungen
      /profil/ ). The article describes the case of visceral abscesses after dental screening in a
      patient with HHT and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. These could probably have been
      prevented if the dentist had prescribed an antibiotic prophylaxis to the patient. The article
      includes a call to search for telangiectases. If those are seen the dentist is recommended to
      ask the patient if he or relatives have nosebleeds. If both apply, the dentist is asked to
      inform the patient about HHT and give him the address of the national German self-help group.

      After 3 and 6 months a reminder shall be published in the same journal.
