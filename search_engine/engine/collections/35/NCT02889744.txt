    
      1. Subject Identification and Screening For each cohort, patients will be identified after
           acquisition of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (> 30 minutes). If the
           patients meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients will be enrolled in the study. The
           investigators will obtain written informed consent from all of the patients or their
           representatives.

        2. Assignment of Subject Number A unique identification number will be given to study
           subjects in an attempt to de-identify their information. Subject numbers will be
           assigned in sequential order. The subject number will consist of four digits. The first
           two digits will designate the study site. The last two digits will designate the subject
           by number in sequential order (i.e., subject number 01 01 will be the first subject at
           site 1; 01 02 will be the second subject at site 1, etc.).

        3. Study Methods

             -  Randomization to 36-TH (core body temperature (BT) 36℃) or 33-TH (core BT 33℃)
                group will be performed by a web based randomization site (http://mrcc.snuh.org).

             -  Start target temperature management using external cooling device (Arctic Sun)
                within 1 hour post-ROSC.

             -  SctO2 monitoring starts within 1 hour post-ROSC and maintain for 72 hours.

             -  36-TH (core BT 36℃) or 33-TH (core BT 33℃) for 24 hours

             -  Rewarming 0.25℃/h in 33-TH group

             -  Core temperature < 37.5℃ for 72 hours

           All patients will be treated per the postresuscitation care protocol. Target treatment
           will include

             -  Target: central venous pressure (CVP) (8 - 12 mmHg), mean arterial pressure (MAP)
                (> 65 mmHg), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) (> 70%)

             -  Seizure control, shivering control as appropriate

             -  Coronary intervention as soon as possible if needed

             -  Infection control if indicated

             -  Other supportive care

           Monitoring data including

             -  CVP, MAP, ScvO2, lactate, neuron specific enolase (NSE), end-tidal carbon dioxide
                (EtCO2), input-output (I/O) balance

             -  Intermittent electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (2 times/72 hours)

             -  Laboratory data including arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA), complete blood count
                (CBC), liver function test (LFT), electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine
                (BUN/Cr), et al.

             -  SctO2

             -  Core (esophageal or bladder) temperature

        4. Data Collection

      Study data will be collected in the following manner:

      • All data will be collected on appropriate Case Report Forms.
