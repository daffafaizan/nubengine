      (GI) toxic effects of external beam radiotherapy followed by permanent source brachytherapy
      using interstitial iodine I 125 seeds in patients with intermediate risk, clinically
      localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. II. Determine the freedom from prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) failure, overall survival, disease specific survival, and local and/or distant
      clinical relapse rates in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to
      the pelvis 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Permanent source brachytherapy comprised of
      ultrasound-guided implantation of iodine I 125 seeds into the prostate is performed 2-6 weeks
      after completion of EBRT. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, then every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
