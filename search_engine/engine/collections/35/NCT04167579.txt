    
      The TVT Registry was designed to support a national surveillance system to assess the
      characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients receiving transcutaneous valve
      therapies. Patient-level data are submitted by participating hospitals to The Society of
      Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and American College of Cardiology Foundation's (ACCF) joint TVT
      Registry. The purposes of the TVT Registry include: (i) collecting pertinent and standardized
      data elements from participating hospitals, health care providers and others that measure and
      assess the quality of care for patients receiving TVT; (ii) providing confidential periodic
      reports to participating hospitals, health care providers and others, to evaluate and improve
      the quality of care in these areas; and (iii) permitting and fostering appropriate research
      based upon the data collected by means of the TVT Registry.

      The secondary aim of the TVT Registry is to serve as a scalable data infrastructure forpost
      market studies.
