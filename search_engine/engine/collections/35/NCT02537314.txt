      signaling will alter: a) circulating levels of nutrient substrates and secretion of hormones
      that regulate nutrient metabolism; and b) glucose and fatty acid absorption, production, and
      utilization.

      Obese (BMI = 30-50 kg/m2) subjects will be studied. The topical anesthetic benzocaine will be
      infused into the duodenum prior to infusion of glucose and oleic acid into the duodenum.
      Duodenal infusions with a naso-intestinal feeding tube will circumvent the confounding
      effects of gastric emptying on the metabolic responses to a meal. Substrates (glucose, free
      fatty acids), and lipoproteins) and hormones will be measured by standard biochemical and
      immunological methods. Aim 2 will determine if enteric neural signals regulate appetite. The
      studies will be carried out in both lean and obese humans and the procedure will be performed
      as described above. In addition, the subjects will be asked to use a visual analog scale to
      estimate their level of appetite before, during and after enteral infusions.
