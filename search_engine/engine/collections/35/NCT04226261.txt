      collected and stored. Results of NGS will be compared between patients who develop definite
      infection immediately (within 72 hours) after sample collection, and those who remain well.
      Clinical data describing baseline information about the patient and rheumatic diseases,
      antibiotic and steroid or immunosuppressor therapy exposure, pathogen testing, immunology
      results, and infection-related events will be collected prospectively from the electronic
      medical record.

      An initial exploratory phase will examine approximately 50 participants to determine whether
      the effectiveness of predicting infections. The study may then enroll up to 200 participants
      to collection additional data for analysis.
