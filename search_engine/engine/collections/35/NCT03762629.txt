      intervention. Thirty normal-weight children and adolescents will be recruited as control
      group. Clinical characteristics, body composition, blood biochemistry, and circulating irisin
      levels of the subjects will be measured before and after 6-week intervention. Endothelial
      function will be assessed by a flow-mediated dilation test. Circulating exosome-derived
      miRNAs, exercise-induced epigenetic modifications, circulating irisin levels irisin
      concentration in plasma and arterial stiffness as well as cardiac autonomic function will be
      investigated before and after the 6-week intervention. Fecal samples were collected before
      and after the 6-week intervention for analysis of the compositional and functional changes in
      the human gut microbiota.
