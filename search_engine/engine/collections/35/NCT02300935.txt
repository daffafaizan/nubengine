      remains an aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Trametinib and nab-paclitaxel have
      demonstrated single-agent activity in Phase III trials of patients with melanoma. The
      investigators propose to investigate this drug combination in patients with advanced
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This open-label Phase I study is designed to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), and safety profile of
      trametinib and nab-paclitaxel given in combination. Patients with melanoma and known BRAF
      mutation status will receive escalating doses of trametinib and nab-paclitaxel to determine
      the MTD. Once the MTD is determined an additional 6 patients will be treated at the MTD to
      establish the dose for future studies.
