      and 50 (150) eligible participants will be assigned to receive RAL 400 mg BID along with
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TVD) 1 tablet once daily (3-drug NPEP) for
      28-days or TVD 1 tablet once daily (2-drug NPEP) for 28-days according to established
      Australian guidelines for the use of 3 or 2-drug NPEP following a potential or actual sexual
      exposure to HIV in men who have sex with men (MSM).1 Based on hospital NPEP data over the
      past 2 years, it is anticipated that 100 MSM will receive 3-drug (RAL-TVD) NPEP and 50 will
      receive 2-drug (TVD) NPEP. Follow-up post NPEP is for 23 weeks i.e. to week 24 post exposure.

      Primary study objectives:

      To describe the safety of 28 days of nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis(NPEP)
      containing raltegravir (RAL) To describe the tolerability of 28 days of NPEP containing RAL
      To describe on-drug adherence and regimen completion rates of 28 days of NPEP containing RAL

      Secondary study objectives:

      To investigate whether or not receipt of NPEP decreases, increases or has no impact on HIV
      risk taking behaviour To describe the effects of RAL and tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate/emtricitabine (TVD) on key inflammatory biomarkers in a subset of the main study
      population
