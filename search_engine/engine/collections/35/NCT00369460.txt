        -  Demonstrate a decrease/increase of fat-free mass (FFM) by 10% from baseline, based on
           tumor progression/regression, within each patient with inoperable locally advanced or
           metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.

        -  Determine the correlation between changes in FFM and 6-month survival.

        -  Confirm the frequency of lymphocytopenia in patients with inoperable locally advanced or
           metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.

        -  Demonstrate an interaction between pretreatment total lymphocyte count, treatment
           response, and 6-month survival in patients with inoperable locally advanced or
           metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.

        -  Collect adjuvant information, such as weight, body mass index, age, ECOG performance
           status, gait speed, concomitant medications, CA19-9, and total lymphocyte count, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients will have weight, body mass index, age, ECOG performance status, gait speed,
      concomitant medications, CA19-9, and total lymphocyte count measured before start of cancer
      treatment of the patient's choosing.

      Patients will be re-assessed at approximately 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and with any
      change in tumor burden.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17 patients will be accrued for this study.
