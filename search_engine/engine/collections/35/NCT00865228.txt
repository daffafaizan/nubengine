      lipoproteins, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol the lipoprotein that transports
      endogenous cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues. Increased cholesterol and
      triglyceride levels lead to an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, the underlying cause of
      heart attack, strokes and peripheral vascular disease. Despite changes in lifestyle and the
      availability of potent lipid-lowering agents, cardiovascular disease continues to be the
      major cause of death in Western Europe and North America.
