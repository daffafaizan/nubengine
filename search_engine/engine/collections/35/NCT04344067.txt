      who will receive FIR therapy for 6 months and 50 in control group. Many parameters of blood
      and urine samples as well as ultrafiltration amount, dialysate urea nitrogen, creatinine,
      Na+, K+, total protein, CA-125, and glucose degradation product (GDP) for the dialysate
      effluent of not only the first and last exchanges but also the total exchanges of daily PD
      regimen will be measured for both groups at day 1 and 6th month. However, only the FIR group
      will receive tests of blood, urine and dialysate on day 2. The significance of the study is
      that patients might benefit from the prophylactic therapeutic effects of FIR therapy, leading
      to the reduction of the hospitalization costs and the need for interventional procedures in
      CAPD patient care in Taiwan.
