      helping their patients quit tobacco. However, Doctors of Chiropractic (DCs) have not been
      utilized in this role. DCs can provide a unique channel for the conduct of tobacco
      interventions, but they currently receive little to no training in these techniques (Hawk &
      Evans, 2005). Doctors of Chiropractic are increasingly concerned with patients' use of
      cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The chiropractic team provides educational and preventive
      services to patients, and the office visit can provide an extended opportunity to talk to
      patients about their tobacco use (Hawk, Long, Perillo, & Boulanger, 2004; Rupert, 2000).
      Given the health effects associated with chronic tobacco use, the chiropractic visit provides
      a "teachable moment" during which the DC can relate current health problems to tobacco use
      and provide brief counseling to patients who use tobacco (Gordon & Severson, 2001; Vogt,
      Lichtenstein, Ary, et al., 1989).

      In the proposed developmental study, eight chiropractic clinics will participate in the
      design, implementation, and evaluation of an office-based tobacco cessation intervention.
      Adapted from previous office-based intervention protocols, the intervention will be based on
      Cognitive Learning Theory (Bandura, 1997) and the Clinical Practice Guidelines (Fiore,
      Bailey, Cohen, et al., 2000) and will also incorporate Motivational Interviewing techniques
      (Miller & Rollnick, 1991). Finally, using the RE-AIM framework (Glasgow, Vogt & Boles, 1999),
      we will assess individual-, clinic-, and organization-level variables that may affect the
      delivery of treatment for tobacco dependence, the implementation and maintenance of the
      intervention.
