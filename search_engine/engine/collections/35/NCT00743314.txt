        -  To assess the feasibility of integrating Philips Precedence SPECT/CT® images with GE
           PET/CT Fusion software to reduce radiation dosimetry delivered to lymph nodes draining
           the arm in patients after surgery for stage I or II breast cancer.

        -  To examine the differences in radiation dosimetry in these patients using 3-D conformal
           radiotherapy with vs without the Philips Precedence SPECT/CT®.

        -  To compare reduction in lymph node radiation dosimetry in these patients using single
           photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) with 3-D
           conformal radiotherapy vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filtered technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid (TcSC) intradermally and
      undergo single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT)
      imaging at the time of TcSC and 2 hours after injection. Patients then undergo
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the whole breast, including the low axilla and lymph
      nodes identified by the Phillips Precedence SPECT/CT® at a dose determined by computer
      analysis of the imaging information.

      Patients complete a lymphedema screening questionnaire at baseline and at 12 and 24 months
      after treatment.
