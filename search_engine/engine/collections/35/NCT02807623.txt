      exercise intervention (push-ups) compared to an oral NSAID (ibuprofen) and a blinded oral
      placebo to decrease local injection site inflammation symptoms of delayed pain, erythema, and
      edema and any impact on serologic antibody immune response after influenza vaccine receipt. A
      healthy military cohort will be randomly assigned to either perform push-ups consistent with
      their army physical fitness score, or to take a blinded oral medication which will be an
      NSAID (ibuprofen) or an oral placebo. The study will require three visits for assessment: on
      the day of vaccine receipt, 48-72 hours later and 21 -28 days later. The assessment visits
      will include injection site inspection, an injection site photograph, completion of symptom
      diaries and a validated pain scale and a laboratory blood specimen at the first and third
      visit to measure antibody level changes. The exercise participants will also be required to
      provide 1-2 fingerstick blood samples to evaluate for lactate, which is a byproduct of
      anaerobic exercise to measure if level of exercise effort achieved anaerobic metabolism. The
      study will evaluate if either of the interventions impacted perceived delayed pain, physical
      signs of inflammation or antibody response as measured by serology.
