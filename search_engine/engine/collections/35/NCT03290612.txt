      markers in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover pilot study. The
      participants will also perform morning typical behaviors such as arousal from sleep, change
      in posture (getting out of bed) and mild intensity physical activity; identical to the
      stressors encountered in everyday life. This pilot study is in healthy middle aged adults
      without a history of CV disease.

      Participants will spend two nights in an inpatient hospital suite at Hatfield Research
      Center. Upon awakening in the morning, they will either ingest Vitamin C or placebo in a
      randomized order. This will be followed by moderate intensity exercise, recovery, and
      discharge.
