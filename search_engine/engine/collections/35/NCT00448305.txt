      frequent neoplasm in women. In recent years so-called "profiling of breast cancer" with
      expression arrays has become common and it was suggested that the results will allow
      individualization of care. Breast cancer may now be subclassified into luminal, basal, and
      HER-2 subtypes with distinct differences in prognosis and response to therapy. About 80% of
      all basal-like-breast cancers possess a so-called "triple-receptor-negative" phenotype.

      Patients with "triple receptor negative breast cancer" have a complete absence of hormone
      receptors incl. HER-2, an aggressive clinical course and a paucity of treatment options. The
      only therapeutic option is chemotherapy and in this respect the choice of cytostatic agents
      is limited. Against this background, the study tries to find another therapeutic option by
      combining a vascular-disrupting activity with the cytostatic effects of paclitaxel in the
      study drug EndoTAG-1.
