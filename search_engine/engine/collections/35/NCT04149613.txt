      mortality. Recent data have shown that tumors arising from different regions of the colon
      differ in their molecular characteristics which causes translate into a differential clinical
      outcome.Several studies described the role of microRNA expression in the initiation and
      progression of CRC and its response to different therapeutic strategies. Other studies have
      shown that systemic inflammation is a key determinant role of clinico-pathological outcomes
      in patients with CRC. We therefore aim to evaluate the expression of selected microRNA and
      inflammatory markers in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer and assess their correlation
      with tumor location, dietary patterns, survival rates, response to systemic chemotherapy and
      other clinic-pathological parameters. We believe that identifying a predictive and prognostic
      panel made up of circulating microRNA and inflammatory markers may perhaps explain the
      difference in outcome between right and left colon and perhaps impact the clinical practice
      in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.
