    
      The aim is to compare ciNPWT (closed incisional negative pressure wound dress) technique to
      the traditional, dry wound dressing technique at high infection risk laparotomy wounds.

      Control arm will be treated "as usual": sterile gauze or high-absorbing surgical wound dress.

      Experimental arm will be dressed with: one layer of silver-containing, impregnated mesh laxer
      (Atrauman® Ag - Hartmann) directly placed on the primary closed wound, one layer of
      alcohol-soaked foam (VivanoMed® White Foam - Hartmann) and sufficient-size sealant film
      (Hydrofilm® - Hartmann).

      A negative pressure of -90 Hgmm will be administered in a continuous mode over 5 days
      postoperatively.

      Surgical site infection and abdominal wall dehiscence rate will be assessed, as well as cost
      effectiveness will be calculated at both arms.
