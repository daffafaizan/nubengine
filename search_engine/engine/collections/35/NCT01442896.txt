    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

      To identify and combine a set of predictors (i.e. by statistical modeling, machine learning
      classifiers or neural networks) to predict progression in glaucoma patients To determine how
      to most sensitively and specifically determine progression for a trial of a potential
      neuroprotective agent.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      To evaluate genetic and other potential biomarkers associated with progression in glaucoma.

      To evaluate tests currently used on glaucoma patients to better predict which ones are most
      sensitive to detect disease progression and measure rates of change.

      To assess progression by structural and functional tests:

        -  Optic disc stereophotographs

        -  Cirrus OCT

        -  RTVue OCT

        -  Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP)

        -  Frequency Doubling Technology Matrix
