      will receive bilateral Xiidra. The most symptomatic eye will be selected to receive DEXTENZA®
      insertion on the day Xiidra is prescribed (study eye), while the other eye will be assigned
      to receive sham punctum dilation (control eye). If there is no obvious symptomatic
      difference, the right eye will receive the intracanalicular insert. The study group will
      consist of 20 eyes receiving DEXTENZA® insertion. The control group will consist of 20 eyes
      receiving sham punctum dilation. Thus, for every eye in the study group, there will be a
      paired eye with similar baseline characteristics in the control group sourced from the same
      participant. This fellow-eye design allows for greater control of potential confounders tied
      to participants' systemic and ocular health.
