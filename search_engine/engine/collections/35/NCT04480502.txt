    
      This is a multicenter open-label, randomized, non-comparative, parallel cohort pivotal study
      of treatment with envafolimab (cohort A) or envafolimab combined with ipilimumab (cohort B)
      in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic UPS/MFS who have progressed on
      one or two lines of chemotherapy. Patients will be assigned at random into one of the two
      cohorts: cohort A of 80 patients who will receive single agent envafolimab (300 mg every 3
      weeks by subcutaneous (SC) injection) or cohort B of 80 patients who will receive envafolimab
      (300 mg every 3 weeks by SC injection) in combination with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks
      intravenously for four doses).
