      since when the virus actually circulated on the territory. Data from China but also
      systematic samples taken from the passengers of the boat Diamond Princess also report almost
      50% of asymptomatic forms of Covid-19. Medical and paramedical staff are in fact potentially
      exposed to the risk of professional contamination, with probably a different risk between the
      first-line referent hospitals and the others, due to the large number of patients treated in
      the first, including in the pre-epidemic phase (average of 190 consultants per day at the
      emergency department Pitié-Salpêtrière for example). Therefore, and despite the application
      of standard protective measures, it is possible that a certain number of these personnel
      already have or will contract Covid-19 disease, including in its asymptomatic form. Knowledge
      of this seroconversion rate, if it is found to be higher than that of the general population,
      could lead to a review of the measures to protect personnel from other emerging infectious
      risks.
