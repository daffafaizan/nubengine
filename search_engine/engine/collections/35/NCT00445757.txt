      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation in patients undergoing stereotactic
           radiotherapy for renal tumors.

        -  Determine radiotherapy-associated toxicity in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine preoperative pathologic response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of radiotherapy.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo stereotactic radiotherapy to 1 tumor. Cohorts of 4-8
           patients receive escalating doses of radiotherapy twice daily for 2 days until the
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or upper limit is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose
           preceding that at which at least 2 of 4 or 3 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting
           toxicity (DLT). DLT is assessed at 4 and 8 weeks after radiotherapy.

        -  Surgery: Two months after completion of radiotherapy, patients undergo preoperative
           assessment of tumor response followed by partial nephrectomy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
