    
      The study is an assessor-blinded RCT for examining the efficacy and lasting effects of 24
      weeks of supervised FES cycling exercise compared to passive leg cycling on mobility and
      secondary outcomes in people with MS with mobility impairment. Participants who meet the
      eligibility criteria will undergo the informed consent process and baseline assessment.
      Participants will then be randomized to either the FES or passive leg cycling program.
      Following baseline assessment, participants will complete a 24-week leg cycling program, with
      a mid-point assessment at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, participants will undergo a
      post-intervention assessment. Following a 12-week follow-up period, participants will undergo
      a final assessment. Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 10
      months.
