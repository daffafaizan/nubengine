      Score (IPSS). The IPSS will be assessed at baseline before RT, 4 weeks into RT, the last day
      of RT, and monthly thereafter for a total duration of 6 months from start of RT. Patients
      will have 2 more IPSS assessments at 9 and 12 months. The total duration of follow-up will be
      one year from start of RT. We will compare the rate of IPSS increase in the Rapaflo group
      compared to the standard arm at different time point (4 weeks, 6 weeks and at the end of
      treatment). We will also determine the rate of IPSS return to baseline at 4 and 12 weeks
      after the end of treatment. The rate of therapy dependence in the 2 arms will be evaluated at
      20 and 26 weeks.
