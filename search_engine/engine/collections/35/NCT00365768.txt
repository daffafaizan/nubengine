      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in pediatric
           patients with lymphoma, leukemia, or solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the safety of glutamine vs placebo in these patients.

        -  Compare the efficacy of glutamine vs placebo in reducing the progression and/or
           resolution of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of glutamine supplementation vs placebo on chemotherapy-related
           toxicities in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of glutamine vs placebo on measures of quality of life in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the effect of glutamine supplementation vs placebo on serum nerve growth factor
           and glutamine levels in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of glutamine on vincristine-mediated antitumor efficacy in vitro.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning 1 week after administration of vincristine chemotherapy, patients
           receive oral glutamine twice daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Beginning 1 week after administration of vincristine chemotherapy, patients
           receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-21.

      Patients in both arms undergo neuropsychological and clinical neurological assessment, blood
      collection for serum marker (e.g., serum glutamine and nerve growth factor) analysis, and
      quality of life assessment on days 1, 21, and 42.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for an additional 21 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
