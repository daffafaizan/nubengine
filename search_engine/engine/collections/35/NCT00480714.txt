    
      Volunteers for the study will be recruited through advertisements. Each volunteer will have
      received an information sheet concerning the study and will have agreed to participate in
      writing.

      Volunteers will be given at least 48 hours between reading the information leaflet and
      agreeing to participate. Female volunteers will have a pregnancy test prior to enrollment.
      Volunteers will give signed consent for their GP's to be notified about their participation
      in the trial. The GP will be faxed a letter on the day of screening and asked to reply if
      they know of a reason why the volunteer should not take part. The signed consent form will
      also be faxed with the letter.

      A week after the screening visit and after a negative Heaf test, subjects will receive a
      single intradermal injection of 106 cfu M. bovis BCG in 0.1ml just inferior to the insertion
      of the deltoid muscle. Blood tests will be taken at the screening visit and day of
      immunisation, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after the immunisation. 75mls will be
      taken on the screening visit, and 60mls will be taken on all subsequent visits. Screening
      samples will be tested for full blood count, biochemical screen and immunological assays to
      determine vaccine immunogenicity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be prepared for
      cellular immunological assays to be performed without or following cryopreservation. Other
      serological measures of immune response, i.e.

      antibody titres, will be assayed on frozen plasma samples. All blood tests will be taken
      within 1-3 days of the due date as described in the schedule above.
