      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid) in
      patients with advanced unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who have failed available therapies.

      OUTLINE:

      Pre-cycle: Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours
      on days 1-5, 1 week prior to course 1.

      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 4 of weeks
      1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients responding to treatment may receive up to 4
