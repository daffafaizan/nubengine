      office. This is usually accomplished by administering a shot of numbing medicine (local
      anesthesia) in different parts of the mouth. Local anesthesia is an important tool used for
      care in the dental office however despite its standardized use in dental clinics use of local
      anesthetic is not standardized for use in dental cases under GA. In the literature there is
      some evidence suggesting that it has some marginal benefit for pain control short term post
      operatively and control of vital signs during surgery. Some evidence also suggests that due
      to its use there can be increase in post-operative lip chewing and cheek biting due to the
      numb sensation. Additionally, it has been seen that due to the numb sensation that children
      can be more irritable during when waking up after surgery.

      The study section will have 60 participants of which one half will receive local anesthesia
      for restorative dental care under GA and the other half will receive conventional no
      anesthesia for restorative dental treatment under GA, based on random assignment (like the
      flip of a coin). There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group prior to the
      consented treatment. Before the surgery, a nurse will access the child's overall pain and
      comfort. The study team (faculty, anesthesiologist, and resident) will record the blood
      pressure, heart rate, and breathing duration throughout the procedure. After the child has
      completed the surgery a nurse will again access the child's overall pain and comfort. Lastly,
      parents will be contacted that evening of surgery by a member of the study team to check up
      on the child and will be asked some questions to access the child's comfort at home.
