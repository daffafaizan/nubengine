      radiation have been recognized for over 40 years..

      Although intravenous administration is the approved standard route, because of practical
      advantages there has been increasing interest in the subcutaneous administration of Ethyol,
      which presents multiple advantages when used for radioprotection.

      Based on the data that has been presented, as well as the personal experience of this and
      other physicians/centers with subcutaneous administration of amifostine, the researchers are
      proposing an open-label study evaluating the rate and severity of toxicities associated with
      this route of administration. Toxicities to be assessed include nausea/vomiting, hypotension,
      and skin/fever reactions.
