      Background: There is limited representation of ethnic minorities in preventive interventions
      for the generational impact of maternal depression.

      Methods: The Preventive Intervention Project (PIP) was adapted to be culturally and
      contextually relevant for urban African American mothers with depression and their children.
      A pilot clinical trial (PIP vs. lecture) was conducted.
