      preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia (including HELLP and eclampsia), and preeclampsia
      superimposed on chronic hypertension were identified through the Perinatal Database. Platelet
      counts (PC) for each patient, from one month prior to the delivery admission, until hospital
      discharge, were analyzed. The number of PC determinations per parturient was determined. For
      each diagnosis, the positive predictive value (PPV) of an initial PC > 150,000/mL for
      maintaining subsequent PC > 80,000/mL, as well as the PPV of the PC prior to initiation of
      neuraxial analgesia was calculated. The median time interval from the closest PC
      determination to initiation of neuraxial analgesia was calculated.
