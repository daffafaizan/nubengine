      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of donepezil or EGb761 on neurocognitive function in patients who
           underwent radiotherapy for a primary brain tumor or brain metastases at least 6 months
           before study registration.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Quantify the extent of radiation-induced white matter disease and temporal lobe atrophy
           in patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Group 1 (closed to accrual 10/09/03): Patients receive oral donepezil once daily for 24
           weeks.

        -  Group 2: Patients receive oral EGb761 three times daily for 24 weeks. In both groups
           (group 1 closed to accrual 10/09/03), treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable
           toxicity.

      In both groups (group 1 closed to accrual 10/09/03), quality of life and neurocognitive
      assessment is performed at baseline and at weeks 6 (group 1 only), 12, 24, and 30.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (35 per treatment group) will be accrued for this
      study within 9.5 months. (Group 1 closed to accrual 10/09/03)
