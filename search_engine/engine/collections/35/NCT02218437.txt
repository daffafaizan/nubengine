    
      1. Mesenchymal Stem Cells were prepared by in vitro separation, screening, and culture from
           healthy human umbilical cord tissue; The " injection of mesenchymal stem cells
           (umbilical) manufacturing and verification regulation " was also formulated.

        2. The starting dose of Umbilical Cord Derived MSC was 0.5-1.0 * 106 cells /kg, based on
           the previous human studies; And the maximum tolerated dose was 1 * 107 cells /kg

        3. The response and complete remission rate, relapse rate of the injection of Umbilical
           Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (or combined with ATG ) for Child with SAA were
           determined.
