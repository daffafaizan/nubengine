      Consent Form (ICF) through the final protocol-specified contact. After a screening phase of
      28 days, eligible subjects will receive treatment on Day -7 with a loading dose of the study
      drug. This will continue during concurrent therapy with cisplatin and radiation, which will
      begin on day 1. Treatment will continue until completion of therapy, documented confirmed
      disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents
      further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject
      withdraws consent, pregnancy of the patient, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure
      requirements; or administrative reasons. After the end of treatment, each patient will be
      followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected
      for 90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the patient
      initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier). Subjects who discontinue for reasons
      other than disease progression will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until
      end of study disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing
      consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed by telephone for
      overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the Investigator is notified by
      Sanford Research to discontinue follow-up
