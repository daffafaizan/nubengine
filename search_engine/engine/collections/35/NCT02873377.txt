    
      A two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial will be conducted with up to 15 construction
      sites, selected from one Construction Company in south Florida. Cluster randomization is used
      with construction site chosen as the unit of allocation because it is most practical in this
      setting and minimizes the risk of spillover effects from the intervention to the control
      group. In conjunction with the site's safety manager, the investigators will recruit 9 adult
      Hispanic construction workers per site (126 total) who smoke â‰¥5 cigarettes/day in the last
      year. Participants in the enhanced care will receive one culturally adapted brief
      face-to-face behavioral counseling session developed in phase 1 and delivered at a lunch
      truck, two brief follow-up phone counseling calls, fax referral to the Florida quitline (QL),
      and provision of up to 6 weeks of free NRT. Participants in the standard care will receive
      fax referral to the Florida QL, and provision of up to 8 weeks of free NRT.
