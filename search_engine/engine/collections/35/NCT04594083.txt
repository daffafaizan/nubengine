    
      Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the ShotBlocker and Palm
      Stimulator, developed by researchers for reducing pain during intramuscular (IM) injections
      in children.

      Design: The study was conducted via a randomized controlled design. Setting: The study
      population consisted of children in the seven to 10 age group admitted to the emergency
      department of a public hospital (Kahta State Hospital) between February 2019 and July 2019
      and who received an IM injection as part of the medical treatment.

      Interventions: The study data were collected from the children, who were divided into Palm
      Stimulator, ShotBlocker, and control groups.

      Main outcome measures: The children's pre-procedure fear levels were evaluated using the
      Children's Fear Scale (CFS), and their pain levels during the procedure were evaluated using
      the Facial Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). The children also reported injection-related pain
      levels using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
