    
      The Cupola system is a non-invasive device for pigment/tattoo removal based on ultrasound
      technology. The safety of the device was demonstrated in a previous pilot study approved by
      the Herzog Helsinki committee #167-09, Ministry of Health April 2010 #HT-5293) showing that
      no risk was associated with the procedure.

      This study is designed to determine the efficacy of the device for tattoo removal in up to 6
      treatments in different treatment intervals. Three areas of the tattoo that are similar in
      size, color, and intensity will be chosen. One area will not be treated; the second will
      receive 6 treatments in 2-3 week intervals; the third will receive 3 treatments in 4-6 week
      intervals. The evaluations will include color measurements, photography, subject comfort and
      skin condition.
