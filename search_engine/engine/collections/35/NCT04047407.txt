    
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic painful, non-inflammatory rheumatic disease with a high
      negative impact on the quality of life, and is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue and
      generalised hyperalgesia on examination, symptoms that can be the consequence of central
      sensitization.

      Despite several methods have successfully addressed this increased responsiveness of
      nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system, there is a lack of consensus about how to
      systematically perform them and those that are more appropriated for different syndromes.
      Therefore, investigating appropriate simple methods to assess clinical manifestations of
      central sensitization is relevant in the assessment of fibromyalgia.

      The present study aims to investigate the pain response after suprathreshols pressure
      stimulation in fibromyalgia subjects compared with healthy volunteers.
