    
      Primary outcome:

      1. To determine the change in knee joint function and physical performance in adults with
      obesity and knee osteoarthritis treated for 6 months with oligofructose-enriched inulin or
      placebo.

      Secondary outcomes:

        1. To determine the change in knee pain in adults with obesity and knee osteoarthritis
           treated for 6 months with oligofructose-enriched inulin or placebo.

        2. To examine the change in body composition (fat mass and lean mass) in participants
           treated with oligofructose-enriched inulin or placebo.

        3. To evaluate the change in quality of life in participants treated with
           oligofructose-enriched inulin or placebo.

        4. To gain a mechanistic understanding of the influence of oligofructose-enriched inulin
           supplementation in metabolic OA through examination of gut microbiota composition and
           short-chain fatty acid concentrations.

        5. To gain a mechanistic understanding of the influence of oligofructose-enriched inulin
           supplementation in metabolic OA through examination of serum inflammatory and
           metabolomics markers.
