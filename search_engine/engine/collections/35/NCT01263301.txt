      who suffered from acute brain stem stroke after receiving hemodialysis for months. He has DM
      related uremia and the vascular access is in the forearm. Subclavian steal was found on
      duplex in the same arm for hemodialysis. We used standard cuff test for diagnosis of
      subclavian steal by carotid duplex examination. Accidentally, we found the flow of subclavian
      artery was back to normal when the cuff is on that stops the flow. We want to see if this
      phenomenon can be used to serve as a differential diagnostic tool for differentiation of
      subclavian steal caused by stenosis of subclavian artery or due to DASS.
