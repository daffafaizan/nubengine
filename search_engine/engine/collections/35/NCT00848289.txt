      susceptibility to tobacco carcinogenesis as predictors of bladder cancer risk. We will
      measure susceptibility to tobacco carcinogenesis and this will include studies of the genetic
      modulation of carcinogen activation and detoxification and of chromosome sensitivity to
      tobacco mutagens.
