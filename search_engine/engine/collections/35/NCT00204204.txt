    
      We plan to study approximately 200 road accidents with multitraumatised patients and
      accidents with modern cars and severe material damage with little or moderate damage to
      persons inside the vehicle. A researcher will be alerted by the call centre (Norwegian
      911-equivalent), move to the place of accident and take a pure observers role (unless
      ethically unacceptable due to lack of other health personnel). He will document the accident
      including use and condition of safety features, conditions inside the coupe, weather
      conditions, etc. Other available information on the vehicles, crashtests etc will be gathered
      from the manufacturer. All medical information will be gathered from the ambulance service,
      hospitals, pathology and forensic departments. Information from police and fire department
      will also be gathered.

      Patient, next-of-kin, others invloved will be interviewed as appropriate in follow-up.

      Four accident groups: Front-to-front or -object > 60 km/hour, same < 60 km/hour, car rolled
      over on road, car rolled over out-of-road. Factors: Age of vehicle, damage to coupe, cause of
      accident, on-scene time, initial evaluation by health personnel, injury severity scoring in
      hospital.
