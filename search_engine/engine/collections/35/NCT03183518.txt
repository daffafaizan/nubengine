      positive control are applied under a semi-occlusive patch to the upper back of each subject.
      The first phase of the study is an Induction Phase; a controlled amount of each product is
      applied under a semi-occlusive patch. The patch will remain on the skin for 24 (±2) hours
      during this phase. Following patch removal the patch site will be exposed to ultraviolet - A
      (UVA) radiation and re-assessed 24 hours later prior to re-application of another
      semi-occlusive patch (with both the products) to the same site. The Induction phase will last
      3 weeks. After a subject completes the Induction Phase they will enter a Rest Phase of 2
      weeks duration, during which no patches will be applied. After the Rest Phase, subjects will
      return to the clinical site for the Challenge Phase. In the Challenge phase two test patches
      will be applied to virgin skin areas on each subjects' upper back for 24 hours. Following
      removal of both patches, one of the Challenge patch test sites will be exposed to UVA
      radiation. Both Challenge patch test sites will be assessed up until 72 (±2) hours later.
