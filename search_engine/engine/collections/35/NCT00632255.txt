      to therapy,pharmacological levels of imatinib and the prevalence of side effects. We expect
      to be able to correlate the actual dose received, the pharmacological levels of drug in
      blood, with the change in the level of residual disease (measured by Q-PCR) at various time
      points. We also want to gain insight into the relationship between compliance to therapy and
      specific side effects and between compliance and duration of treatment. We will also assess
      the adherence to imatinib therapy after increases in the drug dose that are part of standard
      treatment.
