      which is the traditional method for evaluating patients with suspected blockages or narrowing
      of the heart vessels (coronary artery disease) causing impaired blood to flow to the heart
      muscle (myocardium).

      The purpose of the study is to determine and compare the newest heart imaging equipment which
      allows the non-invasive evaluation of coronary anatomy, coronary flow and myocardial
      perfusion in patients with suspected or proven coronary artery disease (CAD) with the actual
      gold-standard for quantitative myocardial perfusion assessment. In order to achieve this aim,
      the study team will compare heart scan results from a computed tomography (CT) Myocardial
      Perfusion Imaging (CT-MPI) scan and CT-Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) with the actual standard
      clinical care represented by a PET Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (PET-MPI) study.
