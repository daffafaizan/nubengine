    
      This randomized, controlled, double-blinded phase 2 trial will assess the efficacy and safety
      of Anti- SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma as prophylaxis following exposure to COVID-19 (as
      defined in the inclusion criteria). Adults 18 years of age and older with high risk exposure
      as defined by CDC may participate. A total of 500 eligible subjects will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either high titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma or control (SARS-CoV-2
      non-immune plasma).
