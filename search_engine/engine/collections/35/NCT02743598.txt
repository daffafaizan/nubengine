      cognitive impairment. Considering the synergistic effects of HIV and DM on cognition, these
      subjects are at increased risk of cognitive impairment. glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
      receptors have wide tissue distribution including the central nervous system. The study
      hypothesis is that GLP-1 could potentially ameliorate the impairments in cognition in this
      population. This study will assess the impact of liraglutide on neurocognitive performance
      and peripheral inflammatory markers. It will also evaluate the effects of liraglutide on
      glycemic control and metabolic risk factors in HIV infected subjects with type 2 diabetes.
