      to allow individuals with tetraplegia to interact with their environment using their own
      paralyzed limbs by combining recording of brain activity, brain stimulation to provide
      sensory feedback, and stimulation of the paralyzed extremities based on neural recordings.

      Device Name:

      Reconnecting the Hand and Arm to the Brain (ReHAB) System

      Intended Use The proposed device is intended to allow greater functional independence for
      individuals who are paralyzed due to disease or injury. The purpose of this trial is to
      advance development of a novel technological approach to allow individuals with tetraplegia
      to interact with their environment using their own paralyzed limbs by combining recording of
      brain activity, brain stimulation to provide sensory feedback, and stimulation of the
      paralyzed extremities based on neural recordings.

      The target population are individuals with high tetraplegia, defined as less than antigravity
      weakness of both upper extremities and both lower extremities as a result of an identified
      and static (stable for at least 3 months) injury or disease affecting upper motor neurons
      process that prevents motor neural activity from activating muscles below the neck to perform
      functional activities. Injuries and diseases that lead to this clinical condition include
      spinal cord injury, and stroke.

      Objective(s):

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential
      efficacy of an approach combining multiple intracortical brain recording/stimulating
      microarrays with direct peripheral nerve and muscle stimulation for restoration of arm and
      hand movement in people with high tetraplegia.

      Secondary objectives include validation of the combined platform described above as a
      clinical device to allow paralyzed individuals to have a more meaningful interaction with
      their environment as assessed by ability to perform brain-controlled reaching and grasping
      tasks that ultimately might allow for greater functional independence.
