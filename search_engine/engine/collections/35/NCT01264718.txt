      Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and minority children are at especially
      high risk. The most effective way to insure uninsured children, however, is unclear.

      Methods: We conducted a randomized trial of the effects of parent mentors (PMs) on insuring
      uninsured minority children. PMs were experienced parents with >=1 Medicaid/CHIP-covered
      child who received 2 days of training, then assisted families for 1 year with insurance
      applications, retaining coverage, medical homes, and social needs; controls received
      traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach. The primary outcome was obtaining insurance 1 year
      post-enrollment.
