        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tirapazamine when administered with paclitaxel,
           carboplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with stage IIB-IIIB non-small cell
           lung cancer.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the response rate and survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tirapazamine.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising tirapazamine IV over 2 hours and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour
      on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, and 39. Beginning on day 1, patients undergo
      radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks. Beginning 4-5 weeks after completion of
      radiotherapy, patients with stable or responding disease receive consolidation chemotherapy
      comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tirapazamine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
