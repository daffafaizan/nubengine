      Primary

        -  Determine whether administration of a daily dose of riluzole results in tumor shrinkage,
           as measured by RECIST criteria, in patients with advanced melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the long-term toxicity of riluzole when administered to these patients.

        -  Compare the survival of these patients with historical controls.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
