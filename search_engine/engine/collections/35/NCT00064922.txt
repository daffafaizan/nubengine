      drug) use during pregnancy or in post-partum women with children under 1 year of age living
      with them, or in non-pregnant females who smoke. We are targeting smoking cessation since
      cigarette use is so prevalent in our service. We will compare a control group to two
      different voucher-based contingent-reinforcement procedures: one that targets smoking
      abstinence alone vs. one that offers additional incentives for negative BAL and urinalysis
      results.
