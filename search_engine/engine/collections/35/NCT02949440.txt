    
      To compare the caudal-to-cranial approach with the medial-to-lateral approach in laparoscopic
      right hemicolectomy for the advance right colon cancer.

      A prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed in the GI department,the
      Guangdong provincial hospital of Chinese Medicine from October 2016 to October 2024.The
      sample size，150 cases with advanced right colon cancer, will be needed after calculated by
      the statistics .The 150 cases will be randomly divided into two groups: laparoscopic radical
      right hemicolectomy using the caudal-to-cranial(CtC) approach(GroupCtC) and laparoscopic
      radical right hemicolectomy using the medial-to-lateral(MtL) approach (GroupMtL). Primary
      outcomes are the operative time，The secondary outcomes are the total blood loss,the number of
      lymph nodes dissected,the average time of ground activities,the time to first flatus,the
      hospital stay,the intra-operative complication and the post-operative complication，and
      others' outcomes are the Disease-free survival rate(DFS) at 3 years and 5 years,the Overall
      survival rate（OS）at 3 years and 5 years.The data in two groups will be compared.
