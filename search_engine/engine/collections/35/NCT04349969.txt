      (Part A), a dose escalation phase for estimating the optimal maintenance dose (Part B), and a
      dose expansion phase (Part C). The 3 parts will be conducted sequentially. Approximately 159
      subjects (up to 27 subjects in Part A, up to 72 subjects in Part B, and up to approximately
      60 subjects in Part C) will be enrolled in this study.
