      study. A minimum of 4 small intestinal biopsies will be taken from all subjects and controls.
      All TTG specimens will be run through the hospital laboratory. Intermediate level TTG values
      20-100 will be assessed separately and as part of the larger group. An optional part B of the
      study will assess the frequency of lactose intolerance in subjects prior to the start of a
      gluten free diet.
