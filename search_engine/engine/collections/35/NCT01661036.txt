      (DCCPS), Behavioral Research Program (BRP) proposes conducting formative research as an
      integral part of the development of a new data collection instrument, the Family Life,
      Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) survey. Specifically, NCI proposes conducting
      cognitive testing with the objective of identifying potential sources of measurement or
      response errors within the questionnaires. Many of the questions are new questions that have
      not been previously tested, or previously-used questions that have never been used with a
      teenage population.
