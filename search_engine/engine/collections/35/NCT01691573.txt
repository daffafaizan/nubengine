      has become first-line therapy for managing many pediatric patients with atrioventricular
      accessory pathway or atrioventricular nodal-mediated supraventricular tachycardia.

      Cardiac ablation in children is not a standardized procedure as in adults as evidence gaps
      still have to be filled. On a European perspective, lack of a dedicated scientific society
      has limited so far the collection and sharing of data among the most experienced centers.

      Actually there are no sufficient data available about the management of pediatric patients
      undergoing ablation in clinical practice, in particular regarding indications, methodology
      and clinical follow-up.
