      the efficacy of providing tailored physical activity computer reports to patients and
      physicians. The primary outcome is minutes of physical activity measured by the 7-Day
      Physical Activity Recall interview at 6 months. The intervention group completed physical
      activity surveys at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Based on their responses, participants
      received four feedback reports at each time point. The reports aimed to motivate participants
      to increase physical activity, personalized to participants' needs; they also included an
      activity prescription. The control group received identical procedures, except that they
      received general reports on preventive screening based on their responses to preventive
      screening questions.
