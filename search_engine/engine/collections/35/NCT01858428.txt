      which will include up to 360 subjects in approximately forty-five (45) sites across the
      United States to evaluate the CVI Paclitaxel-coated PTA Catheter compared to the bare
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter (bare balloon catheter) for the
      treatment of de-novo or post-PTA occluded/stenotic or reoccluded/restenotic (except for
      in-stent) SFA and/or popliteal arteries.
