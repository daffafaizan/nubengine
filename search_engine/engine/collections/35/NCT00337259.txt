      B-cell lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma needs novel agent to improve clinical course by
      chemotherapy. Recent trials with new agents for indolent lymphoma shows promising results.
      Gemcitabine is known to have activity to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and has less adverse effects
      than other new agents. With this background gemcitabine will be tried as a single agent for
      advanced marginal zone lymphoma.

      Gemcitabine will be administered with 1,250mg/sq.m on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Response
      will be assessed by IWC criteria.
