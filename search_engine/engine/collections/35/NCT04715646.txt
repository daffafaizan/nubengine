    
      EP0156 is designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of brivaracetam (BRV) from
      pediatric study participants with epilepsy who participated in the study in neonates, N01349
      [NCT03325439], and/or the ongoing, open-label, long-term, follow-up study in pediatric study
      participants, N01266 [NCT01364597], who have the opportunity to continue BRV treatment by
      participating in EP0156.

      EP0156 is also designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV from directly
      enrolled (DE) Japanese pediatric study participants with partial-onset seizures (POS)
      recruited in Japan. In the DE study participants only, pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be
      evaluated in addition to the safety and tolerability of BRV.
