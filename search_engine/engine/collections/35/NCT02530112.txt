      procedures,perioperative measures (such as use of perioperative blood transfusion or
      pressors), and outcomes for cancer control and free flap survival. This sub-protocol, in
      conjunction with protocol #816676 (Otorhinolaryngology Research Registry) will serve as a
      hypothesis generating study for future research on reconstructive free flap surgery outcomes
      by narrowing down existing questionnaires to tailor it specifically for these patients.
