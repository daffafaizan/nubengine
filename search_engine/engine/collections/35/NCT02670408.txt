      ISHLT classification from 2004, which represents a widely-used international consensus, based
      on morphological criteria of the cellular infiltrate within the myocardial specimen system
      with certainties and some arbitrary and blurred parameters. Recent data-driven approaches
      using molecular and conventional technologies indicate that this system produces incorrect
      diagnoses with potential harm to patients due to inappropriate treatment. To address this
      unmet need and improve diagnostics in the area of organ transplantation, the Alberta
      Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC, University of Alberta) has developed a new
      diagnostic system - the Molecular Microscope™ Diagnostic System (MMDx) that interprets
      biopsies in terms of their molecular phenotype, and combines the molecular and
      histopathological features of transplant biopsies, plus clinical and laboratory parameters,
      to create the first Integrated Diagnostic System. The MMDx developed first in kidney
      transplant biopsies because phenotypes are well established, will now be adapted to heart
      transplant endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs). The present study will develop a Reference Set of
      EMB, adapt the MMDx™ system to assess and report EMBs; and validate and refine this system in
      900 unselected prospectively collected for clinical indications and a standard of care EMBs
      from North American and European Centers. In addition to demonstrating the real-time
      feasibility and potential value of this System in patient care, the study will develop and
      optimize a transparent and user-friendly reporting format to communicate this information to
      clinicians and obtain detailed feedback to improve its utility. We refine now our MMDx system
      using a new type of analysis (see primary outcome) and the resulting MMDx report. Currently,
      INTERHEART recruited 889 biopsies from 454 patients.
