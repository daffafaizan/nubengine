      dose-dependent fashion. Smokers seem to be characterized by central obesity, increased
      inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, which may lead to insulin resistance and
      irregularities in glucose metabolism. The current study is a meal test study, in which the
      aim is to examine a number of variables during a liquid mixed meal test (including gastric
      emptying, glucose tolerance, gut and pancreatic hormone responses, gall bladder emptying,
      appetite and food intake) performed in healthy non-smoking subjects and in healthy smokers
      with or without concomitant cigarette smoking.

      The investigators hypothesize that smoking-induced increases in circulating nicotine levels
      and simultaneous activation of nicotinic receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and in the
      autonomic nervous system would have detrimental effect on postprandial glucose metabolism
      and, thus, constitute an important link between smoking and the risk of type 2 diabetes. The
      current study will help to clarify this hypothesis and improve our general understanding of
      the association between smoking and gut hormone secretion, gastric emptying and glucose
      metabolism.
