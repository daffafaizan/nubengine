      administration of amifostine in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. IV
      administration of amifostine is 200 mg/m2/day in a short 3-min infusion 15 to 30 min before
      each fraction of radiotherapy. SC administration is 500mg/day in two slow 1.25 ml injections
      at two different sites 20 to 60 min before each radiotherapy fraction. Procedure requires
      antiemetic treatment and blood pressure monitoring in both arms.
