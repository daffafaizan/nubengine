      setting. Patients with burn wounds will be screened for enrollment. All burn wounds that are
      not clearly full thickness on clinical assessment will be treated the first 48 to 72 hours
      with a hydrocolloid gel (Flaminal®) combined with Vaseline gauze. Wounds will be photographed
      on a daily basis. In order to obtain an optimal preparation for Laser Doppler imaging, the
      burn wounds will be meticulously debrided during dressing changes. Patients whose burn wound
      meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either phototherapy with the Embar®
      light therapy or sham irradiation. Disinfection and topical treatment of the wounds will be
      the same in both groups as well as the treatment regimen after wound closure with special
      pressure garments and hydration.

      Clinical wound assessments, wound tracings (if possible) and digital photographs will be
      conducted at least twice a week till wound healing. Swabs will be taken on admission, the day
      after laser Doppler imaging and from then on a weekly basis. Primary endpoint is complete
      epithelialization of the wound, secondary endpoint is maturation of the scar after one year.
      Follow-Ups will be performed one, three, six and twelve months after wound closure. The
      treatment regimen will consist of custom made pressure garments and hydration of the scar.
      Objective methods will be used during these follow-ups to evaluate elasticity and color of
      the scar, this by using the Dermalab and the Dermaspectrometer, as well as the Vancouver Scar
      Scale, a subjective method.
