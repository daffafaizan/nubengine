      standard healthcare delivery system.

      The investigators and collaborators have developed an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention
      for primary care called Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC). MTPC combines common
      Mindfulness-Based Intervention skills with additional attention to patient/provider
      relationships, cultural and socio-economic diversity, coping with chronic illness, reducing
      unnecessary medical care, and encouraging self-management skills acquisition.

      This project addresses important gaps in the current mindfulness research and delivery system
      by evaluating the integration of the novel MTPC model into a system of urban, community,
      multi-cultural, safety-net Patient-Centered Medical Homes.

      In this pilot randomized controlled trial, the investigators compare the effectiveness of
      8-week MTPC versus a 60-minute introduction to mindfulness plus referral to community
      mindfulness resources for primary care patients on behavioral health outcomes of anxiety,
      depression, stress, and self-management of chronic illness. The investigators are also
      testing the effect of MTPC on rates of initiation and maintenance of health action plans that
      patients collaborate on with their primary care provider during study Week 6 . This study
      also enrolls primary care providers who have participated in various levels of mindfulness
      training, i.e., 16-hour and 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction and 10-month mindful
      communication vs. no training.

      Outcome assessments are conducted at baseline and study week 8. An action-planning visit with
      PCPs occurs at week 6 with follow-up during week 8 (initiation) and interview at study week
      24 (maintenance).
