      undergoing breast surgery. The first type is called "general anesthesia" (GA) which is when a
      person "goes to sleep" with a breathing tube and then receives intravenous (IV) pain medicine
      during and after surgery to minimize surgical pain. The other type of anesthesia is called
      "regional anesthesia" (RA), or "nerve blocks" which numb up the nerves that supply the breast
      area. By doing this type of anesthesia, subjects often don't go "to sleep" with a breathing
      tube, instead, they get heavy IV sedation and take a "deep nap" during the surgery.
