      symptomatology immediately prior to and for up to one year following surgical resection and
      reconstruction head and neck malignancies.Patients with head and neck malignancies that
      require simultaneous surgical resection and reconstruction of the ablative defect will be
      eligible to participate.Quality of life and symptom relief will be evaluated by both domain
      and disease specific questionnaires at four time points: pre-operatively, and 3 months (±1
      month), 6 months (±1), and 9 months (-1 and +3) post-operatively. These assessment points
      represent clinically significant events in patients' post-operative course following head and
      neck surgery. Studies have shown that quality of life decreases significantly at three months
      after surgery but then reapproaches baseline levels around one year (1). Pre-operative
      responses will serve as the baseline for comparison.
