      I. To evaluate the feasibility of correlating changes in the number of circulating tumor
      cells in metastatic breast cancer patients with time to progression following
      hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all known sites (=< 5) of disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival, overall survival, pattern of failure, and
      toxicity of hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all active sites (=< 5) of
      metastatic disease.

      II. To assess the feasibility of the Interferon-Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature
      (IRDS) for its predictive value in treatment failure, both in and out of the radiation field.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients with metastases in the lung, liver, abdomen, and extremities undergo 10 fractions or
      less of hypofractionated radiation therapy and patients with brain metastases undergo a
      single fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 2 months, at
      3 months, every 3 months for a year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
