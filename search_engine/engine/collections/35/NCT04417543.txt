      of associated comorbid health conditions that can have significant health and quality-of-life
      implications. Of these comorbidities, cognitive impairment is one of the most common and
      distressing aspects of epilepsy.

      Excito-toxicity, mediated by glutamate acting on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the
      hippocampus, can cause memory dysfunction in epilepsy .

      Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA-type
      glutamate receptor . It also has antioxidant property and increases production of brain
      derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)
