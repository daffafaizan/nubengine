    
      Eligible to this study were patients less than 18 years old, presenting with non Burkitt,
      aggressive, CD20 positive PTLD, after solid organ transplants.

      Induction therapy consisted of two cycles of a combination of Fludarabine(30mg/sqm/day, days
      1,2,3), Cyclophosphamide (750 mg/sqm/day, day 1), Doxorubicin (30 mg/sqm/day, day 1)and
      Rituximab (375 mg/sqm/day, day 4).

      Thereafter consolidation therapy was given as follows: two blocks for stage II or III with
      LDH less than 500 IU/L; three blocks for stage III with LDH >500 and < 1000 IU/L or stage IV
      with LDH < 1000 IU/L; four blocks for stage III or IV with LDH > 1000 IU/L. Blocks given were
      modified BFM blocks used for treatment of non Hodgkin B-lymphomas, as follows:

      Block 1: High Dose Methotrexate (HDMTX) 1.5 gr/sqm; Vincristine (VCR,1.5 mg/sqm); Cytarabine
      (from 120 to 150 mg/sqm x4); Ifosfamide (600 mg/sqm/day x5); VP-16 (80 mg/sqm/day x2);
      Dexamethasone (DXM,10 mg/sqm/day for 5 ays); Intrathecal
      Methotrexate-Cytarabine-Methylprednisolone(TIT).

      Block 2:HDMTX (3 gr/sqm); VCR (1.5 mg/sqm); Daunomycin (20 mg/sqm/day x2); Cyclophosphamide
      (160 mg/sqm/day x5); DXM (10 mg/sqm/day x5); TIT

      Block 3:Vindesine (3 mg/sqm); Cytarabine (3000 mg/sqm q 12 hours x4); VP-16 (100 mg/sqm q 12
      hours x4); DXM (20 mg/sqm/day x5);

      Block 4 as Block 1.

      Outcome measures are: achievement of complete remission after induction therapy; incidence of
      infectious episodes; neurological toxicity; incidence of graft rejection; duration of
      complete remission.
