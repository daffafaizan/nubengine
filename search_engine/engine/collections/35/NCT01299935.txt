      evaluation of the effects of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program compared to health
      education (HE) on secondary prevention of clinical events in African American men and women
      with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients (N=201; mean age 59 yrs) were enrolled with
      documented CAD (i.e., coronary angiogram showing at least one artery with > 50% stenosis).
      Patients were pretested at baseline and every 6-12 months for the duration of the study for
      incidence of clinical events, BP, BMI, medication usage, lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial
      stress factors and intervention compliance. Subjects were followed for a maximum of 9.2 years
      (mean 5.4 years). The investigators hypothesize that a selected stress reduction
      intervention, the TM program compared with a health education control may significantly
      reduce risk for death, MI and stroke in African American men and women with CHD. If
      successful, the Transcendental Meditation program may be clinically useful in the secondary
      prevention of cardiovascular disease in a high-risk population.
