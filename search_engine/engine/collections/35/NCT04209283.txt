      memories will be logged for monitoring their frequency in a daily diary for the following
      weeks. Baseline assessment questionnaires will also administered. In the second session, a
      memory will be selected and targeted with the intervention (memory reminder followed by 25
      min gameplay with mental rotation) followed by monitoring the frequency of both the targeted
      and non-targeted intrusive memories. Participants will also complete self-rated questions
      concerning the impact of their intrusive memories. The intervention session will be repeated
      for other intrusive memories (maximum 6 intervention sessions). In the last intervention
      session, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and self-rated questions
      assessing the impact of their intrusive memories. Participants will be asked to complete
      measures at 1 month follow-up and at 3 month follow-up. In the 1 month follow-up,
      participants complete questionnaires and monitor the frequency of intrusive memories for one
      week. In the 3 month follow-up, participants will be contacted via telephone to give an
      estimation of the frequency of intrusive memories in the previous week and answer questions
      about the impact associated with their intrusive memories.
