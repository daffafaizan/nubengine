      patients with recurrent oligodendroglial tumors after radiation therapy. II. Assess the
      objective response and duration of response of these patients given this treatment. III.
      Characterize the acute side effects of temozolomide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide on days
      1-5. Courses are repeated every 28 days. Treatment continues for a maximum of 12 courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3
      months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
