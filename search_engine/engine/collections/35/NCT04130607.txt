      hypothesis generation to generate diagnostic possibilities, followed by hypothesis
      verification to confirm the most likely diagnostic possibility.3-5 The first step appears to
      be non-analytical, related to pattern recognition. The second step could be calculated using
      analytical reasoning, however, physicians rarely make an overt calculation of conditional
      probabilities. Instead, experienced clinicians typically use an implicit habit or heuristic
      called "anchoring and adjusting" to incorporate diagnostic testing information into their
      thinking.6,7 Cognitive psychologists have postulated that anchoring and adjusting provides a
      way that probability estimates can be updated based on additional new evidence. Most of the
      discussion in the literature focuses on how this heuristic can lead to biased thinking
      because of base-rate neglect or anchoring.6 Very little discussion is on how this heuristic
      could be improved to yield more accurate probability estimates and whether proper use of the
      heuristic could be taught.

      The degree to which a diagnostic test should lead to an adjustment of a probability estimate
      depends on the operating characteristics of a test, that is, the sensitivity and specificity.
      Likelihood ratios, once understood, are easier to incorporate into one's thinking, and thus
      could be used to calibrate the anchoring and adjusting heuristic.7

      In this randomized trial, we tested whether explicit conceptual instruction on Bayesian
      reasoning and likelihood ratios would improve Bayesian updating, compared with a second
      intervention where we provided multiple (27) examples of clinical problem solving. The third
      arm provided minimal teaching about diagnosis, but no explicit teaching or examples.
