      pro-fibrosis factor levels and downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation with disease
      activity in patients with macular edema or fibrosis secondary to any underlying disease.

      120 patients will be enrolled from both the clinic and OR, with the latter patients
      undergoing surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
      with Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment without PVR,
      macular pucker, or macular hole. Clinic patients must be receiving an intraocular injection
      of a steroid as part of standard of care for macular edema or progressive fibrosis.

      Surgical patients will receive an anterior chamber (AC) tap at the beginning of surgery,
      while clinic patients will receive an AC tap prior to the intraocular injection of steroid
      with a second AC tap at a follow-up visit 6 +/- 2 weeks after the first injection. The
      aqueous sample will then be analyzed by measuring the levels of various pro-permeability and
      pro-fibrosis factors and/or their downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation.

      We will also determine the correlation between reductions in foveal thickness or improvements
      in visual acuity with changes in the aqueous levels of pro-permeability and pro-fibrosis
      factors from baseline to week 6 in the clinic group.
