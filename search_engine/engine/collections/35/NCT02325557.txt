      dose-determining trial of ADX31-142 monotherapy in subjects with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The dose determining phase is intended to
      select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Part B.

      Part B of the study will be an open-label, Phase 1-2, multicenter, non-randomized
      dose-determining trial of ADXS31-142 in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in subjects
      with mCRPC. Part B will consist of a dose-determination phase followed by an expansion cohort
      phase. The dose-determining phase is intended to select a RP2D for the combination.

      Dose escalation/de-escalation for this study will be explored by applying the mTPI design.
