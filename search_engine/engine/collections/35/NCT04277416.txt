      Ortho Development® Corporation's Entrada™ Hip System (Figure 1). The Entrada™ Hip System was
      fully introduced to the US market in July, 2018. The Entrada™ Hip System includes the
      Entrada™ Hip Stem, an FDA approved (510(K) # K171249) femoral stem coupled with either a
      cobalt chrome or Biolox® Delta Ceramic femoral head. Additionally, the stem and head are
      coupled with either the Escalade® or Legend® acetabular shell, both of which utilize highly
      cross-linked polyethylene liners.
