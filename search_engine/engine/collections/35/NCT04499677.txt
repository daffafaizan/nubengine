    
      FLARE is a phase IIA randomised, double-blind, 2x2 factorial placebo-controlled,
      interventional trial in which 240 participants, aged 18 years (â‰¥ 18 years) to 70 years old
      inclusive will be recruited. Participants will be adults who have developed the early
      symptoms of COVID-19 within the first 5 days, or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the
      first 7 days of symptom onset, or not presenting symptoms but tested positive within the last
      48 hours (date/time of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment).

      Eligible participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive one of the following
      combinations:

      Favipiravir + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (both active); Favipiravir active +
      Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) placebo; Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)
      active; Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) placebo;

      All participants will be enrolled and followed up for 28 days. A saliva sample for
      virological analysis and safety blood samples will be collected at baseline, as well as a
      diagnostic nose and throat swab, if the participant hasn't been tested for COVID-19 yet.
      Following randomisation, participants will take trial medication for 7 days and during this
      period will take a daily saliva sample and complete a symptoms diary including four daily
      temperature measurements.

      Participants will have two follow-up visits at Day 7 and Day 14 where they will be assessed
      and undergo blood tests for toxicity and pharmacokinetic assessment (on Day 7 only) and
      provide stool samples. Participants will have a telephone follow up three (3) weeks after
      their last day of treatment (Day 7) and further information will be collected through a
      questionnaire.
