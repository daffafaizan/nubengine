      arms. Conversely, a center may choose to participate in only a single arm. The enrollment
      goal is approximately 36 - 72 cases per center for Cohort 1 (cementless) and 15 - 30 cases
      per center for Cohort 2 (cemented) , and will vary dependent upon the number of participating
      centers. Although a goal is presented, there is no maximum limit to the number of cases that
      a center may enroll. In the event that a center far exceeds the enrollment goal, Stryker may
      ask the center to cease enrollment so as not to skew the data. All participating centers will
      comply with the federal regulations regarding patient informed consent and Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) approval. Non-compliance of a study center may
      result in termination of the center's participation in the study.
