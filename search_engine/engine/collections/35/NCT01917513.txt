    
      This is a multicenter, two-arm, randomized, open-label study intended to compare the
      detection rate obtained by performing G-EYE™ high definition colonoscopy vs. the detection
      rate obtained by performing high definition standard colonoscopy.

      The study will enroll 1000 subjects. Consecutive adult subjects who were referred for
      elective colonoscopy will be asked to enroll into this randomized clinical study if the
      candidate meets the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Subjects will sign informed consent form and undergo randomization. The study includes a
      run-in preliminary phase of 270 patients to allow physicians to get familiar with the G-EYE™
      endoscope.
