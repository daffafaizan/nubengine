      number of mature (MII) oocytes, these oocytes will be fertilized by Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm
      Injection (ICSI). If a patient has been randomized to the study group, all inseminated
      oocytes and subsequently all fertilized diploid (2PN) zygotes will be placed in the
      CultureCoin and then into the MIRI-TL Time-lapse incubator and cultured as per normal
      protocol to the blastocyst stage (Day 5/6 or 7). Top quality blastocyst(s) will be
      transferred and monitored for implantation, pregnancy and ongoing birth. Embryo transfers
      will either occur in a fresh or frozen embryo transfer cycle.
