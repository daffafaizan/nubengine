      participant is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an
      inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical
      trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), and single-center study. The study
      will consist of Screening Period (2 to 21 days prior to participants' dose administration),
      Double-blind Treatment Period (single dose of JNJ-49122944 or placebo on Day 1), and Safety
      Follow-up Period (4 to 7 days after discharge). The total duration of participation for each
      participant, including screening, will be up to approximately 4 weeks. Blood samples will be
      collected for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
