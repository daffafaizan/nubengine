      neuropathic pain. These observed effects of ralfinamide may have been achieved by targeting
      both hyperactivity of peripheral sensory neurons, through voltage-dependent, Na+-channel
      blockade [Stummann et al., 2005] and Ca++-channel blockade, and sensitization of central
      neurons, through NMDA-receptor modulation.

      Evidence of efficacy in mixed peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes has been demonstrated in
      Study 001 [Anand et al., 2008]. In particular patients with neuropathic pain due to nerve
      compression (e.g., compression radiculopathy, lumbar spinal stenosis, sciatic nerve
      compression, spinal root compression, intercostal neuralgia) showed response to ralfinamide
      treatment. In this sub-population, statistically significant improvements in severity of
      pain, as measured on the VAS and 11-point Likert scales, as well as a greater proportion of
      patients meeting "responder" criteria, compared to the placebo group, were noted with
      ralfinamide treatment. Similarly, patients in the study classified as having neuropathic low
      back pain also showed significant benefit from treatment with ralfinamide; therefore, the
      focus of the current study is on this indication.

      The current study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and analgesic efficacy of
      ralfinamide in patients with chronic neuropathic low back pain due to nerve compression,
      i.e., compression radiculopathy or post-traumatic/post-surgical lumbar radiculopathy. It
      should also be noted that no current drug therapy has global regulatory approval for treating
      this type of chronic neuropathic low back pain; therefore, should ralfinamide prove effective
      in this patient population, it would be satisfying an unmet medical need.
