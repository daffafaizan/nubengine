      demonstrated retrospectively on small cohort studies, which is in line with our clinical
      experience. Although this therapeutic concept seems applicable to patients with spondylitis,
      the theoretical clinical benefit of minimally invasive surgery remains hypothetic and unclear
      compared to brace treatment, which might still be regarded as the gold standard.
