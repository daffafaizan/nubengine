      with significant beneficial effect on TTP in some studies, but the beneficial effect on OS
      remains uncertain. In the present study, we hypothesized that the GALNT14 genotype might play
      a role in this issue. Our pilot study indicated that GALNT14 "TT" genotype was associated
      with a favorable complete response rate in patients treated by TACE alone. This genotype was
      present in ~ 25% of Chinese population coming from Taiwan, Colorado (US), or Beijing (China),
      and in ~ 7% of Italian population. But it was present in ~ 50% of Japanese population. The
      lower percentage of a TACE - favorable genotype in Chinese and Italian population could
      explain the different results between Japanese and Chinese/Italian clinical trials. It is
      possible that in a population with higher percentage of TACE - favorable genotype (GALNT14
      "TT"), the beneficial effect of sorafenib adjuvant treatment might not be detected. In this
      study, we proposed to examine the TACE + sorafenib effect in patients with GALNT14 "non-TT"
      genotype, a TACE - unfavorable genotype.
