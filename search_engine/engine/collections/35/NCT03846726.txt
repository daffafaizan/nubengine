      chemoradiotherapy followed by a clinical complete response from the year 2010 to 2018 were
      included. Sequential subjects were identified from a prospective maintained database in the
      Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Clinical experts on rectal cancer from other 5 regional
      medical centers in China were also invited to participate, and provided data of cCR patients.
      Standardized forms for data collection were sanded to researchers in each center. Patients
      received radical resection will constituted our surgery group. Those refused surgery
      constituted the observation group who went on with the watch and wait approach. A
      propensity-score matched observational analysis will be used to compare the oncological
      outcome of these two groups.
