      same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), & hence named as
      SARS-CoV-2. It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence that is 75%-80%
      identical to that of SARS-CoV. Since its first discovery in Wuhan, China in late December, it
      has now become a pandemic disease claiming more than nine hundred forty-five thousand deaths
      world-wide so far. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic, & recovery
      without any treatment. While there is disproportionately higher mortality among elderly &
      people with co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease or any
      immunocompromised status. Recently, several regimens have been tried as antiviral medicine.
      Among these medicines, Favipiravir is considered a broad-spectrum antiviral with spectrum of
      activity noted against a wide range of RNA viruses namely Influenza, West Nile virus, Yellow
      fever virus, Food & mouth virus, Flavivirus, Arenavirus, Bunyavirus & Alpha virus. In the
      USA, Japan & China, it has been approved for use in resistant Influenza. Regarding use of
      Favipiravir in COVID19, there have been some studies with limited data. The earlier Chinese
      study that compared between Favipiravir (35 patients) versus Lopinavir/Ritonavir (45
      patients) among mild to moderate cases showed a trend towards earlier improvement in CT scan
      & quicker viral clearance in Favipiravir arm with lesser side effects comparatively. Another
      randomized clinical trial in China conducted on patients with COVID19 pneumonia (moderate)
      failed to demonstrate a significant difference in clinical recovery rate at day 7 between
      Favipiravir (116 patients) versus Umifenovir (112 patients) however, Favipiravir was
      associated with earlier relief of pyrexia & cough in comparison Another multicenter, open
      label, randomized phase II/III trial conducted in Russia on moderate COVID19 infection
      comparing Favipiravir against standard of care in total 60 patients randomized into three
      treatment groups with 20 patients each: Favipiravir 1600/600 mg, Favipiravir 1800/800 mg, or
      Standard of care (which included, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine versus
      lopinavir/ritonavir versus no etiotropic treatment) concluded that Favipiravir enabled viral
      clearance in 62.5% patients within 4 days with good safety data, no matter which dosing was
      used. There has been an observational study on 2141 patients in Japan that showed good
      recovery among mild (not requiring oxygen), moderate case (requiring oxygen) or younger
      patients (59 years or younger) whereas poor prognosis in severe (requiring mechanical
      ventilation or ECMO) or older patients (60 years or older). The most common adverse events
      were hyperuricemia (335 patients; 15.52%) followed by liver injury or liver function test
      abnormalities (159 patients; 7.37%) in this study. Similarly, the open label randomized ,
      multicenter clinical trial was conducted in 150 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of Favipiravir plus standard supportive care ( Favipiravir treatment arm, versus standard
      supportive care alone ( control arm ) across seven clinical sites in India.

      It was evaluated among mild to moderate patients, randomized within a 48 hours window of
      testing RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 . The patients received Favipiravir tables of 3,600 mg
      (1,800 mg BID) (Day 1) + 1,600 mg (800 mg BID) (Day 2 or later) for up to maximum of 14 days
      , along with standard supportive care . The results from this Phase 3 trial conducted by
      Glenmark showed numerical improvement for the primary efficacy endpoint with 28.6% faster
      viral clearance in the overall population (Hazard Ratio 1.367 [95%CI 0.944,1.979]; p=0.129).
      Additionally , 69.8 % of patients in the Favipiravir treatment arm achieved clinical cure by
      Day 4, which was statistically significant compared to 44.9% observed in the control group
      (p=0.019). Likewise, Glenmark's Favipiravir was well tolerated with no serious adverse events
      or death in the Favipiravir treated arm but adverse events were reported in 26 patients in
      Favipiravir treatment arm. However, adverse events were mild to moderate and none led to drug
      discontinuation and dosing adjustments. This trial demonstrated statistically significant
      faster time to clinical improvement with Favipiravir treatment in Mild to moderate COVID-19
      patients compared to the control group. Additionally, An open-label, nonrandomized,
      before-after controlled study was conducted in an isolation ward of the national clinical
      research center for infectious diseases at Shenzhen, China.35 patients was enrolled in the
      FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable
      between the two arms. From 30 January to 14 February 2020, laboratory-confirmed patients with
      COVID-19 were consecutively screened, and eligible patients were included in the FPV arm of
      the study. Patients who had initially been treated with antiviral therapy with LPV/RTV from
      24 January to 30 January 2020 were screened, and eligible patients were included in the
      control arm of the study. The dose was 1600 mg twice daily on Day 1 and 600 mg twice daily on
      Days 2-14. LPV/RTV (AbbVie Inc., 200 mg/50 mg per tablet) were given orally. The dose was LPV
      400 mg/RTV 100 mg twice daily. Both FPV and LPV/RTV were continued until the viral clearance
      was confirmed or until 14 d had passed. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the
      45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two
      arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median
      (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5-9) d versus 11 (8-13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also
      showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an
      improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential
      confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest
      imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with
      faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse events were found in the FPV arm than in
      the control arm.In this open-label before-after controlled study, FPV showed better
      therapeutic responses on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance.These
      preliminary clinical results provide useful information of treatments for SARS-CoV-2
      infection. Doses of Favipiravir ranged widely across studies, from 400 mg up to 6000 mg
      loading doses, with the more common regimens being 1200 mg per day, split into twice or three
      times daily doses. 494 Studies were screened, 55 studies assessed for full text eligibility,
      29 studies were included. Hyperuricemia was shown as the side effects.
