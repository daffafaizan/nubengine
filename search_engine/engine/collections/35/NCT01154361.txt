      a well known side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which may become
      life-threatening if the upper airway is involved. To be note, ACEi induced angioedema were
      always located in the head and neck region.

      The pathophysiology of ACE inhibitor (ACEi) induced angioedema most likely resembles that of
      hereditary angioedema (HAE), i.e. it is mainly mediated by bradykinin induced activation of
      vascular bradykinin B2 receptors (BKR-2). In contrast to an increased bradykinin generation
      in HAE, treatment with ACEi decreases the bradykinin degradation in plasma and increases the
      biological activity of bradykinin.

      The current pharmacotherapy of ACEi induced angioedema is not satisfactory. Antihistamines
      and corticosteroids may be effective in the treatment of urticaria with cutaneous edema and
      itchy, but are theoretically ineffective and hence superfluous in bradykinin induced
      angioedema. However, glucocorticoids still belong to the standard treatment of angioedema.

      We hypothesized that the BKR-2 antagonist icatibant might be an effective therapy for
      ACEi-induced angioedema.

      Patients with ACEi induced angioedema, located in the upper aero-digestive tract will be
      randomized and treated either with icatibant and plazebo or cortisone with clemastin and
      plazebo.
