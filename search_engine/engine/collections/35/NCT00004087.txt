      yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (90Y-hMN-14) plus autologous peripheral blood stem
      cell rescue in patients with metastatic or recurrent colorectal or pancreatic cancer. II.
      Compare the tumor to organ dose ratio between 90Y-hMN-14 and iodine 131 monoclonal antibody
      MN-14 (131I-MN-14) in these patients. III. Determine the antitumor effects with myeloablative
      doses of 90Y-hMN-14. IV. Evaluate the immunogenicity of 90Y-hMN-14 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (90Y-hMN-14),
      multicenter study. Patients are stratified by prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days -18 to -14 and peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC) collection on days -15 to -13. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not harvested,
      bone marrow is also collected. Patients receive pretherapy imaging with indium In 111
      monoclonal antibody MN-14 (IN111-MN-14) IV on days -7 to 0. Patients receive 90Y-hMN-14 for
      up to 40 minutes on day 0. PBSC are reinfused on days 7 to 14. Patients receive G-CSF SQ
      until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y-hMN-14
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which
      2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1-4, 6,
      8, 12, and 24 weeks, and then every 6 months thereafter for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
