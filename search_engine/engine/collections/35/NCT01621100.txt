      the researchers and participants know which treatment is being administered), multicenter
      (conducted at multiple centers), single-arm (only one group), study to evaluate the
      effectiveness and tolerability (capable to tolerate) of Once-Daily OROS hydromorphone for
      cancer pain treatment. This is a 14-week study consisting of 2-week efficacy evaluation
      period (1st evaluation on Day 1 and 2nd evaluation on Days 15Â±2) and a 12-week extension
      phase. 99 patients will receive Once-Daily OROS hydromorphone for 2 weeks .After 2 weeks, if
      a patient has continuous cancer pain and the investigator deems it necessary to administer
      the same medicine as the study medication then the patient may participate voluntarily in the
      12 weeks extension phase. At the extension phase, other continuous-type strong opioid
      analgesics (painkiller) may be administered at the same time for the adjustment of cancer
      pain based on the discretion of the investigator.
