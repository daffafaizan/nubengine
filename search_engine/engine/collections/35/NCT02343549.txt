      patients. The FDA will review safety data of the first 15 patients during enrollment of the
      first cohort. Enrollment and interim analysis of the first cohort of patients will be
      completed within 15 months of study commencement. Upon FDA approval and favorable interim
      analysis followed by subsequent protocol/consent amendment (as applicable), the second stage
      will enroll a cohort of 24 patients and will be completed within 15 months of stage 2
      commencement. The overall duration of the study is expected to be no longer than 30 months.
