    
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single, and multiple oral dose study
      conducted in 2 parts.

      Part A will comprise a single-dose, sequential-group study incorporating a food effect
      evaluation. Up to 48 subjects will be studied in up to 6 groups (Groups A1 to A6), with each
      group consisting of 8 subjects. Each subject will participate in 1 treatment period only and
      reside at the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 7 (144
      hours postdose), except for Group A3, which will participate in a second treatment period for
      a food effect evaluation. Each subject in Group A3 will participate in 2 treatment periods
      separated by a minimum of 7 days. Dosing of subjects in the fed state in Group A3 can
      commence after review of the safety data from Group A4.

      Part B will comprise a multiple-dose, sequential-group study. Up to 36 subjects will be
      studied in up to 3 groups (Groups B1 to B3), with each group consisting of 12 subjects. Part
      B of the study may start after completion of Group A5, at a dose equal or less than given in
      Groups A1 to A3.
