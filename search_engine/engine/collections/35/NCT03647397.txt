      improve health outcomes for pediatric patients with respiratory distress.

      The results of this study will be used in three primary ways:

        1. As evidence to support an installation of PECO in hospital HVAC systems to improve the
           standard of care for patients with respiratory distress

        2. Towards dissemination efforts through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and
           presentation at national and international conferences

        3. For informing healthcare providers and stakeholders

      There are no plans to repeat this study with other hospital partners
