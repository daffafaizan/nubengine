    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to study the effect of Omalizumab on
      children with food allergy.

      Primary endpoint: Change in challenge threshold after 3 months of treatment in patients
      treated with Omalizumab versus placebo.

      Secondary endpoints: Change in challenge threshold at 6 months. Change in Skin Prick Test
      (SPT), serum markers for allergy (specific IgE, IgG4, BAT (basofil activation test)),
      severity of comorbidity, and quality of life from at 3 and 6 months. Change in treshold
      within and between the groups.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that increased Omalizumab dose and/or a longer treatment
      period will increase food allergy threshold.

      Within the groups:

        -  3 months treatment with Omalizumab in asthma dose versus 6 months with Omalizumab in
           asthma dose - in primary responders

        -  3 months treatment with Omalizumab in asthma dosing versus 3 months additional treatment
           with Omalizumab in max dose - in primary non-responders

        -  3 months treatment with placebo versus 6 months with placebo- in primary
           placebo-responders

        -  3 months treatment with placebo versus 3 months with max dose Omalizumab - placebo cross
           over to active.

      Between the groups:

        -  3 months treatment with Omalizumab in asthma dose versus 3 months with max dose
           Omalizumab

        -  6 months treatment with Omalizumab in asthma dose versus 3 months with max dose
           Omalizumab.

      Patients are randomized electronically via an e-CRF prepared by OPEN in RedCap. Assigned 3:1
      to Omalizumab or placebo in 13 x 8 block (6:2) by a blinded health care person.

      GCP-monitoring is performed by the local GCP-unit at Odense University Hospital
