    
      MPDL3280A (also called atezolizumab) is an immune check point inhibitor which targets
      programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Overexpression of PD-L1 prevents the immune system from
      eradicating cancerous cells as it blocks antigen recognition. MPDL3280A inhibits this
      interaction, allowing immune-mediated tumour cell killing.
