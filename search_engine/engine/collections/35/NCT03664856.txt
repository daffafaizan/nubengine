      of life. It establishes in particular a right of the patient to deep and continuous sedation,
      makes advance directives binding but refuses access to euthanasia. It also states that
      artificial hydration and nutrition are treatments and not cares, which means that they can be
      stopped once they are deemed unnecessary, disproportionate or have no other effect than
      artificial maintenance of life.

      While a number of personalities from all walks of life were heard during the parliamentary
      debate, it was found that patients were not asked about main issues under discussion.
      Therefore, the investigators found it useful to collect their opinions in the context of
      individual interviews.

      A feasibility study was carried out among 40 patients, which demonstrated the feasibility of
      such project. This study is the subject of an article which is currently submitted to the BMC
      Palliative Care Journal.

      The main objective is to contribute to the elaboration of the legislation on the end of life,
      to its adaptation to the wishes of the patients. Patients with cancer and palliative care are
      directly affected by the legislation on end-of-life, and it seems legitimate that these
      legislative provisions correspond to their expectations. The aims also to help caregivers to
      act in accordance with their wishes.
