      disability due to Traumatic Brain Injury. DBS has been proven safe and efficacious for
      remediation of multiple neurological conditions. It is the hope of the study team that the
      protocol will provide further insight into the potential of DBS to improve the quality of
      life and functioning of persons with severe disability due to TBI and at the same time can
      provide new clinical insights that will improve treatment for the entire spectrum of injury
      severity.
