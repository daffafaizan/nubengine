      periodontal disease may also aggravate the existing systemic disease by changing the
      inflammatory parameters in the body. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      obesity and exercise on periodontal and biochemical parameters [serum, saliva and gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) adipokines (interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, leptin, resistin
      and adiponectin)].
