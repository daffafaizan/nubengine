      unclear if there is a benefit of inhaled corticosteroids when used in addition to systemic
      corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence that inhaled corticosteroids result in
      clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute
      asthma. Similarly, it was mentioned in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that
      further research is needed to clarify if there is a benefit of inhaled corticosteroids when
      used in addition to systemic steroids.

      Objective: To determine if adding nebulized budesonide to the systemic steroid for treatment
      of acute wheezing in hospitalized children has any benefit on, symptom score, duration of
      hospitalization and time to discharge from hospital.

      Study Design/Setting/Participants: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of nebulized
      budesonide versus placebo for children 6 months to 6 years of age who have admitted to the
      hospital for acute wheezing.

      Intervention: Participants will receive standard therapy including SCS, albuterol, and
      ipratropium bromide and will be randomly assigned to also receive either nebulized BIS or
      saline.

      Study Measures: Differences in asthma scores, vital signs, duration of hospitalization and
      time to discharge from hospital will be compared between treatment groups.
