      used. However, perioperative atelectasis and respiratory complications may occur with high
      incidence due to general anesthesia and carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. Intraoperative
      ventilatory strategy to address these issues include intraoperative recruitment maneuver and
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Recently, individualized optimal PEEP with minimal
      driving pressure or maximal respiratory compliance was reported to reduce respiratory
      complications after general anesthesia. A recent version of general anesthesia ventilator
      provides a stepwise procedure of determining optimal PEEP by calculating respiratory
      compliance. We investigated whether the application of individualized optimal PEEP could
      reduce the incidence of atelectasis and respiratory complications after robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy compared to uniform PEEP. We plan to determine the degree
      of immediate postoperative atelectasis by measuring the lung ultrasound score and compare the
      lung ultrasound score between groups.
