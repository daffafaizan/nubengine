    
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized on the day of the procedure using
      a computer system that generates a table of random numbers, to perform endoscopic
      diverticulotomy using a LigaSure device (LS 1500, Covidien; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
      or with Stag Beetle (SB) knife standard (Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Tokyo, Japan).

      Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic therapy is administered prior to the procedure and will
      be performed under deep sedation with control by an endoscopist or anesthesiologist in the
      cases indicated.

      Gastroscopy will be performed to identify Zenker's diverticulum, and isolate the septum under
      endoscopic control using a diverticuloscope or flexible overtube (ZD overtube, ZDO 22/30 Cook
      Medical), after placing a guide (0.035 ", 450 cm Jagwire, Boston Scientific, Natick MA, USA)
      in the esophageal lumen. The overtube has two leaflets at one of its ends, a longer one that
      is placed in the esophageal lumen and the short leaflet is placed in the diverticulum. In
      those cases in which it is not possible to place the diverticuloscope, the septum will be
      isolated with the help of a cap on the end of the endoscope. In these cases, the device used
      will always be the SB-Knife since it is not possible to use the LigaSure and they will be
      excluded from the study analysis.

      The time of the procedure will be counted from when the overtube is placed until it is
      removed after diverticulotomy.
