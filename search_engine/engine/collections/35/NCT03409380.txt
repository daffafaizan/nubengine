      treatments will be performed. The primary objective is to determine the effects of arginine
      assessed by standard laboratory assays and metabolomics. To accomplish the objective
      standardized meals will be provided for 2 days preceding treatment for dietary consistency.
      Participants will arrive at the center following a 10-12 hr fast. Blood samples will be
      collected at baseline (fasting), 1.5 hrs, 3.0 hrs, 6.0 hrs, and 24 hrs post treatment. Plasma
      prolactin, growth hormone, amino acids, glucose, insulin, triacylglycerols, thyroid hormones
      (TSH, T3, and T4), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBH), testosterone, cortisol, DHEA, and
      citrulline will be measured. Metabolomics will be measured at 3 time points for each
      treatment. Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) will also be performed at ~2 hrs following
      treatment to examine endothelial function in response to nitrous oxide release. In addition,
      psychological status including fatigue will be assessed using a standardized mood
      questionnaire (POMS).
