    
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, cross over, pharmacokinetic study. Subjects will
      initially be dosed for 2 weeks (Run-In Phase) to allow suppression of endogenous testosterone
      production, while allowing the oral TU to reach steady state. The subjects will then be
      confined to a clinical unit in which they undergo the PK Phase of the study. During the PK
      Phase of the study, subjects will undergo a five-period cross-over in which oral TU is dosed
      twice daily. Subjects will dose in the morning and in the evening immediately prior to
      protocol-defined meals. The protocol-defined breakfasts will contain various levels of fat
      including 15 g, 30 g, 45 g, a breakfast consistent with the fat and calorie content of the
      high-fat breakfast consistent with recommendations in the Guidance for Industry on
      Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence Studies (December 2002), or while fasting
      (with no meal until 4 hours post-dose). Subjects will be randomized to a designated sequence
      of the protocol-defined breakfasts, or the fasted state. The subjects will be required to
      consume the entire breakfast within 20 minutes during the PK Phase. The protocol-defined
      evening meal will be required to be consumed within 20 minutes. The 5 meal periods will occur
      on sequential days.

      Approximately twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure completion of 16
      subjects.
