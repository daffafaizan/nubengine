      The overall goal of this research is to elucidate the neural bases of two specific forms of
      emotion regulation - cognitive regulation (CR) and attention regulation (AR). CR and AR are
      thought to be important mechanisms underlying therapeutic change associated with
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for
      generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). We seek to test whether changes in CR and AR
      underlie the therapeutic effects of CBT and MBSR, which have been shown in the clinical
      science literature to be effective treatments for SAD. We will examine CR and AR in healthy
      controls (HCs) and in participants with generalized SAD at baseline, as well as in
      participants with SAD after they have completed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
      three treatment arms: CBT, MBSR, or Waitlist (WL). This work will address 3 aims: Aim 1 will
      examine the efficacy of CR and AR in individuals with SAD versus HCs; Aim 2 will investigate
      the immediate and longer-term impact of CBT versus MBSR for SAD; and Aim 3 will examine
      treatment-related changes in CR and AR and test whether these changes mediate the effects of
      CBT versus MBSR. The broad, long-term objective of this research is to contribute to advances
      in clinical interventions targeting individuals suffering from SAD, as well as a wide range
      of other anxiety and mood disorders.
