      Primary

        -  Determine the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in determining response to
           therapy in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the association between SNPs and treatment outcome and toxicity in patients
           enrolled on protocol CCG-1891 vs protocol CCG-1952.

        -  Determine the role of SNPs in drug metabolizing enzymes and the development of
           veno-occlusive disease in patients enrolled on CCG-1952.

        -  Evaluate interactions between genotypes and other risk factors for treatment response in
           these patients.

        -  Determine predictive models utilizing genetic information and clinical data to predict
           treatment response and toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples undergo genotype assessment on the Pyrosequencing platform.
      Contingency tables and X^2 test performs a univariate analysis of the risk of relapse and
      genotype, and multivariable analyses using logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards
      evaluate the risk of relapse given genotype and other confounders. Genotype patterning,
      classification and regression trees, and multifactor dimensionality reduction evaluates for
      patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with toxicity and relapse risk.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients (200 with relapsed disease and 600 without
      relapsed disease) will be accrued for this study.
