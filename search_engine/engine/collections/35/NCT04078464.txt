      physical activity influences ratings of perceived exertion, feeling states and physiological
      response (blood pressure and heart rate) during physical activity. Changes in affect and
      cognitive function pre- and post- physical activity bout will also be assessed. The effects
      of mindfulness training during an acute bout of physical activity will be compared to
      mindfulness training alone and acute physical activity alone. This research will contribute
      to larger questions of how to increase rates of physical activity in the general population
      and make physical activity more enjoyable.
