      feasibility and to collect first effectiveness data for the use of transcranial alternating
      current stimulation (tACS) to re-normalize pathological alpha oscillations in dorso-lateral
      prefrontal cortex (dl-PFC) of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder by
      comparing Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) scores immediately before the first
      stimulation session and immediately after the last stimulation session. As a secondary
      objective the investigators will assess the differential clinical effects of sham, 10 Hz and
      2 mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of
      alpha oscillations.
