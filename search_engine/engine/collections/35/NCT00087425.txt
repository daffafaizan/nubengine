      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of bryostatin 1 and rituximab in patients with
           rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic
           leukemia (CLL).

        -  Determine the antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on the functional and molecular status of effector
           cells (i.e., NK cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells) in these patients.

        -  Determine the expression of CD20 and complement-inhibitory molecules on tumor cells
           before and after treatment with this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on the global gene expression pattern in CLL cells
           of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously over 24 hours on days -6, 2, and 9 of course 1
      and on days 2 and 9 of courses 2-6. Patients also receive rituximab IV over 4 hours on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1 and 4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-48 patients (9-24 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 9-24
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia) will be accrued for this study within 12-30 months.
