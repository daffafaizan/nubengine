      axillary and inguinal lymph nodes dissections. A vacuum assisted closure therapy should
      prevent these comorbidities. In this study, we compared PREVENA, a negative pressure wound
      therapy, versus conventional dressings. We evaluated the wound complications at the seventh
      day, the thirtieth day and at this end of the first year after surgery. It is a retrospective
      study of about ninety lymph nodes dissections among with there were seventy times the use of
      a negative pressure wound therapy, PREVENA.
