    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day dosing regimen of
      once daily administration of ATB-346 at doses of 150 mg, 200 mg and 250 mg compared to
      placebo in reducing osteoarthritis knee pain as measured by changes in the post-treatment
      WOMAC subscale pain score relative to each patient's pretreatment baseline WOMAC assessment.A
      total of 360 evaluable patients are planned in this study: 250 mg (n=120); 200 mg (n=120);
      150 mg (n=60); placebo (n=60).

      Safety will be assessed via measurements of vital signs and clinical laboratory tests at
      baseline and at various time points during the study, patient monitoring, and by the
      documentation of adverse events.
