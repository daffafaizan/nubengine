      dominant-side knee extension before, during, and after TSCS and a sham condition.
      Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation will be applied (via the Vectra Neo) using a 5cm x10cm
      oval electrode placed midline on the skin between spinous process T11 -T12 as a cathode and
      two 7.5cm x 13cm rectangular electrodes placed symmetrically on the skin over the lower
      abdomen as anodes. A symmetrical biphasic rectangular waveform, at 50Hz and 1millisecond,
      will be used to provide 30 continuous minutes of stimulation. As sham procedures for this
      intervention have not been established, the investigators will follow sham procedures well
      documented in Transcranial DC Stimulation (tDCS). Electrodes will be placed as they are in
      the Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation condition. Stimulation will be applied at
      subject's maximum intensity for 30 seconds and then discontinued. Subjects will participate
      in two testing sessions, each approximately one hour in length, separated by at least 24
      hours.

      Subject's starting condition will be randomized. Subjects will be informed that two
      stimulation conditions are being tested, but will not be told which is the experimental
      condition.
