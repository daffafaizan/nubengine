      increase levels of insulin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

      A growing body of evidence suggests that insulin plays a role in normal memory processes and
      that insulin abnormalities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, insulin administered to the nasal cavity is
      transported within a few minutes into the brain, but does not affect blood sugar or insulin
      levels.

      The study will consist of a single site, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the acute
      effects of INI (20 International Units) or placebo delivered with nebulizer-like device on
      CSF insulin levels, AD biomarkers and memory. At study entry, participants will be randomized
      to receive either an acute dose of insulin or placebo first, and the other substance on a
      second visit. Participants who are cognitively normal or who have aMCI (n=20) will be
      enrolled. The primary outcome measure will be to test the hypothesis that CSF insulin levels
      will increase 30 minutes after receiving a 20 International Units dose of insulin delivered
      with a nebulizer-like device, compared to levels achieved 30 minutes after placebo.
