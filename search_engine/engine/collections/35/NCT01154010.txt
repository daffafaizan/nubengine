      inflammation inside the eye can lead to a number of conditions that ultimately effect vision.
      These can include glaucoma, posterior synechiae, cystoid macular edema, and cataract. The
      standard treatment for the disease is drug therapy centered around the administration of
      corticosteroids. These are administered in the form of eye drops, and if necessary
      periocular/intraocular injections, or/and by systemic oral/IV administration. Unfortunately,
      the treatment with corticosteroids can similarly induce severe side effects including
      glaucoma and cataract formation. ActiPatch is a medical device that emits a low frequency
      pulsed electromagnetic field. This device has been shown to reduce inflammation and pain in a
      number of conditions, eg blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). ActiPatch is FDA approved for use
      after blepharoplasty to reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. The treatment is not
      invasive, does not require additional medication, and side effects from ActiPatch and other
      PEMF devices have not been reported. The potential benefit of treating uveitis with ActiPatch
      is the potential to reduce the time and/or amount of steroid administration. This would
      benefit patients by reducing the risk of unwanted side effects of the corticosteroid
      treatment.

      The benefit to society would be an improved treatment for anterior uveitis.
