      trial enrolling adult patients within 48 hours of ARDS onset from twenty medical centers
      across the US, some of which included more than one hospital. We studied the patients who
      were randomized to the pulmonary artery catheter arm of the FACTT study. The investigators
      included patients that had PEEP and cardiac index measurements performed within a short
      period of each other during the first 3 days of the FACTT study enrollment. Since FACTT had a
      2x2 factorial design, half of the patients were in a 'liberal fluids' study arm, and the
      other half were in a 'conservative fluids' study arm.
