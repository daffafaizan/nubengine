      disrupting key signaling events associated with immune activation. The trial addresses a
      pressing clinical need, namely prevention of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) after
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and promotion of donor-recipient immune tolerance.
      The safety profile of this anti-CD40L antibody overcomes major prior limitations, and the
      planned biologic studies will provide significant mechanistic insight.
