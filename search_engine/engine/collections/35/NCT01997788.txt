      renal cell carcinoma. The incision for the nephrectomy causes severe postoperative pain. A
      single dose of intrathecal morphine(ITM) has been used for the postoperative pain of
      prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate and hepatectomy. The effect of ITM for
      open nephrectomy has not been studied. Therefore, this prospective, randomized study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single 50 mcg dose of ITM added to intravenous patient
      controlled analgesia(IV-PCA), comparing to IV-PCA alone.
