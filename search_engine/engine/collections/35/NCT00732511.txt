      Endothelial function will be measured non-invasively by flow-mediated changes in pulsatile
      blood volume in the finger-tips.

      Vascular compliance (stiffness) will be assessed by tonometry of the radial pulse wave
      ("augmentation index") and diastolic puse wave analysis.

      Plasma nitrate/nitrite levels mirror NO production and will be measured
      spectrophotometrically by the Griess reaction.

      Plasma nitrotyrosine, an in vivo marker of NO-dependent damage induced by reactive nitrogen
      intermediates derived from NO, will be measured by ELISA.

      Exhaled NO may provide an real-time measure of endothelial cell NO production and can be
      measured by a hand-held device which contains an electrochemical detector sensitive to 5 ppb.
