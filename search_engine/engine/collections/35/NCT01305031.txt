      injure many organ systems. Some studies have shown that resuscitation of term newborn infants
      with room air were safe and of great benefit. A static room air, however, may be
      inappropriate for resuscitation of preterm infants. The number of late-preterm infants has
      increased in recent years, which represent approximately 70% of all preterm infants. Our
      study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of using room air during resuscitation of
      late-preterm infants and whether this will avoid oxidative stress derived damage and improve
      outcomes.
