      lymphatic systems and that can be more reliably diagnosed if a compatible clinical picture is
      combined with a pathologic demonstration of non-necrotizing epithelioid-cell granulomas. As
      the thorax (bronchi, lung parenchyma, and/or intrathoracic lymph nodes) is almost invariably
      involved, bronchoscopy with its ancillary sampling procedures (endobronchial biopsy,
      transbronchial lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, conventional and ultrasound
      guided-transbronchial needle aspiration, endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration)
      has been the diagnostic tool most frequently used to confirm pathologically the clinical
      suspect of sarcoidosis.

      Among the possible bronchoscopic sampling procedures, endobronchial biopsy (EBB), which is
      the easiest and safest, has long been used, even though its value has been assessed in small
      studies, mostly retrospective. Although its diagnostic yield has been shown to be widely
      variable (5%-71%) across different studies, EBB has constantly demonstrated to increase the
      diagnostic success of bronchoscopy in sarcoidosis when coupled with other sampling methods.
      In the last few years, high-definition (HD) videobronchoscopy has become widely available in
      the market and will progressively become the standard of care for airway inspection and
      sampling, as it provides substantially higher resolution images as compared to conventional
      white light bronchoscopy. Furthermore, in combination with improved video processor units,
      some HD videobronchoscopes offer post-processing real-time image enhancement (i-scan
      technology). Preliminary studies, performed in the setting of lung cancer, suggest that HD
      bronchoscopy with optical image enhancement (OE) may result in better detection of subtle
      vascular abnormalities in the airways, which are often associated with preneoplastic lesions.
      We hypothesize that HD videobronchoscopy could help identify bronchial involvement from
      sarcoidosis before it is (plainly) visible by conventional bronchoscopy.
