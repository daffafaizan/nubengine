      achieved by local anesthetic infiltration at the anterolateral aspect of quadratus lumborum
      muscle (QLB-I), or at the posterior aspect of the muscle (QLB-II), or transmuscular (QL-TM
      block). Ultrasound-guided technique is the usual route used for QLB performance. QLB had been
      considered a modification of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block[4]. A cadaveric study
      had showed similar local anesthetic spread in both QL and TAP blocks.

      TAP block could be performed by using either the ultrasound or loss-of-resistance technique;
      whilst, QLB is only performed using the ultrasound and the feasibility of loss-of-resistance
      technique had not been investigated for this block.

      This study aims to explore the feasibility of using loss-of-resistance technique for QLB. And
      to compare between the Ultrasound guided QLB type II and the loss-of-resistance technique for
      QLB as regards the degree and duration of analgesia and side effects.
