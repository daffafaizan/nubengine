      with locally advanced gastric cancer. To this end, this trial is evaluating the feasibility
      and treatment efficacy of adding an antibody blocking the EGF pathway to a neoadjuvant
      approach with proven efficacy developed at New York University (NYU). The combination of
      Irinotecan and Cisplatin has been shown to be synergistic and active against gastric
      carcinoma. This trial therefore builds upon NYU previous experience with the neoadjuvant
      administration of Irinotecan combined with Cisplatin as well as the reported enhanced
      activity of Irinotecan, Cisplatin and External beam radiation when combined with Cetuximab to
      develop a novel neoadjuvant and adjuvant approach for the treatment of gastric and
      gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancers. The program includes: 1) systemic combination of
      Irinotecan, Cisplatin and Cetuximab used as an induction, 2) followed by potentially curative
      gastrectomy or GEJ resection, and 3) post-operative chemoradiation as reported in the
      Intergroup study with the addition of Cetuximab.
