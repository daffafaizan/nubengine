      associated with increased mortality. Although guidelines for management of the trauma induced
      coagulopathy does not recommend any specific timing of fibrinogen substitution, several
      papers suggest that early substitution might be associated with improved outcome. Laboratory
      measurement of plasma fibrinogen level, thromboelastometry and/or its estimation based on
      base excess, hemoglobin level, Injury Severity Score or combinations require diagnostic
      procedures that are associated with with a certain time delay and prolongs the time to
      fibrinogen substitution.
