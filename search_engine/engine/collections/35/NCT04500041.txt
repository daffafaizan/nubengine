      methods of treatment assignment (randomized and parent preference) and an embedded internal
      pilot study for sample size re-estimation. Patients will be treated either with serial casts
      or a full-time brace and followed until curve resolution, failure or palliation (neither
      resolution nor failure after 2 years of treatment). Results of this study will provide
      clinicians and families with evidence to support informed treatment decisions.
