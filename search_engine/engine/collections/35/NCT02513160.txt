    
      Run-In Period (Days -14 to Day -1): Participants were provided with single-blind placebo
      breath-actuated inhaler (BAI) or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) device for twice-daily use after
      appropriate training and demonstration of the proper technique. Participants discontinued
      their current asthma therapy for the duration of the study.

      Treatment Period (Day 0 to Week 6): Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and
      device type through a qualified randomization service provider (ie, IRT). The interactive
      response technology (IRT) system stratified patients based on treatment at the time of
      screening visit, either inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or non-corticosteroid (NCS). During the
      study, blinded persons were blinded to treatment (active or placebo) assigned but not device
      (BAI or MDI) assignment.
