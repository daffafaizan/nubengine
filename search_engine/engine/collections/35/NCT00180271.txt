      stratified by clinical center and ischemic status. Approximately 60% of the subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive a CRT-D with biventricular pacing, and 40% will receive an ICD
      only. Optimal pharmacological therapy for heart failure will be required in both treatment
      arms. Length of follow-up for each subject will depend on the date of entry into the study,
      since all subjects will be followed to a common study termination date.
