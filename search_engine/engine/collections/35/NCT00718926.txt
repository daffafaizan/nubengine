      mM of monochlorobimane (MCB, M-1381, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and propidium iodide (PI).
      Fluorescent intensity, reflecting the amount of icGSH, was inspected under a confocal laser
      scan microscope. To detect the GSH levels we used a fluorescent MCB probe with excitation and
      emission wavelengths of 405 nm and 410-480 nm, respectively. The cell-permeating MCB probe is
      non-fluorescent but forms a fluorescent adduct with GSH in a reaction catalyzed by
      glutathione-S-transferase.
