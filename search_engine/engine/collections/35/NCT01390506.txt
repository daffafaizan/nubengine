      intensive care is required to optimize neurological recovery. The pathophysiological
      reactions that follow hypoxic brain injury are complex, and the mechanisms by which ischemia
      causes neuronal death leading to postanoxic encephalopathy are only partly understood to
      date. Therapeutic hypothermia improves brain function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
      Injury however can be ongoing even after the return of spontaneous circulation, giving the
      clinician an additional window of opportunity to treat and protect the injured brain [5].
      Therefore there is an unmet clinical need for further therapeutic strategies. Strategies to
      counteract the deleterious effects of oxygen-derived free radicals after cerebral reperfusion
      have been studied for long.

      The trace element selenium is part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase which belongs to the
      endogenous defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. Clinical data suggest that
      supplementation of selenium may be beneficial in critically ill patients and in
      neurodegenerative diseases including, among others, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and
      epilepsy, where oxidative stress plays an important pathophysiological role. In SIRS, sepsis
      and septic shock doses up to 4000Âµg per day have been proven to be safe A recent
      retrospective analysis supported the hypothesis that early administration of selenium may
      improve neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.

      Therefore the purpose of this study is to explore the influence of early administration of
      selenium on neurological outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation by a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, single-center study.
