      treatments for PTSD on PTSD symptoms and relationship functioning in active duty military
      personnel who have recently returned from combat deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom
      (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), or Operation New Dawn (OND) and their partners.
      Research indicates that PTSD is associated with high levels of relationship distress [8-12].
      We will compare a treatment specifically designed to incorporate partners,
      Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT), with an established therapy that focuses on
      treatment of the individual, Prolonged Exposure (PE). CBCT includes techniques designed both
      to promote support for the traumatized individual and reduce relationship distress; whereas,
      PE focuses solely on PTSD symptoms and treats only the patient with PTSD. Therefore, we
      expect to see greater improvement in intimate relationship functioning with CBCT than with
      PE, while remaining equally effective in reducing PTSD symptomatology. Our specific
      hypotheses are as follows:

        1. Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) will be equally
           effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, as measured by
           the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the PTSD Checklist -
           Stressor Specific Version (PCL-S).

        2. CBCT for PTSD will be more effective than PE in improving relationship distress in a
           sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans and their partners, as measured by the Couples
           Satisfaction Index.

        3. CBCT for PTSD will have significantly greater impact than PE on measures of relationship
           functioning (e.g., intimacy, conflict, aggression) in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans
           and their partners.
