      to significantly increased morbidity in this patient population. The majority of patients are
      symptomatic due to their malignant effusions. The recurrence rates are thought to be quite
      high overall and may approach 100% without any further treatment.Currently there is no
      available non-invasive, medical means for controlling the effusions other than systemic
      chemotherapy.Zoledronic acid has been shown in a mouse model of malignant pleural effusion to
      decrease fluid accumulation and tumor dissemination while prolonging survival.
