      worldwide. Surgery to remove the tumour remains the principal form of treatment for liver
      cancer, however recurrence of the disease after surgery is common and survival after
      recurrence is poor. At the moment there is no recommended standard treatment for HCC
      immediately after the tumour has been removed surgically. PI-88 is a new experimental drug
      which blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumours to stop the tumour growing (starves
      it of food) and also stops tumour cells spreading. Previous experience with PI-88 has shown
      it has been well tolerated and has shown some benefit in delaying the time it takes for the
      hepatocellular carcinoma to reappear after surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine
      if PI-88 is effective and safe in patients who have had surgery to remove primary liver
      cancer.
