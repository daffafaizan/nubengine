      disability worldwide. As of recent, therapies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (e.g.
      erenumab) have been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine. This study aims to
      investigate structural and functional cerebral changes using magnetic resonance imaging
      before and after treatment with erenumab in patients with migraine.
