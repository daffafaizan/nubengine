      gastric cancer, whereas only a subset of patients could benefit from it. Therefore, one major
      challenge for perioperative drug treatment is to construct promising biomarkers and to screen
      out potential beneficial patients. Recent evidence has revealed that tumor microenvironment
      (TME) is highly associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer. Meanwhile, tumor
      microenvironment score (TMEscore) established with transcriptomic data is a robust biomarker
      for predicting prognosis and guiding individualized immunotherapy strategies. However, its
      predictive value for perioperative drug treatment outcomes warrants further exploration and
      validation. The study is a multi-center, observational study to evaluate the relationship
      between the efficacy of perioperative treatment and tumor microenvironment in patients with
      locally advanced resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastreal junction or the stomach,
      aiming at further determining the predictive value of TMEscore and establishing a
      comprehensive treatment-efficacy evaluation system for gastric cancer. Eligible subjects were
      selected according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. After the successful
      screening, the patients were treated in accordance with the clinical guidelines and the
      actual conditions. The residual tissue samples of the primary tumor were collected to conduct
      the tumor microenvironment detection. After routine neoadjuvant therapy, followed by a
      restaging of the tumor status and surgery. The residual surgical specimens were collected to
      conduct the tumor microenvironment detection analysis.
