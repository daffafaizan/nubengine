      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV infected adults, but side effects an the great number
      of pills induces less adherence to the therapy. Once daily combination with a lower number of
      pills could be more easy to take, with a greater adherence, less side effects, and the same
      efficacy. 355 patients are recruited in the study, randomized in two treatment groups:
      maintenance of the HAART therapy versus changing for a once daily combination of FTC, ddI,
      efavirenz, during 48 weeks. The primary end-point is the viral success maintained until 48
      weeks. Secondary end-point is the safety and adherence.

      The trial is prolonged for a total of 48 weeks.
