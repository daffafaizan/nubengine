    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To define the biodistribution of gallium 68Ga-FAPi-46 in normal and cancer tissues of
      patients with prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether 68Ga-FAPi-46 and gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11)
      accumulation observed by positron emission tomography (PET) correlates with the amount of
      fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in excised
      cancer tissue, respectively.

      II. To assess the 68Ga-FAPI-46 biodistribution correlation with 68Ga-PSMA-11.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-FAPi-46 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/computed tomography (CT)
      imaging over 20-50 minutes.
