      analgesic delivery system that is currently used in daily practice in KK Women's and
      Children's Hospital. It has enabled us to monitor the infusion pumps through wireless
      connection to a central monitoring system and hence, collect pump utilisation data
      electronically. The CIPCEA system is programmed to analyse the LA usage across the last hour
      and adjust the background infusion rate according to a preset algorithm.

      Breakthrough pain is defined as maternal complaint of pain or pressure that required and was
      successfully treated with supplemental epidural medications. we investigated the potential
      factors associated with breakthrough pain in patients who receive CSE epidural analgesia with
      CIPCEA, with the aim of elucidating the important associated factors.
