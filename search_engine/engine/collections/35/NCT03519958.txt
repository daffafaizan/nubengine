    
      This is a multi-center, observational study of patients with locally advanced/metastatic
      NSCLC who progressed on previous EGFR TKI treatment. Eligible patients will be recruited from
      participating sites in Hong Kong over a 12 months enrolment period.

      Plasma and urine samples will be collected from enrolled patients. Plasma circulating tumor
      DNA (ctDNA) and urine ctDNA will be analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for detection of
      T790M mutation and EGFR sensitizing mutations. Patients who are T790M plasma-negative,
      regardless of the urine testing results, will be recommended to undergo re-biopsy (defined as
      tissue sampling or cytology sampling), tissue/cytology T790M testing, and to provide a second
      plasma sample for a second plasma T790M test (tested by ddPCR).

      Enrolled patients who subsequently receive osimertinib treatment will be followed up as per
      routine practice at the investigational site. Patient data will be collected for 12 months or
      until death or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs earlier, from the first prescription of
      osimertinib. All clinical decisions will be at the discretion of the treating physician.
