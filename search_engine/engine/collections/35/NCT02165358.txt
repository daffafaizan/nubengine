      patients affected by Becker muscular dystrophy and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I.

      Becker and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies are both hereditary muscular disorders. Both
      diseases appear clinically with shrinkage and muscle weakness of the muscles around the
      shoulder girdle and pelvis, while muscle hypertrophy of the calves and tongue is seen.

      The quality of the enlarged calves has to the investigators knowledge not previously been
      described, and their hypothesis is that the normal correlation between muscle strength and
      muscle cross-section is absent in the calf muscles. Thus the investigators hypothesis
      suggests that there is no actual hypertrophy of the calf muscles, but rather a
      pseudohypertrofy with reduced force per cross-sectional area. With a picture of increased fat
      infiltration and disorganized muscle fibers.

      The enlarged calves' muscle quality will be assessed primarily on the basis of the muscle
      structure on MRI (assessed on both T1 imaging, 3-point Dixon scans, and diffusion tension
      imaging), and based on a calculation of muscle strength per cross-sectional area. Isokinetic
      muscle dynamometry (Biodex-4) will be used to measure muscle strength. The findings will be
      compared with results from non-affected controls.

      Additionally the investigators want to describe the tongue muscle appearance on T1-weighted
      MRI.
