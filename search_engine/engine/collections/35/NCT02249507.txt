      organizations endorse the performance of at least 150min/wk of moderate intensity or 75min/wk
      of higher intensities in order to achieve better health parameters in different contexts.
      Aerobic exercise is known to be an effective way to diminish BP levels post-session. These
      responses are widely applicable in hypertensive subjects, acting in aid of BP management
      treatment. Although these benefits of aerobic exercise are well known, few studies explore
      the potential of this intervention in resistant-to-treatment patients. Moreover, the effects
      different intensities of aerobic exercise in this population is scarce. Thus, the aim of this
      study is to determine the magnitude of BP responses, if there is any, of resistant
      hypertensive subjects to two different intensities of aerobic exercise, compared with a
      control session. For that, subjects will be enrolled for one pre-intervention cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing and three randomized intervention sessions: control, 50%HRmax and 75%HRmax.
      Prior and immediately after all intervention sessions (during 1h), forearm blood flow and
      reactive hyperemia will be assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. After the sessions,
      24h blood pressure will be assessed with an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system.
