      adolescent patients, including those that make use of new technologies, to help them achieve
      and maintain high levels of adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART), particularly as they
      take responsibility for their own medication-taking in the transition to adult care. The
      research planned here will contribute to the scientific evidence base on approaches to
      support ART adherence effectively among youth by 1) conducting formative research on
      adherence challenges among adolescents and refining options for a personalized adherence
      intervention package; and 2) implementing a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess
      the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a novel real-time feedback intervention that
      permits adolescent patients to tailor intervention features to suit their individual
      preferences.
