      Treprostinil has not been adequately studied to determine its safety and efficacy in children
      â‰¤ 16 years old. However, the drug's use and tolerance in children with PAH has been
      demonstrated in studies with small sample sizes.

      Although the pharmacokinetic relationship of treprostinil has been established in adult
      patients with PAH, the relationship between the steady-state plasma concentration and dose
      for children requires further investigation because of physiologic differences, such as the
      maturity of enzyme systems and drug clearance mechanisms, between children and adults. The
      subjects in this study will be divided into cohorts by age to address the physiologic changes
      that occur throughout childhood.

      Currently, no data exists demonstrating the relationship between the steady-state plasma
      concentration and dose for children treated with intravenously or subcutaneously delivered
      treprostinil. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil among different age cohorts
      in children will provide the data to make an informed recommendation for dosing based on age
      (and possibly weight).
