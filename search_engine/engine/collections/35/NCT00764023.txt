      removed catheters or shunts, excised tonsils, amputated tissue, sputum, stool, or other
      excretions. The samples can be cultured for microbes, examined using microscopy, or analyzed
      using molecular techniques. The studies can examine microbes or the host's response to
      microbes by examining the nucleic acids (e.g. 16S DNA, mRNA), proteins, or other metabolites.
