      deliver vaccines and other pharmaceutical products beneath the skin. Design aspects such as
      quality, pressure, orifice size, angle of injection relative to skin and injection stream
      coherence control the depth to which the product is delivered. This technology provides a
      safer delivery option for patients and healthcare staff by removing the need for needles for
      the administration of vaccines.

      In addition to improved safety, additional benefits of using jet injectors include more
      consistent and reliable dose volume delivery, reduced vaccine waste, diminished need to
      transport large quantities of sharps, reduced risk of needle sticks, syringe reuse, and costs
      associated with sharps waste. Jet injectors offer a needle-free procedure to those
      individuals who are adverse to needles.

      This study compared the efficacy of a disposable syringe jet injection device (Stratis) with
      traditional needle and syringe (NS) administration for the delivery of a trivalent
      inactivated influenza vaccine. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing measures of
      hemagglutination inhibition (HI); specifically GMTs, seroconversion and seroprotection.
      Safety of the two administration devices was evaluated by comparison of incidence of
      solicited local and systemic adverse events.
