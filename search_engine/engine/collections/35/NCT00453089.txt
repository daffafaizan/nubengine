    
      Primary Aims:

        1. the optimal dose of VG101 based on the highest of 4 proposed dose levels that is not
           associated with unacceptable toxicity during 12 weeks of treatment. Toxicity will be
           based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE), version 3. Unacceptable toxicity will be defined as the occurrence of any Grade
           3, 4, of 5 toxicity that is possibly or probably associated with study drug or any other
           unacceptable toxicity as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.

        2. Specific potential adverse effects of VG101

      Secondary Aims:

        1. the preliminary efficacy of VG101 to:
