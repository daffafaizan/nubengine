    
      Over a period of approximately 6 months, the study will follow Emergency Department
      Physicians at each of three separate institutions and retrieve data from their encounters
      with patients presenting with renal colic. Parameters for both CHOKAI and STONE scores will
      be logged, extracted and matched against a reference standard of CT scan to compare
      diagnostic accuracy of both scores to predict the presence of ureteric stones in this
      population

      Full-time ED Physicians from each institution will be recruited to participate in the study
      as follows:

      Each ED Physician shall be provided with Data Collection Sheet. This form will provide them
      with a standardized option to enter the components of the STONE and CHOKAI score using data
      normally conducted in the history taking and physical examination of patients suspected to
      have ureteric stones. Additional items have also been included to investigate for other
      variables that could influence clinical prediction of presence of ureteric stones.

      Those patients suspected to have ureteric stones will have confirmation of urolithiasis by
      non-contrast CT scan. Though the investigators will log the data in their respective data
      collection sheets per patient, they will not be involved in entering this data onto the
      study's database.

      Data will be collected for a period of approximately 6 months from February 1, 2021 onward,
      with a target sample size of 200 patients.
