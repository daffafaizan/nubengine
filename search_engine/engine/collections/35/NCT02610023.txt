      I. To examine the relationship between estimated intakes of dietary carotenoids using three
      different FFQ's and comparing them with estimated carotenoid intake from 3 day diet records
      and blood and skin measurements.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete the Willett FFQ, the Fred Hutchinson FFQ, and the newly developed
      Clinton Carotenoid Assessment Tool (CCAT), in random order over a 3 to 4-month period of time
      with 4-6 weeks between each visit. Prior to each visit, participants also complete a 3-day
      diet record, a daily sun exposure diary, and a 3-day activity record. Blood samples are
      collected for plasma carotenoid assessment and and skin carotenoid content is assessed using
      a resonance Raman spectroscopy.
