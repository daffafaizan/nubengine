      technique used for treatment of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) secondary to benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). HoLEP represents a state of the art alternative to transurethral
      resection of the prostate (TURP). HoLEP has been shown to be safe and effective for treating
      prostates of all sizes and has low perioperative morbidity.

      A holmium laser fiber is passed through a continuous-flow resectoscope and is used to resect
      the obstructing prostate tissue (enucleation). After enucleation is performed, the resected
      tissue is advanced into the bladder. The morcellator is then used to cut the tissue into
      small pieces which are then removed from the bladder via suction through the morcellator
      blades (morcellation). We currently use the first commercially available morcellator
      (VersaCut, Lumenis Incorporated, Santa Clara, CA). The Storz continuous-flow resectoscope
      (Karl Storz,Tuttlingen, Germany) is currently used to perform the enucleation portion of the
      procedure.

      Recently, a new morcellator has been developed (Piranha, Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany).
      The Wolf morcellator has been reported to remove tissue at a faster rate than the Lumenis
      device
