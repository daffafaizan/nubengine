      for bariatric surgery. Postoperative pain after bariatric surgery can de significant.
      Narcotic analgesics are often used to manage the postoperative pain in patients undergoing
      bariatric surgery. However, these drugs causes many undesirable adverse effects such as
      nausea, constipation, and respiratory depression.

      The ultrasound (USG) guided ESP block was first defined in 2016. With the administration of
      local anesthesia between the transverse process of the vertebra and the erector spinae
      muscle, it is stated that the effect mechanism of ESP is that spread blocks the ventral and
      dorsal rami to the paravertebral area. In the literature, it has been shown that bilateral
      USG guided ESP block provides effective analgesia after bariatric surgery.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of ESP block on postoperative analgesic
      consumption in patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery
