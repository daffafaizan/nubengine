    
      This is an observational, prospective, cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy and
      precision of the new HAG-B19 in healthy Western adults. A stratified sampling method is used
      to recruit a heterogeneous sample of 160 subjects, covering a wide range of ages and body
      compositions according to gender specific BMI distributions in the population. Volunteers who
      signed the informed consent form are included in the study. A financial compensation of 50.-
      CHF is given to each participant (100.- to the 16 participants subjected to the DEXA
      measurements).

      The body composition of each subject (FM, LBM and FM%) is assessed with sequential
      measurements using 3 HAG-B19 and 3 Nutriguard-M® devices (Data Input, Germany). FM% values
      measured by HAG-B19 are compared to values by Nutriguard-M® to assess the accuracy and
      precision of HAG-B19 (main objective). Intra- and inter-device variability are obtained by
      comparing the 3 repeated measurements and the 3 HAG-B19 devices (secondary objective). In a
      subgroup of 16 individuals, the FM% values measured by HAG-B19 are compared to DEXA
      measurements (secondary objective). Pearson correlations and Bland-Altman graphs are
      performed to assess the agreement of the measurements between the devices and paired t-tests
      are used to determine if there is a bias between the devices. The significance of the
      statistical analysis is fixed at p <0.05.
