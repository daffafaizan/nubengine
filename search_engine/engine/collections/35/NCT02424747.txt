      with extremely high mortality and morbidity in terms of increased risk of developing Chronic
      Kidney Disease (CKD) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Patients with CKD are at increased
      risk of cardiovascular, cerebro-vascular disease and long term increased risk of death. Those
      patients who progress to ESRD have a 20% mortality risk per year in Sweden. Outcome after
      acute kidney injury in the Swedish critical care population has never previously been
      described.

      Method: This cohort study uses Swedish national healthcare registers to investigate the
      epidemiology of acute kidney injury. The Swedish Intensive Care Register (SIR) provides the
      population base, with data extraction between 2005 and 2011. The information obtained is
      cross-matched by the Swedish board for health and welfare (Social Styrelsen) with other
      national registries. All data are returned anonymized and individual patients can not be
      identified in any way. Additionally analysis is performed on a group and not on an individual
      basis. The key to this data is held by Swedish board for health and welfare. The other
      national registries include the Swedish Cause of Death Register (Dödsregister), the Swedish
      renal register (Svensknjurregistret) and the in and out-patients registers (Öppen-
      slutenvårdsregister) these are used to obtain data on all cause mortality, co-morbidities,
      Pre and Post ICU CKD and ESRD. Epidemiological methods are used to analyse the data.

      Investigators aim to describe outcome in terms of long-term mortality (up to five years) and
      renal morbidity (incidence of CKD and ESRD) in critically ill patients with and without de
      novo AKI in Sweden.
