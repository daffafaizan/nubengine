      toxicity. Risks are compounded by the fact that patients may frequently take both
      Over-the-Counter (OTC) and prescription NSAIDs, a fact they often do not report to their
      physician. Further, our prior work suggests that African American patients may be at greater
      risk from NSAIDs than whites. While the consequences of unsafe NSAID use are well recognized,
      effective ways of improving safe use are as yet poorly established. Three findings from
      medical interaction research suggest that a solution may lie in improving doctor-patient
      communication. First, patients' communicative behaviors influence those of their doctors.
      Patients who actively participate by preparing beforehand for the visit, asking questions,
      and expressing concerns, get more information from their doctor, and in many cases receive
      more diagnostic and therapeutic action. Second, patients can indeed be easily taught to use
      active communication behaviors during medical encounters. Third, better communicators have
      better outcomes.A recent report of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) noted that
      medication-related injuries are frequent, costly and in many cases preventable and strongly
      recommended that measures be instituted to strengthen patients' capacities for sound
      medication self-management and communication.
