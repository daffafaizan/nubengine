      subjects with FOP as assessed by low-dose, whole body computed tomography (WBCT), excluding
      head, compared to untreated subjects from Clementia's FOP natural history study (Study
      PVO-1A-001, NHS). The other primary objective is to evaluate the safety of palovarotene in
      subjects with FOP.

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study that will be conducted in two parts: Part A,
      the main part of the study; and Part B, the 24-month extension. Eligible subjects will
      receive a chronic/flare-up dosing regimen of palovarotene for 48 months as follows:

        -  Chronic treatment: orally administered 5 mg palovarotene once daily for 24 months.

        -  Flare-up treatment: orally administered 20 mg palovarotene once daily for 4 weeks (28
           days) followed by orally administered 10 mg palovarotene once daily for 8 weeks (56
           days). Flare-up treatment may be extended until the Investigator determines that the
           flare-up has resolved.

      Note that all dosing will be weight-adjusted in skeletally immature subjects (those under the
      age of 18 years with less than 90% skeletal maturity on hand/ wrist x-rays performed at
      Screening).
