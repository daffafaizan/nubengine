      I. To evaluate the safety of ibrutinib plus PD 0332991 (palbociclib) in patients with
      previously treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and select the recommended phase 2 dose
      schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the toxicity profile of ibrutinib plus PD 0332991 (palbociclib). II. To
      estimate the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rates.

      III. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To estimate the response duration
      (RD).

      LABORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the genomic profile of MCL cells pre-treatment and at relapse. II. To estimate
      the pharmacokinetic profile of ibrutinib when given concurrently with PD 0332991
      (palbociclib).

      III. To evaluate the level of cell-free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) over time in
      conjunction with response to therapy.

      IV. To evaluate the presence of circulating MCL cells over time.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and palbociclib PO QD on
      days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
