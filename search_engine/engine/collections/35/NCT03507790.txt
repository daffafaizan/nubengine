    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 36 week
      multicenter Phase 2 study of two doses of CT1812 in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD).

      This Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety of two doses of CT1812 administered
      once daily for 6 months in adults aged 50 to 85 who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease (the targeted clinical indication for CT1812). Randomized participants
      will receive 100 mg of CT1812, 300 mg of CT1812, or placebo once daily for 182 days.
      Exploratory endpoints that evaluate the effect of CT1812 on biomarkers are also included.
