      To assess the efficacy of crizotinib in real life setting

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the therapeutic response to crizotinib-based treatment

        2. To identify additional biomarkers selectively present in the ALK positive population

        3. To assess the safety of crizotinib (250 mg/bid) in the treatment of NSCLC in real life
           setting

      Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer death in Western
      Countries. Identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements reinforced
      the role of targeted therapies in lung cancer. The EML4-ALK fusion gene is detected in 3-7%
      of patients with adenocarcinomas of the lung and is associated with specific clinical
      pathological features, including young age, absent or minimal smoking history and
      adenocarcinoma histology. However, such clinical features do not properly select patients for
      ALK inhibitors (ALK-Is) and, consequently, molecular testing is mandatory. Indeed, current
      guidelines recommend to test ALK rearrangements at diagnosis all patients with advanced lung
      adenocarcinoma, due to immediate therapeutic implications.
