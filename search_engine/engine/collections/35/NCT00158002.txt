      Open-Label Maintenance Phase, and Taper/Exit Phase. Subjects who have either succesfully
      completed the CAPSS-271 protocol or who discontinued the CAPSS-271 study due to lack of
      effectiveness after completing at least 2 weeks of maintenance treatment will be eligible to
      enroll.
