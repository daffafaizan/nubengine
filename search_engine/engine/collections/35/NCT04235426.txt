      neuropathy cases. Existing evidence based treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome, splinting,
      corticosteroid injection and surgery, are not 100% effective and alternative treatments are
      worth exploring .Surgery indicated in Patients with persistent numbness and pain, motor
      dysfunction with diminished grip or pinch grasping, or thenar eminence flattening. Empirical
      evidence indicates that many patients with CTS have self-limiting symptoms and respond to
      splinting and anti-inflammatory medications. Recently major attention has been drawn to
      platelet-rich plasma for its possible effects on axon regeneration and neurological recovery.
