    
      The study includes a 35-day screening period; a 14-week randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, controlled treatment period (Period 1); a 246-week blinded extension period
      (Period 2); and a 30-day follow-up visit.

      Participants who met eligibility criteria were to be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of
      four treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 1) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 2)

        -  Group 2: upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 1) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2)

        -  Group 3: MTX (Period 1) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 2)

        -  Group 4: MTX (Period 1) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2)

      Starting with implementation of Protocol Amendment 5, all participants in the extension
      period will receive open-label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those currently on
      upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
