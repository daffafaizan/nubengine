    
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, active-controlled, multi-site, pivotal
      safety and superior effectiveness study in patients with symptomatic partial-thickness
      rotator cuff tears comparing a single ADRC injection generated with the TransposeÂ® RT system
      into the supraspinatus tendon and surrounding area to standard-of-care (SOC) corticosteroid
      injection into the subacromial bursa.

      Up to 20 U.S. centers will be initiated to enroll in the study. 246 subjects assigned to two
      randomization arms will be enrolled: an adipose-derived regenerative cell (ADRC) injection
      arm (ADRC treatment arm) and the SOC corticosteroid injection arm (active control arm). All
      subjects will be randomly assigned to ADRC treatment or active control arms in a 2:1 ratio.
