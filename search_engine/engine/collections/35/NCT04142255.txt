      the interventional treatment of FMT. At the same time, combined with metagenomics and 16S
      rRNA sequencing techniques, the trial aims to study the efficacy of intestinal micro-ecology
      for the treatment of autism symptoms and the improvement of gastrointestinal problems and
      autism symptoms in autistic patients, and to explore potential new techniques for treating
      children with ASD.
