      essential nutrient selenium can be anti-tumorigenic if consumed at levels greater than
      nutritional requirements. If it is possible to increase plasma selenium concentrations above
      120 nanograms per milliliter with less than 200 micrograms of selenium daily, then it is
      possible that supplementation can be accomplished through the use of selenium-containing
      foods.
