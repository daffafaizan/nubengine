    
      This is multi-sites, interventional, double-blinded, randomized, 2-arm parallel-group
      clinical trial. Two HM fed groups will be included as comparator group.

      The primary objectives are:

        1. To evaluate neurodevelopment at 2 years of age in term small-for-gestational age (SGA)
           infants fed standard formula or nutrient-enriched formula from 1 to 6 months of age and
           compare to each human milk (HM)-fed group.

        2. To evaluate length-for-age Z-score at 2 years of age in term SGA infants fed standard
           formula or nutrient-enriched formula from 1 to 6 months of age and compare to each
           HM-fed group.

        3. To evaluate systolic blood pressure at 2 years of age in term SGA infants fed standard
           formula or nutrient-enriched formula from 1 to 6 months of age and compare to each
           HM-fed group.
