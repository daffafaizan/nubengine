    
      The kynurenine pathway is involved in hyperalgesia. This pathway is activated by
      inflammation. Ketamine would interact with the kynurenine pathway and inflammation. Our
      working hypotheses are: the clinical effects of ketamine on neuropathic pain are greater in
      the presence of systemic inflammation and the mechanism of action involves an interaction on
      the kynurenine pathway.

      Study design: Interventional randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      ￼Main goals:

        1. To show a better clinical efficacy of ketamine in chronic pain in patients with an
           inflammatory component.

        2. Explore the anti-inflammatory activity of ketamine through the Kynurenine pathway.

      Population Adult, medullary injured (BM), with chronic neuropathic pain (DN). 4 groups: BM
      with DN with bedsore Ketamine Group versus Placebo Group BM with DN without bedsore group
      Ketamine versus Placebo Group

      Intervention Ketamine infusion 1 mg / kg IVSE over two hours versus Nacl perfusion 0.9%

      ￼ Primary judgment criterion Decrease by more than 30% the intensity of neuropathic pain
      evaluated at the moment on a numerical scale of 10 points between H0 and H4. Comparison of
      groups two by two.

      Secondary judgment criterions:

      NPSI score (Neuropathic pain symptom inventory) at H1, H4, D1, D4, J7 Sub score of NPSI; H1,
      H4, J1, J4, J7 Depression Scale HADS (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale) J0, J1, J7 Plasma
      serotonin (5-HT) kynurenine (KYN), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) activity (KYN / TRP
      ratio), kynurenic acid ( KA) and quinolinic acid (QA), as well as 3 proinflammatory cytokines
      IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α before perfusion and H4 perfusion.

      In parallel blood samples will be collected to study the activation of the kynurenine pathway
      in response to inflammation due to a pressure ulcer.
