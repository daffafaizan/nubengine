      participants in each group: 1. interprofessional videoconferencing intervention, 2. in-person
      PT and, 3. "usual-care" provided by a NP. Due to the interprofessional nature of the
      intervention, the NP involved in the telehealth-based intervention group may alter their
      "usual care" practice; therefore, the control group participants will be drawn from the
      practices of 2 NPs not involved in the Telehealth intervention providing services out of a
      different clinic. Each PT and the NP alone will complete a standardized online diagnostic
      classification tool.Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups.
