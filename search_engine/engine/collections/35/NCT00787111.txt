      completion of the previous clinical study, in which they received fluoxetine or placebo. The
      study will look at the effect of fluoxetine on IQ (Intelligence Quotient) over an 18 month
      period. A possible total of 128 children and adolescents with AD will participate in the
      study from sites across the US.

      The study is open-label. All of the subjects in this study will receive the active medicine
      fluoxetine orally dissolving tablets (ODT). Children will begin by receiving a daily dose of
      2mg fluoxetine for two weeks. The family and child will be asked to come back to the clinic 2
      weeks later and, depending on the child's tolerance and response to the medicine, may have
      his or her dose increased to 4mg/day. After this visit, the time between visits to the clinic
      and the dose that the child will receive will be decided by the study investigator based on
      their clinical judgment on benefit versus tolerability. The largest daily dose of fluoxetine
      that the child could receive in this study is 54mg.
