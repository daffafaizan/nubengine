      week of life. Coordination of sucking and swallowing, and coordination of both and breathing
      is necessary for efficient and safe oral feeding, and is not well established before the 35th
      week gestational age. That is why tube feeding is essential for preterm infants younger than
      that age.

      There is no consensus regarding the best way for the feeding tube, i.e. oral vs. nasal, and
      whether placing the tube should be continuous or intermittently. Nasogastric tube has been
      associated with vagal responses. Both tubes may cause gastric perforation.

      Development and function of oral feeding has been described. It is known that non-nutritive
      sucking and early introduction of oral feeding accelerate the transition from tube feeding to
      oral feeding. It is suggested that the preterm infant may experience a maturational lag in
      vagal function related to ingestive needs, which may contribute to continued feeding
      difficulties and may be a measurable marker of subtle neurodevelopmental problems. Both oral
      and nasal feeding tube may interfere with establishment of efficient oral feeding. The
      purpose of this study is to see whether there is a difference between oral and nasal tube
      feeding, regarding the institution of oral feeding.
