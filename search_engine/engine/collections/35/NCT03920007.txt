    
      Study duration per participant is approximately 112 weeks including: an approximately 56-day
      screening/baseline period, an approximately 52-week study observation period including 1
      treatment day, and an approximately 52-week safety follow-up period. The end of study visit
      will be approximately 104 weeks after the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)
      administration.

      After completion of the main study (DFI14738), participants may have the option to enroll in
      a separate long-term follow-up study, in which case they would no longer continue in DFI14738
      and their end of study visit would be conducted at Week 52.

      The study is separated into 2 parts including a dose escalation phase (Part A) and a dose
      expansion phase (Part B). In Part B participants will be treated at the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) determined from Part A.
