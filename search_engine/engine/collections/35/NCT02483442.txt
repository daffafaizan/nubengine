    
      This is a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study that will assess a new diagnostic
      management strategy for suspected Pulmonary Embolism (inpatients and outpatients). The new
      diagnostic strategy is designed to reduce the use of imaging tests for Pulmonary Embolism,
      particularly Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram, by excluding Pulmonary Embolism with
      combinations of Clinical Pretest Probability and D-dimer results in a higher proportion of
      patients. The safety of this management strategy will be established by demonstrating a very
      low rate of proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism during 90 days of follow-up
      in patients who had anticoagulant therapy withheld in response to negative diagnostic
      testing. Diagnostic test utilization will be assessed. All clinical outcomes will be
      adjudicated by a central independent adjudication committee that will be blind to initial
      D-dimer measurements and patient management.
