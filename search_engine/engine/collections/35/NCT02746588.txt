      recurrent miscarriages a year. Together with the current examination program, the
      investigators plan to describe the uterine cavity according to abnormalities as septa,
      adhesions and further the condition for the endometrium regarding infection and hormone
      receptors. This description will include descriptive office hysteroscopy with biopsies for
      histologic - and immunohistochemically examinations.
