      with these two drugs. II. Compare the time of spleen size decreased by 10%,20%,30%,50% of
      chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with imatinib to those treated
      with hydroxyurea pulse therapy. III. Compare the time to achieve complete remission (CR) of
      these patients treated with these two drugs. iv. Estimate the overall survival, event-free
      survival, progression-free survival (OS, EFS, PFS) and major cytogenetic response of these
      patients treated with these two drugs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are to receive one of two treatments. Arm I: Induction: Patients receive
      oral hydroxyurea daily (hydroxyurea pulse therapy) until hematological remission.
      Maintenance: continuing hydroxyurea pulse therapy to maintain white blood cells below 8. 0 Ã—
      109 / L. Arm II: Induction: Patients receive imatinib 400mg qd until acceptable blood counts
      are achieved. Maintenance: Follow the recommendations of the NCCN guidelines for
      chronic-phase CML treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      2 years.
