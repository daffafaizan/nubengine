      anesthesia. The patients were randomized to receive either RLB or intravenous analgesia
      treatment. All patients were routinely monitored and their heart rate, blood pressure and
      pulse oxymetry recorded during the anesthesia. Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) scores
      evaluated at 2, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after the surgery. Opiod and NSAÄ°D as rescue medication
      were recorded postoperatively
