      age. The maxillary expansion is the most important treatment choice of this skeletal problem
      in the upper jaw. There are many types of maxillary expansion regarding the force amount and
      the number of expansion times: slow maxillary expansion (SME) rapid maxillary expansion
      (RME), and semi-rapid maxillary expansion (SRME).

      Practitioners are conscious that complaints submitted by children and adolescents during the
      active phase of expansion, such as pain, discomfort and oral ulcers are common symptoms. This
      trial of two parallel groups will compare the pain, discomfort and functional impairments
      accompanying the rapid and slow maxillary expansion in early adolescent patients.

      RME group: A bonded modified Hyrax palatal expander will be applied. SME group: A removable
      palatal expansion appliance with a midline screw will be applied.

      To assess the pain, discomfort and functional impairments, patients will be asked to fill out
      questionnaires of six questions: 1) What is the degree of pain/discomfort you have
      experienced?; 2) Do you have difficulty in mastication?; 3) Do you have difficulty in
      swallowing?; 4) Do you have a sense of tension or pressure in soft tissue?; 5) Do you have
      swelling in soft tissue?; and 6) How easy is the treatment procedure?.
