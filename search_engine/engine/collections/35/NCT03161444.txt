      Aedes albopictus in southern France raises concerns about the occurrence of outbreaks of
      indigenous Zika virus transmission. In this context, knowledge of the cumulative impact of
      the epidemic that affected the Caribbean in 2016 is an important issue for the management of
      future epidemics and modeling work. Since the Zika virus has not yet been circulated in the
      Lesser Antilles, the cumulative incidence rate can be estimated by conducting a general
      population seroprevalence survey at the end of the epidemic, or more simply within a cohort
      of patients regularly monitored and whose habitat is distributed throughout the study area.
      Thus, HIV-infected patients who benefit from regular clinical biological monitoring
      constitute a population sample perfectly adapted to the study of the emergence of the Zika
      virus in the French West Indies. The cumulative incidence of infection with the chikungunya
      virus after the 2014 epidemic has thus been estimated at 58% for Martinique and Guadeloupe
      using this method.
