      (efalizumab) and they will be taught to self-inject by the dermatology nurse or research
      doctor. The subject will be administering 0.7mg/kg at week one and 1mg/kg once a week
      thereafter until week 24. If the subject feels uncomfortable self-administering these
      injections, the subject may identify a caregiver to administer these injections for them. He
      or she will be taught to administer these injections by the dermatology nurse or research
      doctor.
