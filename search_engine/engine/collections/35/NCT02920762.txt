    
      A study will be performed to evaluate changes in prescribing behavior of prescribers.

        1. For products that are indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients only (i.e., fentanyl
           transdermal patches, extended-release hydromorphone pills and extended-release morphine
           pills >90mg), describe trends in the proportion of prescriptions for these products to
           opioid-non-tolerant patients in the year preceding the availability of REMS-compliant CE
           courses and compare the proportion of prescriptions to opioid non-tolerant patients pre-
           versus post-REMS CE course availability

        2. For products whose labels indicate that higher dosage strengths should only be used in
           opioid-tolerant patients, describe trends in the proportion of prescriptions prescribed
           to opioid non-tolerant patients with a high starting dosage strength; compare the
           proportion of prescriptions for such products that are prescribed to opioid non-tolerant
           patients with a high starting dosage strength pre- versus post-REMS CE course
           availability

        3. Describe trends in the proportion of prescriptions for ER/LA opioids prescribed to
           patients that have early refills of prescriptions and compare this proportion pre-
           versus post-REMS CE course availability.

        4. Compare the concomitant use of benzodiazepines with ER/LA opioids before and after REMS
           implementation.
