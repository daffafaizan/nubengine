      increased rates of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that
      metformin use, as an adjunct to insulin, will decrease these adverse outcomes by reducing
      maternal hyperglycemia, high maternal insulin doses, excessive maternal weight gain and
      gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia, all of which should reduce perinatal and neonatal
      mortality and morbidity. In addition, since metformin crosses the placenta, metformin
      treatment of the fetus may have a direct beneficial effect on neonatal outcomes. This study
      is an randomized controlled trial (RCT) that adds metformin to insulin, and is a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT. The investigators believe that neither metformin alone
      nor insulin alone will effectively treat this population, and therefore our design, which
      includes the addition of metformin to insulin, will be the most relevant to our patients.
