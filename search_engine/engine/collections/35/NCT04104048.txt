      ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) or with non ST segment elevation
      acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) (1), (2). In STEMI patients, PCI is advised in all patients
      in the first 12 hours after onset of symptoms, the earlier the better (1).

      Coronary revascularization does not always lead to coronary reperfusion. The development of
      devices and procedure has improved clinical outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) to the culprit of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (3-5).

      However, proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD)-AMI has still been associated with
      high morbidity and mortality because of the broad ischemic area (6, 7). In fact, clinical
      outcomes were significantly worse in the proximal LAD-AMI as compared with the mid LAD-AMI.5)
      Moreover, the proximal LAD disease in stable angina was closely associated with early
      revascularization following optimal medical therapy (8). Therefore, clinical guidelines
      regarding coronary revascularization have discriminated the proximal LAD disease from other
      LAD diseases (9).

      In terms of coronary revascularization, the ostial LAD disease requires special attention in
      the proximal LAD disease, because percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) can be more
      complex in the ostial LAD disease than in the non-ostial proximal LAD disease (10) even in
      the setting of AMI, left-main-trunk (LMT)-to-LAD crossover stenting was frequently required
      in the ostial LAD disease (11).
