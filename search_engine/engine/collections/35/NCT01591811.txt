      series of consecutive studies to optimize the safe delivery of accelerated radiotherapy to
      partial and whole breast in the prone position, as summarized in a recent review of this
      experience. The current protocol focuses on whole breast radiotherapy for women with stage
      0-2 breast cancer treated by segmental mastectomy: it aims at further refining the role of
      prone IMRT versus a 3D-conformal radiotherapy technique in this common subset of patients.

      This study is an open label randomized trial. Patients will be randomized within cohort
      defined by assigned treatment (3D CRT if IMRT not covered or IMRT) and within these primary
      strata by menopausal status (pre/post) and by chemotherapy prior to radiation (yes/no). The
      on-site treatment randomization assignments will done on site and treatment assignments will
      be provided to the Research Nurse after she has confirmed eligibility. Patients will be
      randomized within the primary strata based on presumed insurance coverage on consent to the
      study to allow simulation to proceed. Should the coverage change, then the patient will be
      re-randomized in the correct stratum and the initial randomization number will be retired
      with a notation that the initial stratification was revised and patient re-randomized.

      Patients will have completed all breast surgical procedures prior to accrual into this
      protocol in order to establish eligibility criteria. Final pathology margins must be at least
      1 mm in all directions to be eligible. The patient may undergo re-excision if the initial
      margins are involved or close (< 1mm). If the patient meets the eligibility criteria after
      re-excision, she may be entered onto the study.
