      investigate surgeons, as well as gastroenterologists and radiologists who perform invasive
      procedures and gastroenterologists and radiologists who do not perform invasive procedures.
      The qualitative approach will rely on face-to face interviews with purposively sampled
      physicians of the 5 groups and will be continued until saturation. The quantitative approach
      will rely on a questionnaire that will be sent to physicians of the 5 groups.
