      or with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). However, use of AZT is limited by its frequent
      toxicity, which sometimes relates to the amount of drug given. Thus, a combination treatment
      of two drugs that work together may provide more effective and safer treatment. IFN-A is a
      drug that has antiviral effects and may work well with AZT.

      The study is being conducted in three stages. In Cohort A (IFN-A alone), four patients
      receive IFN-A; subsequent four-patient cohorts receive doses escalated in increments. If 50
      percent or more of patients at any dose level experience grade 2 or better toxicity, doses in
      subsequent cohorts are escalated. If grade 3 or 4 toxicity is seen in one patient at a given
      dose level, two additional patients are enrolled at that level. Treatment is given
      subcutaneously (under the skin, with a needle), 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The MTD is
      defined as the dose level immediately below that at which 50 percent or more of patients
      experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity. In Cohort B (combination IFN-A plus AZT), patients who
      complete treatment in Cohort A continue on the same dose of IFN-A, and a low, middle, or high
      dose of AZT is added. In Cohort C, four newly assigned patients who have been on a stable
      prescribed dose of AZT of at least 90 mg/m2 for 6 weeks are treated at each of the same dose
      combinations as those in Cohort B. Treatment is given for 12 weeks. IFN-A is given
      subcutaneously 3 times a week and AZT is given orally every 6 hours. Dose levels of both
      drugs are increased until 50 percent or more of patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity in
      any dose level.
