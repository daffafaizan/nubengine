    
      This trial is an observational, non-randomized controlled study. A total of 1500 patients
      admitted to the ED for a septic or hemorrhagic shock will be followed.

      The primary outcome is the admission to the ICU.

      The study will not impact the treatments provided to each patient. Capillary refill time and
      skin mottling score will not be taken into account to decide patient's treatments and/or ICU
      admission. Patients will be followed during their hospital stay in order to precise their
      destination after ED (home, ICU, ward) and 28- and 90-days mortality after hospital
      admission.
