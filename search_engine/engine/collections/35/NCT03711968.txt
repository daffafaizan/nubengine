      affects the central nervous system causing a wide spectrum of sensory, motor, and
      neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms. In the great part of patients with MS, there is a
      cognitive deficit that can start already in the early stages of the disease. Disability
      related to the disease is usually investigated through the Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS), however, the scale does not evaluate some very disabling aspects of the disease such
      as diplopia, fatigue and the impact of cognitive disorders.

      The posture and postural self-correction are dependent on the image that anyone have of his
      own body and on the perception of it in the space, both internal and external. In multiple
      sclerosis proprioception and interoception are often altered due to motor and cognitive
      impairment.

      The investigators propose a rehabilitative protocol that combine postural rehabilitation with
      specific visual-spatial tasks, relaxation sessions with self-awareness improvement and
      cognitive rehabilitation.
