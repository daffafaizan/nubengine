      Primary

        -  Compare the proportion of patients with oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer with
           xerostomia of â‰¥ grade 2 at one year after treatment with parotid-sparing
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy vs conventional radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the degree of xerostomia by quantitative measurements of stimulated and
           unstimulated salivary flow in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare local and regional tumor control, time to tumor progression, and overall
           survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare acute and late side effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center and site of disease (oropharynx vs hypopharynx). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5
           days a week, for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo conventional radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6
           weeks.

      Salivary flow measurements are performed at baseline, at week 4 during radiotherapy, and then
      at 2 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the completion of radiotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 2 weeks, and then at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
      after the completion of radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      for 3 years.

      study.
