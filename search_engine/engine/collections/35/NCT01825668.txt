    
      Hypothesis 1: To determine the responsiveness of plasma lipid profile including Total
      cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations to high and low cholesterol diets in adults
      who been breast-fed as infants for different durations

      Hypothesis 2: To determine if differences exist in rates of cholesterol absorption and
      synthesis in adults, and whether such differences respond to variations in cholesterol
      intake, between individuals who were breast for different durations.

      Hypothesis 3: Consumption of a plant sterol formulation in low-fat milk product will
      favorably alter lipid profiles compared with control in the study population.

      This is a free-living, randomized, crossover trial. This trial is modeled after previously
      successful functional food trial at the investigators clinic, consistent with current
      recommendations to decrease Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk and improve circulating lipid
      profiles. The proposed study will include three treatment phases of 4 weeks each, separated
      by 4-week washout intervals:

      Phase 1: Study diets with placebo (240 ml of 2% milk shake; 50 mg cholesterol).

      Phase 2: Study diets with enriched cholesterol (240ml of 2% milk shake; 600 mg cholesterol).

      Phase 3: A study diet with plant sterols (240 ml of 2% milk shake;2.0 g/d of plant
      sterols/240 ml serving; 50 mg cholesterol).

      During each treatment period participants will consume their supper time meal along with
      assigned test product. Consumption of the suppertime meals and the test products will be
      monitored by a clinical coordinator to ensure compliance. Participants will be asked to fill
      out a 3-day food diary at the beginning and end of each experimental period.
