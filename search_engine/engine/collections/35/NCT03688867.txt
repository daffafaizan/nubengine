      metrics and to describe the level of physical activity of pancreatectomy patients prior to
      their planned resection. Patients undergoing pancreatectomy will undergo routine preoperative
      work up: Staging PET/CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis, and biochemical work up (CBC, CMP, CA 19-9,
      prealbumin/albumin).

      During the initial consultation, the patients' resting vitals (including weight) will be
      recorded. They will then perform the grip strength, 30s CST, and 6MWT to establish their
      baseline frailty metrics. Available baseline laboratory values (CBC, CMP including albumin),
      will also be recorded. Research personnel will then provide them with a fitness tracker,
      stress ball, and prehabilitation routine to follow at home until the day of surgery. They
      will also be asked to keep a physical log of their completed physical activities.

      The patients will then complete the prehabilitation program during the time between the
      initial consultation and date of surgery, which typically occurs 3-4 weeks after the initial
      consultation date.

      On the day of surgery, patients will turn in their physical log and their fitness tracker.
      Data from the fitness tracker will be downloaded onto a Cleveland Clinic encrypted computer.
      A set of resting vitals will be recorded (again including weight) and the patients will then
      be asked to perform the three-frailty metrics (grip strength, 30s CST, and 6MWT). After this,
      the patients will not require any additional testing.
