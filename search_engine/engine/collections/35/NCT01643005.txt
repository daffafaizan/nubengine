      important because it integrates an intervention that improves sexual health, relationship
      functioning, and parenting skills. Our intervention will be integrated with an existing
      community based parenting program. By targeting high risk heterosexual couples experiencing
      an important life transition that increases their stress, conflict, and sexual risk, the
      investigators can provide maximum benefit to the men, women, and children in our communities.
      Using the guiding framework of Attachment Theory and the principles of Emotion Focused
      Therapy, the investigators will directly address issues of emotion, intimacy,and relationship
      functioning to create an intervention that strengthens romantic relationships and reduces HIV
      risk behavior. The investigators will conduct a small pilot randomized controlled trial of 50
      parenting couples randomized to either the relationship strengthening HIV prevention
      intervention or an active control. The intervention will last 15 weeks and each session will
      be approximately 1.5 hours long. The investigators will assess couples at baseline, 4-months,
      and 8-months.
