      This study aims to calculate current and accurate prevalence and incidence estimates for
      atopic dermatitis (AD) by age group and sociodemographic factors. It also aims to describe
      the burden of comorbidity in AD with a focus on atopic and mental health conditions. The
      study also aims to describe the health care resource utilisation of this cohort in terms of
      prescription use, primary care appointments, and specialist referrals.

      Method This study will define AD cases using a previously validated algorithm for case
      identification use clinical codes form primary care in the UK (Read codes). The study will
      analyse the population prevalence and incidence of AD using this definition over a 10-year
      period (2008-2018). Within this population the prevalence of autoimmune conditions
      (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes, and
      multiple sclerosis) will be reported and compared with a cohort of individuals without a
      diagnosis of AD, matched by age and sex at GP practice level. In the same cohort, the annual
      use of topical and oral medications used for the treatment of AD, primary care appointments,
      and specialist referrals, overall and stratified by sociodemographic factors will also be
      reported.
