      defects in ciliary structure and/or function. Prevention or delaying disease progression
      requires medical therapies and routine lung function monitoring, with the goal of early
      initiation of medical therapies. Of course, this is contingent on recognizing early lung
      disease.

      Current investigations for monitoring lung disease include pulmonary function tests (PFT),
      chest x rays and chest CTs. But each of these modalities are either not sensitive enough or
      expose the patient to ionizing radiation.

      The investigators believe that hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI (HP Xe-MRI), new imaging modality,
      will be more sensitive then current tests and also avoid the need for ionizing radiation. To
      evaluate this, The investigators will compare HP Xe-MRI to PFT, when the patient is well and
      during a pulmonary exacerbation that is being treated.
