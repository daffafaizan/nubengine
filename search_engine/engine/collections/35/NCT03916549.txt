      standardized: patients are undergoing low anterior resection with mesorectal excision +/-
      (chemo)radiotherapy. Unfortunately around 80% of patients undergoing low anterior resection
      will experience complex bowel dysfunction including fecal incontinence, soiling, urgency,
      incomplete evacuation, fragmented defecation and impaired rectal sensation known as low
      anterior resection syndrome (LARS) causing a "toilet dependence" which severely affects
      quality of life.

      Still there is no standardized treatment for LARS.
