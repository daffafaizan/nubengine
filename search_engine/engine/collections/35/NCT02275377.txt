      Hospital of Clinics de Porto Alegre, for convenience. Subsequently, patients will be
      subjected to test respiratory muscle strength (manometer), respiratory muscle resistance,
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (maximum), evaluation of cardiac reflex sensitivity and
      autonomic control test and induction of inspiratory muscle mechanoreflex with occlusion
      plethysmography at baseline before the start of the training protocol. Patients will
      randomize inspiratory muscle training for 30 minutes a day, 7 days a week, for 8 weeks with
      muscle training device (PowerBreathe). There will be a weekly monitoring in the Clinical
      Research Center of the institution where the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and
      respiratory training techniques will be reassessed and readjusted (40% of MIP). The control
      group will be submitted to respiratory training techniques with muscle training device
      (PowerBreathe) without load. After this period, all initial tests will be reassessed. A
      healthy control group study with 10 normotensive individuals will be included.
