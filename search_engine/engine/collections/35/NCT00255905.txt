    
      Insomnia, characterized by an inability to initiate and maintain sleep, is a defining feature
      of mood disorders such as depression. CBT has been found to be an effective treatment for
      depression-related insomnia. This study will determine the effectiveness of CBT in treating
      insomnia that is secondary to depression. In addition, this study will assess the
      relationship between insomnia and depression, since previous studies have shown that insomnia
      may not only be a symptom of depression but may also indicate the onset of a depressive
      episode.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive weekly sessions of either CBT or clinician
      monitoring for 8 weeks. Participants in both groups will meet with a therapist at selected
      visits, but only CBT participants will receive actual therapy. All participants will have 13
      study visits; four will be overnight visits in a sleep lab. On Visit 1, participants will
      complete questionnaires about their sleep quality and symptoms of depression. Participants
      will also undergo a physical exam and will begin a daily sleep diary. Visits 2, 3, 12, and 13
      will be overnight visits in the sleep lab. During these visits, participants will have
      electrodes placed on their bodies and a polysomnograph will be used to monitor their sleep.
      Participants will meet with their therapist on Visits 4 to 11. Participants' sleep diaries,
      depression scales, and sleep scales will be used for assessment. After the intervention part
      of the study is complete, participants will have monthly follow-up visits for up to 2 years.
      During the follow-up visits, participants will complete questionnaires about their sleep
      quality and symptoms of depression.
