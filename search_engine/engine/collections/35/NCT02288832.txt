      economic impact of a new strategy for the screening and subsequent treatment of vaginal flora
      anomalies before the 20th week of gestation- molecular biology techniques (PCR for A. vaginae
      and G. vaginalis by point-of-care testing) will test self-collected vaginal samples in a
      population of pregnant women at low risk of preterm delivery. There are multiple secondary
      objectives, including assessment of the effect of the strategy on the following indicators-
      delivery before 26, 32, and 37 weeks. Methods-An open-label prospective randomized study will
      compare 2 groups with different management of their pregnancies. Pregnant women at low risk,
      regardless of any symptoms, will be randomized into 2 groups. The study will not include
      women at high risk of preterm delivery. Innovative strategy (group A)- these women will
      undergo routine screening for bacterial vaginosis by analysis of their self-collected vaginal
      samples with this innovative technique.
