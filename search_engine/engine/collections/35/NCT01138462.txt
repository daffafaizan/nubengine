      despite use of standard precautions. Recommendation to prevent MRSA transmission in long term
      care facilities are lacking. We aim to reinforce the current infection control strategy by
      general MRSA screening of institutionalised residents and decolonisation of MRSA carriers.
      Because the uncertainties in the impact of this reinforced strategy, we aim to compare this
      action to the policy actually applied.
