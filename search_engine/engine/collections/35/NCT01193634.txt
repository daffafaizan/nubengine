    
      In the PARADYM RF clinical study, the sponsor aims at:

        -  Demonstrating the performances of the right ventricular autothreshold algorithm ;

        -  Reporting the adverse events documented in the study;

        -  Reporting electrical performances of Sorin Group PARADYM ICDs, in order to validate that
           the performances of those devices are in conformance with longevity and effectiveness
           objectives;

        -  Assessing the user satisfaction (patient and physician) of the remote monitoring
           solution and the overall availability of the system in terms of data.

        -  Reporting the Situs 2 MV left ventricular lead performances;

        -  Reporting the Situs 2 MV LV lead mechanical handling.

      Thus, this study intends to show that PARADYM RF ICDs operate safely and appropriately in
      intended-use as part of an ICD system.
