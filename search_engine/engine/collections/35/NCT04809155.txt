      That said, significant disparity in rates exist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and other sexual
      minority women (LGB) versus non-LGB teen women: Research suggests that lesbian and bisexual
      teen women are between two and four times more likely to report having been pregnant than
      teen women who identified as exclusively heterosexual. Despite this compelling evidence that
      lesbian and bisexual adolescent women are at risk for teen pregnancy, programs tailored to
      the unique needs of adolescent LGB women are nonexistent. Evidence-based teen pregnancy
      prevention (TPP) programs targeting LGB teen women are urgently needed.

      The Girl2Girl intervention text messaging-based TPP program designed specifically for LGB
      women ages 14-18 years, nation-wide. This is an extension of a previous randomized controlled
      trial. Here, the cohort was recruited using an effectiveness strategy: Girls were allowed to
      register and enroll themselves without needing to talk to research staff. All eligible and
      interested youth were allowed to enroll; no diversity targets were applied.
