      signals transmitted through electrocardiograph electrodes and to detect ischemia
      abnormalities based on electrical waveform, patient data, demographics, algorithmic
      sensitivity and software based informatics. The MyoVista provides the clinician with a
      standard ECG conventional waveform, along with an additional report derived from the
      proprietary informatics exclusive to the MyoVista.

      The device holds a lot of promise for early intervention to properly diagnose and treat
      patients under risk timely and effectively. The MyoVista captures and amplifies signals from
      the myocardial tissue. These signals are then processed and compared to an algorithm that
      looks for certain changes occurring in these processed waveforms. The changes that have been
      identified occur much sooner than those processed by a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG).
      These recordings focus on early detection of myocardial abnormalities by non-linear analysis
      of electrical activity and physiological phenomenon. This novel assessment might be capable
      of detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction in a variety of heart diseases.

      The study would compare MyoVista results to subclinical measures of atherosclerosis (CAC and
      CT angiography) in 200 subjects at risk for coronary disease. Correlations between the
      MyoVista reading and the presence of calcified plaque, soft plaque, CTA stenosis, will be
      determined.

      This study has the potential to confirm MyoVista as a reliable and sensitive marker of
      atherosclerosis. Findings may provide a strong indication for the value of a MyoVista test to
      confirm CAD in clinical practice, and for the clinical application of MyoVista in management
      of coronary disease and atherosclerosis.
