      of patients with these conditions. Mortality at 3 months ranges from 36% to 60%. To date,
      these exists no consensus regarding the optimal time to initiate renal remplacement therapy
      (RRT). Retrospective and observational studies have suggested that early initiation of RRT
      could help to improve prognosis in these patients. Therefore, we aim to investigate wether
      early initiation of RRT (within 12 hours after a diagnosis of acute renal insufficiency at
      the "failure" stage according to the RIFLE Criteria), will reduce 90-day mortality as
      compared to deferred initiation of RRT (48 to 60 hours after diagnosis), in intensive care
      unit (ICU) patients with septic shock who develop acute renal failure.

      Secondary objectives include: to compare the impact of the two RRT strategies on 28, 180 et
      360 day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of RRT, duration of ICU stay
      and duration of overall hospital stay. In addition, quality of life at 90 and 360 days will
      be evaluated using the EQ5D questionnaire. Tolerance of both strategies will be compared in
      terms of metabolic disorders, arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema by overload, hypotension,
      hemorrhagic complications, and dependence on RRT at hospital discharge.
