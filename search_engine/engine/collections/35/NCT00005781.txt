      reliability of digital photography of the skin as a prevalence assessment tool in preparation
      for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001 (NHANES IV). NHANES is charged
      with monitoring disease in the U.S. population, which is affected frequently by skin
      disorders and disease. The three skin disorders proposed for study in NHANES IV are atypical
      nevi, psoriasis, and hand dermatitis. This selection is based on the expected impact of these
      diseases on the U.S. population, including a prevalence of 3-10%, associated risk of melanoma
      in the case of atypical nevi, and associated disability in the cases of psoriasis and hand
      dermatitis.

      This skin disease section of NHANES, as currently planned for 2001, includes an imaging
      component with four standardized photographs to be obtained from each survey participant
      (SP). The selection of the regions to be photographed is designed to maximize the information
      obtained, while preserving patient privacy and is based on the known distribution of clinical
      findings of the three conditions, as well as NHANES logistical limitations. This validation
      study is a cooperative effort between the NIAMS extramural programs, the NCI intramural
      program, and the National Center for Health Statistics.
