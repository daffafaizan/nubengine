    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTDs) of olaparib and onalespib (AT13387)
      administered in combination in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with olaparib
      and AT13387 administered in combination as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0.

      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of the combination of olaparib and
      AT13387.

      III. To determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of olaparib and AT13387. IV. To document
      anti-tumor activity of the combination of olaparib and AT13387 as assessed by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and progression free survival (PFS).
      Although the clinical benefit of [this/these] drug(s) has not yet been established, the
      intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the
      patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to
      safety and tolerability.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that there will be induction of BRCA1 and RAD51 foci after olaparib
      alone and reduced formation of these foci after the combination of AT13387 and olaparib,
      assessed immunohistochemically.

      II. To assess downregulation of expression of HR pathway genes after the combination of
      AT13387 and olaparib.

      III. To assess whether there is induction of BRCA1 and RAD51 foci after olaparib alone
      assessed immunohistochemically in the optional biopsy performed after olaparib alone compared
      to the optional baseline biopsy prior to initiation of the study.

      IV. To assess whether there is reduction of BRCA1 and RAD51 foci after the combination of
      olaparib and AT13387 assessed immunohistochemically in the optional biopsy performed after
      one of the combination olaparib and AT13387 doses (compared to the optional biopsy after
      olaparib alone).

      V. To assess whether there is induction of HSP70 (a known biomarker of HSP90 inhibition)
      after the combination of olaparib and AT13387 assessed immunohistochemically in the optional
      biopsy performed after one of the combination olaparib and AT13387 doses (compared to the
      optional biopsy after olaparib alone).

      VI. To assess whether there is downregulation of expression of HR pathway genes after the
      combination of AT13387 and olaparib assessed by Nanostring in the optional biopsy performed
      after one of the combination olaparib and AT13387 doses (compared to the optional biopsy
      after olaparib alone).

      VII. To assess whether there is induction of phosphorylation (phospho) H2AX after the
      combination of AT13387 and olaparib assessed by immunohistochemistry in the optional biopsy
      performed.

      VIII. To assess whether there is downregulation of CCNE1 after the combination of AT13387 and
      olaparib assessed by immunohistochemistry in the optional biopsy performed.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 (cycle 0). Beginning in
      cycle 1, patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 and onalespib intravenously (IV) over
      1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months
      for up to 2 years.
