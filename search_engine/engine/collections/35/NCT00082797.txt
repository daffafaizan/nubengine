      Primary

        -  Determine the response in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated
           with high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin calcium.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the acute toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 1 and oral or IV leucovorin
      calcium every 6 hours beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood methotrexate levels are
      acceptable. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients then receive standard radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Patients with
      disease progression proceed to standard radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy upon
      stopping methotrexate therapy.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 2 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
