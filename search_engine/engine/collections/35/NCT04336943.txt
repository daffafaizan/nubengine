      All patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle, total 6 cycles.
      Starting cycle 4, patients with CDK12 mutations and mismatch repair deficiency
      (MMRd)/microsatellite instability (MSI)-high will also receive olaparib orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 1- 28 of cycles 4-6. Patients with homologous recombination mutation will
      also receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 of cycles 1-6. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and then every 12
      weeks to complete 24 months (at 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months).
