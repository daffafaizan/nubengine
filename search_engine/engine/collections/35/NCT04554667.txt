      side effects. Strength training has been shown to manage some of these side effects but most
      interventions have involved light-to-moderate resistance training programs. HLST may produce
      better outcomes but it is unknown if such a weight training program is feasible and safe for
      HNCS.

      OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this proposed study is to examine the feasibility and safety of
      a HLST program in HNCS at least 1 year post-surgical neck dissection.

      METHODS This single arm feasibility study will recruit 15-20 HNCS to complete the HLST
      program 2 times per week. The primary feasibility outcomes will include the eligibility rate
      (with reasons for ineligibility), recruitment rate (with reasons for refusal), 1 repetition
      maximum testing rate (with reasons for not completing the test), program adherence (including
      attendance, dose modifications, and progression), and follow-up assessment rate (with reasons
      for drop out). The primary efficacy outcome will be strength gains from baseline. Secondary
      efficacy outcomes will include physical functioning, quality of life, fear of cancer
      recurrence, pain, body composition, anxiety, fatigue, stress, shoulder mobility, self-esteem,
      sleep, and motivation to engage in a HLST program.

      SIGNIFICANCE Weight training is an effective intervention in HNCS but the optimal weight
      training prescription is unknown. If heavy weight training is deemed safe and feasible in
      HNCS, it can be compared to light-to-moderate load weight training to determine if it is a
      better prescription for improving outcomes that are important to HNCS.
