      preterm deliveries in young women. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a selective, tissue
      preserving method that may become a good treatment option for these patients.

      This study will explore topical application of methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) and
      hexaminolevulinate (HAL) of the cervix for photodynamic therapy using red light (630 nm).
      Different doses of MAL and HAL will be used with different application time, followed by
      illumination.
