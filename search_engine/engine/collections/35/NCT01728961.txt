      accounts for up to 3 million deaths each year, of which 90% occur in Africa where malaria is
      the leading cause of mortality in young children. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
      are the mainstay of antimalarial therapy throughout much of the world, yet pediatric
      pharmacokinetic data on the most widely adopted ACT regimen, artemether/lumefantrine (AL) are
      lacking. Of equal importance is the assessment of key drug-drug interactions in HIV
      co-infected children as ARVs are known to affect the metabolic enzyme activity responsible
      for ACT elimination. This study proposes to investigate the drug-drug interaction between the
      antimalarial artemether/lumefantrine and nevirapine based antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for
      HIV in children co-infected in resource limited settings.
