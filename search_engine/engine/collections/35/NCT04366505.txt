      striatal cue reactivity and increasing cognitive control, namely mindfulness-based
      intervention and real-time fMRI neurofeedback. Firstly, the investigators will test whether a
      prior mindfulness-based intervention (WP1) is able to enhance the effect of rtfMRI NFB (WP2)
      and change the networks involved in regulation of cue reactivity by providing participants
      with explicit strategies. Secondly, the investigators will investigate whether this combined
      intervention leads to a better clinical outcome in terms of decreased heavy drinking days and
      a reduced sum of alcohol consumption three months later.
