      postoperative pain. However, the optimal dose is unknown and there is constant controversy on
      analgesic versus side-effects. The investigators therefore investigate the effect of
      Gabapentin as a perioperative analgesic in a dose-related manner and with a sample-size
      allowing evaluation of side-effects.
