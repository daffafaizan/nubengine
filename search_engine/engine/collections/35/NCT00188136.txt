      donor-search, either within the family or in volunteer donor registries, will be performed at
      diagnosis irrespective of the expected risk profile. All patients will receiv at least one
      cycle of IC. Inclusion criteria for early allogeneic transplantation are either poor risk
      cytogenetics and/or bad response to the first cycle of IC defined by more than 10% marrow
      blasts on day 15. If a patient meets one of those criteria they could enter the early
      allogeneic HSCT trial after providing informed consent. DNA-based HLA-typing of donor and
      recipient will be performed using high resolution (4 digits) for HLA - A, B, DRB1 and DQB1
      and intermediate resolution (2 digits) for HLA- C.

      During IC-induced aplasia after the 1st or 2nd cycle a fludarabine-based reduced intensity
      conditioning therapy will be started if a donor is available. All patients receive
      fludarabine 30 mg/m2 i.v. daily for five days (day- 6 to -2) and melphalan 150 mg/mÂ² on
      day-2. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG Fresenius 10 mg/kg/day day -5 to -2, total dose 40 mg/kg,
      Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) will be applied after transplantation from unrelated or HLA
      mismatched family donors. PBSC grafts will be preferred. As immunosuppression cyclosporin A
      (CsA) is either administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day or given at an
      bioequivalent amount of the oral formulation in two divided doses starting on the day before
      blood stem cell infusion (day -1). The dose of CsA is adjusted to maintain blood levels
      between 150 and 250 ng/ml. Starting on day 50, oral CsA administration will be tapered by 5%
      weekly if GVHD was inactive. Acute and chronic GvHD will be treated with prednisone, CsA or
      tacrolimus.
