    
      This is a Phase II single-center, open-label clinical trial with three dosing regimens,
      designed to determine the efficacy and optimal dose of the Kovacaine Mist intranasal delivery
      system for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth numbers 4-13 (maxillary right second
      premolar to maxillary left second premolar). Kovacaine will be administered intranasally on
      the same side of the midline as the tooth on which the procedure will be performed in three
      dosing cohorts [four 100 μL, two 200 μL, or one 200 μL spray(s)] of 10 subjects each. The
      first cohort receiving 4 sprays will be completed before initiating study of the remaining
      two cohorts, which will be treated using a randomized, parallel-group design. Administration:
      Subjects in the 4- and 2-spray cohorts will be administered the same total dose of 12 mg
      tetracaine HCl/0.2 mg oxymetazoline HCl. The 4-spray cohort will be treated with a sequence
      of four 100-μL sprays at intervals of 4 minutes. The 2-spray cohort will be treated with a
      sequence of two 200 μL sprays 4 minutes apart. The 1-spray cohort will be administered one
      200 μL spray, a total dose of 6 mg tetracaine HCl/0.1 mg oxymetazoline HCl, which is half the
      dose of the 2-spray cohort. Rescue: If the study drug does not provide sufficient anesthesia
      to allow for completion of the dental procedure, a rescue injection of articaine will be
      administered.
