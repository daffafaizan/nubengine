      Although many management strategies have been used in patients with LE, including
      pain-relieving drugs, corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy, elbow supports, shock-wave
      therapy, platelet-rich plasma injections, and surgery, the optimal treatment is still
      unclear. When conservative treatments are unsuccessful or not accessible because for cost
      reasons, an increasing number of patients consider complementary medicine, particularly
      acupuncture.

      In a systematic review by Trinh et al., acupuncture was found to relieve the pain of LE
      effectively but its long-term efficacy could not be established. Another technique commonly
      used to treat chronic pain in patients with LE is fire needle therapy, which combines
      acupuncture and moxibustion. A case report demonstrated a significant short-term effect of
      fire needle therapy in a patient with LE. Moreover, it has been shown that a combination of
      rehabilitation and fire needle therapy is effective for at least 4 weeks in patients with LE.
      However, although the early case report demonstrated effects lasting for 4 months, there was
      insufficient evidence for the intermediate-term or long-term therapeutic effects of
      acupuncture or fire needle therapy in terms of reducing the pain associated with LE.

      The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the outcomes of acupuncture used in
      combination with fire needle treatment are better than those of acupuncture alone in patients
      with LE.
