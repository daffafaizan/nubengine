      I. To assess the frequency of pathogenic germline homologous recombination (HR) variants in
      men with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC).

      II. To collect patient reported outcome measures associated with genetic testing in men with
      mPC.

      III. To assess the utility of family history to enrich screening of population of men with
      metastatic prostate cancer for germline HRD variants.

      IV. To identify a cohort of men with prostate cancer and inherited homologous recombination
      deficiency (HRD) mutations who might benefit from specific research and treatment
      opportunities and provide a mechanism to notify these men of current and future
      opportunities.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive web-based or hard-copy questionnaires and saliva collection kits via
      mail or in person. Participants also provide saliva samples to be mailed back to Color
      Genomics for genetic testing once complete. Participants then receive phone-based genetic
      counseling if they are identified to have an inherited mutation in a deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) repair gene. All participants have access to phone-based genetic counseling whether or
      not they are not found to have a mutation.

      After study completion, participants are followed up at 6 months.
