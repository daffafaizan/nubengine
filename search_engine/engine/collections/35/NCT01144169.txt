      death. Autophagy may enable renal cancer to escape from cytokine therapy, cytotoxic
      chemotherapy or targeted agents. Hydroxychloroquine prevents autophagy by blocking
      acidification of lysosomes, and is being studied in clinical trials as a means of enhancing
      of cancer therapy. This phase Ib clinical trial will test the hypothesis that pre-operative
      exposure to HC reduces biologic markers of autophagy in peripheral blood, normal kidney and
      renal cancer specimens obtained at the time of nephrectomy. These data will be used in the
      design and pharmacodynamic monitoring of future therapeutic trials of HC in combination with
      high dose interleukin-2 and other systemic therapies for advanced RCC.
