    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of hafnium oxide-containing
      nanoparticles NBTXR3 (NBTXR3) activated by radiotherapy in patients with inoperable,
      locoregional recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), previously treated with definitive
      radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with
      inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC.

      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor response of reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with
      inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC.

      III. To evaluate time-to-event outcomes after reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with
      inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess biomarkers of response in patients treated with NBTXR3/radiation therapy (RT).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of NBTXR3.

      Patients receive NBTXR3 intratumorally (IT) or intranodally on day 1. Within 15 days,
      patients undergo RT 5 times weekly (Monday-Friday) over 3 weeks for a total of 10-15
      fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
