      patients with a diagnosis of primary and recurrent incisional hernias and 1) who decline to
      have surgery to repair the hernia or 2) patients who cannot have surgery because their health
      will not allow them or 3O if surgery to repair the hernia is completed. A comparison will be
      made between those who receive surgery and those who do not.

      Subjects will fill out three survey forms on quality of life and pain at baseline and again
      at six and 12 months. Measurements of change in hernia size will be made, life-style changes
      such as smoking cessation, weight-loss, tighter control of diabetes will be initiated for
      outcome comparison with controls.
