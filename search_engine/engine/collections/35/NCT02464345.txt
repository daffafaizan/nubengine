      BED is needed. The investigators propose a RCT that will compare a novel therapy HAPIFED with
      the current 'gold-standard' trans diagnostic treatment, CBT-E. HAPIFED has been developed by
      the CIs and is based on recent developments in psychological approaches to obesity in general
      (as highlighted in Casazza et al.'s (2013) paper on "Myths, presumptions and facts about
      obesity") and in people with co-morbid obesity and BN or BED. Unlike CBT-E, it allows reduced
      energy intake and education around specific food choices - a necessary element in weight
      loss.
