      placement with varying results. Local anesthetic infiltration at pin application sites has
      been used but was always unsuccessful in obtunding the hemodynamic responses to skull pin
      placement. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, has been recently introduced as
      a sedative for patients on mechanical ventilation. In addition to its sedative effect;
      Dexmedetomidine has significant analgesic qualities and has been labeled as
      "analgesia-sparing". To the best of the investigator's knowledge, few studies investigated
      Dex use to suppress hemodynamic responses to skull pinning. The aim of the current study was
      to evaluate the lowest effective dose of Dexmedetomidine in attenuating the hemodynamic
      responses to skull pin placement for craniotomies. Lidocaine, administered subcutaneously at
      the head-holder pin sites, was more effective in preventing the blood pressure response to
      skull-pin than was deepening the level of anesthesia.
