      interview. They will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Both
      groups will receive a smoking cessation manual and list of resources. The intervention group
      will also receive smoking cessation counseling and nicotine replacement therapy. Both groups
      will be seen for in-person assessments again at 8 weeks and 6 months post baseline.
