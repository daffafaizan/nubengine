      turn to the internet for information and support, yet few controlled studies have examined
      the effectiveness and safety of online support groups. The investigators are testing the
      potential efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of an innovative theory-based online
      support group (OSG) for breast cancer survivors. Members of the control group will
      participate in a standard OSG that encourages self-expression. Members of the experimental
      condition will participate in a prosocial OSG that provides structured helping opportunities
      and coaching on how best to give support to others. Participants will complete two telephone
      interviews and six weekly online support group meetings.
