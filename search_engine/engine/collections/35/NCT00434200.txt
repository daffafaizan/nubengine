      group. The patients who participated in the 2 years intensive exercise training (2 times a
      week, training duration 65 minutes) improved their functional capacity and functional ability
      without detrimental effects on the large joints damage or on disease activity. Only patients
      with excessive large joint damage at baseline were at risk to develop additional damage when
      participating in intensive weight-bearing exercises. Patients who exercised were able to
      delay the decrease of bone mineral density of the hips.
