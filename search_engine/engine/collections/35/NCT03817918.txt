      lung will be made at 2 predetermined areas. The images will be made: after induction (tidal
      volume of 10 mL/kg), during two-lung ventilation (tidal volume of 10 mL/kg) and during
      one-lung ventilation (tidal volume of 10 mL/kg and 5 mL/kg). The sites to be studied will be:
      the 3rd intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line (dependent lung), the 8th intercostal
      space at the posterior axillary line (dependent lung). Three consecutive respiratory cycles
      at each site will be recorded for subsequent analysis.

      Lung ultrasonography will be performed by the principal investigator and a co-investigator
      using a Terason (Teratech Corporation, Burlington, MA) device and a 12L5 linear ultrasound
      probe. For each image, the probe will be oriented perpendicularly to the pleura with the
      pointer towards the participant's head. A depth of 4 cm will be used and adjusted in order to
      have the pleural line located between the center and the three-quarts of the screen. The
      beam's focal zone will be positioned at the level of the pleural line. A 12 MHz frequency
      will be used.

      Using a reference ultrasonographic image, an experienced lung ultrasonographer will segment
      the pleura. From this image, an algorithm will define a region of interest which will be
      followed throughout the rest of the images of the video sequence. Thereafter, the algorithm
      will calculate the various components of pulmonary strain in relation to tidal volume. The
      principal investigator or a co-investigator will visually validate the speckle-tracking.
