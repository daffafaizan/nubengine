      differentiate between "hard" breast cancer masses and "soft" normal tissue. Unlike strain
      elastography, shear wave elastography applies a non-compressive longitudinal acoustic
      radiation force to underlying tissues, inducing transverse shear waves. Studies in Thiel
      embalmed human cadavers have shown significant differences in Young's modulus between
      intraneural and extraneural tissue, and ready colour differentiation between tissues.

      The investigators own pilot studies have shown a 3-fold greater Young's modulus within nerve
      in Thiel embalmed cadavers and human volunteers. The investigators hypothesis is that shear
      wave elastography can differentiate between nerve and adjacent tissue in patients before
      nerve block for surgery. If so, this technology has the potential to reduce the incidence of
      complications with UGRA and encourage parallel applications such as cancer node biopsy.
