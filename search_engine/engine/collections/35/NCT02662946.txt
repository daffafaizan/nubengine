      anastomotic leakage is insufficient vascular supply. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      usefulness of intraoperative assessment of vascular anastomotic perfusion in laparoscopic
      colorectal surgery using indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced fluorescence, in order to assess if
      the information of the ICG angiography could lead to change the site of resection and
      improving the anastomotic leak rate. Two-hundred and eight patients, undergoing rectal
      resection or left colectomy, for benign or malignant disease, with high vessels ligation,
      will be randomized intro 2 arms: ICH angiography (colonic perfusion is intraoperatively assed
      with ICG angiography and level of resection is selected based on the fluorescence) and
      Control (resection is performed with subjective judgment). The rate of postoperative leak in
      the two groups will be recorded.
