    
      Background:

        -  Human papillomavirus (HPV)+ oropharyngeal cancer is an increasingly common type of
           cancer that frequently affects young patients.

        -  The treatment for locoregionally advanced cancer carries substantial life-long
           morbidity.

        -  Although the overall prognosis for HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer is favorable, about 20
           percent of patients with stage II disease and 35 percent of patients with stage III
           disease will die within five years.

        -  Induction therapy is an area of active study in this type of cancer. The aims of
           induction therapy are to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and potentially to permit
           the study of de-intensified definitive treatment of locoregional disease.

        -  E7 TCR T cells, administered as a single infusion, have demonstrated safety and clinical
           activity in treatment-refractory metastatic HPV+ cancers.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the feasibility of systemic treatment with E7 TCR T cells for stage II or stage
      III HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with stage II or stage III HPV+
           oropharyngeal cancer.

        -  The cancer must be HPV16+ and patient must be HLA-A 02:01+ HLA type.

        -  Patients must be treatment-naive.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II, single arm, feasibility study of induction E7 TCR T cell therapy.

        -  Patients will receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, a
           single infusion of E7 TCR T cells, and systemic aldesleukin.

        -  Patients will be referred for standard of care definitive therapy (chemoradiation or
           surgery) at the time of maximum tumor response
