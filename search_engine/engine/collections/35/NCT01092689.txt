      Identifying and modifying risk factors can reduce mortality through prevention. Carcinogens
      that form in meat cooked at high temperatures may be modifiable risk factors for pancreatic
      cancer, but direct evidence is needed to demonstrate involvement in pancreas tissue. We
      propose to recruit subjects scheduled for pancreatectomy as a treatment for pancreatic
      cancer. These subjects will ingest a very low dose of radiolabeled PhIP, a meat-derived
      carcinogen, and a small amount of resected tissue (waste) will be analyzed with highly
      sensitive technology to determine if this carcinogen binds to DNA in the pancreas. We
      hypothesize that the meat-derived carcinogen will bind to DNA in the pancreas. The amount of
      PhIP ingested is equivalent to the amount in two very well-done barbecued chicken breasts and
      the dose of radioactivity is comparable to a typical chest x-ray. This research can increase
      understanding of pancreatic carcinogenesis, facilitating the design of prevention strategies.
