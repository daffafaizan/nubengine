      I. Estimate the maximum-tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of pazopanib
      hydrochloride in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      II. Define and describe the toxicities of this regimen in these patients. III. Characterize
      the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib hydrochloride in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Preliminarily define the antitumor activity of pazopanib hydrochloride within the confines
      of a phase I study.

      II. Evaluate changes in tumor vascular permeability following initiation of pazopanib
      hydrochloride and correlate these changes with clinical outcome by dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients accrued after the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib hydrochloride has been
      determined receive pazopanib hydrochloride as an oral suspension.

      Some patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and periodically during
      study. Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic studies.
