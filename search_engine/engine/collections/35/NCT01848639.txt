    
      -  During a run-in period : Spironolactone will be initially administered per os at a 25 mg
           dose per two days in practice after the session, three times per week

        -  Patients will be randomized (spironolactone vs. placebo) and titrated over one month to
           a maximum single dose of 25 mg/d

        -  However if kalemia is greater than or equal to 5.5 mmol / l twice on this run-in period
           or on the day of randomization, patient won't be randomized.

        -  A pre-specified algorithm for the management of the risk of incident hyperkalemia will
           be followed, including dose adjustment, temporary cessation of study treatment, in
           addition to usual dietary measures and the use of chelating resins and low-potassium
           dialysis baths

        -  Patients will be followed for a mean of 2 years.
