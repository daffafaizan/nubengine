      will evaluate the clinical efficacy, overall safety and tolerability of ribociclib in
      combination with letrozole in older women (â‰¥70 years) with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer
      and no prior hormonal treatment for advanced disease as per the indication approved by the
      European Medicines Authority (EMA) and as made available by Belgian national authorities in
      the national health care system. A total of maximum 150 patients will be enrolled for
      treatment with Letrozole (2.5 mg once daily) + ribociclib 600 mg (day 1 to 21 in a 28 day
      cycle), which will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or
      patient/physician decision to withdraw. During the study, patients will be continuously
      evaluated for disease progression as per national standard of care (approximately every 12
      weeks radiologically); for safety; and for quality of life and geriatric assessment
      components including functional status with QoL assessment and CGA at 3 months (+/- 2 weeks)
      and at 1 year (+/-2 weeks).
