      prandial), plus regular subcutaneous insulin as rescue, applied to total parenteral nutrition
      (TPN) should be as effective (glycemic control, variability) and safe (hypoglycemia) as the
      usual (regular insulin inside the TPN reservoir and subcutaneous insulin as rescue) in
      patients with type 2 diabetes critics.
