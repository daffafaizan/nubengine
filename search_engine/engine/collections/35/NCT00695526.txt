      reported cranberry consumption increased nearly 8% of circulating high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL) cholesterol levels in non-diabetic subjects. Although characteristics of diabetic
      dyslipidemia are low HDL and high triglyceride, the benefits of concentrated powder of
      cranberry juice on lipid profiles were not evident in type 2 diabetic subjects with diet
      control alone. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of cranberry on lipid profiles in
      type 2 diabetic subjects using oral anti-diabetic drugs have never been studied, especially
      total to HDL cholesterol ratio which is important in predicting cardiovascular diseases in
      Asian and/or diabetic population. Furthermore, cranberry has anti-oxidative effect which is
      associated with reduction of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) cholesterol in
      non-diabetes. Therefore, we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to
      assess the effect of cranberry on lipid profiles in type 2 diabetes.
