    
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center, clinical trial in which 128
      participants diagnosed with PTPNP will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment groups:

        1. CMM plus Axon Therapy (n=64)

        2. CMM alone (n=64)

      Participants will be consented, screened, and undergo a 7-day baseline assessment to measure
      pain scores and assess diary compliance. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will undergo
      an in-clinic baseline evaluation, receive randomization assignment, and start their
      respective treatments.

      All participants will return to the clinic for assessment at Day 30 (± 14 days), Day 90 (± 14
      days), Day 180 (± 30 days) and Day 365 (± 30 days). Participants randomized to the CMM plus
      Axon Therapy group will return to the clinic for Axon Therapy treatments as follows:

        -  Month 1: 6 treatments

             -  WEEK 1: 3 treatments (consecutive treatments are best)

             -  WEEK 2-4: Weekly treatments

        -  Month 2: Bi-monthly treatment

        -  Months 3-12: Treatments every 2-4 weeks

      In addition to in-clinic assessments and treatments, all participants will a receive weekly
      phone follow-up to assess pain intensity and occurrence of adverse events after treatment
      starts. Weekly phone follow-ups will only occur during weeks when the participant is not in
      clinic for treatment.
