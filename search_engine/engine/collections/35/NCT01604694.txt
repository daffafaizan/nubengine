      this study was made versus placebo: one group of patients will have a TAP block of
      levobupivacaine, the second group will have a TAP block with placebo before the surgery.
      Patient follow up includes data collected before surgery (at pr√© anesthesic visit and just
      before surgery) and data collected immediately after surgery (at post operative time) and at
      distance of the surgery (15 days and 3 months after the surgery). The principal aim is to
      show if TAP block have an analgesic effect in post operative period after abdominoplasty. To
      answer this question we will compare opioid intake during the two days after the surgery
      between the two groups.
