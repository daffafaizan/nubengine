    
      Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases in
      dermatology. Due to genetic predispositions, inflammatory changes of the skin occur. The
      specific mechanisms are only partly understood for both diseases and targeted therapies are
      established in psoriasis therapy and are becoming available for atopic dermatitis. In order
      to better understand the course of the disease and to characterize the changes in the
      inflammatory mechanisms during the course of the disease and under the influence of external
      factors such as therapies, longitudinal prospective studies are needed to evaluate clinical
      data and biological samples. This study investigates long-term clinical and epidemiological
      data from affected patients, as well as biological samples, including blood samples, skin
      biopsies, non-invasive skin swabs for microbiome detection, and tape strips for the molecular
      characterization of the disease. Data collection and biosampling will be done during routine
      visits, typically at week 0, 2 and 12.
