      using an insulin pump and Dexcom CGM with minimum data requirements will initiate a run-in
      phase of 2 to 8 weeks that will be customized based on whether the participant is already a
      pump or CGM user. Participants who skip or successfully complete the run-in will be randomly
      assigned 2:1 to the use of closed-loop control (CLC group) using t:slim X2 with Control-IQ
      Technology vs. SAP for 6 months.
