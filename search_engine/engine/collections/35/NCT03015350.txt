      ventilation and one lung ventilation. The investigators will use Gas Chromatography for
      define drugs levels. 16 patients with ASA I-III patients who undergo thoracotomy and
      abdominal surgery will be recruited to this study. Patients will divided in to the 2 groups.
      %1.5 Sevoflurane will apply in Group S and %6 Desflurane will apply in Group D during
      anesthesia maintenance. Each groups will divide 2 subgroups which are one lung ventilation
      groups and two lung ventilation groups. Two lung ventilation will be performed to Group Sa
      and Group Da, one lung ventilation will be performed to Group Sb and Group Db. Sequential
      blood samples will be taken from both arterial and central venous canula at the same time
      point. First blood samples will be taken at 40. minutes of anesthesia. Sequential samples
      will be taken at interval of 10 minutes during two lung ventilation. In one lung ventilation
      second blood samples will be taken at the 10. minutes of one lung ventilation. After than at
      the interval of 10 minutes, collection of blood samples both arterial and central venous will
      be continue.

      All collection will assess with gas chromatography.
