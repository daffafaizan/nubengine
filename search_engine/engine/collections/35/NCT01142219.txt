      cell disease patients older than 1 year of age. The patients were randomly assigned to take
      0.1 g/kg/day of either L-arginine or placebo orally. Adverse events were monitored by a
      safety committee. The variables were assessed while patients were in remission, as part of
      their routine care: weight, blood pressure, full blood cell count, creatinine and dosage of
      methemoglobin at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2),
      fetal hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity were measured
      through transthoracic Doppler echocardiogram before and after treatment.
