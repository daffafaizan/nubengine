    
      Participants in the early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) spectrum, enrolled in ongoing or future
      clinical trials with JNJ-54861911 (Phase 1b or Phase 2 studies) will be provided the
      opportunity to participate in this study upon completion of their treatment period under the
      parent protocol. The study will consist of a Screening phase and 2 sequential treatment
      phases (a 12-month double-blind [DB] treatment phase [placebo controlled] and an open-label
      [OL] phase [active]) followed by an End-of-Treatment visit. Treatment in OL phase will
      continue until registration of JNJ-54861911; unless safety issues emerge as determined by the
      Data Review Committee (DRC) that would warrant termination of the study. Blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected to evaluate the plasma and CSF
      pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54861911, as well as amyloid beta fragments. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
