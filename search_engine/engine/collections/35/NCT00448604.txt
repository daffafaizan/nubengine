      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity due to repeated
      exacerbations. The impact of viral infections during and outside COPD exacerbations is poorly
      understood and there is only scarce data on the role of new biological markers of infection
      for the management of COPD exacerbations.

      Objectives of the project

      The investigators aim to

        1. describe the epidemiology of viral infections in patients admitted with an exacerbation
           of their COPD;

        2. explore the evolution of viral infections outside exacerbations;

        3. analyze the impact of viral infections on clinical outcomes;

        4. explore the role of biological markers (CRP, procalcitonin) for the diagnosis and
           prognosis of viral infections.

      Methods

      The investigators will prospectively follow-up 100 patients admitted with an acute
      exacerbation of their COPD. Virological samples will be obtained at admission and at 3
      months, to explore the evolution outside episodes of acute exacerbation. Clinical information
      will be obtained after one-year follow-up. Samples will be tested by RT-PCR for 15
      respiratory viruses. The impact of viral infections and the role of biological markers will
      be explored using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.
