      chemotherapy with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX. Although a strategy of using sequential 5-FU, irinotecan
      and oxaliplatin has been thought to maximize overall survival in such patients, significant
      toxicity remains a problem. It has been suggested feasible that chemotherapy can be
      discontinued after 2-3 months and restart same treatment on progression in patients with
      chemosensitive colorectal cancer. Thus we designed this pilot phase II study to evaluate the
      feasibility and efficacy of first-line FOLFIRI discontinuation after initial 8 cycles and
      reintroduction after progression.
