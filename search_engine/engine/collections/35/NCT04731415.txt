        -  Melanogenesis of eyelid and facial skin -> melasma

        -  Cellular alteration of lacrimal and meibomian gland -> dry eye symptoms

        -  Increased corneal thickness and corneal curvature -> contact lens intolerance

        -  Increased lens thickness -> loss of accommodation

        -  Decreased intraocular pressure -> better glaucoma control There are few studies of
           posterior changes in pregnant women. Many limitations of previous publications includes
           lack of internal control and no data of postpartum contraception. However, choroidal
           thickness seems to be thicker in pregnant women than non-pregnant women. The other
           changes are non-inclusive.
