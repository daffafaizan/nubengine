      of Barrett's tissue, patients who have given written, informed consent are randomized (sealed
      envelope method) and placed on an oral dose of zinc gluconate (26.6 mg zinc BID) or a placebo
      (molar equivalent of sodium gluconate BID) for 14 days. At the time of endoscopy, 4 biopsies
      are taken (and pooled) from the Barrett's tissue and 4 from proximal normal esophageal
      tissue. Biopsies are flash frozen for later analyses by atomic absorption spectroscopy, PAGE
      and Western immunoblot or RNA microarray.
