      treatment, assessment, compliance, and outcomes in smokers with and without respiratory
      symptoms/COPD. The study aims to reveal and address the anticipated barriers to the
      acceptance and implementation of mHealth devices in this patient population and clinical
      setting. As is well documented, the more attention patients receive from medical personnel,
      the better their clinical outcomes. Here we are attempting to use device-driven monitoring
      applications, interactive reminders, and teaching modules to deliver a constant positive
      feedback loop to patients to improve their health decisions.

      Objectives of the study:

      To assess the feasibility of using mHealth devices in current smokers with and without
      respiratory symptoms/COPD.

      To assess the utility (i.e., validity and reproducibility) of mHealth devices in detecting
      vitality parameters in current smokers with and without respiratory symptoms/COPD (e.g.,
      heart rate; blood oxygenation; steps/motion; FEV1, FVC, and their ratio; peak expiratory flow
      [PEF]).
