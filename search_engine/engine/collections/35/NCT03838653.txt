      becoming a routine study for patients requiring thoracic surgical procedures. On the day of
      thoracic surgery, the participant will be intubated with a left-sided DLT and investigators
      will confirm the correct insertion of the left-sided DLT at first pass under direct
      laryngoscopy. This information will be recorded and saved. After the study is completed,
      investigators will review the MDCT of the chest to review any abnormal findings and correlate
      it with the success of the insertion of the left-sided DLT into the left bronchus.
      Investigators will conduct a pilot study to determine the most influential anatomical change
      that leads to the DLT misplacement at the first pass based upon the changes of the
      tracheal-bronchial anatomy on MDCT.
