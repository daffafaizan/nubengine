      participate in group recreational and classroom activities, with 12 children and 5 staff per
      group. Three behavioral conditions (no behavioral modification, low-intensity behavioral
      modification, and high-intensity behavioral modification) are delivered in random order, with
      each condition lasting 3 weeks. Along with the behavioral treatment conditions, children
      receive 1 of 4 medication doses (placebo, 0.15 mg/kg methylphenidate, 0.3 mg/kg
      methylphenidate, or 0.6 mg/kg methylphenidate) in random order, with each dose varied daily
      and repeated 3 or 4 times within each behavioral treatment condition.

      Measures include frequency counts of positive and negative behaviors, academic productivity
      and accuracy in the classroom, and counselor, parent, and teacher ratings of benefits and
      side effects. Parents attend training sessions and implement behavioral programs at home.
