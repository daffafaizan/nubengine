        -  Determine the anti-tumor activity of erlotinib and gemcitabine in patients with
           metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracycline and/or taxane.

        -  Determine the adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2 receptor intensity and
           serum concentrations have an impact on clinical response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the impact of genetic differences in proteins involved in drug response
           (transport, metabolism, and mechanism of action) on clinical response and adverse events
           associated with gemcitabine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8 and oral erlotinib on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving a complete response are followed every 6 weeks for up to 5 years or until
      disease progression (PD). Patients discontinuing study therapy for any other reason are
      followed every 3 months until PD and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
