      and unmet clinical need to optimize pharmacotherapy both during hospital stay and after
      discharge Therefore, we aim to perform a randomized controlled trial in geriatric inpatients
      to investigate the impact of a multifaceted clinical pharmacy intervention on health related
      outcomes. The primary objective is to reduce all-cause unplanned hospital visits in geriatric
      inpatients. Secondary objective are to optimize drug therapy in geriatric inpatients and
      improve their health; To empower and educate patients, caregivers,community pharmacists and
      physicians regarding drug regimen decisions to maximize therapy adherence and the
      understanding of the (de)prescribing process and to enhance healthy ageing; To optimize
      transitional care from the hospital to primary care.
