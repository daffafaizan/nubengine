    
      PACTN is manufactured by a novel method to employ cancer-specific somatic variants
      (mutations) as a means to immunize autologous T lymphocytes to specifically kill cancer cells
      bearing the protein products of the mutations.

      The PACTN method is based on the premise that somatic DNA mutations that cause cancer often
      give rise to proteins with an altered amino acid sequence. Peptides derived from these
      proteins, if expressed in the context of MHC Class I or II may be perceived as "non-self" by
      the immune system; that is, they may be perceived as neoantigens (aka, neoepitopes). Such
      neoantigens could therefore serve as immunogenic targets for the development of
      patient-specific, personalized T cell mediated immunotherapy.
