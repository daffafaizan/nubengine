      2.5 System for 24 hours following primary PCI for STEMI has the potential to limit the
      infarction of at-risk myocardium compared to primary PCI with routine post-PCI care (standard
      of care). This study is a feasibility study. Therefore, the principal objective is to
      identify trends in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based efficacy outcomes between
      the randomized treatment arms (Impella arm compared standard of care.
