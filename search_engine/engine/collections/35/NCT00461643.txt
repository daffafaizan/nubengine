      and ultrasonographic assessments. Successively, patients enrolled will be allocated in three
      different strategies (strategy A, B, and C).

      A total of 184 infertile PCOS patients per arm will be enrolled and treated with three
      different integrated strategies: clomiphene followed by clomiphene plus metformin followed by
      gonadotropins (strategy A); metformin followed by metformin plus clomiphene followed by
      gonadotropins(strategy B); and metformin plus clomiphene followed by gonadotropins(strategy
      C).

      In all patients, the same regimen will be used to administered clomiphene, metformin, and
      gonadotropins.Both clomiphene and metformin will be administered at incremental doses in each
      case.Gonadotropins will be administrated to obtain a controlled ovarian stimulation using
      highly purified urinary FSH in a low-dose step-up protocol.

      During the study, the clinical and reproductive outcomes, and adverse experiences will be
      evaluated in each woman.
