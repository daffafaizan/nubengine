      physical therapy or in the study group and receive an equivalent 10 weeks therapy utilizing
      vibration, unweighting, therapeutic exercise and manual mobilization. The study uses a
      baseline MRI and x-rays which have shown the justification for surgical intervention and
      during the course of the protocol will have repeat MRI's and x-rays to determine any
      statistical change in the lumbar spine resulting in reduction or elimination of pain,
      improved range of motion, improvements in performance and reduction or elimination for the
      need for surgical intervention. Anatomical measures will be done comparing pre-treatment
      versus post-treatment and will include foraminal dimensions,disc height, canal stenosis,
      lumbosacral angle and facet spacing. Questionnaires will be completed during the course of
      the treatment and post-treatment at 6 months and one year. The final follow up phone call to
      the patient will be made following 24 months post initial treatment to determine the current
      patient status pertaining to low back pain, subsequent treatment, surgery, etc. Final study
      documentation will occur at that time. Intermediate results at one year will compare the
      control group vs. the study group for overall result differences.
