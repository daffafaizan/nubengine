      children in the West. There is an imperative need for health care professionals to develop
      and evaluate interventions to promote the psychological wellbeing of children living in
      poverty. First, however, it is crucial to assess and understand how the impact of poverty, in
      particular the impact of income disparity, affects the psychological wellbeing of Hong Kong
      children before any intervention to promote it can be planned, developed, or evaluated.
      Unfortunately, while much public concern about poverty has concentrated on children's
      physical development, the impact of poverty and income disparity on their psychological
      well-being remains relatively underexplored. Because the cultural context in which they live
      is drastically different from that of Western children, the way that Chinese children view
      the nature and meaning of poverty, as well as their responses to it and to any psychosocial
      interventions, will in all likelihood differ considerably from those of Western children.
      Hence, the aim of this study is to explore the impacts of poverty and income disparity on the
      psychological well-being of Hong Kong Chinese children.
