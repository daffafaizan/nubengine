    
      This is a placebo-controlled double blind study. Patients will be randomized to receive
      etanercept versus placebo in a 2:1 fashion for the first 3 months. All patients will receive
      etanercept in the last 3 months.

      Patients with active PPP will be included. A washout of 4 weeks for systemic medications and
      2 weeks for Psoralen Ultra Violet A (PUVA) therapy will be required. A washout period of 2
      weeks will be required for all other topical medications. The Palmoplantar pustulosis
      severity index (PPPASI) will be used to evaluate severity. Only patients with a severity
      score of 8 or more on hands and/or feet will be included. Safety will be assessed by
      performing physical examinations, evaluation of adverse events and biological parameters
      (complete blood count (CBC), chemistry, urinalysis).

      High quality digital medical photographs will be taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.
