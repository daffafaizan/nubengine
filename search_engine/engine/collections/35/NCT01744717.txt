    
      The specific Aims for the study are :

      To determine the validity and reliability of the ESCID scale to assess pain in
      non-communicative critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation, in a large sample of
      critically ill medical and surgical patients.

      To assess the relationship between the application of a common and painful procedure, usual
      in daily practice, and its associated changes in physiological indicators of pain: variation
      of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, sweating.

      To assess the degree of pain when applying two painful procedures documented as common in the
      usual care of critically ill patients, and one non-painful procedure, using two pain scales:
      ESCID and BPS.

      To assess the differences in the employment of the pain scales in patients with medical and
      surgical pathology.
