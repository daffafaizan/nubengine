      structural support and flexibility to the spinal column. Intervertebral discs do not remain
      structurally intact over a lifetime and degenerate as a natural part of aging. Degenerated
      discs do not react to stresses and forces the same as healthy discs. When too much stress is
      applied to a degenerated disc, tears can result. Evidence suggests that when a tear is
      present, sensory nerve endings can grow into the tear and transmit pain.

      The TransDiscal System (TDS) is a medical device that is used in a procedure called Disc
      Biacuplasty and is currently available in the United States and throughout the world. The TDS
      enables the back of the disc to be heated to high enough temperatures to ablate the nerves
      inside that are transmitting pain, while maintaining low enough temperatures to prevent
      damage to surrounding tissues. The TDS uses two electrodes, located at the ends of two thin
      probes, which are placed on both sides of the back of the intervertebral disc by inserting
      them through the skin into the disc using x-ray guidance. Radiofrequency (RF) current flows
      in the disc between the two electrodes, heating the tissue in the disc to the desired
      temperature. The study evaluates a modified heating protocol than what is currently in
      clinical use which should allow for a larger area of the back of the disc to be heated.
