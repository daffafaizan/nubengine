      be performed. Brachial and aortic blood pressure (BP), wave reflection and arterial stiffness
      indices will be assessed with the brachial cuff-based oscillometric device Mobil-O-Graph NG
      (IEM, Stolberg, Germany). The above hemodynamic and arterial wall parameters will be measured
      for 24-hours on visits 1 (baseline) and 7 (month 6). The monitor will be set to obtain
      recordings 3 times/hour from 11:00 pm to 06:59 am and 2 times/hour from 07:00 am to 10:59 pm.
      Measurements will be used for the analysis if >80% of recordings were valid with no more than
      two non-consecutive day hours with fewer than two valid measurements, and no more than one
      night hour without valid recording, according to recommendations for ambulatory BP
      monitoring. Bioelectrical Impendance Analysis (BIA) with the Fresenius Body Composition
      Monitor (BCM - Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homberg, Germany) will be performed on visits 1, 4
      and 6 in order to assess the hydration status and body composition parameters of the
      participants.
