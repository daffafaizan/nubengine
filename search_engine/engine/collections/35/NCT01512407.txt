      However, recurrence is common after surgery and most occurs in the liver. Transarterial
      chemoembolisation (TACE) is an effective palliative treatment for HCC. It involves the
      infusion of chemotherapeutic agent admixed with iodised oil followed by embolisation of the
      hepatic arterial flow using small particles. This procedures allows application of smaller
      dose of chemotherapy concentrated to the liver and thus is well tolerated with minimal side
      effects. We conduct a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE after
      hepatectomy in HCC patients.
