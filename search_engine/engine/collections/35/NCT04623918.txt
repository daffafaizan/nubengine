      burden in women of reproductive age and children. In this randomized controlled trial, 317
      women aged 18-45 years living in convents in the greater Manila area, Philippines, were fed
      meals using either biofortified or commercially available rice for all meals, 7 days a week,
      for 9 months. Women living in convents in the greater Manila area were recruited for this
      study. These women represent a segment of the population at high risk for iron deficiency,
      consume large quantities of rice, and all of their meals are prepared and consumed in common
      kitchen and dining areas, respectively.

      The investigators hypothesized that daily consumption of iron-biofortified rice
      (IR68144-2B-2-2-3) would improve hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and total body iron in 9 months,
      compared to control rice. In order to examine this hypothesis, the investigators conducted a
      randomized efficacy trial of iron-biofortified rice and iron status in among women living in
      convents in the greater area of Manila, Philippines for 9 months.

      The objective of this randomized efficacy feeding trial was to determine the effects of
      consuming iron-biofortified rice on iron status in women, compared to non-biofortified rice.

      The long-term goal of this study is to determine if iron bio-fortification of rice is an
      efficacious and potentially effective strategy to improve iron status of at-risk populations
      in resource-limited settings.
