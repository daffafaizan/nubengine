      a few researches are focused on the exercises physiological effect at the postpartum recovery
      period.

      A prospective observational study was designed to evaluate the protective or the prolapsed
      effect of abdominal and pelvic floor exercises in postpartum women.

      Two groups were established: Group A was composed of primiparous women during postpartum
      period and group B of nulliparous women. Both groups practiced the same set of 6 abdominal
      and perineum exercises. The bladder descent was registered by ultrasonography, and the
      correct execution was controlled in both groups by superficial pelvic floor and abdominal
      electromyography.

      A Graphical User Interface on MATLAB software has been developed for aiding in offline
      measurement process.
