      mostly assessed by daytime blood gases and nocturnal oxymetry (SpO2). Transcutaneous CO2
      measure (TcCO2) has shown higher sensitivity than SpO2 to detect hypoventilation in
      neuromuscular diseases (NMD) patients. No data exist on the prognostic value of these
      techniques to monitor mechanical ventilated NMD patients.

      Basing on retrospective data review, investigators aimed to compare the prognostic value of
      the data obtained using different tools to assess residual hypoventilation in the cohort of
      ventilated NMD patients followed at our reference center.
