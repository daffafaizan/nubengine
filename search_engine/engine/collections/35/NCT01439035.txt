      standard pediatric endoscope. The endoscopist will introduce the OFDI imaging catheter
      through the biopsy channel of the endoscope already in place. The catheter will be passed
      into the view of the endoscope so that the tip of the catheter can be directly visualized
      throughout the procedure. The catheter will be placed adjacent to the bowel wall in the
      vicinity of the target locations. Once the OFDI probe is in place, OFDI imaging will start
      and data will be continuously collected during helical pullback scanning of the inner
      catheter drive shaft over a predetermined length of approximately 3 cm.

      It is expected that the total experimental procedure including the insertion of the OFDI
      catheter, OFDI imaging, and removal of the catheter will add approximately 10 minutes to the
      total length of the procedure.
