    
      Background:

      Of 17 performance measures of hospital quality regularly reported for the Veterans
      Administration (VA) health care system, rates of colorectal cancer screening are the lowest.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of this study were to 1) test whether a health care provider-directed
      intervention increased colorectal cancer screening rates in an urban VA medical center and 2)
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      Methods:

      The study was a randomized controlled trial, conducted at two clinic firms at a VA Medical
      Center in Chicago. Eligible patients were men, age 50 and older, had no personal or family
      history of colorectal cancer or polyps, had not received colorectal cancer screening, and had
      at least one visit to the clinic during the study period. Health care providers in the
      intervention firm attended a workshop on colorectal cancer screening. Every 4-6 months they
      attended quality improvement workshops where they received group screening rates,
      individualized confidential feedback, and training on improving communication with patients
      with limited literacy skills. Medical records were reviewed for colorectal cancer screening
      recommendations and completion. Literacy level was assessed in a subset of patients. In the
      cost-effectiveness analysis, resource and cost estimates were derived.

      Status:

      The project is complete.
