    
      Purpose: We propose a study comparing the morphological and functional aspects of the
      neosquamous epithelium (NSE) after ablative therapy for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE)
      to that of native squamous epithelium in normal controls as well as gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD), non-BE subjects.

      Participants: Eligible subjects will be women and men between the ages of 18-80, with one of
      the following:

        1. Two or greater cm of dysplastic BE, who will undergo or have undergone radiofrequency
           ablation for BE at UNC, or

        2. Diagnosed with GERD per a gastrointestinal (GI) physician undergoing upper endoscopy for
           other indications at UNC, or

        3. Non-GERD controls per a GI physician with normal esophageal mucosa undergoing upper
           endoscopy for other indications at UNC.

      Procedures (methods): Esophageal biopsies will be obtained specifically for research purposes
      before ablation therapy or, in subjects not receiving ablative therapy, after completion of
      the clinically indicated procedure and before withdrawal of the endoscope. Information from
      the medical record or from patient interview will be obtained regarding diagnosis (Barrett's
      esophagus, GERD, etc), and a questionnaire administered regarding the duration and frequency
      of reflux symptoms and complications of reflux disease. Subjects who are enrolled in the
      pre-ablation group will have additional biopsies and questionnaires administered during
      scheduled follow-up visits. On the last follow-up visit, this group will also undergo
      impedance-pH testing using standard methods, to assess for degree of control of esophageal
      acid exposure, and for number, duration and symptom correlation of non-acid reflux events.
