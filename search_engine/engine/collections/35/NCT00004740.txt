    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients in the first group self-administer
      oral isoniazid following the standard clinic protocol for 6 months. They receive individual
      counseling and education by a peer educator at entry and at week 2, participate in a monthly
      support group cofacilitated by a peer counselor and health educator, and make a monthly
      clinic visit.

      Patients in the second group receive oral isoniazid twice a week. Therapy is administered by
      the nurse, who observes ingestion and swallowing. Nursing education and support per standard
      clinic procedures is provided at each monthly clinic visit.

      Patients in the third group self-administer oral isoniazid, without enhanced education and
      peer support, following the standard clinic protocol for 6 months. Nursing education and
      support per standard clinic procedures is provided at each monthly clinic visit.

      Within each group, patients are randomly assigned to an immediate or deferred financial
      compensation schedule. Immediate compensation for compliance with medication and clinical
      visit is given during the monthly clinic visit, while deferred compensation is given at study
      completion.

      It is recommended that HIV-seropositive patients receive 6 additional months of standard
      isoniazid therapy.
