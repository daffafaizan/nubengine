      administered as surgical prophylaxis to children scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB. In
      particular, vancomycin PK during CPB has been studied only in small case series, whereas no
      specific study has been conducted, so far, in the specific setting of children receiving
      cefoxitin during CPB.

      CPB affects patients' volemia and drugs PK is eventually altered. On the other side during
      and after surgery for heart defects, many risk factors may decrease renal and hepatic
      clearance, including altered renal perfusion, use of vasoactive agents, and use of
      concomitant nephrotoxic medications.

      Primary Objective of the study will be:

      â€¢ To study the pharmacokinetic profile of vancomycin and cefoxitin administered, as
      antibiotic prophylaxis to children undergoing elective CPB.

      Secondary Objectives will be:

        -  To evaluate if a significant difference in blood levels will occur in the four
           predetermined patients' categories.

        -  To evaluate the role of hemodilution during CPB on studied antibiotics' serum
           concentration

        -  To verify the incidence of post-operative infections in the studied population with
           particular attention to sensitive bacteria

        -  To evaluate the impact of ultrafiltration in studied antibiotics' clearance

        -  To evaluate safety of the administered antibiotics This is a prospective monocentric,
           open label, not controlled clinical trial.
