      infertility treatment is Clomiphene Citrate which leads to 50 % pregnancies. In case of
      failure, it is possible to propose surgical ovarian drilling or ovarian hyperstimulation with
      Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI) which lead to 50% pregnancies each. However, surgical
      treatment could be associated to surgical complications, and medical treatment could be
      associated to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and/or multiple pregnancies.

      The aim of this study is to compare the two treatments to demonstrate the equivalence of
      efficacy and the diminution of multiple pregnancies by the surgical treatments. After an
      ambulatory surgery we will observe the spontaneous fertility during 9 months. For the medical
      treatment, Metformin is proposed during 9 months associated with 3 cycles of ovarian
      hyperstimulation and IUI if the sperm is normal Ovarian drilling will be performed by
      FERTILOSCOPY. 126 patients will be necessary in each group (with interval of equivalence :
      10%).
