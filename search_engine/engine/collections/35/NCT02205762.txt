      vinblastine and prednisone is an effective therapy for Multi-system (MS)-LCH. The previous
      prospective trial LCH-III confirmed this regimen as a standard regimen for MS-LCH in patients
      with and without risk organ involvement. It also showed that prolonged treatment in the
      latter group (treatment duration of 12 vs. 6 months) is superior in preventing disease
      reactivations. The results of this trial are encouraging and serve as a basis for the LCH-IV
      study design.Due to the complexity of the disease presentations and outcomes, the LCH-IV
      study seeks to tailor treatment based on features at presentation and on response to
      treatment, leading to seven strata:

        -  Stratum I: First-line treatment for MS-LCH patients (Group 1) and patients with Single
           system (SS)-LCH with multifocal bone or "Central Nervous System (CNS)-risk" lesions
           (Group 2)

        -  Stratum II: Second-line treatment for non-risk patients (patients without risk organ
           involvement who fail first-line therapy or have a reactivation after completion of
           first-line therapy)

        -  Stratum III: Salvage treatment for risk LCH (patients with dysfunction of risk organs
           who fail first-line therapy)

        -  Stratum IV: Stem cell transplantation for risk LCH (patients with dysfunction of risk
           organs who fail first-line therapy)

        -  Stratum V: Monitoring and treatment of isolated tumorous and neurodegenerative CNS-LCH

        -  Stratum VI: Natural history and management of "other" SS-LCH (patients who do not need
           systemic therapy at the time of diagnosis)

        -  Stratum VII: Long-term Follow up (all patients irrespective of previous therapy will be
           followed for reactivation or permanent consequences once complete disease resolution has
           been achieved and the respective protocol treatment completed)
