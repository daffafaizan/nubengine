      divided into two groups,segmental artery clamping group and main artery clamping group. All
      procedures were performed by the same laparoscopic surgeon. Blood loss, operation time, warm
      ischemia time, complications and affected renal function before and after operation will be
      recorded and compared. The safety and efficiency of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with
      segmental renal artery clamping will be evaluated in comparison with the conventional main
      renal artery clamping technique.
