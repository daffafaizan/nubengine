      economic burdens. Although several wound dressings are available, some limitations of those
      dressings still existed resulting in the need for new wound dressing development.

      The sericin dressing with collagen was developed to provide a moist environment and bioactive
      ingredients to the wound bed. To evaluate its efficacy and safety, the STSG donor sites of
      each patient will be divided into two equal areas. Each area will be randomly allocated into
      sericin dressing with collagen group or control group (Bactigras®). The outcomes will be
      collected to examine the efficacy and safety of sericin dressing with collagen in comparison
      with commercial dressing Bactigras®.
