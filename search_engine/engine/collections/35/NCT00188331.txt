      function in 120 patients with localized CRC who receive 5FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Each
      patient will be evaluated at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months for fatigue (using the
      FACT-F questionnaire) and for cognitive function, using validated tests: these will comprise
      both traditional neuropsychological tests and the computerised CANTAB™, a which is less
      dependent on fluency in English. Results during and after chemotherapy will be compared with
      the pre-chemotherapy assessment (so that each patient acts as their own control). Since
      baseline evaluation may be confounded by the recent diagnosis and surgery we will include an
      independent control group of 120 patients who have undergone surgery for CRC but who do not
      receive chemotherapy. Patients found to have cognitive change will be offered further
      comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We will also evaluate quality of life (QOL)
      using the FACT-G questionnaire and anxiety and depression using the General Health
      Questionnaire (GHQ). Blood tests including hormone levels, cytokines, homocysteine,
      procoagulants and apo-lipoprotein E-є4 allele status will evaluate possible mechanisms.
      Finally, since chemotherapy for CRC is evolving to include the more toxic drugs oxaliplatin
      and irinotecan, we will perform a parallel pilot study evaluating pts with early recurrent or
      metastatic CRC who receive these drugs, using similar methods of evaluation.
