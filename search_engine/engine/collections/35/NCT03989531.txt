      and surviving patients mostly suffer from severe heart failure due to an impaired cardiac
      function.It is hypothesized, that Adrenomedullin is a key player in the (dys)-regulation of
      vascular integrity. Adrecizumab is the first-in-class humanized monoclonal
      anti-Adrenomedullin antibody, and acts as a long-lasting plasma Adrenomedullin enhancer
      stabilizing barrier function at a reasonable safety profile.When the anti-Adrenomedullin
      antibody Adrecizumab is administered in the blood circulation at high concentrations by far
      exceeding those of plasma Adrenomedullin, the compartmental distribution of Adrenomedullin is
      altered. Adrecizumab, an IgG with a molecular weight of more than 150 kDa, is too large to
      freely diffuse from the blood circulation to the interstitium. With its fast association
      kinetics Adrecizumab quickly binds to Adrenomedullin in the blood circulation and "pulls"
      Adrenomedullin, which has been initially located in the interstitium, from this compartment
      to the blood circulation. The more Adrecizumab is applied, the stronger is the "pulling"
      effect and the higher the resulting concentrations of Adrecizumab-bound Adrenomedullin in the
      blood circulation. The increase of Adrecizumab-bound Adrenomedullin in the blood circulation
      occurs within 5-15 minutes after administration of Adrecizumab, since it induces a
      translocation of preformed Adrenomedullin. As a consequence of this redistribution, the
      Adrenomedullin concentration in the interstitium decreases, and less Adrenomedullin is able
      to act on smooth muscle cells to exert its vasodilatative activity. In the progression to
      cardiogenic shock, when it comes to excessive vasodilation and hypotension, administration of
      Adrecizumab thus can reduce vasodilation by substracting excessive levels of interstitially
      located Adrenomedullin.
