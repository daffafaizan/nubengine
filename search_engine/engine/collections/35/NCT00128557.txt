    
      This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, community trial of newborn vitamin A
      supplementation on mortality in the first six months of life. The trial is being implemented
      in 596 sectors (i.e. villages and/or smaller groupings), in two thanas comprising a
      population of ~580,000 in rural northern Bangladesh (Gaibandha/Rangpur area) and is nested
      within the JiVitA-1 maternal supplementation study. Women residing in the study area are
      already under 5-weekly pregnancy surveillance conducted by village-based field staff as part
      of the maternal supplementation trial. During their third trimester of pregnancy, women are
      visited by a study supervisor who explains the purpose and procedures of the study. After
      obtaining informed consent, women are interviewed for possible risk factors in the third
      trimester of pregnancy, including a 30-day history of morbidity, a 7-day dietary and alcohol
      intake and tobacco use questionnaire, a 7-day household chores questionnaire, and maternal
      anthropometry (mid upper arm circumference measurement). Upon birth, household members
      contact the village-based field staff who immediately administers the vitamin A or placebo to
      the infant, according to sector assignment. After supplementation, newborns are measured for
      weight, length and mid-upper arm, head and chest circumference, and then followed weekly for
      vital status for three months, and again at six months of age. A child death initiates the
      process of death verification and cause of death determination.
