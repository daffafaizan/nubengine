      extremely LBW (ELBW) premature infants, and it is the most cost consumptive disease in
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit graduates. Vitamin A plays an important role in the development
      of premature lung. Nevertheless, premature infants are prone to vitamin A deficiency. Oral
      supplementation of vitamin A does not alter the incidence of CLD in ELBW infants.
      Intramuscular administration of vitamin A reduced the incidence of CLD. The treatment is
      considered painful and this way is not routinely practiced. Vitamin A is systemically
      bioavailable after intratracheal administration with surfactant in an animal model of newborn
      respiratory distress.
