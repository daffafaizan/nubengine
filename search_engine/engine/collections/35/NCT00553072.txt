      pregnant ladies with eclampsia where it helped neonates also and in mothers with preterm
      labour where the incidence of cerebral palsy was less. We designed a randomised controlled
      trial on 40 neonates with severe perinatal asphyxia to see whether it helps in the short term
      outcome of these neonates.
