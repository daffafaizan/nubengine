      appears at birth or during the first decade of life. Nowadays, doctors put mental health at a
      prior place and pay more attention to the psychological problems of ill kids' parents. In our
      research, we try to find a new modern and efficient psychological counseling mode to improve
      the mentality of parents and relieve their anxiety and depression. We divide guardians of
      parents into two groups .One group is given the traditional follow-up by regular phone call
      every month. The other is in a wechat group. A doctor send the useful information about kids
      care and answer questions of parents at regular time every month. The self-rating anxiety
      scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores of parents are marked before and
      after the long follow up.
