    
      An interventional randomized controlled crossover trial, with the purpose to elucidate the
      reproducibility in nerve block duration on 20 healthy volunteers in Denmark.

      There will be two trial arms:

      1: Day one; Right side low dose nerve block and left side high dose nerve block. Repeated
      after 24 hours. Day three; Left side low dose nerve block and right side high dose nerve
      block. Repeated after 24 hours

      2: Day one; Left side low dose nerve block and right side high dose nerve block Repeated
      after 24 hours Day three; Right side low dose nerve block and left side high dose nerve block
      Repeated after 24 hours

      All volunteers will receive two peripheral nerve blocking catheters adjacent to the common
      peroneal nerve and will be treated two times on each side with Lidocaine 0.5% 5 mL and 10 mL.
