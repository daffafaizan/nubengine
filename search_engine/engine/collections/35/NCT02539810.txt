    
      All eligible patients diagnosed with RH on office BP measurements and unilateral or bilateral
      ARAS ≥60% on a non-invasive test (CT-angiogram or MR-angiogram) will receive a standardized
      optimized triple antihypertensive treatment for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, patients with
      confirmed RH by ABPM (daytime ABPM ≥ 135 or 85 mmHg) and no clinically significant increase
      in plasma creatinine from baseline (< 30%) will undergo a renal angiogram to confirm the
      degree of ARAS ≥60% in diameter.

      Immediately after the renal angiography, all patients will undergo flow fractional reserve
      (FFR) measurements. Once FFR measurements have been done and all criteria are met, patients
      will be randomized in the angiography room to either renal artery stenting + SOMT (stenting
      group) versus SOMT (control group) whatever the results of the FFR in a 1:1 ratio. Both
      groups will continue the SOMT during follow-up.

      The SOMT will be prescribed from the inclusion visit until the 6 month-visit after
      randomization. After randomization, the antihypertensive treatment will be adapted according
      to the results of home BP (HBP) at monthly visits starting 2 months after randomization.
      After the 6-month visit, the antihypertensive treatment adaptation will be left at the
      discretion of the physician in charge of the patient.
