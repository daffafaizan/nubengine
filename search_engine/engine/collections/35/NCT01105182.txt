      Because of its ability to produce large volumes of coagulation necrosis in a controlled
      fashion, this technique has gained acceptance as a viable therapeutic option for unresectable
      liver malignancies. Recently, RFA has been proposed as a viable option for the treatment of
      pulmonary malignancies. Experimental studies in animal tumor models have confirmed the
      effectiveness of RFA in the destruction of experimentally-induced pulmonary malignancies.
      Pilot clinical investigations have suggested that the treatment can achieve high proportions
      of tumor response. We designed a prospective clinical trial aimed at assessing feasibility,
      safety and effectiveness of RFA combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of lung
      malignancies.
