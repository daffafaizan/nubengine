      staggering 246 million people worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea is a relatively common and
      often undiagnosed condition in the general population. Cross-sectional studies of clinic and
      population-based samples suggest that up to 40% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea have
      type 2 diabetes and up to 75% of patients with type 2 diabetes have obstructive sleep apnea.
      There is increasing evidence that the pathophysiological features of intermittent hypoxia and
      sleep fragmentation may be responsible for altering glucose homeostasis and worsening insulin
      sensitivity. The mechanisms through which obstructive sleep apnea impairs glucose metabolism
      are largely unknown. While intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation are likely to play
      an essential role, the relative contribution of each in the causal pathway remains to be
      determined. Moreover, whether the adverse effects of intermittent hypoxia and sleep
      fragmentation are mediated through an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity,
      alterations in corticotropic function, and/or systemic inflammation is not known.
      Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether positive pressure therapy for obstructive
      sleep apnea has salutary effects on glucose metabolism. Many of the available studies
      examining the effects of PAP on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are plagued by
      small sample sizes, lack of a control group, and limited data on compliance with positive
      pressure therapy. The current study will assess, using a community-based sample, whether
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive pressure therapy will improve insulin
      sensitivity, as assessed by the frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test (primary
      outcome measure).
