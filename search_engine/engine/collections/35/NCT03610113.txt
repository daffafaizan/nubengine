      Among them, about 20% are considered as complex features. Conservative treatment has
      traditionally offered an extensive range of results. The reverse shoulder prosthesis as a
      treatment for acute fractures of the proximal humeral in the elderly population has changed
      the therapeutic approach of this acute pathology. However, high-level evidence-based studies
      are still not available, when comparing the conservative treatment with the treatment with
      reverse shoulder prosthesis.

      Objective To compare the functional results and complications of elderly patients presenting
      acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus through two types of treatments; conservative
      treatment and treatment with reverse shoulder prosthesis.

      Methodology A prospective, multicentre and randomized study comparing conservative treatment
      with the surgical treatment at two years followup by the use of functional shoulder
      assessment (Constant scale), complications and re-interventions associated with each
      treatment. The quality of life will also be analyzed through the SF-36 health questionnaire

      Expected results The null hypothesis of the work is based on the appearance of
      non-significant differences between the two groups of the study (conservative vs. surgical
      treatment), concerning functional status, complications, and re-interventions
