    
      This is a single-site, pilot study conducted in the US to determine the benefit of human
      C1-esterase inhibitor [recombinant] (C1-INH-R) therapy to ameliorate ADRs in subjects
      receiving IVIG therapy experience ADRs post-infusion. Subjects who are currently receiving
      IVIG for immunodeficiency or neurologic conditions and experience ADRs will be enrolled.

      In part 1, subjects will continue to receive IVIG for two infusions. Complement proteins will
      be measured pre- and post-infusion. Quality of life and other questionnaires will be
      administered.

      In part 2, subjects will receive C1-INH-R infusion prior to receiving IVIG infusion for three
      infusions. Complement proteins will be measured pre- and post- infusion. Quality of life and
      other questionnaires will be administered.
