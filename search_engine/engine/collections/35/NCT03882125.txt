      health, and financial consequences to afflicted individuals, their families, and society at
      large. Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) is one evidence-based approach to treating
      individuals with opiate addiction, yet supplemental psychosocial treatment to support this
      approach is lacking. Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) has shown to be efficacious
      in various substance use populations, but has yet to be assessed with MMT clients. The
      current study was designed to inform protocol adaptation for to MMT clients, and to evaluate
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a MBRP for this population. The
      sample consisted of adults (N=15) recruited from a methadone clinic to participate in a
      6-week MBRP course. Indices of feasibility, including recruitment, retention, data from focus
      groups and course satisfaction surveys, supported feasibility of the intervention. Outcome
      measures were self-report, and included self-compassion, depression, craving, PTSD symptoms,
      and experiential avoidance, and were assessed at baseline, postcourse, and 1-month follow-up.
      Data were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Mean scores on all primary
      outcomes changed in the expected direction at both postcourse and 1-month follow-up
      assessment, although only depression and experiential avoidance reached significance. Results
      from this initial pilot support feasibility and acceptability, and provide preliminary data
      on outcomes for future trials of mindfulness-based approaches within the MMT community.
