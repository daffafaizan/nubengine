      from baseline.

      Aim 1: To compare pain and function in patients undergoing operative versus non-operative
      treatment of atraumatic rotator cuff tears at 12 months of follow-up

      Aim 2: To assess effects of rotator cuff tear size and age on comparative outcomes of
      operative versus non-operative treatments for atraumatic rotator cuff tears
