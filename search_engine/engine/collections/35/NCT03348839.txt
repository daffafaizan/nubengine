    
      NeLLY study is a multicentre trial, with stepped wedge randomized controled clusters. 2
      strategies will be compared: usual patients follow-up and NeLLY service. The primary endpoint
      of the study is incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. This 3 years study will include 600
      French patients.

      NeLLY service, offering telemonitoring, educational therapy and support to patients with
      severe chronic kidney disease, is based on an app, both for patients and health
      professionals, named Ap'Telecare (@TMM).
