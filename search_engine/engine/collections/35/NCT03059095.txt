      postures, regulated breathing, and meditation. It is designed to bring balance and health to
      the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of the individual.

      A recent systematic review of 17 studies published between the years 2011-2013 reported that
      most studies of yoga demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes
      related to stress. In addition, the practice of yoga also seems to be associated with
      moderate improvements in cognitive function , which in turn, may be expected to positively
      impact overall psychological well-being. These selected results provide a strong rationale to
      examine the effects of yoga for a range of health conditions, in addition to across various
      setting and by use of different delivery methods.

      Much of the research on mindfulness has been in the area of anxiety and depression. Evidence
      suggests that mindfulness-based stress reduction, an intervention that teaches individuals to
      attend to the present moment in a nonjudgmental, accepting manner , can result in reduced
      symptoms of depression and anxiety .
