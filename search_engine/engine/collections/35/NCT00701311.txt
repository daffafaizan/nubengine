      most common diagnosis in older men. In Chronic Prostatitis (CP) or Chronic Pelvic Pain
      Syndrome (CPPS), men have lower urinary tract symptoms, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction and
      decreased quality of life.

      Little is known about the cause of CP/CPPS. Likewise, no definitive therapy exists for
      CP/CPPS. Unlike bacterial prostatitis, where a clear infecting organism can be determined,
      CP/CPPS is not always treated with antibiotics.

      Due to the significant inflammatory nature of CP/CPPS, most prior therapies have focused on
      targeting the inflammation. CC-10004 in several studies has shown to be an inhibitor of
      inflammatory mediators, and may decrease the pain experienced from CP/CPPS.
