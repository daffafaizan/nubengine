      the potential to achieve a 20% reduction in death rates. Newly developed bronchoscopic
      technologies (such as navigational bronchoscopy in a hybrid operation room) have been shown
      to enable physicians to safely reach lesions in peripheral regions of the lung and obtain a
      diagnosis. This new technology may now potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic
      interventions, such as photodynamic therapy, to tumors that were previously unreachable due
      to their peripheral anatomic location.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a photosensitizing drug (a drug that is
      activated by light), called porfimer sodium (PhotofrinÂ®), and a light from a laser that emits
      no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and destroy
      abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation
      of the drug is done by lighting the abnormal area using a fiber-optic device (very fine fiber
      [like a fishing line] that permits light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube called a
      bronchoscope. The light activates the porfimer sodium, which is concentrated in the abnormal
      tissue, leading to its destruction. But the penetrating depth of light is about 1.5 to 2 cm
      limits the treatment range of tumor size.

      We proposed a novel light delivery method of instilling a high-refractive-index (RI) liquid
      (Lipiodol) to enhance light delivery in the lung.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if physicians can reach the tumors in the periphery
      of the lung via electro-navigational bronchoscopy in a hybrid operation room and inject the
      lipiodol to cover the whole tumor then deliver photodynamic therapy by placing the optical
      fiber into the tumor
