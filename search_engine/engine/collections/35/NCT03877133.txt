      to poor prognosis and longer hospital stay. There is no sensitive or specific marker for
      predicting postoperative acute kidney injury, although studies of the biomarkers have shown
      promising results.

      Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive and real-time monitoring device for regional
      oxygen saturation measurement. Previous studies revealed that it could be applied to the skin
      near the kidney and be used to monitor renal regional oxygen saturation.

      Therefore, in this study, the investigators will apply near-infrared spectroscopy around
      kidney area to measure real-time renal regional oxygen saturation during liver
      transplantation surgery and investigate the association between the intraoperative renal
      regional oxygen saturation and the development of post-transplant acute kidney injury.
