      are unsuccessful. Treatment studies have demonstrated that current smoking cessation
      techniques are less effective for women. There is no clear explanation for this difference,
      but it may involve a differential response to nicotine replacement treatments (NRTs) and/or
      smoking-related stimuli. For women, NRT may be less effective at suppressing withdrawal or
      blunting the effects of smoking during a quit attempt. Women may also be more sensitive to
      smoking-related stimuli, suc has the taste, sight, or smell of cigarette smoke. Tailoring
      treatments to the separate needs of smoker subgroups , such as men and women, my produce
      better cessation outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess whether men and women
      differ in the their response to NRT (i.e., transdermal nicotine) and smoking-related stimuli.

      Participants in this double-blind, dose-comparison study will complete separate sessions in
      random order.

      Each session will last approximately 6.5 hours and will correspond to a transdermal patch
      dose (0 or 21mg) and cigarette type (denicotinized and nicotinized). Objectively verified
      cigarette abstinence will be required before each session. Sessions will occur at least 48
      hours apart to avoid carryover. At the beginning of each session a patch will be placed on
      the participant's back and at 4, 5, and 6 hours after patch application the participant will
      smoke a cigarette (all identifying marking on the cigarette will be covered for blinding
      purposes). Physiological, subjective, cognitive, and smoking behavior outcomes will be
      collected during study visits.
