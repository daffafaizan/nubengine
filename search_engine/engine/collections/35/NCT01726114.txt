      MediSensors non-invasive Optical Glucose Monitorâ„¢ on individuals with diabetes mellitus.
      Capillary blood samples will be obtained throughout a daily study session; the study session
      may last for up to 12 hours. Blood glucose will be measured on a YSI blood glucose analyzer.
      Subjects may adjust food intake and insulin administration so device performance is evaluated
      across a broad range of glucose concentrations. Glucose measurements will be time matched and
      paired for comparison. Skin effects and adverse events will be evaluated.
