      aspects of a woman's life. Pelvic floor physical therapy has been shown to improve stress
      incontinence through multiple mechanisms, including rhabdosphincter hypertrophy. Yoga and
      Pilates have also been shown to improve stress incontinence but there is a key gap in
      understanding how yoga-Pilates impacts urethral function and if these exercises represent a
      viable option for treating SUI.

      To fill this gap a new exercise is proposed: a web-based 8-week yoga-Pilates pelvic floor
      workout. The investigators plan to enroll women with SUI and compare urethral rhabdosphincter
      cross-sectional area in a pre-post intervention study. The investigators will also administer
      validated quality of life and severity measures for SUI to evaluate the potential efficacy of
      yoga-Pilates. The overarching goal of this project is to determine how yoga-Pilates impact
      urethral function and if these exercises decrease SUI symptoms.
