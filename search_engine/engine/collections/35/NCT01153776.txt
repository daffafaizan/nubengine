      to invasive coronary angiography for detecting coronary lesions in children who had undergone
      arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries.

      Background Assessment of the integrity of reimplanted coronary arteries is crucial for
      long-term outcome after arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries.
      Non-invasive tests have limited accuracy for detecting coronary lesions, and invasive
      coronary angiography is usually required in this setting.

      Materials and methods Patients (age 4 to 30 years old) who undergone arterial switch
      operation in neonate period are potentially eligible. They will be prospectively included in
      the study. They will have both examinations, their routine invasive coronary angiography and
      ECG-gated 64-slice CT angiography. The ability of CT to detect lesions of the ostia and
      proximal segments of the reimplanted coronary arteries was analyzed by blinded comparison to
      invasive coronary angiogram.

      Expected results and clinical implications We expect to demonstrate that ECG-gated 64-slice
      CT angiography is safe and accurate for the detection of coronary lesions with a high
      sensitivity (expected sensitivity>95%) as compared to invasive angiography. In that
      condition, ECG-gated 64-slice CT angiography could replace the invasive coronary angiography
      for the follow-up of patients with reimplanted coronary arteries after arterial switch
      operation for transposition of the great arteries.
