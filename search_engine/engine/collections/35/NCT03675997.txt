    
      Autograft is one of hematological malignancies treatment, such as lymphoma and myeloma. This
      technique requires several weeks of hospitalization in a protected environment and can be a
      source of anxiety of different natures for patients. According to the medical and scientific
      report of the Biomedicine Agency in 2016, 3 043 patients were involved in an autologous
      transplant, which represents a significant number of patients potentially exposed to these
      types of anxiety.

      That is why it will be interesting in this study to report weekly the level of anxiety
      throughout their hospitalization for the autologous transplant, to detect the most stressful
      period.

      A validated questionnaire will be used: the HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression) scale of
      anxiety and depression.
