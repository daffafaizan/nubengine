      applied during thyroid neural monitoring surgery. In as subsequent clinical application
      study, 60 patients who underwent thyroidectomy with IONM followed an enhanced NMB recovery
      protocol- rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg at anesthesia induction and sugammadex 2 mg/kg at operation
      start. Train-of-four (TOF) ratio was used for continuous quantitative monitoring of
      neuromuscular transmission.
