      antibodies in participants initiating ART early after HIV acquisition, during primary HIV
      infection (PHI). The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dual long-acting
      versions of bNABs (3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS) in a randomised clinical trial powered to
      answer the question whether these bNAbs are effective at controlling HIV replication in the
      absence of ART.

      The study aims to enrol 72 individuals across multiple UK collaborating clinical centres.
      Participants will have been previously diagnosed with primary HIV-1 infection, will have
      started ART during early phase of Primary HIV infection, and who have remained on suppressive
      ART without interruption for at least 12 months. Study duration will vary by participant,
      depending on the time to viral rebound.

      The results from this trial will demonstrate whether or not the combination of two
      long-acting (LS) broadly neutralising antibodies, 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS, will prevent HIV
      viral rebound after stopping antiretroviral therapy for an extended period of time in adults
      living with HIV who initiated ART during early HIV infection.
