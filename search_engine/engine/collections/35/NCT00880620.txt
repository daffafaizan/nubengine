    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-arm study of three doses
      of IPX066 versus placebo.

      Total of 427 subjects were screened and 381 were randomized and received one of the four
      treatment groups (1) placebo (N=92), (2) IPX066 145 mg LD (N=87) (3) IPX066 245 mg LD (N=104)
      (4) IPX066 390 mg LD (N=98) three times a day.

      Study duration is approximately 30 weeks for each subject including 4 weeks of titration (up
      to 3 weeks of dose escalation and I week of stabilization for safe escalation to the
      allocated dose), and 26 weeks of maintenance.

      During the titration phase:

      The following dose strengths were used to titrate up to the final three strengths that were
      assigned to the three IPX066 treatment arms.

      IPX066 95 mg LD capsule containing 95 mg LD and 23.75 mg CD. IPX066 145 mg LD capsule
      containing 145 mg LD and 36.25 mg CD. IPX066 195 mg LD capsule containing 195 mg LD and 48.75
      mg CD. IPX066 245 mg LD capsule containing 245 mg LD and 61.25 mg CD.

      During the maintenance phase:

      IPX066 145 mg LD treatment arm received 145 mg LD and 36.25 mg CD. IPX066 245 mg LD treatment
      arm received 245 mg LD and 61.25 mg CD. IPX066 390 mg LD treatment arm received 390 mg LD and
      97.50 mg CD.

      Primary efficacy outcome measure was change from baseline in the sum of UPDRS Part II and
      Part III scores at the end of study or last value reported if subject discontinued
      prematurely.
