      counties is to:

      1. Determine the effectiveness of SIPsmart and SIPsmartER at decreasing SSB consumption when
      compared to a matched contact control group targeting walking behaviors.

      The secondary aims are to:

        1. Explore causal pathways through which changes in SSB attitudes, subjective norms, and
           perceived behavioral control influence behavioral intentions and SSB consumption, and
           the extent to which changes in SSB consumption are mediated by changes in nutrition
           numeracy and nutrition-related media literacy.

        2. Determine the reach and representativeness, adoption feasibility, degree to which the
           intervention was implemented as intended (and associated costs), and the maintenance of
           behavior changes 6 and 12 months post intervention (i.e., 18 months from baseline) when
           compared to control.

        3. Assess intervention impacts on body weight.

      An exploratory aim is to:

      1. Assess intervention impacts on a 13C biomarker, a new non-invasive biomarker fingerstick
      technique for added sugar intake, and evaluate the changes in this biomarker over time.
