    
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ToleroMune HDM in HDM allergic subjects with
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The efficacy of ToleroMune Ragweed will be explored in subjects
      using an EEC.

      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a
      maximum of 16 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic,
      at the Investigator's discretion. Baseline Challenge will consist of 3 visits to the EEC.
      Eligible subjects will complete a daily diary card at home for two weeks following the final
      visit to the EEC.

      In Period 2, subjects in each cohort complying with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomised to one of four groups and will receive treatment over 11 visits in 3 dosing
      periods for each subject. Within each dosing period visits will take place at intervals of 4
      weeks (28Â±2 days). There will also be two EEC visits during the treatment period and one post
      treatment EEC visit. Following the final visit to the EEC, subjects will complete a daily
      diary card at home for two weeks.

      In Period 3, Follow-up will be conducted 16-21 days after the final EEC visit.
