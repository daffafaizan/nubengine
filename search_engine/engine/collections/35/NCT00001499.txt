      with a bolus of cisplatin followed by chest radiotherapy for previously untreated patients
      with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The non-small cell lung cancer tissue
      obtained prior to the start of treatment will be studied for mutations of the p53 gene. The
      goal of this phase II study is to determine the response rate to 4 cycles of infusional
      paclitaxel and bolus cisplatin for patients with stage III NSCLC. The response will again be
      assessed following completion of 6000 cGy of chest radiotherapy and the patients will then be
      followed for survival. The relationship between the presence or absence of a p53 mutation and
      the sensitivity of the patient's tumors to paclitaxel plus cisplatin and chest radiation will
      be studied. In addition, the plasma levels of paclitaxel will be measured, and the in vitro
      paclitaxel chemosensitivity of the tumor cells will be determined from as many patients as
      possible. This will allow further study of the relationship between p53 status, in vitro drug
      sensitivity, achievable plasma concentrations of paclitaxel, and patients' response to
      therapy.
