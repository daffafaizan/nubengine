      Patients entered in clinical trials, especially the elderly, are not completely
      representative of the "real" population because of selection process. The lack of data
      collected from a real population turns the indication of treatment a challenging task and
      expose older patients to a risk of under treatment (fear of excessive toxicity because of the
      lack of data).

      With the aim of covering this gap, we are planning to run a phase II trial evaluating the
      feasibility of delivering the combination of ribociclib plus NSAI as first-line treatment
      specifically in a population of breast cancer patients aged ≥70 years.

      Primary endpoint:

      • The treatment feasibility will be evaluated as the proportion of patients not having
      experienced disease progression (PD), still on treatment with ribociclib plus NSAI 6 months
      after the first drug administration

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Treatment adherence

        -  Safety and tolerability

        -  Patient reported outcomes (PROs)

        -  Overall response rate (ORR)

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)
