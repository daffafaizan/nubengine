      shown to be an effective treatment for amblyopia. However, the games can be challenging for
      some of the youngest children and boring for some of the older children with amblyopia. To
      provide additional treatment options using the same contrast-rebalancing approach, we have
      processed animated videos to allow dichoptic viewing, with full contrast for the amblyopic
      eye and reduced contrast for the fellow eye. Children will be randomly assigned to watch
      dichoptic videos (experimental treatment) or patch 2 hours/day every day(standard-of-care
      amblyopia treatment) for 2 weeks. At the 2-week primary outcome visit, children in the
      patching group will cross over to the videos and return for a secondary outcome visit at 4
      weeks. Families will have the option to continue with the vdeos for up to 8 weeks.
