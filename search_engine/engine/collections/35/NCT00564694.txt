        -  To test the reliability and clinical and psychometric validity of the European
           Organization of Research for the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life
           questionnaire (QLQ-CR29) in an international sample of patients with colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified into predetermined clinically
      distinct groups (colon cancer after surgery vs colon cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy
      vs rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant radiotherapy vs rectal cancer after anterior
      resection with temporary stoma vs rectal cancer after abdominoperineal excision of rectum vs
      colorectal cancer undergoing palliative chemotherapy).

      Quality-of-life data is collected alongside standard outcomes in patients undergoing
      treatment for colorectal cancer. Patients complete the European Organization of Research for
      the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30), the revised
      colorectal cancer module (QLQ-CR29), case report forms for clinical and sociodemographic
      data, and a debriefing questionnaire at different time points before, during, and after
      treatment. Some patients complete more sets of the same questionnaire at later time points to
      assess sensitivity to change over time and test-retest reliability. Reliability, and clinical
      and psychometric validity of the questionnaires are assessed by correlation analyses,
      exploration of known group comparisons, and responsiveness to clinical changes.
