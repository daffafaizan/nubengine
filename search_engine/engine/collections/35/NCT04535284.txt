      readmission for the person with stroke. Caregivers are routinely engaged during hospital
      discharge for education and training. However, the critical period after discharge is largely
      unsupported. The proposed research will integrate occupational therapy and telehealth to
      provide a post-discharge, caregiver-focused program, the "Health Coaching-in-Context" that
      consists of up to 10 sessions, arranged once-a-week or multiple times a week based on
      convenience of scheduling for up to 10 weeks. The program targets improved caregiver health
      and reduction in readmissions for stroke survivor. The study aims to examine the effects of
      the coaching program for caregivers as compared to usual care and evaluate the feasibility of
      study design. A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted with two parallel groups,
      "Health Coaching-in-Context" and usual care. A sample of up to 40 pairs, including up to 40
      stroke survivors and their respective 40 caregivers will be recruited from University
      hospitals and randomly assigned after consenting. The occupational therapist, unaware of the
      group assignment, will administer assessments before and after the intervention, and at
      4-week follow-up. Data will be collected on general information, readmissions, performance,
      self-efficacy, and quality of life.
