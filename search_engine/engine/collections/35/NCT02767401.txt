      intervention (PCI). However, there is currently no consensus on an optimal treatment modality
      for single lesions resulting in coronary total occlusion (CTO). Since the other coronary
      arteries are often lesion-free, or with stenosis of less than 50%, patients often present
      with no symptoms. Although the expert consensus on CTO lesion suggests reducing the incidence
      of long-term adverse events via successful revascularization, there are few retrospective
      studies on single CTO lesions. To date, it is unclear whether successful PCI based on optimal
      medication treatment (OMT) can increase myocardial viability and the extent of myocardial
      viability related to prognosis of those CTO patients. Therefore, the aim of this
      multi-center, prospective, open labeled, non-randomized controlled study was to determine if
      the improvement to myocardial viability in single CTO patients with successful PCI plus OMT
      was superior to that of patients with only OMT.
