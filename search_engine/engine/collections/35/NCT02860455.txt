      laboratory blood gas analysis, at the time of prehospital management by emergency medical
      services. The diagnostic performance of SpCO for the screening of CO poisoning will be
      determined using ROC curve analysis, and Blood COHb levels >5% and 10% as the reference
      standard for CO poisonning for non-smokers and smokers respectively. Correlation between SpCO
      and COHb will be assessed using Bland and Altman's method.
