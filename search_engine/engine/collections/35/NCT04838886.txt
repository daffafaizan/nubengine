      two groups as intervention and control. The intervention group will be received
      telerehabilitation-based pilates training three times a week for six weeks.
      Telerehabilitation-based pilates will be provided via videoconferencing.

      The first session will be the introduction session, patients will be informed about basic
      principles of Pilates and it will be included teaching inward movement of the lower abdominal
      wall and supine exercises of segmental movements involving trunk muscle recruitment to
      maintain a neutral posture. Afterward the session, a typical session will be included supine,
      side-lying, quadruped exercise, sitting on the exercise ball, and standing exercises.

      stabilization exercises for the deep abdominal muscles. The difficulty of these exercises
      will be gradually increased and focused on keeping neutral positions of the spine in
      different gravity orientations. The control group will be a wait-list group without any
      additional specific treatment. All assessments will be done before and after the 6-week
      intervention program or waiting period. The demographic characteristics of the participants
      initially will be taken and the Expanded Disability Status Scale score of those of MS will be
      recorded. Primary outcomes are balance, gait, core endurance and power, and muscle strength;
