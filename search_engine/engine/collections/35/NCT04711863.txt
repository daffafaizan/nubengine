      laboratory-confirmed, mild to moderate COVID-19 and are admitted to community treatment
      centers. All interactions for this study will be conducted remotely by videoconferencing,
      mobile application, or phone.

      Screening Phase: All patients admitted to community treatment centers receive self-monitoring
      equipment, including an oxygen saturation monitor, blood pressure monitor, and thermometer.
      All participants will first complete a pre-screen to see if they may be eligible for the
      study. Once a participant is confirmed eligible and consented, the study team will deliver
      study drugs to each participant room.

      RCT Phase: Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to take either fluvoxamine or placebo
      (ursodeoxycholate). This phase of the study will last until discharge from community
      treatment centers (usually 10 days) and is single-blinded as the participants will not know
      which treatment they receive. Participants will take up to 100 mg of fluvoxamine or placebo
      by mouth twice a day for a daily total of 200 mg. Participants will continue this dose until
      discharge from community treatment centers (for approximately 10 days). The dose may be
      adjusted depending on tolerability. Participants will complete short 10 minute assessments
      twice a day to report the results of self-monitoring (oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and
      temperature), COVID-19 symptoms, and any adverse events using mobile application or phone.

      Follow-up Phase: The study team will follow participants for approximately 30 days after the
      end of the randomized phase (after discharge from community treatment centers) using phone.
