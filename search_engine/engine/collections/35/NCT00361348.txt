      part of a post-marketing regulatory commitment with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
      the purpose of this study is to characterize the potential pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction between a continuous IV infusion of heparin and an IV
      bolus injection of palifermin. If an interaction is observed during co-administration, it is
      expected that the outcome would be modulation of clearance of palifermin or a change in
      heparin activity. Although not commonly conducted, the literature describes heparin drug-drug
      interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects using both subcutaneous (Grimaudo et
      al,1988; Kroon et al, 1992) and intravenous (Caplain at al, 1999; Noveck & Hubbard, 2004;
      Spowart et al, 1988) formulations. Based on these experiences, it is appropriate to
      investigate heparin drug-drug interactions in healthy subjects.

      In this study, subjects will receive a single 60 mcg/kg dose of palifermin either as
      monotherapy or in conjunction with a continuous heparin infusion. The 60 mcg/kg dose of
      palifermin explored in this study is identical to the current recommended daily dosage for
      patients with hematologic malignancies who were undergoing autologous PBPC transplantation
      after receiving total body irradiation and high-dose chemotherapy: 3 consecutive days
      administered in two cycles with a 5-day non-dosing interval.
