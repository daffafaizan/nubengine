      pregnancy. GDM is not only associated with short-term maternal and fetal adverse outcomes,
      but also related to a wide range of long-term consequences for both mother and child.
      Although maternal hyperglycemia often become normal shortly after pregnancy, women with GDM
      have crucially increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes later in life and the
      mechanisms are not fully understand. Systematic follow-up of the outcomes related to GDM
      would be ideal to observe the nature progression of GDM to diabetes and could help to develop
      preventable targets for intervention. The risks of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type
      2 diabetes in offspring of mothers with GDM significantly increased 1-7 folds than those
      whose mothers didn't have GDM. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms behind the impaired
      metabolic risk profile and other diseases in offspring are unknown, but environmental changes
      including epigenetic changes induced by exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia and genetic
      factors may play essential roles. The GDM and Its Consequences for mothers and offsprings
      (GDMCMO) aims to establish a cohort to follow both maternal and offsprings'short-term and
      long-term outcomes, including fetal malformations including congenital heart diseases, birth
      weight, preterm birth, caesarean section delivery, body growth and neurodevelopment after
      birth, obesity, type 2 diabetes and impaired insulin sensitivity and secretion, lung health
      and allergic diseases later in life for offspring, as well as future type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular risk factors for mother after delivery. Biological samples including blood and
      tissue samples of mothers and children are also collected during pregnancy and after
      delivery. We also aim to identify the high-risk population of mother-child pairs who are more
      likely to develop these adverse consequences, which might help to improve precise
      intervention and resource saving and provide evidence for preventable targets development.
