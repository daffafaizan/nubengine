    
      This study will employ a 3+3 phase I design with dose escalation of GR-MD-02 in conjunction
      with the standard therapeutic dose of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma who
      have had progression after ipilimumab and/or BRAF targeted therapy when a BRAF mutation is
      present, non-small cell lung cancer patients with disease progression after targeted therapy,
      or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with disease progression after at least one
      platinum-containing regimen.

      In addition to monitoring for toxicity and clinical response, blood and tumor samples will be
      obtained to assess immunologic measures relevant to galectin biology and pembrolizumab T-cell
      checkpoint inhibition.
