      bovine xenograft and porcine xenograft materials.

      This entire protocol involves procedures that are standard care. The study is a 2-arm,
      parallel-design, randomized, prospective clinical trial. The test group subjects will have
      extraction sockets grafted with porcine xenograft (Zcore). This test group will be compared
      to an active control group using bovine xenograft (Bio-Oss). The null hypothesis is that
      there will be no significant difference in formation of new vital bone between treatment
      groups (primary outcome).

      In keeping with the protocol our study group has used several times before, the plan will be
      to extract non-molar teeth and graft with the test/control materials. Each subject will
      provide a single non-molar tooth site for study treatment. The graft material will be covered
      with a non-resorbable dense polytetrafluoroethylene (d-PTFE) membrane (TXT-200 singles,
      Osteogenics Inc). This d-PTFE membrane will be removed 4 weeks after placement during the
      4-week post-op visit. Following 18-20 weeks of healing, the dental implant will be placed. To
      place a dental implant, an osteotomy (hole in the bone) is prepared into which the implant is
      placed. This osteotomy can be prepared with either a solid drill, in which case the bone that
      is removed is suctioned into the suction system, or with a hollow trephine drill into which a
      core of bone can be collected. The only "research procedure" being done in the current study
      is the collection of this bone core biopsy for histologic evaluation. The core biopsy will
      then be evaluated for the primary histologic outcome of % vital bone formation and secondary
      histologic outcome of % residual graft material.
