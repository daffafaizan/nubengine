      their content of saturated fatty acids. The investigators aimed to add flaxseed with high
      content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to low fat yogurt to obtain beneficial without
      adverse effects of it. In this parallel randomized controlled trial the investigators
      recruited 70 diabetic patients and randomly allocated to control and treatment groups.
      Participants in treatment group consumed 30 gr flaxseed in 200 gr low fat yogurt, while
      controls consumed 200 gr just low fat yogurt daily. Lipid profile, fasting blood sugar,
      glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, waist circumference
      and body mass index were measured at the first and end of the trial.
