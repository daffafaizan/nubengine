      diagnostic method to correlate clinical symptoms with cardiac arrhythmias. The Holter monitor
      records electrical signals from the heart using electrodes attached to the chest, which are
      connected via cables to a digital recorder. In addition to the device to record the cardiac
      electrical signals, the Holter system also has a software for review and analysis of the
      record. The software of the Holter system has an integrated automatic analysis process to
      detect different sorts of heart beats, rhythms, etc, which are then validated by a technician
      and a physician. The success of the automatic analysis depends of the quality of the captured
      electrical signals, which are dependent on the appropriate attachment of the
      electrodes/cables to the patient body. Therefore, inappropriately attached electrodes/cables
      can result in electromagnetic disturbance that can interfere with the ECG signal, resulting
      in a very noisy record that is hard to be analysed.

      Newer Holter systems that eliminate the cables and attach the recorder directly to the
      electrodes positioned in the patientÂ´s chest might reduce the electromagnetic disturbance in
      the ECG signal capture and, therefore, improve the quality of the exam.

      This study will compare the findings of a Holter exam using a newer system, the QuoreOne
      system from QuoreTech, with a more traditional system, the Cardiolight system from Cardios.
