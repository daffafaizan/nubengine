      enemas and/or oral diet before surgery) is the standard practice in colorectal surgery. The
      importance of MBP in preventing anastomotic leakage and infectious morbidity after elective
      colorectal surgery has been a dogma among surgeons for many years. The main reason is the
      belief that postoperative complications is related to septic bowel content. However, there is
      a paucity of scientific evidence demonstrating the efficacy of this practice in reducing
      morbidity. Moreover, potential disadvantages of MBP include the requirement for a longer
      preoperative duration of admission before surgery, its time consuming nature, being expensive
      and unpleasant for the patient and expose the early population to the particular risk of
      fluid and electrolyte imbalance .At least eight randomized clinical trials and two
      meta-analyses failed to show any superiority of MBP in colorectal surgery. On the contrary,
      they demonstrated that preparation might lead to an increased rate of septic complications.
      Such initial dates lead surgeons to re-evaluate their current clinical practice in colonic
      surgery. But to dates, these findings cannot finally be applied to rectal surgery because of
      insufficient dates. To date, no study about MBP was specifically devoted to rectal surgery.
      Moreover, it is currently admitted that the risk of septic complications following rectal
      resection, as a result of the well-known risk factors, is higher than after colonic
      preparation. It is the reason why most of the colorectal surgeons consider that a no
      preparation regimen in rectal cancer surgery could represent an additive risk factor for
      postoperative morbidity.
