      member of the Patient Reported Outcomes Information System (PROMIS) Network. PROMIS is funded
      by the NIH Roadmap initiative, working to improve the efficiency and accuracy of measuring
      patient-reported outcomes. UWCORR works collaboratively with five research sites (Stanford
      University, Duke University, State University of New York, University of Pittsburgh, and
      University of North Carolina) and a Statistical Coordinating Center (NorthShore University
      HealthSystem).

      Collectively, the goal of the PROMIS Network is to create a publicly available system that
      can be periodically added to and modified and that allows clinical researchers to access a
      common repository of items and computerized adaptive tests. The first step in achieving this
      goal was to build item pools and develop core questionnaires that measure key health outcome
      domains that are manifested in a variety of disabilities and chronic conditions. The
      resulting six item banks cover the domains of pain, fatigue, social health, physical
      functioning, emotional functioning, and sleep-wake functioning.

      The next step in this process is to validate the PROMIS item banks and to examine their
      utility as computerized adaptive tests (CATs) with individuals diagnosed with a variety of
      chronic conditions and disabilities. At UWCORR, we will recruit patients with back and leg
      pain who were treated with epidural steroid injections. This protocol is aimed at comparing
      the psychometric properties of the PROMIS item banks with non-PROMIS 'gold standard'
      instruments, diagnostic data, and medical records. We will compare de-identified data from
      this study with de-identified data from other PROMIS research centers.
