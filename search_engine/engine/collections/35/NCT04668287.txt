      implicit) before and after an online intervention. All selected participants will enjoy one
      of the online working groups led by a psychologist for five weeks. In these group sessions,
      students will be trained to identify how their low self-esteem was developed, what are those
      factors that maintain their low self-esteem and what can they do for improving their low
      self-esteem, using Fennell model.
