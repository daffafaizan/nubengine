      basal hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and impaired insulin release. Glycemic control is
      a fundamental part of the management of type 2 DM and difficult to achieve. Different
      antidiabetic agents can handle diabetic metabolic abnormalities. The development of
      antidiabetic agentswith novel mechanisms of action is highly desirable. Cabergoline, a long
      acting D2 agonist, is expected to play a role in the glycemic control.
