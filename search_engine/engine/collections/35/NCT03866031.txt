      day of implants placement. A direct restorative protocol will be applied to modify the
      existing prosthesis to implant-supported overdentures.

      The evaluations of the primary outcomes will be conducted before implantation and after (1 -
      3 - 6 - 12 - 18), except Peri-implant crestal alveolar bone loss will be conducted only after
      (0 - 3 - 6 - 12 - 18).
