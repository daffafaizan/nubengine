      anesthesiologist administering sedatives and analgesics to a patient while monitoring his/her
      vital signs. MAC is often used to supplement local and regional anesthesia for non-intubated
      patients undergoing non-invasive procedures and minor surgery. The goal of MAC is to relieve
      anxiety by inducing a minimally depressed level of consciousness while the patient is able to
      continuously and independently maintain a patent airway and to respond appropriately to
      verbal commands.

      Respiratory depression is the major concern with most of the medications (midazolam,
      fentanyl, propofol) currently used for MAC. There is clearly an unmet need for a sedative
      agent that can safely be used during MAC in both healthy and high risk populations with
      limited adverse side effects. A medication that can attenuate anxiety and the stress response
      associated with surgery and procedures without causing respiratory depression is highly
      desirable. A medication that reduces the total amount of opioids administered during a
      procedure could substantially reduce complications. Such a medication could be used either
      alone or in combination with other agents, thereby reducing the dose and side effects of the
      other agents.

      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has sympatholytic, sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects that
      attenuate the catecholamine response to perioperative stress. DEX has not been associated
      with respiratory depression when used alone, despite sometimes deep levels of sedation.

      An estimated 325 patients (260 DEX, 65 PBO) requiring MAC sedation for an elective
      surgery/procedure will be randomized at approximately 25 investigative sites.
