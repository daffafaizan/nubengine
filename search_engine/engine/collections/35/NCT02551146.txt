      and tissue supported (full) dentures were treated with 2 dental implants and locators in
      order to improve prosthesis stability.

      The LOCATOR System is comprised of three parts: The LOCATOR implant attachment (LOCATOR
      abutment), the LOCATOR Male and the LOCATOR Denture Cap. The abutment is inserted directly
      into the implant using a torque wrench, while the Denture Cap is placed into the base of the
      overdenture for polymerization using acrylic resin. Custom retention is achieved via LOCATOR
      Males - small color-coded (according to retention force) plastic inserts - which can be
      exchanged as needed.
