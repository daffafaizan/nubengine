    
      Study design: A randomised, double-blind, dose non-inferiority study.

      Study Intervention: Enteric-coated aspirin 100mg, 300mg or 600mg blinded dose daily followed
      by daily 100mg open label dose daily.

      Primary objective: To determine whether the cancer preventive properties of enteric coated
      aspirin in Lynch syndrome are dose sensitive by comparing overall cumulative Lynch syndrome
      cancer incidence rates after 5 years in people who took 100mg, 300mg or 600mg enteric coated
      aspirin for at least 2 years.

      Secondary objectives: Compare overall cumulative incidence of primary colorectal cancers
      using Poisson regression to allow for multiple primaries in individual patients in the three
      treatment groups.

      Compare overall cumulative incidence of primary endometrial cancers using Poisson regression
      to allow for multiple primaries in individual patients in the three treatment groups.

      Compare overall cumulative incidence of cancers of all types, using Poisson regression to
      allow for multiple primaries in individual patients in the three treatment groups.

      The burden of adverse events associated with the different aspirin doses in this relatively
      young and healthy population will be documented.

      Primary outcome: The number of new primary mismatch repair deficient cancers ("Lynch syndrome
      cancers") at 5 years and beyond which develop in participants who remain on prescribed
      treatment for a minimum of 2 years.

      Number of study sites: 4 ISRAEL sites. 20 sites all over the world.

      Study population/size: 300 patients in ISRAEL. UK 1000-1500 patients. Total with
      International 3,000 patients.

      Study duration: 7 years.
