      addition to diabetes and hypertension, malnutrition and chronic inflammation are well-known
      to be major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in normal population. For detecting the
      malnutrition and chronic inflammation and understanding the exact influences to hemodialysis
      patients, we conduct this study. We will collect the biochemical parameters, inflammatory
      markers, lipid parameters, hematologic parameters, and genomic DNA of patients. Then we will
      prospectively record the hospitalization, cardiovascular events, complications of
      arteriovenous fistula/graft, and mortality. According to the above results, we try to explore
      the exact role of malnutrition and inflammation in hemodialysis patients.
