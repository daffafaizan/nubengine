      patients with knee osteoarthritis , Knee will assessed for the following items in both sides
      while Patient lying supine with the knee flexed 40 degrees:

        1. Superior pole of the patella - quadriceps tendon enthesis: ● Quadriceps tendon thickness
           >6.1 mm ● Suprapatellar bursitis ● Superior pole of patella erosion ● Superior pole of
           patella enthesophyte.

        2. Inferior pole of the patella - proximal patellar ligament enthesis: ● Patellar ligament
           thickness >4 mm ● Inferior pole of patella erosion ● Inferior pole of patella
           enthesophyte.

        3. Tibial tuberosity - distal patellar ligament enthesis ● Patellar ligament thickness >4
           mm ● Infrapatellar bursitis ● Tibial tuberosity erosion ● Tibial tuberosity
           enthesophyte.

      Knee functional status was assessed using Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
      scale for Pain, other Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Sport and Recreation
      Function (Sport/Rec) and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL). Low knee function was considered
      if the patient had score 50 or more in any KOOS scale parameter.
