    
      This prospective, multicenter cohort study. The sampling method will be a convenience sample
      of all adult patients presenting to the ED with symptoms concerning a fracture and/or
      dislocation of an extremity. Once a patient has been deemed an appropriate candidate for the
      study, written consent will be obtained from one of the Associate Investigators. Once consent
      has been obtained, a resident physician will perform the ultrasound examination on the
      affected extremity(s) and note their findings.
