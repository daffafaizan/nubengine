      Furthermore, lumbar spinal stenosis is a common disease in the old population and a
      neuroplasty is widely used to treat these patients. We postulate that the sarcopenia may be
      associated with the outcome of neuroplasty in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, and there
      is no study about this topic as far as we know.

      To evaluate this association, we will use the criteria for sarcopenia which is made by Asian
      Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2019 in this study. We will compare the outcome of
      neuroplasty in patients with sarcopenia and without sarcopenia using several tools such as
      numeric rating scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and global perceived effect
      (GPE) score up to 6 months after the procedure.
