      be affected with decreased levels of thyroid hormone (TH), even more so with an elevated TH
      level. Epidemiological data shows that 2%-57% of patients with Graves' Disease (GD) present
      with glucose dysregulation, which might also be related to the changes in islet β-cell
      functions in patients with GD. The incidence of GD has comparable variations geographically,
      with possibly different underlying mechanisms, such as an excessive intake of iodine
      resulting in an aggravation of autoimmune reactions from thyroid and consequently an
      increment in incidence of GD. The same might also be true in glucoregulation and islet β-cell
      functions in patients with GD. This study aims to examine the characteristics of
      glucoregulation and islet β-cell functions in patients with GD in different areas of China,
      using early-phase insulin secretion index (△I30/△G30), glucose area under curve(GAUC) and
      insulin area under curve(INSAUC).
