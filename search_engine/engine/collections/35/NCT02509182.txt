      lung function post-operatively. Supra-physiologic oxygen levels during surgery may contribute
      to this decrease in lung function by worsening lung injury intra-operatively.

      This study will include patients undergoing surgery to remove a lung lobe requiring one lung
      ventilation.

      The patients will be divided into two groups with the experimental group receiving a 60%
      oxygen in air mixture and the control group receiving 100% oxygen.

      The two groups will be compared by using a measure of lung function (the ratio of the partial
      pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the inspired oxygen concentration) and blood levels
      of a protein correlated with lung injury (receptor of advanced glycation end products RAGE).
