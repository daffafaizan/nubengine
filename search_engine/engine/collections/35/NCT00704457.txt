      All urine will be collected and stored until the final follow-up is complete. The urine
      samples will then be sent as a single batch to the Department of Infectious Disease,
      University of Maryland. Urines will be assayed in a blinded fashion and a written report of
      the levels of each of the 3 urine markers will be sent to Beaumont Hospital. Change in urine
      marker levels will be analyzed and correlated with change in symptom scores.
