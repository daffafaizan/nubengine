      procedures for control of underlying abdominal infection within 24 hours of evaluation by
      medical personnel) or patients with surgically confirmed necrotizing soft tissue infection
      (NSTI), requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or step down unit admission and in whom the
      diagnosis of Stage 2/3 acute kidney injury (AKI; as defined by Kidney Disease Improving
      Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria) is established at initial presentation for medical
      evaluation or up to 48 hours from the suspected diagnosis of abdominal sepsis or from
