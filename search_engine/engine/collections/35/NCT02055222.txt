      States are either current or former smokers and remain at risk for the development of chronic
      lung diseases. It is unknown how or why any one individual smoker can develop a wide range of
      lung diseases including chronic obstructive lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis. The
      purpose of this protocol is to collect clinical data, blood, urine, and bronchoalveolar
      samples from smokers and non-smokers in an attempt to establish phenotypic clinical profiles
      that correspond to divergent pathways in the expression of such proteins as the transforming
      growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). The information generated from this study will provide
      insight into the pathogenesis of smoking-related lung injury and potentially allow for the
      development of early therapeutic interventions.
