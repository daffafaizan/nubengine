      factor IX (FIX) gene. FIX is produced in the liver and is critical for fibrin clot formation.
      Hemophilia B is characterized by frequent, spontaneous internal bleeding that can lead to
      chronic arthropathy (joint damage), intracranial hemorrhage, and even death. In patients with
      moderate/severe to severe hemophilia B, the majority of bleeding episodes occur in the joints
      and, if not treated, lead to debilitating damage and a decreased quality of life.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) to
      deliver human factor IX (hFIX) gene, the healthy gene necessary to make FIX, to the liver
      where FIX is normally produced. This study will determine if AAVrh10 can produce clinically
      meaningful FIX levels in patients with moderately/severe or severe hemophilia B.

      This study was previously posted by Dimension Therapeutics, which has been acquired by
      Ultragenyx in November 2017.
