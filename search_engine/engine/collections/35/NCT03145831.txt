      administration. It is open to subjects completing a somavaratan Japanese Phase 2/3 study
      (Protocol J14VR5) in children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), as well as approximately
      20 new children currently receiving daily rhGH therapy for GHD (switch subjects). For switch
      subjects, the first dose of somavaratan will be administered approximately 48 hours after the
      last dose of the daily rhGH. All subjects will receive somavaratan 3.5mg/kg twice-monthly.
      The study will be conducted at approximately 40 medical institutions in Japan.
