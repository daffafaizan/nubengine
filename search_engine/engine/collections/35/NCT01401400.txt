      patients with a response (see definitions below) versus patients who did not achieve a
      response to (peg)interferon treatment. Replication of SNPs identified by the GWAS will be
      performed in an independent cohort of patients with similar characteristics, treated with
      (peg)interferon. A large independent cohort of peginterferon treated HBV patients has already
      been identified guaranteeing a replication cohort.
