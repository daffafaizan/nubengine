      groups. Group 1 patients will receive propofol anesthesia. Group 2 patients will receive
      sevoflurane anesthesia. Intraoperative measurements including mean-arterial pressure, heart
      rate, propofol infusion rate, remifentanil infusion rate, and end-tidal sevoflurane
      concentration will be taken at 15 minute intervals. Patients in both groups will receive
      Piritramid as necessary to control pain either intravenously or through patient controlled
      pump. VAS pain score, mean-arterial pressure, heart rate, nausea will be evaluated at 30
      minute intervals during the first four postoperative hours. Piritramid dosage and vomiting
      will be recorded through the first postoperative morning. Patients will rate pain based on
      the VAS score for the period between leaving the recovery room and the first postoperative
      morning
