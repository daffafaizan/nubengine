      contribute to the antimicrobial defense system of the skin barrier, playing a role in innate
      immune responses against potential pathogens. The peptide and metabolite composition of sweat
      has not been fully explored. Evidence suggests that the composition of the skin barrier could
      vary with diseases. The causes and consequences of the changes of sweat proteins and peptides
      in humans are unknown. This clinical trial will focus on multiomics analysis of sweat, mainly
      of the antimicrobial peptides that play a key role in the host-pathogen interaction.
      Antioxidants, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory compounds may contribute to the regulation
      of systemic inflammation and pathophysiological disorders. In cystic fibrosis, inflammatory
      responses are altered, exaggerated and persistent, even in the absence of infection. It is
      therefore relevant to study the influence of CFTR mutations on the profile of antimicrobial
      peptides expressed in sweat. The clinical study will potentially lead to the discovery of
      novel non-invasive biomarkers of the disease in sweat.
