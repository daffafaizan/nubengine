      of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and decreased survival in patients undergoing
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recently, quality improvement efforts to
      correct serum vitamin D levels among inpatients at CCHMC who have already received HSCT and
      who were vitamin D deficient suggest that current recommended doses of vitamin D are
      inadequate to treat vitamin D deficiency. Possible hindrances to vitamin D treatment in the
      HSCT population include malabsorption related to gut GVHD, mucositis, increased requirement
      for calcium and/or vitamin D, kidney disease, liver disease, and infection. Single, high dose
      vitamin D treatment (stoss-therapy) has been utilized effectively to treat rickets and other
      chronic illnesses such as cystic fibrosis in children. The investigators hypothesize that
      stoss-therapy provided orally prior to transplantation will result in rapid and sustained
      correction of vitamin D deficiency in children who require HSCT. The investigators propose to
      test the efficacy and safety of high dose vitamin D therapy among HSCT patients in a tiered,
      step-wise manner (step one/two) in order to define treatment doses capable of providing
      vitamin D sufficiency.
