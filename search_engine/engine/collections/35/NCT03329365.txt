    
      Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired clonal hematological disorder
      leading to red blood cells hemolysis and thrombosis. PNH has been reported to be the cause of
      cerebral venous thrombosis and embolic ischemic strokes and is sometimes diagnosed after the
      ischemic event. In young patients with embolic ischemic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS),
      thrombophilia is usually investigated. However, access to PNH testing is limited. PNH is
      rarely investigated in stroke patients and its contribution to the pathophysiology of ESUS is
      unknown. The investigators hypothesize that this condition is underdiagnosed, resulting in
      potential preventive opportunities being lost, since PNH can be successfully treated.

      This observational study aims to determine the frequency of PNH among young (â‰¤50 years old)
      patients with recent ESUS or embolic transient ischemic attacks (TIA) of undetermined source
      (ETUS) and patients with SSS-CVT of undetermined source (SSS-CVTUS).

      Patients with ESUS or ETUS will be first screened for: (a) evidence of hemolysis based on
      their plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, (b) unexplained anemia based on their
      hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and (c) unexplained cytopenia (e.g., neutropenia and
      thrombocytopenia). Flow cytometry analysis for PNH will be performed with blood samples
      collected from subjects with abnormal level of plasma LDH (1.5X ULN) or unexplained anemia or
      cytopenia.

      Patients with SSS-CVTUS will undergo flow cytometry without prior screening.

      In addition, plasma and DNA samples will be collected in an optional sub-study for future
      analysis of DNA mutations related to specific PNH phenotypes in patients with stroke.
