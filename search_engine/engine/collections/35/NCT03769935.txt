      malignancy, short doubling time, early and widespread metastasis, is sensitive to
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and has a high initial response rate, but is prone to
      secondary drug resistance and relapse. The treatment is mainly based on systemic
      chemotherapy, and if maintenance therapy with S1 after standard EP regimen induction therapy
      could prolong progression free survival.
