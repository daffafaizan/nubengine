      fibrillation. The two primary techniques currently in use in our center for atrial
      fibrillation are Cryo Balloon and Radiofrequency ablation.

      Based on personal observation, it is felt that patients undergoing Radiofrequency ablation
      have a higher incidence of chest discomfort and subsequently a greater requirement for pain
      medications post procedure as compared to those patients undergoing Cryo ablation.
