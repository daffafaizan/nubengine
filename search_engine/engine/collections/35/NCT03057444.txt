      compared to non-diabetes patients and diabetes patients who are taking metformin. Moreover,
      studies demonstrate that resistant starch increases the butyrate-producing bacteria species.
      Furthermore, studies show that butyrate has on effect on blood glucose and insulin
      homeostasis.

      The aim in this study is to investigate, if resistant starch typ III increases
      butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut of (pre-) diabetic subjects, The effects on blood
      glucose, insulin and HbA1c are investigated as well.

      Patients included in the study are typ 2 diabetics with lifestyle interventions, insulin or
      antidiabetic medication (sulfonylureas, glinides, SGLT2-inhibitors, glitazone) or
      pre-diabetics.

      They get 2x 5g per day the food supplement SymbioIntest (resistant starch types III) over 8
      weeks.

      Study examinations are before intervention, after 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Stool samples are
      collected before intervention and each 14 days consecutively until the end of intervention.
