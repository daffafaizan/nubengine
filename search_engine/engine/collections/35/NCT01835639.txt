      patients have very low vitamin D levels, and the underlying mechanisms are not known.
      Furthermore, approaches to safely and effectively supplement vitamin D in these patients have
      not been established. The purpose of this research study is to learn if vitamin D
      supplementation is safe and effective in patients with primary glomerular disease and to also
      help establish the treatment guidelines. About 35 patients with primary glomerular disease,
      ages 5-30 years old, will take part in this study. Participants will be asked to take vitamin
      D supplements each day for 12 weeks and will have 3 study visits.
