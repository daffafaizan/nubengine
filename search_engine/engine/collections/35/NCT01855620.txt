      Body composition may affect contraceptive hormone metabolism and possibly efficacy. Phase III
      studies to date included few women weighing more than 70 kilograms (134 of 923, 14.5%); there
      were no reported pregnancies in that group. Data about pregnancy rates for women in higher
      body mass index (BMI) categories using the etonogestrel implant exists, but we know little
      about how weight affects the serum etonogestrel levels. Progestin-only methods, such as the
      etonogestrel implant, may be preferred over combined methods including estrogens because
      obesity increases thrombosis risk.

      The investigators propose a prospective study to compare serum etonogestrel levels in the
      second and third years of implant use between women across body mass index categories.

      Based on previous studies, the investigators expect a difference in etonogestrel levels based
      on body weight; however, the investigators hypothesize that etonogestrel levels will remain
      above the threshold for ovulation suppression through three years of implant use for women
      across BMI categories.

      The investigators will measure the serum levels of etonogestrel in normal weight (BMI <
      25kg/m2), overweight (BMI ≥ 25kg/m2 and < 30kg/m2), and obese women (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2) using the
      single-rod contraceptive implant for at least twelve months. Their primary objective is to
      compare the three groups and to evaluate whether etonogestrel levels fall below the critical
      level for contraceptive efficacy (90 pg/mL) (Díaz 1991) in any group.
