      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of intrathecal rituximab in patients with
           recurrent CNS lymphoma arising from CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of intrathecal rituximab.

        -  Determine the molecular pathogenesis of lymphomatous meningitis.

        -  Determine the molecular basis for response or lack of response to rituximab.

        -  Identify molecular markers specific for lymphomatous meningitis that will be useful for
           prognostic evaluation of peripheral lymphomas.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with intrathecal rituximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab intrathecally over 10 minutes on day 1 in week 1 and on days 1 and
      4 in weeks 2-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving at least a partial response with no rituximab-related neurotoxicity may continue to
      receive treatment beyond 5 weeks.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of rituximab until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which fewer than 1/3 of patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at the completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
