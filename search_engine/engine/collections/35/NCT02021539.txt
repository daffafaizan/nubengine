      A-To compare the prognostic qualities of elastography scores and fetal fibronectin
      measurements for predicting the risk of delivery in the next 48 hours.

      B-To evaluate the economic impact of introducing elastographic and fibronectin measures
      during consultatios for obstetric emergencies from the point of vue of the French social
      security system and the hospital.

      C-To evaluate the prognostic value of elastographic measurements in the subgroup twins.

      D-To study elastography variation according to patient outcomes.

      E-Evaluate the reproducibility of intra-and inter-rater elastographic measurements.
