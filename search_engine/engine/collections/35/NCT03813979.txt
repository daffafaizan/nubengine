    
      This is an open-label, parallel-group, nonrandomized, multi-centre, phase-IV, single dose
      trial. The primary aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      50mg of dolutegravir in HIV-seronegative subjects with severe hepatic impairment (n=8) and
      compare these with a single dose of 50mg of dolutegravir in matched controls (n=8). In both
      groups a pharmacokinetic (PK) curve will be recorded for determination of dolutegravir (and
      dolutegravir-glucuronide).
