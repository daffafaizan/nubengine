    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a pathology with a systemic impact with a
      progressive evolution that is characterized by the presence of chronic airflow obstruction.

      Patients with COPD may have problems with cognitive functioning, either globally or in single
      cognitive domains, such as information processing, attention and concentration, memory,
      executive functioning and self-regulation.

      Several studies have determined the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD compared to
      healthy control subjects, reaching very high levels, 36% of COPD patients with mild cognitive
      impairment compared with 12 % non- COPD subjects.
