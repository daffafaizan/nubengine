      will be measured using TcPO2 methods and also using cleared hyperspectral imaging equipment.
      The intent of the study is to observe/measure oxygen saturation levels in the area of the
      treated wound before initiation of dermaPACE treatment, during the treatment period, and two
      weeks post treatment period
