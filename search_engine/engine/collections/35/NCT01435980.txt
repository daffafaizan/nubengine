    
      Methods:

      60 Type 2 diabetes in our hospital will divide into 3 groups: group A (20 patients who give
      basal treatment), group B (20 patients who give basal and Exenatide treatment, group C（20
      patients who give basal and Gastric Bypass treatment). The age, height, weight, blood
      glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c（HbA1c）,homeostasis model assessment(HOMA-IR), lipid,
      blood pressure, course of disease, ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening(FS),
      diameter of left ventricle in late diastolic stage(LVEDd), the thickness of the ventricular
      septa（IVSD) and the posterior wall of the right ventricle in late diastolic stage (LVPWd)
      will record respectively. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI), relative wall thickness (RWT)
      will calculate and High-sensitive C-reactive protein (HsCRP), adiponectin and Tumor necrosis
      factor-α（TNF-α） will detect as Baseline. After each group's treatment, Change from baseline
      of all indexes will record, Multifactor logistic regression will be analyzed the correlations
      between each positive indexes.
