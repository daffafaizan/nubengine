      often followed from adult studies. The primary objectives for this study are to determine if
      subjects can safely and easily be switched from divalproex sodium to Depakote ER and to
      determine if Depakote ER is both safe and effective for pediatric patients with Bipolar I or
      II. Secondary objectives include determining the serum levels of valproic acid 20 hours after
      administration of Depakote ER at a steady rate and determining if co-administration of
      stimulants will effect the serum levels of valproic acid. Thirty subjects, ages 6-17 years,
      with a diagnosis of Bipolar I or II who are currently asymptomatic, according to a score of
      less than 10 on the Young Mania Rating Scale, or who desire to change to once daily dosing,
      or desire to change because of the likelihood of decreased side-effects, will be recruited
      from our clinic and the community. If subjects have completed baseline evaluations (including
      diagnostic confirmation), labs, and rating scales and are still eligible to participate,
      subjects will be switched in one night from twice-a-day divalproex sodium (DVP) to divalproex
      sodium extended release (DVP ER).

      The potential benefits of the research are that new information will be added to the field of
      child and adolescent psychiatry and the possibility that the medication change may result in
      improved symptoms of mania or side effects of medications related to peak and trough levels.
      The potential benefits of this study outweigh the possible risks.
