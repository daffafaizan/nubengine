      care following craniotomy. Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) will be evaluated and documented
      every hour or as needed during stay in ICU by nurse on duty. Emergent agitation is defined as
      SAS of 5 to 7 at anytime during the first 24 hr of ICU stay.Patients are divided into 2
      groups: non-agitation group (SAS 1-4) and agitation group (SAS 5-7).Data collection includes
      pre-operative records, events during anesthesia and operation, events during ICU stay, and
      outcomes. The primary outcome is complications such as self-removal of endotracheal tube,
      central venous or bladder catheters. The secondary and third outcomes are ICU stay and
      Glasgow Outcome Scale at hospital discharge, respectively. Incidence of agitation will be
      calculated to present an epidemiological knowledge. Univariate analyses between the two
      groups will be used for preliminary selection of model variables. Then stepwise block
      logistic regression will be applied to model the risk of agitation using significant
      univariate predictors.
