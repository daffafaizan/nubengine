    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of preoperative neoadjuvant paclitaxel and doxorubicin
      (doxorubicin hydrochloride)/cyclophosphamide (AC) on: senescence; invasion/motility (tumor
      microenvironment of metastasis [TMEM] and 67 kDa laminin receptor [67LR]).

      II. To create a biospecimen repository for future studies derived from patients with breast
      cancer receiving standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease are
      assigned to Stratum A, and patients with HER2-negative disease are randomized to Stratum B or
      C.

      STRATUM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and trastuzumab IV over
      30-90 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. Beginning 2-3 weeks later, patients receive doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks
      for 8 weeks

      STRATUM B: Patients receive paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide as in
      Stratum A.

      STRATUM C: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Patients then receive
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks.

      Patients undergo surgery 2-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
