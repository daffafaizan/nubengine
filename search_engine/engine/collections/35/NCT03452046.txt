      obtaining a clear image of where the US and IVC measurements were made and the probe
      stabilization was achieved. He performed the procedure of changing the pressure supports, a
      blind independent intensive care physician without working, and recorded the applied pressure
      supports respectively. The different pressure supports applied are as follows:

        1. PS 10 mmHg-PEEP 5 mmHg,

        2. PS 0 mmHg- PEEP 5 mmHg

        3. PS 10 mmHg- PEEP 0 mmHg.

        4. T-tube (PS 0 mmHg-PEEP 0 mmHg)
