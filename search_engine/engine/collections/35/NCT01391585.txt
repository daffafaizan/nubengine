      Manager (PRM). A registered nurse will also use PRM to receive incoming responses. Tasks will
      be created for her to outreach to patients who have out of range text responses or poor
      response rates. This intervention if a feasibility study to see if patients can communicate
      with the investigator's health care system and potentially utilize PRM to better manage their
      diabetes.
