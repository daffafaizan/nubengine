      leading to a significantly higher risk of death. Oral opportunistic pathogens have been
      reported to be associated with the incidence of pneumonia among non-stroke immunocompromised
      subjects. Preliminary studies found that patients with stroke had higher carriage rates of
      oral opportunistic pathogens than healthy subjects. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that
      pneumonia complicating stroke is associated with oral opportunistic pathogens, and oral
      health promotion interventions may reduce the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke via
      its effects on the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic pathogens. In order
      to prove this, investigators need to (1) firstly conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      confirm whether oral health promotion is able to reduce the levels of plaque, and the
      incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke at clinical level; (2) secondly employ
      metagenomics analysis to compare oral rinse samples and respiratory samples, and to identify
      pneumonia-associated "oral opportunistic pathogens group"; (3) finally elucidate how oral
      health promotion influences the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic
      pathogens. This proposed study will provide evidence for the integration of oral health
      promotion as part of interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation.
