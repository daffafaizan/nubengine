    
      This study is designed as a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SC administration of RPh201 in participants with previous
      NAION.

      Following a screening phase of 1-8 weeks, participants will attend a baseline visit in which
      they will undergo testing and visual function assessments. Participants then will be
      randomized to receive RPh201 or control.

      Cohort A After randomization, participants will begin a 26-week schedule consisting of
      twice-weekly treatment. Participants will return to the clinic for visits at Week 1, Week 4,
      Week 12 and Week 26 and Week 52

      Cohort B After randomization, participants will begin a 12-week schedule consisting of
      four-times-per-week treatment. Participants will return to the clinic for visits at Week 4
      and Week 12.

      Safety and efficacy parameters will be recorded throughout the duration of the study.
