    
      Visual analog scales (VAS) are one of the most common tools used in questionnaires. VAS are
      validated for pain and stress for example on a horizontal, non-calibrated line of 100 mm,
      ranging from very low (0) to very high (100). Nowadays, most VAS are used on questionnaires
      on internet. However, the influence of screen sizes on responses to visual analog scales were
      never studied.

      Primary objective is to study the influence of screen sizes on response responses to visual
      analog scales.

      Secondary objectives are to assess:

        -  the variability of responses depending on screen sizes within a week

        -  the influence of perception of work and addiction to work on the variability depending
           on screen sizes

        -  relationships with biomarkers of stress : salivary DHEAS, heart rate variability and
           skin conductance

      An open questionnaire will be created by the Clinical Research Direction. The questionnaire
      will be opened by the examinator who will fulfill the anonymized identification of
      participants and the type of screens. In a dedicated room at the LaPSCo, the participants
      will answer the same VAS on four different sizes/types of screens (24-inch screen, laptop,
      tablet, smartphone) and on paper. Saliva will be collected after answering questionnaires.
      Heart rate variability and skin conductance will be measured with the use of a wrist watch
      during 15 minutes, from the entrance in the room to the completion of questionnaires.

      The participant will undergo the same examination within a week (15 minutes).
