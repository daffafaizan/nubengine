    
      this study includes clinical and imaging and interventional aspects. detailed history and
      comprehensive examination of the patient. duplex ultrasonography to detect pelvic varices and
      presence of reflux. renal and left iliac venogram is usually the first step in the evaluation
      of compressive syndrome. then cannulate the gonadal and internal iliac veins selectively.
      contrast medium injected , the incompetent gonadal veins are generally dilated and the
      contrast pools in the pelvis after injection. embolization by injecting afoam sclerosant as
      distally as possible to occlude the pelvic venous plexus using occlusion balloon proximal.

      follow up assessment by VAS score and duplex imaging.
