      HFA-BDP) vs fluticasone propionate (FP) in paediatric patients (5-11year olds). Patients
      identified from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and the Optimum Patient Care
      Research Database (OPCRD). Two analyses were conducted:

        1. Comparison of outcomes achieved by EF HFA-BDP and FP in 5-6year old patients with those
           achieved in 7-11yr old patients.

        2. Comparison of outcomes achieved by EF HFA-BDP used with or without a spacer to those
           achieved by standard particle fluticasone propionate (FP) used with a spacer.
