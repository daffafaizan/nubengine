      postoperative pain(and other types of pain) subanesthetic doses. Gender differences in
      ketamine analgesia are not known. This placebo-controlled,randomised, parallel group study
      investigates the analgesic dose-response effect of ketamine in subanesthetic doses in female
      and male patients following surgical removal of third molars.

      Comparisons: Placebo and ketamine in females and males.
