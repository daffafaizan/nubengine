      as treatment management for their prostate cancer and are or will be scheduled for a repeat
      biopsy. A blood sample will be collected and undergo an immunogenomic assay to be compared to
      their repeat biopsy results. Subjects will then be followed for 10 years with optional serial
      testing at the time of their active surveillance protocol repeat biopsy. This study's
      hypothesis is based on the association of immunogenomic signatures from peripheral blood CD2
      and CD14 cells with aggressive prostate cancer, and that this signature will identify
      patients with aggressive prostate cancer from a cohort of patients currently on or are
      candidates for active surveillance. By comparing the immunogenomic assay to the repeat biopsy
      information we will identify the assay's ability to predict occult aggressive cancer that
      would indicate the patient is no longer appropriate for continued active surveillance.
