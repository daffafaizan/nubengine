      substantial improvements in metabolic health indices in non-diabetic obese persons who
      undergo a weight-maintenance diet including prepared meals that were aligned with current
      dietary recommendations, including those of the Institute of Medicine and the United States
      Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Dietary
      Guidelines for Americans. For instance, marked reductions and often normalization of
      hyperinsulinemia were observed within days of provision of a controlled nutrient-dense high
      quality diet, and LDL was reduced by 20-30% or more within 2 weeks or possibly earlier. This
      indicates that change in diet alone would benefit many at-risk persons with respect to
      normalizing metabolic parameters and disease risk markers. Yet, surprisingly little formal
      research has focused on how a high quality, weight maintaining diet impacts health over a
      short-term period in at-risk individuals. The overall objective of this study is to determine
      if a nutrient-adequate diet closely aligned with food group recommendations set in the 2010
      Dietary Guidelines for Americans elicits a superior metabolic profile in persons at-risk for
      metabolic disease, compared to a nutrient-adequate containing foods closely aligned with the
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) "What We Eat In America" report.
