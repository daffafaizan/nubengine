    
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will be conducted to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP2151 in patients with herpes simplex (labial/facial
      herpes or recurrent genital herpes). The efficacy will be evaluated for the primary endpoint
      defined as, "the proportion of subjects achieving lesion healing by Day 8 of study treatment"
      to demonstrate the superiority of ASP2151 to placebo. The safety will be evaluated based on
      adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs.
