      involves retrieving all breast related nodes while leaving intact the main lymphatic drainage
      chain of the upper limb. This represents a new surgical technique that is the focus of recent
      surgical interest. The assumption is that the sentinel node (SN) of the upper limb is
      different from the SN of the breast and that it is uninvolved after metastatic involvement of
      the axillary nodes in relation to the breast. During the ARM procedure, it is necessary to
      use an injection of a lymphatic tracer into the upper limb in order to visualize the
      lymphatic arm drainage.The ultimate goal for ARM procedure is to reduce the rate of
      lymphedema in N+ patients requiring an AD.
