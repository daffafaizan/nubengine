    
      Ethical approval was obtained to use CT scans of 30 patients with moderate to severe knee
      arthritis (REC reference: 17/HRA/0033, Royal Devon & Exeter National Health Service [NHS],
      UK).

      The CT data will be used to generate the 3D geometry of each patient's proximal tibia. The
      osteotomy correction angle required for each patient such that the altered mechanical axis
      will pass through a point 62.5% of the distance from medial to lateral tibial plateau.
      Virtual HTO surgery will be performed on each patient to alter the mechanical axis of the
      knee by creating an opening wedge osteotomy.

      After the virtual surgeries are performed, each virtual patient will be duplicated. One copy
      will have the osteotomy stabilised using a Generic plate and the other using a Personalised
      plate, thus forming the two arms of the trial.

      For each participant in each arm finite element (FE) models will be created, and loads
      applied simulating walking, sit to stand and squatting. Four healings stages will be
      considered, stage 1 being immediately post-operation (this will not be modelled), stage 2
      representing 2 weeks post-operation, stage 3 representing 6 weeks and stage 4 representing 12
      weeks. The mechanical loads in the plates, and around the screw locations in the bone, will
      be established by solving these finite element models.
