      disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia subjects. The presence
      of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on
      subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.

      This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of flexible dosing of
      brexpiprazole in the treatment of subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the
      Alzheimer's type. The trial consists of a 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day
      follow-up. The trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and 90 years
      of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either
      in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the subject is
      not living alone.
