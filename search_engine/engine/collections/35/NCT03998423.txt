      development or progression of AD. Gut microbiome composition among individuals with the
      Alzheimer's clinical syndrome is reduced in microbial diversity and shows compositional
      differences relative to control groups. Further, genera identified as more abundant in AD are
      associated with greater AD pathology while genera identified as less abundant in AD are
      associated with less AD pathology, as shown using CSF biomarkers.

      The goal of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of an oral fecal microbiota
      transplant (FMT) intervention.

        -  Primary Objective: To assess the safety and feasibility (recruitment, eligibility,
           enrollment, completion, and follow-up) of an oral FMT intervention in people with and
           without the Alzheimer's clinical syndrome.

        -  Secondary Objective: To demonstrate the effects of FMT on the composition and function
           of the gut microbiota. To collect preliminary data in order to estimate sample size and
           other parameters for a larger study.
