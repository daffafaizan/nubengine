    
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled Phase III study to evaluate
      the immunogenicity and the safety of GSK Bio influenza vaccine (Fluarix) administered
      intramuscularly in healthy adults aged 18 to 64 years. Vaccination is currently the most
      effective means of controlling influenza and preventing its complications and mortality in
      persons at risk. Following vaccination, seroprotective antibody titers are achieved in a high
      proportion of vaccinated subjects. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK Bio) has been marketing
      an inactivated influenza split vaccine (FluarixÂ®) since 1992. More than 126 million doses
      have been distributed and the vaccine is registered in 78 countries. It has been well
      tolerated and has proven to be highly immunogenic when injected by the intramuscular route.
