      and/or physical impairment. Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
      millions of individuals and causes irreversible memory loss and cognitive impairment.
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also and incurable disorder that causes patients
      irreversible paralysis, which results in death due to inability to breath and suffocation.
      These disease have been shown to be associated with abnormalities in an important scaffolding
      called microtubules, a cellular structure that help support the shape of the cells. This
      study will explore an experimental imaging test to see if it can be used to help doctors
      identify early microtubule changes. The test involves the injection of a radioactive compound
      that has been shown to go to cells and bind to microtubules. Special cameras called Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET)/CT cameras will be used to allow doctors to view where the
      radioactive compound goes in the body, as this is the first time this radiolabeled agent is
      being used in humans. In this study, doctors will give the new compound to up to five healthy
      volunteers to see where it goes in the body of people who presumable have normal microtubule
      function. Then doctors will give [11C]MPC6827 to up to 30 additional subjects (healthy
      controls and patients with Alzheimers Disease or ALS) to focus on imaging the brain for
      extended times. The research-imaging drug in this study is [11C]MPC6827. The radioactive drug
      in this study is experimental, meaning it is not approved by the FDA and can only be used in
      research studies.
