      different days with a minimum of 14 days wash-out. On one day, the participants will also
      receive dexamethasone in one arm and placebo in the other. On the other day, the participants
      will also receive placebo in one arm and lidocaine in the other. By this using this design,
      the investigators will be able to assess if perineural dexamethasone can increase the
      duration of an ulnar nerve block when controlling for the systemic effects. Furthermore, to
      ensure blinding, the investigators have also incorporated the lidocaine group which also
      allows for the assessment of the effects of adding lidocaine to a peripheral nerve block with
      bupivacaine. The order of which the participant will receive dexamethasone and lidocaine will
      be random. It will also be random in which arm the participant receives dexamethasone and
      lidocaine.
