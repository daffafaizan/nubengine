                treatment, disease activity will be fulfilled.

                The majority of diagnostic tests and procedures are routinely performed during
                clinical care.

                The study will be divided into 2 phases:

                  1. Phase 1 - visit 1

                  2. Phase 2 - observation of selected subjects from visit 1 to 5

                Phase 1:

                30 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, including individuals with a long
                medical history and currently undergoing treatment for interstitial lung disease/
                autoimmune disorder are going to be recruited to the study in every clinical
                center, totaling up to:

                  -  210 patients in IPAF group

                  -  210 patients in CTD-ILD group

                  -  210 patients in IIP group

                Phase 2 Only newly diagnosed patients (individuals who have not been previously
                diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, and such diagnosis was set during phase 1
                of the study) will be recruited to this phase. Due to rare incidence, the
                recruitment phase may take up to 36 months.

                The total number of patients will be

                  -  70 in IPAF group

                          divided into 5 Eppendorf type microtubes (0,5 ml each). These microtubes
                          should be labeled according to the following: first letter of the
                          patient's name- first letter of the patient's surname/ gender F or M/date
                          of birth DD-MM-YY/date of sample collection DD-MM-YY, e.g.
                          AL/K/12.05.45/01.02.18. The samples will be stored in -70 °C. The samples
                          will be collected by a courier and transported to the clinical center
                          responsible for this part of the study. This sample will be used to test
                          for potential IPAF markers, e.g. chemokine C-C motif ligand 18 (CXCL18),
                          Surfactant Protein A- (SP-A), Surfactant Protein D (SP-D), Krebs von den

                15 ml of whole venous blood will be drawn and then divided into 10 Eppendorf tubes
                1, 5 ml each. The tubes will be labeled as described above. The specimens will be
                stored in -70 °C. The samples will be transported to the clinical center

                anesthesia and sedation with use of lidocaine and midazolam will be performed,
                according to anesthesia protocols applied in respective endoscopy units.
                Intravenous cannula will be inserted prior to BF. During endoscopy, the patient
                will be monitored according to safety protocols applied in respective endoscopy
                units.

                Bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed in the bronchus from the middle robe of

                on HRCT results and will be recorded in patient's medical history. Sterile solution
                of 0, 9% NaCl will be instilled. 200 ml fluid will be applied with a syringe in
                portions of 25 ml or 50 ml. It is recommended that minimum 60 % of the lavage fluid
                is retrieved.

                Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) testing. Preparation of microscopic slides,
                analysis of the cellular components of the specimen (kind of the most abundant
                cells retrieved, the cells' durability) will be performed according to a standard
                laboratory procedure (guidelines of the Polish Respiratory Society). Total cell
                count along with cells' durability will be measured in a sample taken from the
                filtrate or material after the first spin. Cytospin (routinely 10 min of 1200-2000
                rpm) will be used to prepare the material. May-Grunewald-Giemsa stain will be used
                to prepare the microscopic slides.

                BALF samples will be secured and stored in order to test for potential IPAF
                markers. 15 ml BALF will be divided into Eppendorf 1,5 ml microtubes and then
                stored in - 70 C. Samples will be checked for concentration of S1009A protein,
                chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 and chitotrisidase 1 (CHIT 1).

                Specimens of bronchial mucosa taken during BF [procedure not routinely performed
                during clinical care]. 5 mucosa specimens will be taken from the initial segment of
                the middle lobe bronchus, placed into Eppendorf microtubes and stored in -80 C.

                     • Whether the patient completed the test. If 6MWT was interrupted, the reason
                     should be recorded (e.g. dyspnea, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia,
                     intermittent claudication, other)

                     • Distance in meters
