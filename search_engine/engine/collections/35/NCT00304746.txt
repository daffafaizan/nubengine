      depression and low or borderline low testosterone levels for participation in this study. For
      a period of nine weeks subjects will receive double-blind treatment with either AndroGel
      (testosterone gel) or placebo. During this double-blind treatment phase subjects will come to
      McLean Hospital for a total of seven visits. Both clinical assessments (including ratings of
      your levels of depression and anxiety, quality of life, and visuospatial memory)and
      laboratory tests will be performed at these visits. Following the nine week, double-blind
      phase, eligible subjects may enter into a six month, open-label treatment phase in which all
      subject receive AndroGel. If you participate in the open-label phase, you will be asked to
      return to the site for 8 visits during the six month period.
