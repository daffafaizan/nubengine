      around the tumors. A common treatment for this swelling is a medicine called dexamethasone.
      Dexamethasone is a steroid. Long-term use of steroids has several known side effects.

      Recent studies have shown that a drug commonly used in to control high blood sugar in
      diabetes, called glyburide, can decrease brain swelling in patients with brain damage or
      stroke. Animal studies have shown that this drug may also reduce swelling from tumors in the
      brain. Researchers are interested in whether glyburide could treat brain swelling as well as
      dexamethasone with fewer side effects.

      This study is being done to see whether glyburide is safe to be used in patients without
      diabetes in combination with receiving SRS for brain metastases. This study will also find
      out if glyburide will decrease brain swelling in patients that get radiosurgery (SRS) for
      brain metastases. This study will also find out if taking glyburide will decrease the chance
      of needing steroids due to brain swelling that is causing symptoms. It is not yet known, but
      it is the investigators' hope that glyburide will both decrease brain swelling and lessen the
      chance of needing steroids.
