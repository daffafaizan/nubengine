        2. Background The first reports of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, a Beta Corona virus,
           single-stranded RNA, were released from Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1,2]. From there,
           the infection quickly spread into a pandemic form.

           The clinical manifestation of the infection varies enormously, from totally asymptomatic
           or mildly symptomatic forms, with nonspecific and flu-like manifestations, to an acute
           respiratory distress syndrome which, in patients requiring hospitalization in the ICU
           and mechanical ventilation invasive, can lead to death [3]. The greater severity of the
           course of the infection depends greatly on the general conditions of the patients, being
           maximum in elderly subjects and carriers of co-morbidities [4]. Recent studies have also
           evaluated the association of blood groups ABO as possible biological markers of
           susceptibility to COVID-19, suggesting that people with blood type O have a lower chance
           of infection while individuals with blood type A are most at risk, and people with blood
           group B have the greatest complications in the event of infection [5,6].

           In Italy, the first non "imported" case dates back to February 2020 in a person residing
           in Lombardy, in the province of Lodi [7]. However, new evidence on subjects tested
           positive for the antibody assay on serum samples suggests that the virus started to
           circulate before the official date.

           Initially, due to the sudden explosion of cases, epidemiological surveillance focused on
           patients related to health facilities because they were symptomatic, suspicious and
           high-risk contacts. Few are the data relating to asymptomatic infections or with mild
           non-specific and nuanced symptoms that, data from China, would quantify in about 85% of
           the total number of infected. Precisely on the role of person-to-person transmission in
           the course of asymptomatic infection and in the subclinical phases of the disease,
           epidemiological data are lacking despite they could prove to be very important. In fact,
           thanks to the availability of serological tests that identify the presence of
           anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, it emerged that a proportion of the population was infected
           by the virus and developed an antibody response [8] and that almost 30% of the people
           with antibodies were asymptomatic. [9]. Therefore, the understanding of the prevalence
           of the disease and the prevalence of the antibody response appear to be of considerable
           interest, as it seems to be established that asymptomatic subjects can transmit the
           SARS-CoV-2 infection for a period that in some cases has proved greater than 14 days
           [10].

           In order to evaluate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection among asymptomatic
           subjects, thus obtaining a real estimate of the beginning of the circulation of the
           virus in Italy, in our study we intend to conduct specific serological tests (total
           antibodies) to identify the prevalence of SARS-2-CoV antibodies among healthy blood
           donors who went to transfusion facilities of the DIMT in Venice during the pandemic
           (about 2500 periodic donors who referred to the Transfusion Center in the period between
           May and October 2019).

           Samples belonging to healthy volunteers (about 500) who have agreed to donate their
           blood will also be evaluated to establish a pool of control subjects belonging to the
           Interinstitutional Multidisciplinary Biobank (BioBIM) of the Research Center of the
           IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana in Rome. Finally, in order to evaluate the impact of
           seroprevalence in subjects with chronic diseases (about 1000), such as cardiovascular,
           oncological, respiratory and neurodegenerative ones, which represent settings of
           COVID-19 positive patients with a poorer prognosis, patient samples with the listed
           comorbidities, already present in BioBIM, will be analyzed. It has recently emerged that
           seroprevalence increases with increasing age and that younger groups have a lower
           susceptibility to infection [11]. Therefore, all samples will be analyzed for any
           association with sex, age group and blood group.

        6. Study type Multicentric, retrospective, observational, non pharmacological, on
           biological samples, conducted at the IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana, Rome, aimed at verifying
           the seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 antibodies in the population.

        7. Objectives 7.1 PRIMARY Objective: The aim of the study is to determine the proportion of
           people in the general population who developed an antibody response to antigenic
           determinants of SARS-CoV-2 in the period preceding the spread of the virus in Italy.

           7.2 SECONDARY Objective: Secondary objectives are represented by the possibility to
           characterize the differences in prevalence between genders, age groups and blood groups,
           also in relation to more unfavourable courses in subjects with other chronic diseases.

        8. Participants

           The study protocol will involve a total of 3500 subjects (3000 healthy subjects and 1000
           patients with chronic diseases) aged> 18 years, of both sexes. The two groups will be
           formed as follows:

           A- Healthy subjects among periodic blood donors of the Transfusion Center and volunteer
           donors of BioBIM B- Patients with chronic diseases including cardiovascular,
           respiratory, oncological and neurodegenerative diseases related to BioBIM

                samples in the Biological Bank.

           9.3 Drop out Not applicable.

       10. Study design

           The study will last 9 months, and includes 3 phases as follows:

           Phase 1: identification of samples Phase 2: sample analysis Phase 3: statistical
           analysis

       11. Methods of contact with possible participants in the study Not applicable. The study
           will be carried out only on samples stored in the Biobank.

       12. Methods of acquisition, statistical analysis of data and storage of raw data, compliance
           with privacy regulations Data collection will be carried out on a dedicated and
           anonymized database by the Principal Investigator. Data will be stored on a dedicated
           and protected server.

       13. Statistical Methodology 13.1 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of all parameters
           will be conducted under the responsibility of the Biomarker Discovery and Advanced
           Technologies (BioDAT) Unit of IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana.

      Data analysis will be carried out using frequency and percentage for the categorical
      variables, and mean and standard deviation for the quantitative variables. The t-test will be
      used to compare means and a p-value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant. All analysis will be performed on the SPSS Statistical Package for Social
      Sciences.

      13.2 Sample size The SPARE study is a pilot study, designed to verify the adequacy and
      feasibility of the project, and to obtain preliminary data that allow to determine the size
      of the sample of the final study. The sample size is therefore represented by a consecutive
      number of subjects who donated blood in the period May-October 2019 (about 2500) and all
      subjects (healthy and with chronic diseases) who referred to BioBIM in 2019 (about 1500 ).

      14) Requirements of originality and scientific soundness of the study The SPARE study aims to
      evaluate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection among asymptomatic subjects and thus obtain
      a real estimate of the beginning of the circulation of the virus in Italy. The evidence
      currently present in the literature refers mainly to the period of the actual pandemic, but
      there are no data relating to the months prior to autumn 2019. Same for the official data
      released by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the National Institute of Statistics
      (ISTAT) [11]. This study will allow us to define the spread of the SARS-2-CoV virus in a
      period long before the date to which the pandemic began in Italy.

      15) Expected Results

      The main expected results are:

        1. Identification of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-2-CoV antibodies in the population prior
           to the date on which the beginning of the infection in Italy is officially traced;

        2. Description of any associations with sex, age, blood group, outcomes of patients with
           chronic diseases.

      16) Progress report The proposers will submit a report on the progress of the study to the
      Ethics Committee at the end of each year and at the end of the study.

      17) Feasibility

      - n. patient samples that may be included is consistent with the study design

        -  presence of the necessary equipment

        -  adequacy of personnel 18) Concomitant treatments Not applicable. The SPARE study is a
           study on biological samples only 19) Cost/benefit ratio The study is supported by the
           IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana. The inclusion of samples belonging to healthy donors and
           patients in this clinical study may provide benefits in terms of more accurate
           management and acquisition of indications on the spread of the Sars-COV-2 virus in the
           asymptomatic population. There are no risks.

           20) Ethical relevance The study is conducted on patient samples stored in the Biological
           Banks, therefore there are no problems of an ethical nature to its execution.

           21) Insurance The procedures provided for the study in this centre do not directly
           involve patients, but the analysis of samples taken in the centres they enrol. The
           researcher assigned to the analysis of the samples is covered by an insurance policy
           included in the contract stipulated with the IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana.

           22) Result publication In compliance with the provisions in force regarding the
           confidentiality of sensitive data and patent protection, the results of the study will
           be submitted for publication within 6 months of after the closure of the database.
