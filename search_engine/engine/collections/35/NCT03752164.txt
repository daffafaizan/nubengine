    
      Pre-Intervention Assessment: permission/assent from the child and consent of the
      parent/guardian will be obtained and initial data and measurements will be collected to
      ensure continued eligibility; baseline measures will be assessed.

      Intervention: participants will engage in a one-time manualized, age appropriate, 1:1,
      30-minute intervention involving gentle yoga and mindfulness techniques in a private room in
      the Pediatric Research Unit at the Children's Hospital of Richmond. The intervention will be
      taught by certified and experienced child yoga instructors who have been trained in the study
      protocol by the applicant. These yoga instructors collaborated with the interdisciplinary
      research team in the development of manualized age-appropriate yoga sequences.
      Parents/guardians will be invited to observe the yoga session. Intervention fidelity will be
      maintained through the use of a manualized intervention and the PI observing all sessions for
      manual consistency. The intervention will cease if the participant suffers from any asthma
      symptoms during the intervention, such as wheezing, coughing, retractions, accessory muscle
      use, chest tightness or shortness of breath, or experiences any other adverse events which
      precludes the his or her ability to actively participate in the intervention.

      Post-Intervention Assessment: upon completion of the intervention, brief semi-structured
      interviews will be conducted with the child and parent/guardian separately in order to
      explore the acceptability of the intervention and the PI will again assess the child for any
      asthma symptoms or adverse events. Post-intervention pulmonary function test and vital sign
      measurements will then be collected.
