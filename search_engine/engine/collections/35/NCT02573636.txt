      PTEN in patients with high risk prostate cancer treated with first line LHRH agonist after
      biochemical failure.

      Patients in this study will be treated with standard hormonal treatment. Patients will remain
      on treatment regardless of rising PSA. PSA, other systemic therapy maybe added and the
      patients with oligometastasis could be treated with radiation therapy; this would be at the
      discretion of the treating oncologist.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene
      fusion and PTEN in hormonal refractory free survival and clinical progression rate in three
      years. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the relation between Gleason score and
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN independently and together, the relation between T stage and
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN independently and together, and to determine the association
      of these markers with overall survival.
