        -  To examine the association of secondary lymphedema, symptoms, functional status, and
           quality of life after treatment in patients with head and neck cancer.

        -  To examine the possible factors contributing to the development of secondary lymphedema
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo a physical and external (e.g., submental area) and internal
      (e.g., larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity) lymphedema examination. Demographics, background,
      and lymphedema treatment information are also collected. Participants' medical records with
      head and neck cancer information and treatment are reviewed.

      Participants complete surveys on Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom (VHNSS), Lymphedema Symptom
      Intensity and Distress Survey Head and Neck (LSIDS-HN), Functional Assessment Cancer
      Therapy-Head Neck (FACT-HN), Quality of Life Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HADS), and Body Image Scale.
