      improvement and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). However, mant patients experience
      diffuse recurrence and treatment failure. This is a phase II trial testing the feasibility of
      adding lithium carbonate, previously shown to have anti-invasive properties in HGG, to
      bevacizumab and chemoradiation following surgical resection of HGG.
