      be performed at up to four experienced 'Radial First' centers (UCSD, UCLA. Arkansas Heart
      Hospital and LBVA). A maximum of 180 patients having undergone successful radial
      catheterization will be enrolled in the study, 60 in each arm. 60 patients will be enrolled
      at the LBVA. Enrollment will continue at each site on discretion of the investigators until
      each center enrolls a minimum of 30 patients, or a maximum of 180 patients are enrolled.
      Clinicians will perform the catheterization in accordance with local standard practice, with
      a minimum of 5,000 units of unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation. At the start of the
      TRA procedure, prior to radial artery cannulation, a baseline Pleth-ox exam will be performed
      for all patients and recorded on the CRF. Ulnar compression will be applied to confirm that
      the radial artery is patent. Patients with a type D pattern exam will be excluded from the
      study. At the conclusion of a successful transradial procedure, the patient will be
      randomized to either SSA or TRB, each device applied per protocol & IFU. It is hypothesized
      that if radial artery compression time can be shortened to 40 minutes or less, the following
      could result: improved catheterization lab efficiency, greater patient satisfaction and lower
      complication rates, including RAO, may be improved.
