    
      This study is for patients planned to undergo a transcatheter-based structural heart disease
      procedure that utilizes TEE and fluoroscopic guidance at the NYU Langone Medical Center. It
      will evaluate the utility and workflow of the transesophageal echocardiography/angiography
      (TEE/Angio) fusion software prototype to provide visualization of anatomic landmarks and
      guidance during structural heart disease procedures.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate software (TEE/Angio fusion) that merges images from
      two standard procedures (ultrasound and x-ray) used to look at the heart during a procedure
      for structural heart disease. Typically, these 2-dimensional images are viewed separately,
      requiring the operator to mentally merge the two images together while deciding if he/she is
      in the correct location for the treatment strategy. TEE/Angio fusion is designed to make a
      single 3-dimensional image of the heart in real-time.
