      and 10 healthy volunteers were examined. All patients underwent clinical evaluation,
      neurological examination, anorectal manometry, and measurement of pudendal nerve terminal
      motor latency (PNTML). All patients with hypertensive anal canal were randomized into three
      groups. Group I (surgical group) underwent closed lateral sphincterotomy LS, group II using
      nitroglycerine ointment (GTN) and group III received injection of botulinum toxin in internal
      sphincter. Post procedures data were recorded at follow up period.
