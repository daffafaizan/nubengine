      effectively alleviate chronic pain. Subjects will complete a screening session before
      completing 5 study sessions that will occur once weekly. Subjects will double-blind doses of
      study medications the morning of each experimental session, and will undergo standardized
      pain testing, as well as provide self-report ratings of drug effects, and cognitive tests.
