      suppressive oral antiviral treatment with valacyclovir reduces complications of Herpes Zoster
      Ophthalmicus (HZO), thereby improving clinical outcomes in this common and potentially
      vision- and life-threatening disease. There are 1,000,000 new cases of Herpes Zoster (HZ) per
      year in the USA, with 10-20% being HZO.

      Specific AIMS

      Primary Aim: The primary aim of this double-masked, placebo controlled multicenter randomized
      clinical trial will test the hypothesis that suppressive antiviral treatment for 12 months
      with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the rate of new or worsening dendriform
      epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis or iritis compared to placebo,
      at 12 months as the primary endpoint, and at 18 months including 6 months of follow-up after
      treatment, as a secondary endpoint, in patients with HZO who have had an episode of one of
      these disease manifestations during the year prior to enrollment.

      Secondary AIM: The second aim is to test the hypothesis that suppressive treatment for 12
      months with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the severity and duration of postherpetic
      neuralgia (PHN), compared to placebo, at 12 months and at 18 months as secondary endpoints,
      in similar patients with HZO. PHN is a debilitating chronic pain syndrome that negatively
      impacts quality of life, especially in elderly patients.

      The study will enroll immunocompetent patients age 18 years and older who have HZO diagnosed
      at variable times in the past, with these types of active anterior segment ocular segment
      disease within the past year. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      long-term suppressive treatment with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily or placebo for 12
      months, plus usual ophthalmic care, and followed every 3 months for a total of 18 months, to
      determine outcomes of new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis,
      endothelial keratitis or iritis and/or severity and duration of PHN during 12 months of
      treatment and for 6 months following treatment discontinuation. The results with regard to
      PHN may be applicable to HZ in other locations. If suppressive valacyclovir treatment is
      determined to be effective, the potentially devastating disease burden of HZO and HZ may be
      reduced for patients, as well as the annual costs to society, estimated in the USA to be one
      billion dollars.
