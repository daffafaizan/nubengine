      dose-limiting toxicity and clinically significant adverse events, in patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
      patients. III. Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen. IV. Assess the
      activities of daily living and neurological status of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 30
      minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 1 and 2, and on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 3-6. Patients undergo
      cranial irradiation on days 1-5 of weeks 1-6. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo a neurological examination and an
      activities of daily living questionnaire at baseline, week 10, and during follow-up visits.
      Patients are followed at weeks 10 and 16 and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
