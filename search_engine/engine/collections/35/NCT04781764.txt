      high-quality high-throughput sequencing database of immune microenvironment cells, so as to
      lay a data foundation for later mining the dialogue mechanism and key targets between immune
      cells and tumor cells in glioma microenvironment.

      Based on the analysis results of the above database, the key role of key target molecules in
      the dialogue between GIM and glioma cells and the regulation ability of immune cells in the
      immune microenvironment were confirmed through cell and mouse animal experiments, which laid
      the foundation for later targeted drug research and development.

      Combined with fluorescence imaging technology, through in vivo imaging of mice, it can
      provide more intuitive and effective visual verification for the dynamic infiltration process
      of GIM and other immune microenvironment cells in the process of glioma evolution, and
      provide a new theoretical basis for the visualization research of dynamic regulation of
      glioma immune microenvironment cells.
