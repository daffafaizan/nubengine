      from October 2018 to December 2019. Sixty adults' patients ASA I-III, their ages ranged from
      25-60 years undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Each patient assigned
      written informed consent before the block performance.

      Patients refused, known allergy to the used drugs, with history of coagulopathy, major organ
      failure and obesity (BMI>40 kg/m2) were excluded from the study.

      Patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups by a computerized randomization table:
      ESPB group, and control group. The patient and the staff providing the postoperative care
      were blinded to the group assignment.

      ESPB group: Will undergo ESP block with 40 ml bupivacaine 0.25% (20 ml on each side) control
      group: anesthetized with the protocol followed by Minia University Hospital.
