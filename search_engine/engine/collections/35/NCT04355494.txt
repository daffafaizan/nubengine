    
      This is an open label, multicenter, Expanded Access Program (EAP) to allow participants with
      a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a clinical presentation consistent with
      COVID-19 severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, or ARDS to be treated with eculizumab.
      Participants admitted to a designated hospital facility who qualify for emergency treatment
      will be administered eculizumab up to 7 times during their treatment course (5 mandatory
      doses and up to 2 optional doses, per Investigator assessment).

      The EAP consists of a Screening Period of up to 7 days, a 4-week Treatment Period, a final
      in-hospital assessment on Day 29 or day of discharge, whichever occurs first, and 3 monthly
      safety follow up visits (to be conducted as a telephone call if the participant has been
      discharged from the hospital or an in-person visit if the participant is still hospitalized).

      For each participant, the total duration of the program is anticipated to be 4.5 months.
