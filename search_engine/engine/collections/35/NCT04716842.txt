      angiotensin II and receptors on the pathogenesis and treatment of sepsis and septic shock.
      However, its level in humans and its relationship with the severity of the disease has not
      been investigated. If angiotensin II plays a role in the diagnosis and prognosis of septic
      shock by evaluating this relationship in our study, it may be a biomarker to be used in
      future diagnosis, prediction of prognosis and treatment. This will enable early recognition
      and treatment of this disease, which causes high mortality and cost in intensive care units,
      thus increasing the survival rate and reducing the cost.
