      cancer. Teaching the principles of mindfulness and compassion to FCGs has the potential to
      protect their psychological health and well-being. This may allow them to provide effective,
      compassionate care to patients, which ultimately puts the needs of the patient first.

      Mindfulness interventions have demonstrated decreased stress and anxiety, and improved
      self-compassion for individuals, but entail numerous sessions over several weeks, a barrier
      for caregivers. The SMART program, a brief mindfulness program, has demonstrated improvements
      in resilience, anxiety, perceived stress, and mindfulness for healthcare providers and
      patients.
