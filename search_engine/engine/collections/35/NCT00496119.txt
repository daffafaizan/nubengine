      tumor site. Researchers are trying to determine what level of proton therapy gives the most
      benefit without causing toxic side effects. Researchers will also be testing the treatment's
      effect.

      If your doctor feels it is necessary, the proton beam therapy may be combined with standard
      photon therapy.

      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will receive proton beam therapy at The
      University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), and possibly photon beam, no
      sooner than 2 weeks after the last surgery to remove the tumor. You will receive proton beam
      therapy once a day for about 35 treatments (7 weeks). Treatment will be given for 5 days in a
      row each week (except for Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) at the MDACC Proton Center in
      Houston. The whole process should take up to 1 hour each day.

      This is an investigational study. The proton beam machine used to deliver treatment is
      approved by the FDA for patient use. The doses being studied are experimental. About 15
      participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MDACC.
