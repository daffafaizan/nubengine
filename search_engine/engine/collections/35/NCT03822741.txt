      impact on patients'quality of life and social integration. Epileptic encephalopathy is
      characterized by refractory seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and poor prognosis. Despite the
      recent progress in technology, molecular diagnosis of neonates suffering from possible
      epileptic seizures can be challenging, due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneities. A large
      number of specific pathogenic variations have been related to various forms of epilepsies.
      Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has significantly improved the molecular diagnosis for rare
      diseases. NGS focusing on genes known to be associated with human diseases is a practical
      approach as a first-tier assessment for patients with heterogeneous genetic background. In
      addition, currently medical therapy for seizure is not based on the etiology, but the
      clinical manifestations, and the main purpose is not to rescue the underlying diseases
      process, but just to reduce the likelihood of seizures occurrence. In this study,
      Investigator performed NGS on neonates with seizure onset before 1 year of age, to detect and
      quantify genetic variants, and assess existing therapeutic effects. Our findings will have
      important implications for the development of precision medicine strategies.
