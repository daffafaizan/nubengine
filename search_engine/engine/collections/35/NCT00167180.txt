      offers little hope of prolonged survival. However, there is evidence that lymphocytes can
      attack cancer cells. There is considerable evidence that this immune attack on cancer cells
      is associated with graft-versus-host disease. Although graft-versus-host disease can cause
      problems, this immune reaction may, in part, be the way that bone marrow transplantation
      cures cancer. In this study we hope that infusion of immune cells from the subject's bone
      marrow donor plus a chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will activate
      the subject's immune system to attack their cancer.
