      the initial treatment of hypertension have better blood pressure control compared to those
      randomised to less aggressive (monotherapy) treatment despite subsequent add-on treatment
      being similar in each group. This will test the hypothesis that monotherapy patients 'never
      catch up' with combination therapy patients.

        1. To determine if this 'never catch-up' phenomenon of improved BP control persists for at
           least one year.

        2. To understand the underlying mechanism of improved BP control; specifically:

             1. To determine if it is due to haemodynamic compensation, such as increased sodium
                retention and volume expansion.

             2. To determine if it is due to increased peripheral resistance.

        3. To understand the predictors of BP control i.e. age, baseline renin status, sodium
           status and plasma volume.

        4. To validate the National Institute for Clinical Excellence / British Hypertension
           Society joint guideline ACD algorithm by comparing BP control in the monotherapy
           crossover arm of phase 1 and to correlate this with age (â‰¤ 55 or > 55y), and baseline
           characteristics such as renin.

        5. To determine the safety and tolerability of a strategy of prescribing combination
           therapy as the initial step versus monotherapy as the initial step.
