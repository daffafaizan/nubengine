      extraction of these impacted teeth is one of the most commonly procedures performed by the
      oral and maxillofacial surgeon. In most cases these are not traumatic procedures, however
      factors such as patient age, habits, degree of tooth impaction and surgeon experience can
      influence the surgical trauma and therefore the postoperative period could include swelling
      and pain of varying magnitudes which can significantly affect the patient's quality of life.

      The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, split-mouth crossover
      trial. All the patients will be informed of the experimental methodology and signed a
      institutionally approved consent form. The study is been conducted in compliance with
      Declaration of Helsinki (1989), and was revised by the Institutional Ethical Committee
      (protocol 1.167.908).
