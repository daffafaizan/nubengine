      stage needs to be explored further. The investigators attempt to quantify and compare the
      levels of micro-RNA 146a and micro-RNA 126 in subgingival as well as coronary plaque samples
      obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis with and without coronary artery
      disease.

      Seventy-five participants were selected and grouped into 3 categories; 25 patients diagnosed
      with chronic periodontitis and coronary artery disease: CP + CAD group; 25 patients diagnosed
      with chronic periodontitis alone: CP group; and 25 systemically and periodontally healthy
      controls (HP). Demographic variables, periodontal parameters, cardiac parameters, blood
      pressure were obtained. miRNA-146a and miRNA126 levels were assessed in subgingival plaque
      (SP) samples from all the three groups. Within CP+CAD group, SP samples of CP+CADa were
      compared with coronary plaques samples (CP) of CP+CADb while the patient underwent CABG.
