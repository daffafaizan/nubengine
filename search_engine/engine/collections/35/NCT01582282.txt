      the acceptable guidelines of the ADA, with compliance assessed by a study dietician using
      7-day food diaries completed by the patients. Subject body weight, serum glucose and serum
      HbA1c, and lipid levels were allowed to stabilize during this period.

      During the 12-week treatment period, Subjects were stratified by either diet alone or diet
      and oral hypoglycemic medication and randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups:
      placebo, 3.4 g psyllium BID for a total of 6.8 g/day (10.4g Metamucil) or 6.8g psyllium BID
      for a total of 13.6 g/day (20.8g Metamucil). For 12 weeks, patients took Metamucil or the
      fiber-free placebo BID, just prior to breakfast and dinner.

      Patients visited the clinic 10 times during the 20-week period at Screening, Weeks -8, -6,
      -4, 0, Day 3, and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, fasting at least 12 hours prior to each visit where a
      blood sample was taken (all visits except Week -6 and Day 3) for analysis of fasting serum
      glucose and lipid levels, and HbA1c. Clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis were done
      at Weeks -8, 0 and 12. The completed 7-day food diaries were reviewed by the study dietician
      at each visit and discussed with the patient to ensure compliance with the recommended diet
      and the patients' body weights were recorded.
