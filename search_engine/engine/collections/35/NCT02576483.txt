      the study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would
      exclude the participant from the study, then the investigator will inform the participant and
      make an appropriate referral. This is standard practice for laser in situ keratomileusis
      (LASIK) surgery, small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and photorefractive keratectomy
      (PRK) surgery.

      If the participant is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive examination
      including computerized videokeratography, then the participant can be enrolled. These exams
      are also standard practice for LASIK, SMILE and PRK surgery.

      The Quality of Vision (QoV) Questionnaire will be administered following the pre-operative
      visit during which participants are enrolled and then at the three-month and twelve-month
      post- op visits before the participants are seen by the principle investigator. The
      questionnaire is the study intervention.

      The participant will undergo bilateral simultaneous LASIK eye surgery, SMILE or PRK surgery.
      The participants will be seen pre-operatively, on the day of surgery, post op day one, one
      month, three months, and twelve-months as part of the study. Participants may also be seen
      more frequently if required from a medical standpoint. The participant will receive topical
      antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. LASIK treated eyes will receive
      pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week to four weeks after treatment. All of this is
      within the usual and customary standard of care for the treatment of patients undergoing
      LASIK, SMILE and PRK surgery.
