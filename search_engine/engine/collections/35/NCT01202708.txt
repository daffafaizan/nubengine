      Europe. The AK200 ULTRA is a single unit which is preprogrammed to provide standard
      hemodialysis as well as hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration with on-line preparation of the
      substitution fluid The AK200 ULTRA hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration is performed using a
      high flux membrane with high ultrafiltration rates compensated by volumetrically controlled
      infusion of on-line prepared substitution fluid. The AK200 ULTRA is, therefore, capable of
      providing dialysis treatments which can improve the removal of medium to high weight
      molecules without the difficulties associated with the manual measurement and administration
      of external substitution fluid.

      This study is designed to assess the safety, efficacy and dialytic capabilities of
      hemodiafiltration with on-line prepared substitution fluid using the AK200 ULTRA in
      comparison to conventional hemodialysis. This study is motivated by the need for a
      commercially available product capable of administering hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration
      in a clinical setting. The ultimate goal of this study is to improve morbidity and mortality
      in the ESRD patient population in the United States.
