        -  Determine the objective response rate of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors
           treated with bortezomib.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamics to correlate proteasome inhibition and efficacy of this
           drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
