    
      This study is a randomized control trial with repeated measures. It will include 34 subjects
      with low back pain who sit 25 hours a week or more at a desk / computer.

      There will be 2 groups: control and experimental, each with 17 subjects. All subjects will be
      measured on the same 2 dates (3 weeks apart - pre and post intervention) with the same
      measures.

      The experimental group will use a pelvic support device, that aids in supporting the user's
      pelvis in a neutral position, in their desk chairs at home or work as tolerated during this 3
      weeks.

      The control group will continue in their current sitting arrangement during the same 3 weeks.

      For control of conflict of interest, the Sponsor-Investigator will not perform any of the
      measures and data will be coded for subject group assignment until all data analysis is
      finalized.

      Multiple sessions of 3-week intervals of data collection may be performed as needed to
      achieve desired subject number in the study.
