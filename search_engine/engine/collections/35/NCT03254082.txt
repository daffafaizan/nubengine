      by placing water and grain mixture in a beaker and placed in a hot water bath (cooked over a
      stove/heating unit). The gruel was allowed to cool for 3-5 minutes before eating. The
      consistency of the gruel was similar to oatmeal. Subjects had a resting blood sample
      collected for assessment of fasting blood glucose, then ate the gruel (or control sucrose,
      22g) that was assigned for that day -- they returned for the other gruel meals or sucrose
      control determined by Latin Square randomization. Finger stick blood samples where then
      collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after eating the gruel (or sucrose) began.
