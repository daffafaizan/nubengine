      for a restrictive protocol for intravenous fluid administration (group A, 100 patients) or
      not (group B, 92 patients). Transfusion guidelines were common for the two groups. The
      volumes of intravenous fluids, priming, "extra" volume on pump and cardioplegic solution and
      the volume of urine were recorded. Net erythrocyte volume loss was calculated. The number of
      the transfused PRC was analyzed as a continuous variable. "Transfusion" was analyzed as a
      categorical characteristic. Analysis employed Student's two-tailed t-test, t-paired test and
      chitest.
