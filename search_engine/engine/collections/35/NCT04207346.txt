      prevalent in the Veteran population. While there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of medications and psychotherapy for improving PTSD symptoms, there has been
      limited study of functioning as an outcome, and the role of other treatments such as somatic
      therapies. One promising but understudied somatic treatment for PTSD is repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The characteristics of TMS treatment are different
      than those of existing treatments and may provide alternative treatment to Veterans who do
      not respond to medications and psychotherapy. Further, it is possible that TMS may have a
      greater effect on functioning and lead to higher rates of recovery compared with medications
      or psychotherapy.

      Objective To determine whether Veteran participants with PTSD who receive TMS delivered to
      the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 1 Hz have greater improvements in: PTSD symptoms,
      functioning, and depressive symptoms than Veterans receiving sham treatments at treatment
      completion and at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion.

      Method 91 Veterans with PTSD will be randomly assigned to receive low frequency TMS or sham
      TMS. All TMS will be applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. PTSD symptoms,
      functional outcomes, and depressive symptoms will be measured for all participants at
      treatment completion, 3 months, and 6 months after completion.

      Hypothesis Veterans with PTSD receiving TMS will have greater improvements in PTSD symptoms,
      functioning, and depressive symptoms at treatment completion and at three and six months
      after treatment completion compared to Veterans receiving sham TMS.
