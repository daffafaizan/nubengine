      neonatology department is associated with neurological development of preterm infants born
      with a GA < 32 weeks. The other hypotheses are that iron intake and the duration of
      breastfeeding are also associated with the development of preterm infants.

      In the previous study EPINUTRI (NCT01486173), the development of infants was evaluated until
      the age of 1 year. EPINUTRI_3 is the follow-up of EPINUTRI until the age of 3 years.

      The aim of EPINUTRI_3 study is to determine the association between lipid intake during
      hospitalization in neonatology department of preterm infants born with a GA < 32 weeks.

      The secondary objective is :

      - to evaluate the association between these factors and communication, developmental and
      social-emotional delays with the test " Ages and Stages questionnaire " (ASQ) at 3 years of
      age.
