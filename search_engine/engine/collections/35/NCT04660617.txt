      death among males worldwide. Though patients with early stage prostate cancer can obtain
      satisfactory therapeutic efficacy from radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, the prognosis
      of men with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa), especially metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC), is still poor. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of
      the high-throughput technologies, including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic
      methods. These techniques are promising in uncovering the mechanism of the tumor progression,
      identifying distinct tumor subtypes and finding new treatment targets.

      In the current prospective study, the investigators plan to perform multi-omics technologies
      in patients with mPCa, aiming at uncovering the mechanism of the tumor progression,
      identifying distinct tumor subtypes and finding new treatment targets.
