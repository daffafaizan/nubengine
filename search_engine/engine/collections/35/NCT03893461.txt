      stereotactic body radiation therapy, immediately after stereotactic body radiation therapy
      completion, four to six weeks after completing stereotactic body radiation therapy). The
      blood sample at the completion of stereotactic body radiation therapy is an extra compared to
      normal gathering of blood samples of patients with NSCLC treated with stereotactic body
      radiation therapy. Also extra glasses with blood will be gathered at each blood sample for
      storage in a biobank in order to be able to make future analysis on this material.

      There is a minimal risk of developing infection or hematoma in connection with blood sampling
      but we consider this risk to be negligible. The total volume of 120 ml blood drawn over a
      period of 6 weeks is an inconsiderable risk for the patient.
