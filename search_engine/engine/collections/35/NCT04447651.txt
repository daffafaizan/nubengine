      recommendation based on participants' genetic information, participants and participants'
      oncologist will decide ultimately what to do, and participants' oncologist will monitor
      participants' day to day care while on therapy. Participation involves allowing the
      investigators access to participants' sequencing report and medical records, providing a
      blood sample (about 8 tablespoons) at baseline and possibly again after three months, and
      answering questionnaires. If participants join the study, a panel of experts (Johns Hopkins
      Molecular Tumor Board) will review participants' genetic information participants entered and
      make a determination regarding treatment recommendation. Blood will be collected at baseline
      irrespective of what treatment is recommended. If immunotherapy is recommended, the
      investigators may collect blood again at 3 months. Participants and participants' oncologist
      will ultimately decide if participants proceed with the recommend treatment or not; the
      recommendation made from Johns Hopkins is not binding in any way. Participants' oncologist
      will continue with usual care according to standard practices while participants are on
      therapy. The investigators will get health information and conduct questionnaires with
      participants and participants' oncologist to assess how participants are doing on therapy.
      The main risks are the discomforts of the blood draw (which are expected to be minor and not
      last), boredom from completing questionnaires and the risk that information may become known
      to people outside of the study. Participants may or may not benefit directly from being in
      the study and there is no payment for participation.
