      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has gained increasing attention as a potential
      treatment for various neurological and psychiatric disorders, but available rTMS studies are
      flawed by inaccurate anatomical targeting, inadequate sample size, unsatisfactory controls
      and lacking blindness. To date, the elective target area of rTMS interventions in AD has been
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a core area of the Central Executive network
      (CEN), which plays a key role in regulating executive functions, attention and working
      memory. While the CEN has recently been described as dysfunctional in AD, AD pathophysiology
      has been mainly associated with the breakdown of the Default Mode network (DMN) and with
      structural disconnection of its parietal nodes. The DMN plays a crucial role in episodic
      memory retrieval and incorporates various brain regions, among which parietal areas are
      highly connected with the rest of the brain. The present multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized and placebo-controlled study has the ambition to provide evidence of the efficacy
      of two tailored network-based rTMS treatments in mild AD, through the enhancement of
      connectivity of CEN and DMN. Innovative integrated multi-modal imaging investigations will
      further enrich this proposal allowing to identify quantifiable markers underlying the
      clinical impact of rTMS on AD.
