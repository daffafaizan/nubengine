      architecture, and bone strength assessed by 3D HR-pQCT with a resolution of 61 µm (Xtreme CT
      II, Scanco Medical, Brütisellen, Switzerland) in the Swiss population.

      Design: Population-based, age- and sex-stratified, cross-sectional study in a single centre.

      Study Size: For the main part, 480 valid data sets will be needed for two age reference
      intervals for both women and men. The number of double/triple stack scans will be between 1
      and 3 depending on graded motion artefacts.

      Among the 120 participants of each reference interval, 21 will be needed to assess
      reproducibility. For these volunteers, the number of double/triple stack scans will be equal
      to 3.

      Project Assessments, Procedures: participant demographics and physical activity will be
      obtained and the validated Swiss FRAX questionnaire will be filled to determine the
      epidemiology-based 10-year fracture risk. Grip strength will be measured. A DXA measurement
      at the hip will be done according to the standard protocol of the Universitätspoliklinik für
      Osteoporose. For participants at elevated vertebral fracture risk, lateral and
      antero-posterior DXA of the spine will be added for vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) and
      spine areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The HR-pQCT examination per se consists then of up
      to 3 repeated double stack scans at the distal radius and triple stack scans at the distal
      tibia.
