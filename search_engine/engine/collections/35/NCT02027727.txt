    
      Our aims are:

        1. to determine which early pk level; week 6 (peak), week 8 (2 week) or week 14 (trough),
           is most associated with week 30 and 54 outcomes in pediatric IBD patients.

        2. to determine if the forecasted PK determined by a newly developed Population PK Model
           software program is in agreement with the observed PK in IBD patients receiving
           infliximab.

      Subject recruitment is limited to patients of the principal investigator only. Subjects will
      be approached for participation in the research in person during a routine clinic visit by a
      member of the study team.
