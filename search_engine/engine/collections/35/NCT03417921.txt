    
      This is an open-label, randomized phase I/II multicenter study to evaluate ABTL0812 in
      combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel at first line therapy. Patients will be
      assigned to the following groups during the study conduct:

        -  GROUP A: You will receive the standard treatment of chemotherapy and the investigational
           drug ABTL0812.

        -  GROUP B: You will receive the standard treatment of chemotherapy.

      For GROUP A:

      Phase I: A 3+3 de-escalation design followed by an expansion phase will be performed

        -  ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily. Potential dose levels are 1300 mg tid,
           1000 mg tid, 650 mg tid and 500 mg tid. Intrapatient escalation or de-escalation is not
           permitted. A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first
           cycle of chemotherapy.

        -  Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 +
           nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15.

        -  If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for
           any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance
           therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or
           patient/physician's request to discontinue.

      Phase II:

        -  ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).
           A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first cycle of
           chemotherapy.

        -  Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV +
           nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8 and 15

        -  If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for
           any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance
           therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or
           patient/physician's request to discontinue.
