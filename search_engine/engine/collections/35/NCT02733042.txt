      this study, 4 treatment arms were to be investigated:

        -  Arm A: durvalumab and lenalidomide ± rituximab

        -  Arm B: durvalumab and ibrutinib

        -  Arm C: durvalumab and rituximab ± bendamustine

        -  Arm D: durvalumab (monotherapy)

      The study was to start with 3 dose-finding cohorts (Arms A, B, and C) and 1 dose-confirmation
      cohort (Arm D) in parallel. All treatment arms were to be open for enrollment at study start
      except in the US, where Arm D was to enroll depending on the availability of treatment slots
      and following the completion of assessment of responses from the combination therapy arms.
      For Arms A and C, prior to enrolling participants to receive all 3 drugs, the doublet
      combinations were to be evaluated. Once the doublet combinations were deemed tolerable, the
      eventual triplet combinations were to be tested.

      On 05 September 2017, the US FDA issued a Partial Clinical Hold on the study Arm A. Following
      this Partial Clinical Hold no more participants were enrolled into study Arm A. Participants
      already enrolled and treated in Arm A who were receiving clinical benefit, based on the
      discretion of the investigator, could continue study treatment after being reconsented. Arm B
      and C completed dose confirmation. The dose expansion part of the study was not opened.
