      effects of such treatments such as fatigue. Regular exercise can potentially improve these
      side effects. However, Safety and effects of exercise has not been studied in patients with
      multiple sclerosis. Our main aim is to study the safety, tolerability and effects of exercise
      on side effects of subcutaneous interferon-b1b in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
