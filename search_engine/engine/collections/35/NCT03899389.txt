      scheduled for conventional coronary angiography, and patients with acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) who were admitted to the hospital with chest pain and undergoing coronography surgery.
      Blood samples will be taken from volunteers once - before the coronography surgery by
      qualified medical personnel.
