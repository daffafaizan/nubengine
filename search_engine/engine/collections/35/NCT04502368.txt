      therapeutic procedure. FOB in respiratory failure patients supported by mechanical
      ventilation may worsen hypoxemia and hypercapnia, therefore FOB requires careful
      consideration in this patient population. The generally accepted indications for FOB in
      ventilated patients are removal of retained secretions, resolution of atelectasis and
      evaluation of hemoptysis. A diagnostic indication is the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), to
      sample the lower respiratory tract without contamination. Studies of FOB performed in
      mechanically ventilated patients suggest an acceptable safety profile, except for the
      occurrence of hypoxemia as the main adverse event. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) in normal
      volunteers is reported to be safe and does not lead to measurable changes in pulmonary
      function parameters. However, in intensive care patients may suffer from serious side effects
      such as prolonged oxygen desaturation. Moreover, reductions in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)
      have been reported to persist in some patients for 4 h and more after the procedure. Authors
      reported the BAL procedure is associated to a worsening of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, in several ARDS
      patients the drop in PaO2 was higher than 30%. Moreover a physiological study in patients
      undergoing FOB and BAL showed adverse change in lung compliance and resistance.

      The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the alterations in respiratory
      mechanics (regional compliance and resistance) and gas exchange induced by FOB and BAL up to
      6 hours after the procedure. The lung regional ventilation evaluation will be made by
      electrical impedance tomography (EIT).
