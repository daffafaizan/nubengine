    
      In order to improve complete dentures fabrications an experimental model for optimizing the
      composite material and the execution technique for the 3D printed dental prosthesis was
      developed.

        -  A new polymer - nano-TiO2 composite system for dentures printing was obtained by adding
           0,4-1%TiO2 nanoparticle in the commercially available E-Dent 100 (EnvisionTEC, Germany).

        -  The new polymer was completely characterized and biocompatibility tests were perform.

        -  A stereolithography technique was set-up for CAD-CAM complete dentures manufacturing.

        -  3D printed dental prosthesis will be inserted to a number of 35 complete edentulous
           patients from a target group;

        -  Clinical follow-up at 6, 12 and 18 months and quality assessment of the dentures will be
           recorded in a specific chart.

        -  A statistical evaluation of data recorded during the entire follow-up period will be
           performed.
