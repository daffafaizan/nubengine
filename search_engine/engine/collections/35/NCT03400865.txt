      prolactinomas, but its clinical use is hampered by intolerance and/or resistant in some
      patients with prolactinoma. Chloroquine (CQ) is an old drug widely used to treat malaria.
      Recent studies, including our own (J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2017; Autophagy, 2017;
      Oncotarget, 2015), have revealed that CAB and CQ are involved in induction of autophagy and
      activation of autophagic cell death. Furthermore, CQ enhanced suppression of cell
      proliferation by CAB. We established a low-CAB-dose condition in which CAB was able to induce
      autophagy but failed to suppress cell growth. Addition of CQ to low-dose CAB blocked normal
      autophagic cycles and induced apoptosis, evidenced by the further accumulation of
      p62/caspase-8/LC3-II. The data suggest that combined use of CAB and CQ may increase clinical
      effectiveness in treatment of intolerance and/or resistant prolactinomas.
