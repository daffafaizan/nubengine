      nephrolithiasis, or others - in which an oral alkalinization could be useful. Oral
      alkalinization could be performed or by bicarbonate contained in alkaline-based waters or
      drug therapies or by citrate. This therapeutic intervention has been said to increase
      extracellular volume leading to rising blood pressure, especially due to the amount of daily
      sodium load. No prospective data has been published in clinical routine, studying its effects
      on extracellular volume nor the blood pressure control.

      Here, investigators propose to follow patients in which an oral alkalinization is indicated:
      blood pressure, body weight, and a clinical evaluation of the extracellular compartment will
      be performed at the beginning and during the follow-up of participants. Initial recorded data
      will be: age, gender, prescription (indication, kind of alkali therapy, volume and duration),
      body weight, body length, a clinical appreciation of the extracellular compartment, blood
      pressure, comorbidities, drug therapy, blood and urine composition. The recorded follow-up
      will be: the adherence to treatment, body weight, body length, a clinical appreciation of the
      extracellular compartment, blood pressure, adverse events, blood and urine composition.

      The principal criterion of evaluation will be the variation in the extracellular compartment.
