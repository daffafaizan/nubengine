      treatment for tobacco use disorder.

      The study is a crossover design study (within-subject analysis), which allows for subjects to
      be their own control.

      Each period of the crossover consists of a 7-day out-patient treatment period followed by a
      single out-patient testing day on Day 8. Subjects will participate in a laboratory session
      following the McKee Stress-Smoking Lapse Test. Upon completion, subjects will undergo a 7 day
      washout period followed by the second period of the crossover design and a 7-day follow-up
      visit.
