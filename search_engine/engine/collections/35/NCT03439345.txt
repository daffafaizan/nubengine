    
      LENS is a phase 4 randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial of fenofibrate in participants
      with diabetes and observable retinopathy or maculopathy. The trial aims to recruit
      approximately 1,060 participants and to treat them for a median duration of at least 4 years.
      The main aim of LENS is to investigate the effect of fenofibrate therapy on progression to
      clinically significant diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy. The trial will be conducted using a
      pragmatic streamlined trial design with the only planned face-to-face visits being an initial
      screening visit, followed by a randomisation visit eight weeks later. Contact with
      participants thereafter will be by means of regular telephone or computer questionnaire, and
      outcome and safety data will also be sought by means of linkage to NHS Scotland registries.
      Prior to randomization, eligible participants will enter an active run-in phase of 6 to 10
      weeks.
