      first line of endocrine therapy (ET) only have a 30-50% chance of receiving clinical benefit.
      For the other 50-70% of patients, ET is ineffective and these patients should probably be
      treated with chemotherapy, as is done for ER negative patients. More importantly, in nearly
      every clinical trial of ET in ER positive, MBC patients, between 15-30% of enrolled patients
      progress in the first 2-3 months, regardless of whether they are receiving first or later
      lines of ET. Currently there is no validated method to identify which ER positive MBC
      patients will be refractory to ET. Therefore, almost all ER positive patients are treated
      with serial endocrine therapies before switching to chemotherapy. The investigators propose
      that a subset of these patients would be better served with chemotherapy, in spite of its
      increased toxicity profile, rather than delaying chemotherapy during a several month trial of
      ineffective, albeit less toxic, ET.

      To try and predict benefit from or resistance to ET, an index (the CTC-ETI) has been created
      that takes into account the number of CTC (which is prognostic) as well as the phenotype of
      the CTC, based on the hypothesis that relative levels of ER and Bcl-2 (high=benefit) and HER2
      and Ki67 (high=resistance) are predictive of ET responsiveness or resistance. Although the
      preliminary data demonstrate the ability to detect, enumerate, and characterize CTC utilizing
      the CellSearchÂ® System, the purpose of the current study is to establish proof of principle
      that these 4 markers can be used to generate a CTC-ETI which can be performed at baseline
      from patients enrolled at different centers, and that baseline CTC-ETI predicts relative
      outcome for patients with ER positive MBC starting a new ET, and can be monitored in such
      patients during ET. Successful completion of this study will set the stage for a larger,
      definitive study designed to demonstrate the clinical utility of a "refined" CTC-ETI in
      patients with ER positive, HER2 negative MBC.
