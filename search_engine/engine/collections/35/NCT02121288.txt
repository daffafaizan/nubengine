    
      The effects of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on adenosine-induced myocardial blood flow (MBF)
      will be evaluated by cardiac 13N- ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) at rest
      (baseline), acute dosing on Day 1, and at short term dosing on Day 7.

      Subjects receiving ticagrelor will have additional pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples
      collected at specific time points to measure ticagrelor concentration in the blood. Subjects'
      participation will be approximatetly 6 weeks.
