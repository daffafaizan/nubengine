      home, between 6:00-8:00 am each day over the 4-mo intervention. The energy content of the NP
      and HP breakfast meals will be standardized to 350 kcal. The energy content of the breakfast
      meals is ~18% of daily energy intake estimated from the energy expenditure equations specific
      for adolescents ages 13-16 y. The NP breakfasts will be 11% protein (10 g protein), 63% CHO,
      and 26% fat, whereas the HP breakfasts will be 34% protein (30 g protein), 40% CHO, and 26%
      fat. The types of protein incorporated within the NP and HP meals will include a combination
      of beef (40%), dairy (20%), eggs (20%), and plant-based (20%) proteins. The NP and HP meals
      will include the same types of breakfasts but will vary in protein and CHO content. An 8-d
      breakfast rotation will occur throughout the study.
