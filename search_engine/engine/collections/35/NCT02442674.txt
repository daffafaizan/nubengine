      on fluid balance in children and adolescent subjects with euvolemic or hypervolemic
      hyponatremia. Subjects who are diagnosed with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum
      sodium < 130 mEq/L [mmol/L]) that persists despite initial standard background therapy (eg,
      including fluid restriction) are eligible to be screened for participation in this trial.
      Subjects who demonstrate prior resistance to vasopressin antagonist therapy will be excluded.
      All potential subjects must be deemed by the investigator as likely to benefit from a therapy
      that raises serum sodium levels.

      Subjects will be required to be in a hospital setting during initiation or titration of
      tolvaptan. Overall, in this trial, subjects will undergo treatment with tolvaptan or placebo
      for 30 (+2) days and a post-last dose follow-up phase of 14 days.
