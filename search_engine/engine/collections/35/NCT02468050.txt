      exercise has emerged as an attractive non-pharmacologic approach to mitigating the
      psychological and physical sequelae of breast cancer and its treatments, however pre
      treatment interventions are not integrated into current practice. This study aims to
      determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a pre treatment exercise intervention in
      attenuating levels of anxiety and depression following breast biopsy and throughout the
      diagnostic period.
