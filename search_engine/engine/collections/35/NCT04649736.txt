      that could exist long-term health damage. This study aims to assess the efficacy of a 6-week
      rehabilitation program following hospital discharged for patients who had severe COVID-19.
      The program includes 12 sessions of home-based respiratory therapy that the patient will
      carry out with a physiotherapist and 6 sessions of telephone-based psychological support
      bring by a psychologist.
