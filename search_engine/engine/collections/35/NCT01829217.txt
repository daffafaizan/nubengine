    
      Primary Objectives

      - To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) to sunitinib in never-smokers with lung
      cancers that are wild-type for EGFR, KRAS, and ALK in a single-arm phase II trial

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To identify oncogenic alterations underlying sensitivity to sunitinib through performing
           nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) of lung cancers treated with sunitinib

        -  To explore the activity of sunitinib in lung cancers known to harbor a RET
           rearrangements and other genomic alterations in targets of sunitinib (e.g. cKIT, PDGFRa,
           PDGFRb).
