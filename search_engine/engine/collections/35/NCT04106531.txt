    
      This is a single-site validation study of a novel quality of life study for patients
      undergoing medical therapy for prolactinoma. Patients will be consented before starting their
      medical regimen and complete the "Prolac-10" questionnaire for baseline and will continued to
      be followed for 13-weeks into their medical care. The primary goal of this study is to
      validate the novel quality of life questionnaire in terms of sensitivity, repeatability, and
      consistency. Secondarily, we aim to validate the test-retest characteristics to further
      validate sensitivity, repeatability, and consistency.
