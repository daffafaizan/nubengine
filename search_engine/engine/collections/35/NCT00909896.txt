      points (24 +/-4hours, 48 +/-4hours, and 72 +/-4hours) between the two groups of patients
      undergoing either robotic or open laparotomy approach for staging of endometrial cancer. Post
      operative Quality of Life will also be collected at several time points. The total amount of
      post operative opioid requirements during the first 24hours between patients undergoing
      either robotic or open laparotomy approach surgery. The survival status every four months for
      the first two years will be monitored, then every 6 months for up to 5 years. The primary
      endpoint is the mean difference in post operative pain VAS scores reported by subjects at
      rest at the following time points: 24+/-4, 48+/-4, and 72+/-4 hours between both groups after
      surgery has been completed.
