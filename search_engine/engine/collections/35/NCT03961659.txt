    
      This is a prospective, randomized, open label, parallel, 16-week study to explore and
      evaluate the therapeutic effects of liraglutid, dapagliflozin and acarbose on the cognitive
      function, olfactory function, and odor-induced brain activation in overweight/obese patients
      with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.We have 1 principle
      investigator, 6 sub-investigators and 1 nurse in research centre. The sub-investigators will
      screen in the outpatient and inpatient departments to enroll 87 patients (29 for each arm)
      totally with the inclusion and exclusion criteria in 12 months. The patients will be
      randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio into liraglutid, dapagliflozin and acarbose treatment group with
      a computer-generated random order. All patients will also continue on their existing dose and
      regimen of metformin throughout the study. At the baseline, clinical information collection,
      100g-steamed bread meal test, biochemical measurement, body composition analysis, cognitive
      assessment, olfactory test and functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) scan will be
      conducted for all patients. During the treatment period, visits at 4-week intervals will be
      performed to evaluate the safety of drugs and adjust the dose of metformin if hypoglycaemia
      occurs; meanwhile, fasting and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose assayed by fingerstick,
      physical examination, and olfactory test will be conducted. At the end of the study, all of
      the assessments will be performed again for all recruited subjects, including early
      withdrawal patients.
