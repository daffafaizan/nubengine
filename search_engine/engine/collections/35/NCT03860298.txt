      Eligible patients will be enrolled through the process of informed consent then will receive
      NaviFUS treatment one cycle. The time interval for each treatment cycle is 3 days, including
      baseline/treatment and 3 days observation. The site of the NaviFUS exposure is where the
      future surgery will be removed. Concomitantly use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) will be
      monitored and recorded in the case report form (CRF). A total of six patients will be divided
      into two stages of recruitment, the first stage will recruit two patients, the second stage
      will be four patients. When the first stage is accomplished, the data and safety monitoring
      board (DSMB) will review the study data and provide the recommendations regarding
      continuation, termination, or other modifications of the study based on evaluation of
      observed adverse effects of the intervention. The second stage will begin to conduct after
      the DSMB agrees to proceed. In this clinical trial, stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)
      exploration will be carried out during long-term video-EEG monitoring and
      excitability/irritability in focal epileptogenic region and epileptogenic network will be
      analyzed.
