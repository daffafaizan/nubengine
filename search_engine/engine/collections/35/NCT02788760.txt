      C3-C7 with a Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Severity (SLIC) Score 1-3 and randomize them in
      to two similar groups. One group will be treated with a cervical collar for 6 weeks and the
      other group will be treated for 12 weeks. There will be a clinical check up and a CT scan at
      1, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after the initial injury. The investigators will compare the results
      between the two groups when it comes to fracture healing (CT based), level of function, pain
      and the length of sick leave with a total of 6 months of follow up.
