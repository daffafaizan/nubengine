      infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human
      convalescent plasma is an option for treatment of COVID-19. Experience from prior outbreaks
      with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS and H1N1 shows that convalescent plasma
      can be effective. Convalescent plasma will be obtained by plasmapheresis or regular whole
      blood donation in subjects who recovered from COVID-19 and who are otherwise eligible for
      donation according to the Institutional protocol. Recipients will be COVID-19 patients
      requiring hospitalization. A blood-type matched transfusion of convalescent plasma will be
      infused and recipients will be followed up.
