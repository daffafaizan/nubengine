      the safety and antiviral activity of the ApB DC vaccine, a therapeutic vaccine derived from
      autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous HIV-1 infected apoptotic cells. The study
      will be conducted in three phases. The first is the pre-vaccination phase that includes study
      entry, isolation of autologous virus, and initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Once the
      patient's viral load has been suppressed to undetectable levels (<50 copies/mL) and
      sufficient virus has been isolated, the second phase will begin. This includes leukapheresis
      in order to harvest monocytes and lymphocytes necessary for vaccine preparation. Three
      vaccine doses will be administered subcutaneously every other week. Six weeks after the last
      vaccination, the third phase, analytic treatment interruption (ATI) phase, will begin. A
      fourth, booster dose of vaccine will be given two weeks after the start of treatment
      interruption. The treatment interruption will be continued for twelve weeks after which the
      primary HIV provider will decide whether or not antiretroviral therapy should be restarted.
      CD4 and viral load will be closely monitored throughout the study especially during treatment
      interruption. Follow-up will be continued for 24 weeks after the 12-week treatment
      interruption.
