      controlled excision for treatment of cutaneous malignancies (See Appendix A). It has the
      highest cure rate of any of the methods used to treat common cutaneous malignancies and is a
      proven safe outpatient procedure. Part of the technique requires marking skin surrounding the
      tumor to correspond with tissue that has been removed and divided into pieces for processing
      and microscopic examination. Currently there are two established ways of marking the tissue;
      lightly scoring it with a scalpel or marking it with a surgical marker. Scoring tissue is
      faster, more accurate, and there is no risk of having the marking washed or rubbed away.
