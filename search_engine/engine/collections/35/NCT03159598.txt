        1. Establish the safety of a lysine-derived urethane adhesive (TissuGlu, Cohera Medical) in
           patients undergoing autologous abdominal-based breast reconstruction. This will be
           assessed via analyzing complication profiles of patients post-operatively. The primary
           endpoints are rate of seroma development, need for seroma drainage and time to drain
           removal (if in drain group).

        2. Determine if there is a difference in pain and other quality of life measures when
           comparing patients who do and do not have abdominal drains. This will be assessed via
           pain medicine utilization and by delivering a targeted survey pre-operatively, as well
           as at post-operative day three and four weeks.

      Study Design:

      Patients will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) Traditional closed-suction drains, 2)
      TissuGlu with closed-suction drains and 3) TissuGlu without closed-suction drains.
