      experiment. Four isocaloric (450 kcal) breakfasts (eggs with a side of French fries, mashed
      potatoes, or beans, and control breakfast of milk, cereal and toast) and breakfast skipping
      will be examined. On five separate mornings, 7 days apart and after a 12 hour overnight fast,
      each participant will receive one of the four breakfasts or skip breakfast, in a randomized
      counterbalanced order. Participants will be given an ad libitum lunch 3 hours after breakfast
      and parents will report the rest of day food record for food intake analysis. Blood glucose
      will be measured via finger-prick at baseline, and 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after
      breakfast consumption. Subjective appetite will be measured with a visual analogue scale at
      baseline and every 15 minutes for 1 hour, and every hour for 3 hours.
