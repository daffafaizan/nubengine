      Aspirin is significantly cheaper than rivaroxaban. Aspirin in combination with rivaroxaban
      was shown to be safe and efficacious in a non-inferiority trial (EPCATII) when compared to
      rivaroxaban alone.

      This study will assess if aspirin alone is non-inferior to rivaroxaban and aspirin in the
      prevention of venous thromboembolism.
