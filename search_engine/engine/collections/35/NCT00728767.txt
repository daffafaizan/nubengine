      The Danish national board of Health has awarded 5.6 million DKR to two studies that will test
      methods that can be used for effective and early detection of heavy drinkers. The study will
      be carried out in 9 Danish municipalities in 2008. The study is part of the 'Diet, Smoking,
      Alcohol and Exercise' nationwide health study of the Danish population. It takes place in 13
      municipalities in 2007 and 2008.

      The study will determine whether a brief intervention is effective in lowering self reported
      alcohol use in heavy drinkers.

      Design:

      The experiment is designed as a randomized controlled trial, where heavy drinkers will be
      allocated to either:

      A) a intervention group receiving a short (about 10 minutes) motivational conversation (build
      on the principles of motivational interviewing) and two leaflets about alcohol ('Good advice
      about drinking less' and 'Learn more about alcohol') and a sheet about local alcohol
      treatment possibilities. The Intervention group is also offered a brief telephone follow up
      call 4 weeks later. The purpose of this is to maintain the participant's motivation to reduce
      drinking.

      B) a control group receiving two leaflets about alcohol ('Good advice about drinking less'
      and 'Learn more about alcohol') and a sheet about local alcohol treatment possibilities.

      The study will take place in premises linked to the 'Diet, Smoking, Alcohol and Exercise'
      nationwide health study.

      After 6 and 12 months there will be follow-up and the participants will receive a
      questionnaire with questions about their alcohol consumption.
