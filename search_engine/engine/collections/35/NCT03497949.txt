      unknown. As a surrogate factor the usage of vasopressor support is more adequate as the
      registration of vasopressor drugs are many times not complete in records. The investigators
      retrospectively investigated the anesthetic journals of 1100 patients with an acute hip
      fracture (AHF) noting confounding factors and the usage of vasopressors either by injections
      or infusions and then correlated these results to mortality at 30-, 90- and 365-days
      Confounding factors were; all comorbitity, age, ASA grade as well as type of anesthesia
