      combination with Bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the initial safety and effectiveness of this agent in combination
      with Bevacizumab. The investigators are also trying to determine the best dose level of
      CRLX101 to give in combination with Bevacizumab. About 22 subjects will be enrolled in this
      study at the University of Pennsylvania. This study also involved two sub-studies that will
      be conducted in a select set of study subjects. This includes investigational cG250 PET/CT
      scans and paired bone marrow biopsy/aspirate assessments. The IND being requested from the
      FDA for this study will cover both the use of CRLX 101 as well as the use cG250 in the study
      sub-study.
