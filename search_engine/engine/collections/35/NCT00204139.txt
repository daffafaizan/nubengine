      benefits, according to the results of number of randomised trials, mostly performed in
      industrialised countries. While ultrasound did not seem to prevent fetal death, it was
      associated with improved detection of multiple pregnancies, improved detection of congenital
      abnormalities and reduced need for postterm labour induction. Only one trial, from Cape Town,
      has investigated the benefits of a policy of routine second trimester ultrasound scanning in
      an under-resourced setting.

      This will be cluster randomised controlled trial, performed in the Krugersdorp area of South
      Africa, where most health service users are African, working class and dependent on
      government health facilities. About 900 low-risk pregnant women at less than 24 weeks
      gestation will be recruited, and randomised, in clusters, to either routine scanning or no
      scanning with recourse to selective scanning if clinically indicated.

      Women will be followed up for maternal, fetal and neonatal outcome, and for indices of health
      service utilisation. Important outcome measures will be need for subsequent
      ultrasound,detection of multiple pregnancy, detection of congenital abnormalities, postterm
      pregnancy induction, still birth,and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

      Data analysis will compare outcomes according to whether routine ultrasound scanning was or
      was not done, using standard statistical methods.
