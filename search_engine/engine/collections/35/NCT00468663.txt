      predict monthly ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide
      (CO). These models will be used to estimate study participants' PM2.5 and CO exposures during
      and before pregnancy. We will test whether these air pollutant exposures are associated with
      subsequent risk of preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Additionally, we will test biological
      markers of maternal lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and
      inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) in maternal blood samples drawn during
      early pregnancy. We will also examine carboxyhemoglobin measured in early-pregnancy maternal
      blood samples as a marker of CO exposure.
