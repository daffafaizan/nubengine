      doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with relapsed or incurable solid tumors. II. Obtain
      pharmacokinetic profiles for various dosages of VX-853 administered in combination with
      doxorubicin HCl liposome. III. Achieve whole blood concentrations of VX-853 in the predicted
      therapeutically effective range and characterize the pharmacokinetics at these doses. IV.
      Document antitumor effects of VX-853 in combination with doxorubicin HCl liposome in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of VX-853. Patients receive VX-853 orally every 8
      hours on days 1-3 and doxorubicin HCL liposome IV over approximately 15 minutes beginning 26
      hours after starting VX-853. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      VX-853 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 18 months.
