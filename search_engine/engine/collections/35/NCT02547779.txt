    
      SMART-SURG is a large, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial of 0.9% saline versus
      physiologically-balanced isotonic crystalloids (Lactated Ringers or Plasma-LyteÂ© A) with
      regard to the incidence of major adverse kidney events by 30 days in patients admitted to
      non-medical intensive care units. All patients admitted to participating non-medical
      intensive care units at Vanderbilt University medical center who are 18 years or older will
      be enrolled. The study will occur in one-month blocks. Each participating ICU will be
      randomized to an initial fluid group (0.9% saline or physiologically balanced isotonic
      crystalloids). The assigned fluid will be used exclusively for all patients receiving
      isotonic crystalloid for the duration of the month-long block (except in the presence of
      pre-specified contraindications). The assigned study fluid will switch at the end of each
      month-long block such that half of the months are assigned to 0.9% saline and half of the
      months to physiologically balance fluid. The primary endpoint will be major adverse kidney
      events by 30 days (MAKE30 is the composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, or
      persistent renal dysfunction at discharge). All aspects of study design, intervention, and
      data collection will be harmonized with an ongoing, independent study addressing the same
      question in the medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University during a similar study
      period (SMART-MED). A pre-specified data analysis plan will dictate the harmonized analysis
      of SMART-MED and SMART-SURG.
