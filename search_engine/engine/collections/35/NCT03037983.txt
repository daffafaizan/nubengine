    
      High-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the dysfunctional brain region most implicated in cognitive
      deficits in schizophrenia, has recently been shown to improve cognition in non-Veteran
      samples with schizophrenia. The investigators' goal is to confirm the efficacy of this
      treatment modality to remediate cognitive deficits and improve functionality in Veterans with
      schizophrenia, as well as to gain a better understanding of the neural mechanisms responsible
      for cognitive deficits and their remediation. The investigators propose conducting a
      small-scale study to generate pilot data supporting the feasibility of conducting rTMS with
      Veterans and the effectiveness of rTMS in this population. In addition, the investigators
      will conduct neurophysiologic experiments to test whether certain neural maker of abnormal
      brain function improves with rTMS.
