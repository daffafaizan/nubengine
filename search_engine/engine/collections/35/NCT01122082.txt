      as well as "liking" and "wanting" (the two components of the reward system) could be
      influenced by glycogen stores and the carbohydrate-to-fat balance. More precisely, one may
      expect that a high fat oxidation rate could increase liking and wanting carbohydrates to
      replenish glycogen stores and conversely, that a high carbohydrate oxidation rate could
      produce the reverse. In order to validate this hypothesis, the present study has been
      conducted to investigate in humans the influence of the carbohydrate-to-fat oxidation ratio
      on carbohydrate-to-fat selection and the food reward system.
