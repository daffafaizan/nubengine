      patients to reduce the proportion of untreated OSAS in the population. This object is
      important considering that a longer duration of CPAP treatment is linked with better daytime
      functioning and metabolic and blood pressure effects of CPAP. The main endpoints will be CPAP
      usage (defined as the proportion of night with CPAP usage ≥1h); CPAP adherence (defined as
      the proportion of night with CPAP usage ≥4h); the average nightly usage of CPAP (hour/night);
      CPAP efficacy (defined as AHI and ESS score). Each measure will be performed after 1 week, 1
      month and 6 months.
