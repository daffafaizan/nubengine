    
      What kind of information will DETECT provide?

      I. From the cross sectional part (descriptive epidemiological part on 16th/18th September
      2003)

        -  Frequency, characteristics and severity of cardiovascular diseases, selected associated
           metabolic syndromes and atherosclerotic diseases and syndromes

        -  Identification and determination of the proportion of patients with high-risk
           constellations (e.g., post myocardial infarction, associated morbidities, laboratory
           measures)

        -  Rates of General Practitioners recognition, diagnostic and therapeutic profiles

        -  Assessment of quality of care (comparison with guidelines)

        -  Indicators of undertreatment, overtreatment and inadequate treatment

      II. From the longitudinal part

      Changes of laboratory parameters and diagnoses after one and five years, in relation to:

        -  Initial diagnostic and therapeutic status

        -  Selected intervention criteria

        -  Composition of risk indicators, and comparison with existing indices (PROCAM,
           Framingham, Score etc.)

        -  Measurement of frequency and point of critical outcomes e.g., myocardial infarction,
           associated morbidity, hospitalisation, critical medical interventions

        -  Significance of established and "new" cardiovascular risk factors

        -  Prognostic value of biomarkers for risk stratification
