      plus bevacizumab for 12 cycles or the same chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and valproic acid
      for 12 cycle.

      Thereafter, in both arms, patients who are progression free after 12 cycles (24 weeks) of
      treatment continue maintenance bevacizumab+fluoropyrimidines until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Surgery may be carried out in case of appropriate tumour reduction is evident at response
      evaluation. Resectability has to be evaluated by a multidisciplinary review team and the
      decision regarding post-surgery chemotherapy is at the discretion of the investigators,
      according to the policy commonly adopted by their Institution in clinical practice.
