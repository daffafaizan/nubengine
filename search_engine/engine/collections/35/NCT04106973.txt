    
      Mesothelioma is a rare, aggressive and treatment-resistant disease and, in the United States,
      is caused almost exclusively by exposure to asbestos fibers. There is often a lengthy latency
      period of 40-50 years between exposure and disease onset. The median age of diagnosis is 65
      years while the median survival time after diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma without
      treatment is 9 months. Symptoms, where present, may be non-specific, which further
      contributes to delayed diagnosis.

      In this study, the volatile organic compound (VOC) profile of exhaled breath from subjects
      with histologically confirmed mesothelioma will be compared against case-matched control
      subjects with bilateral pleural plaques or bilateral pleural thickening. Putative markers
      will then be tested against a blinded cohort to test predictive value of the markers.

      This study seeks to identify markers for mesothelioma using a non-invasive technique which
      samples volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the breath of test subjects (Owlstone Medical
      Ltd, Cambridge, England).

      A comparison of the participant's VOC profile will be made with an FDA-approved, serum-based
      assay (Lumipulse MesomarkÂ®, Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc., Malvern, PA) of the participant's
      soluble mesothelin related peptides (SMRP) to discern parameters of efficacy..
