      contrast during a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) in subjects who have image guided
      radiation therapy (IGRT) for the treatment of abdominal and pelvic tumors. Participant
      duration is one visit.

      Subjects will be required to fast for at least 2 hours prior to study procedures, as
      determined by the treating physician based on the site to be irradiated. An 18- to 22-gauge
      peripheral IV will be placed in the subject's arm prior to being brought to clinical
      treatment room. The patient will be placed in position for radiotherapy as per standard of
      care and will be connected to IV contrast injector. Standard of care IGRT techniques will be
      performed to confirm correct positioning. Iodinated IV contrast will be administered and the
      contrast enhance cone beam CT will be initiated. Treatment will then be administered with the
      patient in the position determined by non-contrast cone beam CT, as per standard of care.
      Immediately after completion of treatment of the subject, the study physician will complete
      physician survey of attitude about the utility of contrast-enhanced cone beam CT.
