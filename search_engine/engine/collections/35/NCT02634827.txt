      I. To determine the complete response rate for elderly patients with FLT3 mutated acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) using midostaurin and decitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the 1-year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) rates.

      II. Determine overall response rates in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine
      the complete response duration in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen based on National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the prognostic and predictive factors (FLT3 internal tandem duplication [ITD]
      versus [vs] tyrosine kinase domain [TKD] mutation) for patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Explore genetic targets for this disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5 and midostaurin orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 8-21 of courses 1 and 2, and on days 1-28 of each subsequent
      course. Patients failing to achieve complete response (CR)/complete response with incomplete
      recovery (CRi)/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia-free state by end of course 2
      receive midostaurin PO BID on days 1-28. Patients achieving CR/CRi/PR/morphologic
      leukemia-free state by end of course 8 may continue on current regimen. Patients failing to
      achieve a CR/CRi/PR/ morphologic leukemia-free state in bone marrow blasts by end of course 8
      go to event monitoring. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2
      years.
