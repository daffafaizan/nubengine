      adults. Acne affects approximately 85% of teenagers, but can occur in most age groups and can
      persist into adulthood. There is no mortality associated with acne, but there is often
      significant physical and psychological morbidity. Acupuncture combined with moving cupping
      and ear point tapping may effectively relieve the skin lesions, but the evidence is limited.
      Also, young patients usually have no time to see the doctor frequently, thus it's necessary
      to figure out a better frequency of treating.
