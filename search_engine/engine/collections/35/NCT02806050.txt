      non response to letrozole plus palbociclib treatment. The investigators will perform this
      feasibility study in 15 patients with metastatic breast cancer, eligible for letrozole and
      palbociclib therapy.

      All patients will be treated with letrozole 2.5mg daily continuously throughout a 28-day
      cycle. This is combined with palbociclib 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7
      days off treatment. At baseline all patients will have a FES PET scan. Currently the
      combination with palbociclib and letrozole has been approved by the FDA as initial
      endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with ER positive HER2 negative advanced
      breast cancer. This is based on improved progression free survival with 10 months compared to
      endocrine therapy alone in both first and second line hormonal treatment for ER-positive
      metastatic breast cancer. In Europe, approval is expected late 2016. Therefore, in this
      study, all patients will receive a (presumably effective) treatment combination, that
      patients do not have standard access to in the Netherlands yet. In addition to the standard
      control visits to the clinic, two extra visits will be performed as part of the study: for
      screening and for the FES-PET scan. In the future, this study may potentially contribute to
      improved selection of patients for this combination treatment. This is of relevance in view
      of optimal treatment for individual patients, avoiding unnecessary toxicity and financial
      burden.
