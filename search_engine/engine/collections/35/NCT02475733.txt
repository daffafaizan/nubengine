      intravenous ceftazidime avibactam in combination with metronidazole versus meropenem.
      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie,
      9 doses) before having the option to switch to an oral therapy. The decision to switch to
      oral therapy is entirely at the Investigator's discretion, if the patient has good or
      sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.Patients will
      be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study, and blood samples will be taken for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. The duration of each patient's participation in the study
      will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 days after start of study treatment (defined
      as the time point at which first dose of study treatment is administered) at which time there
      will be a late follow up (LFU) assessment visit. The LFU is to be performed 20 to 35 days
      after the last dose of any treatment.The assessments at the test of cure (TOC) visit should
      be performed in person 8 to 15 days after last dose of any study drug (IV or oral). The
      maximum duration of IV study drug or oral switch therapy is up to Day 15.
