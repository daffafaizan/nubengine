      education session provided prior to beginning physical therapy on outcomes of usual physical
      therapy for acute/sub-acute low back pain patients. The study compares two groups, one group
      will be treated with usual physical therapy with no pre-treatment education and the other
      group will also receive the pre-treatment. Patients will be followed after 6 weeks and 3
      months. Physical therapy care is left to the discretion of the physical therapist in
      conjunction with the patient. Outcomes will include pain and disability, and patients
      attitude and believes (pain catastrophizing, fear avoidance behavior). The overall hypothesis
      is that the additional educational treatment may address and improve pain, disability and
      fear.
