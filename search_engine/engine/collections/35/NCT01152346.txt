    
      This study is an open label, multi-center randomized, single dose, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, two-way cross-over, relative bioavailability study of Azacitidine for Injection
      for suspension use manufactured for Bioniche Pharma USA LLC compared with Vidaza®
      manufactured by Celgene Corporation in MDS patients under fasting conditions. Patients who
      are on a stable 75 mg/m2 dose of Vidaza will be randomized to study drug sequence Azacitidine
      on C1D1/ Vidaza® on C2D1 or Vidaza® on C1D1 / Azacitidine on C2D1. Randomization will be in a
      2:2 ratio. Thirty-six (36) patients will be enrolled to ensure 28 evaluable patients.
      Patients will not be blinded to their treatment assignment.

      After randomization, fasted patients will receive 1 dose of assigned study drug (either
      Azacitidine for Injection or Vidaza®) subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on C1D1. On Days
      2-7, they will receive their normal Vidaza® treatment. Following a 21 day rest period,
      patients will cross over to receive the alternate treatment on C2D1 followed by their normal
      Vidaza®) treatment on Cycle 2 Days 2-7. The Final Patient Visit will be conducted 7 days
      following the last dose of Vidaza®.

      The total duration of the study for each patient will be up to 56 days including the
      Screening period and Post Study Visit.
