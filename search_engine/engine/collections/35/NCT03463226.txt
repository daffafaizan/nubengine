    
      One hundred and fifty six patients have been enrolled so far. Methods were as described
      below:

        -  Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was directly recorded from the peroneal nerve
           using the microneurography technique ;

        -  All patients underwent symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test performed on a
           cycle ergometer, using a ramp protocol with workload increments of 5 or 10 Watts per
           minute;

        -  Body composition measurements were performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
           (DXA);

        -  Muscle strength was assessed by handgrip dynamometer using the mean value of three
           attempts;

        -  Blood samples were drawn in the morning after 12h overnight fasting. The laboratory
           tests included B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; pg/mL) plasma level, serum sodium
           (mEq/L), serum potassium (mEq/L), creatinine (mg/dL), haemoglobin level (g/dL),
           high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP; mg/L), lipid profile (triglyceride, total
           cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein; mg/dL), and fasting
           glucose (mg/dL). Blood sample to assess hormone plasma levels were also drawn at the
           same time: total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), sex hormone binding globulin
           (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), luteinizing hormone (LH),
           follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and insulin-like
           growth factor 1 (IGF1).
