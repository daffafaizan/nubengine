    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in subjects
      with Bipolar 1 Disorder or Schizophrenia who have a history of suboptimal aderence and are
      currently on treatment with oral aripiprazole. This will be an open-label observational pilot
      trial to compare the PK profile of aripiprazole at Visit 1 of subjects who are receiving oral
      aripiprazole and who have the potential for suboptimal adherent behavior with their assigned
      medication.

      Information obtained in the current trial will be used to inform the conduct of a randomized,
      open-label, parallel-group trial to assess between-group change from baseline adherence using
      PK sampling in subjects receiving oral aripiprazole with or without the MIND1 System
      (Protocol 316-13-211).
