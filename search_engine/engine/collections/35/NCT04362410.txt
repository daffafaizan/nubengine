    
      This is a Phase 1, single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose,
      parallel group study in healthy Chinese male or female subjects. 48 healthy subjects will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three treatment cohorts (i.e. 1:1:1 to Low dose, Medium dose
      and High dose) to receive a single dose of tezepelumab or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Each
      subject will only participate in one cohort. Dose level is unblinded and treatment
      (tezepelumab or placebo) will be double-blinded within each treatment cohort. Following a
      screening period of a maximum of 28 days, subjects will stay at the study facility for two
      nights starting from the day before dosing (Day -1) to Day 2. Subjects will receive a single
      dose of tezepelumab or placebo subcutaneously on Day 1 and safety monitoring and serial
      collection of blood samples for PK evaluation will be followed throughout the study period.
      The follow up period after the dosing will be 112 days.
