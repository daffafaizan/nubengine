      whether daily 4% chlorhexidine cord cleansing is more effective than dry cord care for the
      prevention of neonatal deaths and omphalitis (umbilical cord infection) in Southern Province,
      Zambia. Secondary goals are to 1) compare where pregnant women plan to deliver and where they
      actually deliver, and 2) to describe the health services network available to pregnant and
      postpartum women in case of serious illness among the women and their newborn infants.

      Clusters consisting of individual health centers and their respective catchment areas will be
      assigned to one of two arms. In the intervention clusters, mothers will apply 4%
      chlorhexidine to their infants daily until 3 days after the cord completely separates.
      Mothers in the control clusters will use dry cord care as per normal routine standard of care
      and in accordance with Zambia Ministry of Health policy.

      In order to achieve the 4th Millennium Development Goal of reducing child mortality by
      two-thirds, simple, inexpensive, and scalable interventions are required. If the use of a 4%
      chlorhexidine umbilical cord wash effectively reduces neonatal mortality, this will be a
      low-cost intervention that can be easily translated from a research project into a program
      for countrywide implementation in Zambia. These results will also add to the limited evidence
      base about the effectiveness of interventions for reduction of neonatal mortality in
      sub-Saharan Africa.
