      in treating hyponatremia and the signs and symptoms of water retention associated with HF,
      liver cirrhosis with ascites (LCWA) and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
      (SIADH). Lixivaptan was previously evaluated in disease states characterized by hyponatremia
      with euvolemia (SIADH)and hyponatremia combined with fluid overload (HF, LCWA). Lixivaptan
      resulted in correction in hyponatremia together with a marked aquaresis in subject with
      volume overload. The present study is designed to confirm and extend the observation from
      previous studies that lixivaptan therapy corrects hyponatremia, in euvolemic subject,
      including subjects with SIDH.
