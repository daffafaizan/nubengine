      wire into the bile duct can result in the pancreas duct being entered instead. When this
      happens, the doctor may either remove the wire (known as "single wire" technique) or leave it
      in and use a second wire ("double wire") to enter the bile duct. This study will try to
      determine whether the "double wire" technique or the "single wire" technique removing the
      wire is the safest and most efficient.
