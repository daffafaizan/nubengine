    
      Method 27 patients with sepsis less than 24 hours, admitted in ICU, 16- 60 years old, male
      and female, randomized divided two groups(P=12, S=15) study in randomized clinical trial.

      Inclusion criteria:

      A: At least 3 of SIRS criteria;

        1. 36> Tem> 38 ◦c

        2. HR>90 bpm (without medication)

        3. RR>20 bpm or PaCo2≤ 32 on mechanical ventilation

        4. WBC<4000 or >12000 or > 10% immature neutrophil

      B: Documented diagnosis of sepsis (separation organism from blood, urine, CSF, secretions
      such as trachea and sore) or strong suspect for infection with at least one of following:

        1. WBC in sterile area,

        2. Perforated viscera,

        3. Radiological evidences of pneumonia,

        4. High risk of infection such as cholangitis. Severity of disease is appointed with APACHE
           II (on result of laboratories in last 24 hours)

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Pass more than 24 hours from diagnosis of sepsis.

        2. High likelihood of mortality (renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, ….) or imminent
           death(APACHE II score >25)

        3. Pregnant or lactescent woman

        4. 16 > age years old

        5. No satisfaction of patient

      Treatments of S group include:

        1. Early goal - directed resuscitation

        2. Appropriate diagnostic studies prior to antibiotics

        3. Early broad - spectrum antibiotics

        4. Narrowing antibiotic therapy based on microbial therapy and clinical data

        5. Source control

        6. Stress dose steroids for septic shock

        7. Target Hb values of 7-9 g/dl in absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage

        8. Lung protective ventilation for ALI/ARDS

        9. Avoidance of Neuromuscular blockade

       10. Maintenance of blood glucose < 150mg/dl

       11. DVT/stress ulcer prophylaxis

      In plasmapheresis (P) group, plasmapheresis will add into conventional therapy which is
      mentioned above. volume of plasmapheresis is 20-40 ml/Kg with five time in a week (distance
      24-48 hours) that will do with speed of 60-120 ml/min through of central venous catheter.

      Steps of plasmapheresis:

        1. calculation of plasma volume

        2. PT, PTT, Plt before and after plasmapheresis

        3. Replacement plasma with albumin 20% and/or normal saline

        4. Check of serum calcium before and after plasmapheresis. Injection of calcium gluconate
           10%.

        5. Stop of all of drugs (except vasopressor)

        6. Cardiovascular monitoring during plasmapheresis

        7. Infusion of heparin 500 u/h Demographic characters of patients (age, sex, weight, BMI)
           will record. Central venous, arterial line and Foley catheter will insert. For all of
           patients will do follow assays daily: CVP, BP, ABG, BUN, Cr, Na, K, CBC, PLT, PT, PTT,
           U/A, P, Ca, Mg, Chest X Ray. LFT and Alb

      Level of biomarkers evaluate at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 14th day of study. In P group,
      evaluation will do before and after of plasmapheresis. Biomarkers include:

        1. TNF-α (early release cytokine)(plasma)

        2. IL-1 (early release cytokine)(plasma)

        3. IL-6 (pro & anti-inflammatory cytokine)(plasma) Patient will evaluate for 14 days or
           until death. Patient's morbidity will record until 30 days.

      Evaluation of morbidity will do by scoring systems:

        -  TISS score (Therapeutic intervention scoring system): for evaluation of severity of
           care.

        -  SOFA score (Sepsis- related organ function assessment): for evaluation of organ
           function.

        -  ADL score (Activities of daily living) Recorded information will analyze by t- test for
           quantitative variables and χ 2 square for qualitative variables, with α = 0/05.
