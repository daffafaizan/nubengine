      patients with cirrhosis. However, risk of HCC incidence is not the same for different
      patients. The study aimed to develop a scoring system to assess risk of developing HCC in a
      large cohort of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis (F3) or
      cirrhosis (F4) with sustained virological response (SVR) after receiving direct acting
      antivirals (DAAs).
