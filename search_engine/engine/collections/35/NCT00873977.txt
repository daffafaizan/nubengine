      morbidity, including excessive daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
      Although Continuous Pressure Airway Pressure (CPAP) is effective treatment of objective and
      subjective complaints, adherence to CPAP therapy is suboptimal. Recently, pressure-relief
      CPAP (C-flex,A-flex; Respironics; Murrysville, PA) is available. The present study is
      single-blind,prospective, randomised, crossover study to compare the adherence and effects of
      therapy with C-flex, A-flex, and autoadjusting CPAP after 3 months of CPAP treatment.

      Additionally, after 3 months of CPAP treatment, the patients who treated with C-flex and
      A-flex will crossovered, we will acess to change of adherence and effects of CPAP treatment.
