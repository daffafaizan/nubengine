    
      Subjects will undergo a total of up to 5 FLT PET scans.

      Subjects are randomized between two groups to reduce radiation exposure from the FLT PET
      scans. If bone marrow activity is not identified in one scan, further scans are cancelled
      until the 1-month follow up scan. This is not a randomization to compare therapeutic efficacy
      between two study arms. Data will be pooled for analysis as pre-specified in the study's
      statistical plan.

      Group 1 has FLT PET scans pretreatment, after 5 radiation treatments, after 10 radiation
      treatments, after 15 radiation treatments, and then 1 month after completing radiation
      therapy.

      Group 2 has FLT PET scans pretreatment, after 5 radiation treatments, after 10 radiation
      treatments, after 20 radiation treatments, and then 1 month after completing radiation
      therapy.
