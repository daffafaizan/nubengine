      many diseases. Existing clinical trials were unable to provide scientific evidence by using
      the highest international standards to justify the efficiency of thermal waters. Hark√°ny
      medicinal water has been used for rheumatic, skin and locomotor diseases for more than 100
      years. Its beneficial effects are indisputable. However, to introduce these effects,
      internationally high-level scientific methods and investigations are needed.

      Psoriasis is among the most common dermatological diseases worldwide. Its significance is
      emphasized by adverse effects on quality of life, caused by chronic pain, physical and
      psychical disability due to psoriatic plaques. Former studies revealed an increased risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Moreover,
      excessive oxidative stress can be responsible for the onset of psoriasis complications.

      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease responsible for significant morbidity,
      characterized by articular inflammation. Oxidative stress is a key marker for determining
      pathophysiology of patients with RA.

      The pathophysiological link between these conditions is the presence of excessive oxidative
      stress.

      Subjective methods will include questionnaires, objective markers of disease severity will
      include the measurement of biomarkers from blood samples.
