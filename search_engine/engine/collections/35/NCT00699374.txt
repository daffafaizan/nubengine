      events in the sunitinib arm compared to the sorafenib arm, and the fact that sunitinib did
      not meet the criteria to demonstrate that it was either superior or non-inferior to sorafenib
      in the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer. Patients on sunitinib who
      are judged by the investigator as receiving clinical benefit may chose to remain on study and
      continue treatment with sunitinib until clinical benefit as per the investigator's judgment.
