    
      This is a large 1000 patient single arm observational study being conducted to determine the
      impact of ethnic origin (Caucasian, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Hispanics) on
      patients being treated for 2nd line advanced NSCLC with pemetrexed given in routine clinical
      practice. Data will be collected on disease control rate by pemetrexed as defined by Response
      Rate (RR) (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)), Stable Disease (SD) and
      toxicities. In addition, overall survival, progression-free survival, treatment toxicities,
      activities of daily living, symptom burden and resource utilization will also be observed. To
      meet the study goals, a total of 400 Caucasians, 200 African- Americans, 200 Asian-Americans,
      and 200 Hispanics will be accrued to this study.
