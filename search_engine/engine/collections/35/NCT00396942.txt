      The aims of the present study are to:

        1. Clarify that the altered plasticity of the primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with
           Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with impaired motor learning by using the paired
           associative stimulation (PAS) technique, which can enhance or inhibit the M1
           excitability with paired stimulation to the contralateral peripheral nerve and cerebral
           cortex.

        2. Elucidate that the altered plasticity of the M1 in patients with PD goes together with
           impaired sensorimotor integration via the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop.

      Study population

      12 right-handed patients with PD

      12 right-handed age-matched healthy volunteers

      Design

      Patients and age-matched healthy volunteers will complete five different sessions: Visit 1:
      clinical screening; Visit 2: motor learning session; Visit 3 and 4: the paired associative
      stimulation (PAS) sessions; Visit 5: the control session.

      During the motor learning session, subjects will be asked to perform metronome-paced pinch of
      their index finger and thumb.

      During the PAS sessions, they will receive 20 minutes of paired stimulation to the
      contralateral peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at the
      appropriate timing for producing changes of the M1 excitability.

      During the control session, they will receive 20 minutes of repetitive TMS without the
      peripheral nerve stimulation.

      Outcome measures

      For the motor learning session:

        -  peak acceleration (MPA) of thumb movement

        -  maximal peak force (MPF) between the index finger and thumb

      For the PAS and control sessions:

        -  peak-to-peak motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude

        -  resting motor threshold

        -  afferent inhibition

        -  event related desynchronization (ERD) and event related synchronization (ERS)
