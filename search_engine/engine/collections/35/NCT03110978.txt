    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Event-free survival (EFS), with events defined as local recurrence, regional recurrence,
      distant metastasis, secondary malignancy (including lung cancer), and death.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Toxicity related to stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy [SABR]) and immunotherapy.

      III. Exploratory analyses of potential predictive markers and immunologic mechanisms of
      action.

      EXPLORATORY/TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify candidate tumor-associated antigens or genes that elicit cellular and humoral
      immune responses in serum samples (with Immunotherapy Platform).

      II. Assess PDL1 expression in tumor biopsy specimens (with Department of Pathology).

      III. Identify potential radiomics features from positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that may predict treatment response
      and toxicity (with Department of Radiation Physics).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy over 1-2 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy over 1-2 weeks. Beginning within
      36 hours before or after the first fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, patients
      also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles with nivolumab
      repeat every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for up to 3 years, then annually thereafter.
