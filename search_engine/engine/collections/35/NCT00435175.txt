      muscle power is seen after menopause, readily counteracted by female hormone therapy (HT).
      Treatment with HT through months to previously untreated postmenopausal women, or hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) to women with Turner syndrome, increases muscle mass and reduces
      fat mass. HT in postmenopausal women furthermore prevents fat accumulation and increases
      lipoprotein lipase activity and lipolysis to an extent comparable to premenopausal women. In
      contrast, it has also been shown that estradiol may actually attenuate lipolysis during basal
      as well as catecholamine stimulated conditions. In addition, one study found whole body fat
      metabolism to be lower during treatment with estradiol than without, and reduced lipolysis is
      present in postmenopausal women during treatment with estradiol, along with an increased
      number of α-adrenergic receptors and a decreased number of β-adrenergic receptors.

      It is not clear whether the lipolytic effect of estradiol happens acutely or is dependent on
      chronic exposure. Moreover, regional differences in the pharmacodynamics of estradiol have
      not been assessed. Finally, effects on skeletal muscle have never been examined.

      The purpose of the present study was 1) by microdialysis to quantify the regional production
      of glycerol in two tissues (muscle and fat), and in two regions (abdominal and femoral). 2)
      To quantify the whole-body lipolytic effect of estradiol, and 3) in biopsies to study
      intracellular mechanisms behind the action of estradiol.
