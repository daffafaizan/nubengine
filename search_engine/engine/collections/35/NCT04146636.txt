      simple parameters and easy "by head" calculation. Using the recommended cut-offs (eLIFT â‰¥8),
      eLIFT sensitivity was 86%. This result position eLIFT an as interesting tool for the
      screening of advanced liver fibrosis in large populations.

      As our preliminary results come from very selected patients, i.e. patients from tertiary
      centres who underwent a liver biopsy, we now need to evaluate in the real condition of
      primary care setting whether the use of eLIFT will help general practitioners to screen
      advanced liver fibrosis in their asymptomatic NAFLD and alcoholic patients.
