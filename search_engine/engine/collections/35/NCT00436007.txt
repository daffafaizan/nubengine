      regimens for the malaria candidate vaccine 257049 integration into EPI. The co-administered
      EPI vaccines include GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™, a measles vaccine (depending
      on the supply availability), Aventis Pasteur's Yellow Fever vaccine Stamaril™ and GSK
      Biologicals' Oral Polio vaccine Polio Sabin™. Tuberculosis vaccine (Bacillus of Calmette and
      Guerin, BCG) will be administered according to national medical practice and will not be
      administered as part of this protocol, but will be documented.
