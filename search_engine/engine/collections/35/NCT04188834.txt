      disorders, including Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), depression, and
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). However, current means to non-invasively modulate brain
      activity are limited.

      The study will evaluate whether sensory flicker can modulate neural activity of deep brain
      regions in humans, and whether it can have relevant effects on behavior. Moreover, it will
      compare those effects to the gold-standard method of modulating brain circuits, direct
      electrical stimulation of the brain (the same mechanism as deep brain stimulation), using a
      powerful within-subjects design.
