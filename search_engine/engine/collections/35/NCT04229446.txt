      living at different wards at eight nursing homes.

        1. About 12 nursing homes are selected to participate in Trondheim and in Oslo.

        2. All patients at the included nursing homes will be screened with respect to dementia and
           pain (see screening tools later). If patients have dementia and report pain (â‰¥3 on MOBID
           2) they will be included in the intervention part of the study (n=240).

        3. The included patients will then have a clinical examination of pain and pain management
           by expert physicians (see below). Evaluation of the use of analgesics and
           psychopharmacological medication will be performed. Inappropriate medication (both too
           much and too little) will be corrected in collaboration with the nursing home doctor.

        4. In addition to the clinical examination of pain, the investigators will measure total
           daily physical activity, ADL, QOL, and neuropsychiatric symptoms on all included
           patients.

        5. After the pre-test - a randomization of the wards into intervention wards or control
           wards will be performed.

        6. About five staff members at each of the wards randomized to the intervention group will
           receive education in the MBC before intervention.

        7. A post-test just after the intervention has ended, pain, total daily physical activity,
           ADL, QOL, and neuropsychiatric symptoms will be measured.
