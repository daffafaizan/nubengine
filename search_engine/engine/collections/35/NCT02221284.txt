    
      This survey was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of alogliptin
      tablets (Nesina Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients who have had an inadequate response to
      hypoglycemic agents (e.g., insulin preparations or rapid-acting insulin secretagogues) in
      addition to dietary/exercise therapy. Participants will receive alogliptin as part of routine
      medical care.

      For adults, 25 mg of alogliptin is usually administered orally once daily.
