        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and alemtuzumab
           in patients with recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergoing HLA-matched
           allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

        -  Conditioning: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2,
           cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5, and alemtuzumab IV on days -4 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic transplantation: Allogeneic stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients receive
           graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis with tacrolimus IV or orally for approximately 30
           days.

      Patients are followed weekly for 100 days and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months
      after transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 with HLA-identical related donors and 10 with
      matched unrelated donors) will be accrued for this study.
