    
      Treatment Plan:

      7.5 Gy x 10 daily fractions delivered with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or regular
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

        -  Optional schedule of 12 Gy x 5 daily fractions can may also be used ONLY in situations
           where dose constraints for organs at risk can be EASILY met while optimal planning
           target volume (PTV) coverage is achieved; but the 7.5 Gy x 10 daily fractions schedule
           is preferred.

        -  All doses are prescribed to the tumor periphery.

      For this protocol, patients will be followed only up to 2 years post radiation therapy.
