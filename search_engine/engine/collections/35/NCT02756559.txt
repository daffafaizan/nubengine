      investigators collected samples in emergency intensive care unit (EICU), surgical intensive
      care unit (SICU) and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) between July 2014 to March 2015.
      Septic patients were divided into sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock according to the
      diagnostic criteria. Peripheral white blood cells were sorted into monocytes, lymphocytes and
      neutrophils by using flow cytometry (Flow Cytometry, FCM). Jurkat T cell lines were purchased
      from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Institute of basic medical sciences. miRNAs agomirs
      and antagonists were used to establish miR-223, miR-15a, miR-16 overexpression and knock-out
      transient transfection cell lines. Western blot was used to detect difference expression of
      protein expression.
