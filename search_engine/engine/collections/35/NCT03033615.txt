      an additional 5 minutes of imaging using very low-dose radiation prior to the
      conventional-dose CT scan. The prospective review will be performed in two cohorts: Chest CT
      scans and abdominal CT scans.

      Anonymized images will be processed by conventional CT software and compared to the same
      images processed with machine-learning-based PixelShine. A board-certified radiologist will
      assess the noise and visual quality of the imaging data.

      Study patients will receive approximately 10% more dose than a standard CT scan by
      participating in the study. There are no known short-term safety issues associated with this
      study. The study-related very low dose radiation is at a level far below that used for
      conventional x-ray imaging. The study has been approved by the Radiation Safety Committee as
      part of the review process.
