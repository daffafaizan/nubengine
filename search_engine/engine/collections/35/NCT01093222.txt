      I. To assess the progression-free survival in patients with unresectable or metastatic
      gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma treated with the combination of sorafenib
      (sorafenib tosylate) and erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      II. To assess the overall survival in patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder
      carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma treated with the combination of sorafenib and erlotinib.

      III. To assess the objective response rate. IV. To assess the frequency and severity of
      toxicities. V. To collect specimens for banking for future research.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily and erlotinib hydrochloride PO
      once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
