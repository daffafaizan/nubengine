      participants being fitted with the F&P trial nasal mask for use in-home.

      The participant will then come in to return the mask (Visit Three) and have a final
      interview, this ensures the maximum time participants will be exposed to the trial mask in
      home will be 14 Â± 4 days from visit two.

      The mask will be returned to the Institution at the conclusion of the trial and the
      participant will return to their previous mask. The Institution will recruit all patients
      within 1 week of the beginning of the study.
