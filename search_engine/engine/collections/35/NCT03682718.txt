      induced. Any induction method is likely to be effective in a woman with a favorable cervix,
      whereas no method is highly successful when performed in a woman with a cervix that is
      unfavorable.

      The use of a balloon catheter as induction method was first described in 1862 by Trainer. The
      goal of the catheter was to ripen the cervix through direct mechanical dilatation of the
      cervical canal and indirectly by increasing endogenous prostaglandin secretion.

      Alternatively, Prostaglandins are one of the key players in cervical ripening by a number of
      different mechanisms.

      The aim of present study is to compare the safety and efficacy of vaginal misoprostol versus
      the combination of vaginal misoprostol and intracervical Foley catheter in induction of labor
      at term pregnancy.
