      at Heidelberger Ionenstrahl-Therapie (HIT) centre as monocentric trial.

      Proton therapy is the gold standard in the treatment of skull base chordomas. However,
      high-LET beams such as carbon ions theoretically offer biologic advantages by enhanced
      biologic effectiveness in slow-growing tumors. Up until now it was impossible to compare two
      different particle therapies, i.e. proton and carbon ion therapy directly with each other.
      The aim of this study is to find out, whether the biological advantages of carbon ion therapy
      mentioned above can also be clinically confirmed.

      Patients with skull base chordoma will be randomised to either proton or carbon ion radiation
      therapy. As a standard, patients will undergo non-invasive, rigid immobilization and target
      volume delineation will be carried out based on CT and MRI data. The biologically
      isoeffective target dose to the PTV in carbon ion treatment (accelerated dose) will be 63 Gy
      E ± 5% and 72 Gy E ± 5% (standard dose) in proton therapy respectively. Local-progression
      free survival (LPFS) will be analysed as primary end point. Toxicity and survival are the
      secondary end points. Also matters of interest are patterns of recurrence, prognostic factors
      and plan quality.
