      I. Assess the frequency and degree of hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with potential serum/plasma markers of
      hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      III. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tissue markers of hypoxia in patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer.

      IV. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tumor angiogenesis in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      V. Correlated hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with apoptosis in patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      VI. Measure and characterize tumor perfusion in relationship to hypoxia in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      VII. Correlate tumor perfusion to microvessel density in tumor samples in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      VIII. Determine the longevity of EF5 adducts in human lung tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive EF5 intravenously (IV) over 1-2.5 hours. Beginning 24-55 hours later,
      patients undergo tumor hypoxia measurement using a polarographic needle electrode and
      intraoperative tumor measurement before undergoing surgical biopsy or resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.
