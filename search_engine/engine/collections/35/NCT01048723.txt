    
      A single-arm, open label, proof of principle phase II study exploring the efficacy of RAD001
      in resectable soft tissue sarcomas either in the extremities, trunk or retroperitoneum.
      Patients with resectable sarcomas as detailed below were to have a core biopsy for molecular
      markers prior to therapy with RAD001 10mg PO daily x 2 weeks. Within 7-14 days of the end of
      therapy with RAD001, the patients were to be brought to surgery for definitive resection or,
      should they be candidates for neoadjuvant radiation, would have 6 16 gauge core biopsies
      taken percutaneously or using image guidance. Pharmacodynamic markers as detailed in the
      objectives were to be assessed in the laboratory.

      Patients were to be numbered sequentially from 1 to 40, or more if there were patients that
      dropped out due to drug toxicity, with the goal of achieving 40 patients in accrual for
      evaluation of the pre- and post-treatment tumor samples for Pharmacodynamic assays.
