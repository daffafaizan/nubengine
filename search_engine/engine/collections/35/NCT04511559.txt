      and mortality rates. Surgery is the conventional treatment option for early and intermediate
      stage gastric cancer, but the diagnosis in the early stage of gastric cancer remains a
      challenge to clinical practitioners. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is tumor-derived
      fragmented DNA with an average size of 166 bp, mixed with cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of other
      sources in blood circulation. ctDNA is reflecting the most up-to-date status of the tumor
      genome. Hence, it is considered as a novel biomarker for tumors, which can be qualitative,
      quantitative, and used for disease monitoring. This study is designed to evaluate the
      potential clinical utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a clinical index in the
      diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer. The primary purpose of this trial is to describe
      the profile of ctDNA methylation in gastric cancer. The second purpose is to demonstrate the
      correlation between the plasma ctDNA methylation status and the diagnosis and prognosis of
      patients with early and intermediate stage gastric cancer.
