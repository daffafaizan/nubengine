    
      Treatment Plan: Interventions involve 3 components, Massage Therapy, Humor Therapy, and
      Relaxation Therapy, as described below:

      Massage Therapy Patient and parents will meet with a licensed massage therapist at the time
      of admission. During the session, the therapist will introduce them to the rationale of the
      massage intervention before moving on to provide the initial massage session. Each session
      will last approximately 1/2 hour. Massage sessions will be scheduled 3x/week from admission
      through week +3.

      Humor Therapy For this component will utilize a humor cart, stocked with humorous video
      shorts, books, gags, props and games.

      Relaxation Therapy In the initial session held near the time of admission, parents will meet
      with the RA therapist, who will describe relaxation response and the benefits of a regular
      practice of relaxation techniques. They will be led through a modified progressive muscle
      relaxation induction, using breath awareness and muscle release, followed by guided imagery.
