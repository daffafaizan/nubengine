      medical histories. Participants will be asked to return for a follow-up visit after two
      years. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data will be collected. Registry resources will
      be made available to researchers and medical practitioners to support a broad range of
      research on the causes, diagnosis, mechanisms, and treatment of APS.

      The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the coordinating center and an enrollment
      site for the registry. There are seven other enrollment sites: Ball Memorial Hospital,
      Muncie, IN; Duke University, Durham, NC; Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY; Johns
      Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA; University of
      Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX; and University of Utah Health Science Center,
      Salt Lake City, UT.
