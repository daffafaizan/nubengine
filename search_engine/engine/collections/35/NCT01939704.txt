    
      We are proposing a 4-arm, 18 month randomized control clinical trial to address social
      determinants of health, improve health status and health care satisfaction, and change health
      care utilization patterns in the Pediatric Urgent Care and Primary Care Clinics at San
      Francisco General Hospital. We will compare our CCLiP protocol to standard of care in both
      the Pediatric Primary Care Clinic & Urgent Care. All arms (intervention and control) include
      a baseline survey including social needs assessment, health care status, health care
      satisfaction and health care utilization assessment; and two telephone-based follow up
      surveys at 3 and 6 months. Patients in the intervention arms (whether in urgent care or
      primary care) will receive a maximum of 3 months of intervention protocol which includes a 30
      minute on-site intervention at time of enrollment in addition to twice monthly follow-up
      phone calls for up to 3 months to help address social needs. Patients in all arms will
      receive 3 and 6-month follow up surveys.
