      anxiety and injuries from seizures. For such individuals, ideal treatments should improve
      quality of life through control of seizures and improved emotional state. Meditation with
      cultivation of emotional balance is known to improve emotional state and may also benefit
      seizure control in some individuals. In this study, individuals with uncontrolled epilepsy
      will receive detailed training in meditation to determine whether the training leads to
      improvements in seizure control and various measures of emotion and quality of life.
