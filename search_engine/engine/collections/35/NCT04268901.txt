      children during painful medical procedures (e.g., venipuncture, IV placement). Recent
      technological developments in the area of virtual reality (VR) provide new and potentially
      more effective ways of distracting children from the pain and anxiety associated with medical
      procedures. While initial studies of VR pain distraction are promising, few have studied the
      effectiveness of the technology in children, using a multi-method approach. The current study
      aims to recruit 240 children ages 7-21 and their caregivers who arrive at the hospital for an
      outpatient painful medical procedure. Children and their parents will be randomly assigned to
      one of two treatment conditions: 1) existing hospital standard of care or 2) standard of care
      plus distraction via VR. Children and caregivers will be asked to complete measures assessing
      pain and anxiety both before and after the procedure. In addition, objective measures of
      child pain and distress during the medical procedure will be taken using coding of
      behavioral/verbal expressions. Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used to
      compare differences in primary and secondary outcome variables in VR + standard of care to
      standard of care only conditions when pre and post-operative measures are available.
      Univariate ANOVA will be used to compare conditions on post-operative variables.
