      microbiota composition of critically ill children in paediatric intensive care unit and its
      relationship with clinical complications and inflammatory biomarkers.

      DESIGN: This study is a multicentre, observational and prospective study including 100
      critically ill children admitted in three paediatric intensive care units (Hospital
      Materno-Infantil Torrecárdenas de Almería, y en el Hospital Materno-Infantil Carlos Haya de
      Málaga and Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago) This study is a multicentre,
      observational and prospective study conducted by members of the Department of Biochemistry
      and Molecular Biology II, Nutrition and Food Technology Institute "José Mataix" of the
      University of Granada research group in collaboration with the Hospital Materno-Infantil
      Torrecárdenas from Almería, the Hospital Materno-Infantil Carlos Haya from Málaga and
      Complejo Hospitalario Universitario from Santiago de Compostela pediatric intensive care
      units and primary care unit of the University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves from Granada as
      recruitment centres.

      This trial will include 100 critically ill children admitted from the three different
      pediatric intensive care units with an expected hospitalization time of more than 5 days. In
      addition, 50 healthy children will be recruited from a primary care centre as controls.
      Faecal and respiratory system (oropharynx) samples will be collected from ill and healthy
      children, while blood samples will be harvested only from critically ill children at the time
      of admission to the pediatric intensive care units as well as at the day of discharge. Sample
      aliquots will be sent to the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II, University
      of Granada for further analysis.

      Study population The study population will comprise 50 healthy children aged between 1 month
      and 16 years, recruited in a paediatric primary care center from Granada, and 100 critically
      ill children admitted to the pediatric intensive care units aged between 1 month and 16
      years. 50 patients will be recruited at the pediatric intensive care units of Hospital
      Materno-Infantil Torrecárdenas from Almería, the Hospital Materno-Infantil Carlos Haya from
