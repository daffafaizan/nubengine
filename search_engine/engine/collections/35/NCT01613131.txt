      Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that low dose estrogen therapy in concert with the low doses of
      levonorgestrel that circulate when Mirena is used will suppress ovulation in perimenopausal
      women.

      Aim 2: To examine ovulation rates and symptom control with Mirena alone, and to assess the
      tolerability of combined estrogen therapy plus the Mirena IUS as a treatment option for
      symptomatic perimenopausal women.

      The proposed pilot study is designed to test the feasibility and tolerability of the proposed
      regimens: Mirena alone or Mirena plus low-dose TDE in treating symptoms in perimenopausal
      women and to provide the preliminary data for a larger, comparative effectiveness study of
      optimal symptom control and provision of long term contraception for midlife women within 5
      years of their final menstrual period.
