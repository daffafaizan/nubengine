      perform the necessary circulation of blood through the body. This can result in symptoms like
      shortness of breath at rest or with minimal activity. Advanced heart failure is one of the
      leading causes of hospitalization and deaths in the United States. This is a prospective
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group, multicenter study of the
      effectiveness of Nesiritide administered as serial infusions in the outpatient setting.
      Patients enrolled in this study will receive nesiritide or placebo for up to 12 weeks.
      Patients will then be followed for an additional 12 weeks. During the the first 17 weeks of
      the study patients will have multiple laboratory tests, have their vital signs (blood
      pressure and heart rate) assessed, and complete quality of life questionnaires. During the
      last few weeks of the study patients will be contacted to inquire how they are doing. The
      study hypothesis is that compared to placebo plus standard care, Nesiritide plus standard
      will reduce time to death or first occurrence of hospitalization due to heart or kidney
      problems. Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests and vital signs at various time points throughout the study. The patients
      assigned to the nesiritide group will receive a single 2.0mcg/kg bolus (one time injection)
      followed by serial IV infusions (4 to 6 hours) at a standard flow rate of 0.010 mcg/kg/min
      once or twice per week for 12 weeks. The patients assigned to the placebo group will receive
      matching placebo.
