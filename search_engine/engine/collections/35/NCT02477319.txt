      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Over 1,900 mutations,
      categorized into five genotypic or functional classes are implicated in causing CF. Severity
      of disease varies widely in CF based on CFTR-dependent and independent factors. Progressive
      obstructive lung disease is the main determinant of morbidity and mortality in CF; therefore
      it is critical to identify biomarker profiles that reflect and predict this phenotypic
      variability, and understand their relationship to residual CFTR activity. Emerging CFTR
      modulator therapies that directly target defective CFTR are being evaluated in pivotal
      clinical trials and may become available in the next few years. It is not known how partial
      restoration of CFTR function might impact CF disease progression and disease-related
      biomarkers. Thus there is urgent need to i) identify and validate biomarkers that might
      reflect partial restoration of CFTR function and can be used to monitor disease progression,
      and ii) evaluate the mechanistic effects of CFTR modulators and other relevant therapies in
      individuals with CF
