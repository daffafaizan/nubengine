      study. It consists of 3 phases: a screening phase beginning within 21 days before the first
      study drug administration; an open label treatment phase consisting of 2 treatment periods
      (Period 1 and Period 2), during which patients will receive 2 single doses of 3 mg
      paliperidone ER; and end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study procedures in
      Period 2 or at early withdrawal. All volunteers will receive each of the following 2
      treatments in random order: Treatment A: 1 tablet of 3 mg paliperidone ER in the fasted
      state; Treatment B: one 20 mg paroxetine tablet once a day from Day 1 to Day 13 and 1 tablet
      of 3 mg paliperidone ER on Day 10 in the fasted state. Successive paliperidone ER
      administrations will be separated by a washout period of at least 14 days and no more than 28
      days. Paroxetine is a potent and selective CYP2D6 inhibitor. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as
      paroxetine have been reported to increase the plasma concentrations of antipsychotics such as
      perphenazine, clozapine, and risperidone. Because paliperidone ER and paroxetine could
      potentially be used in combination in schizophrenic patients, the potential for a drug-drug
      interaction between paroxetine and paliperidone ER needs to be explored.The safety and
      tolerability of the 3 mg tablet of paliperidone ER administered with and without paroxetine
      to healthy men will be monitored.

      Two single oral doses of paliperidone ER 3-mg; 20-mg paroxetine orally once a day for 13 days
