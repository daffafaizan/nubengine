    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab plus
      Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy in patients with Initial Unresectable or potentially resectable
      proximal Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma. 33 participants with
      Initial Unresectable locally advanced proximal gastric carcinoma /Gastroesophageal Junction
      (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma (Siewert type II/III) will be treated with conversion therapy as below
      once recruited:

        1. induction chemotherapy (3w): one cycle of camrelizumab 200mg q3w and SOX regimen
           (oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1, Q3w + S-1 40-60mg bid, d1-d14,Q3w);

        2. after the induction, concurrent Chemoradiotherapy will be started (5-6w): intensity
           modulated radiotherapy was given for tumors and high-risk lymphatic drainage areas,
           total dose:45Gy/25d, 1.8Gy/d, camrelizumab 200mg q3w, S-1 40-60mg bid, d1-d14, Q3w. The
           resectability assessment will be performed followed by MDT.

        3. Participants still unresectable will receive additional conversion therapy with
           camrelizumab and SOX regimen. The resectability will be evaluated every 6 weeks until
           resectable or up to 8 cycles of conversion therapy.

      Resectable patients will receive D2 resection.
