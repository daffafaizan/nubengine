      soon as feasible after randomization to a HOBIT study arm, but no later than 24 hours from
      injury. Subsequent biospecimens will be obtained every 8 hours (+/- 1 hour) for the first 24
      hours post-enrollment. This will allow the characterization of acute changes in biomarker
      levels. On study days 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 biospecimens will be obtained once a day to allow
      characterization of sub-acute changes in biomarker levels. If feasible, samples should be
      collected at 8am (+/- 2 hours) to minimize the effects of circadian rhythm on biomarker
      levels. In addition, during the first 5 days of the study, one set of biospecimen will be
      collected 4 hours after HBO treatment to examine the acute effects of HBO treatment on
      biomarkers. This will not apply to those randomized to non-HBOT groups. During the 6-month
      visit, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of blood will be collected. In addition, for subjects who have an
      external ventricular drain in place, 5 cc of CSF will be collected at each time point if
      feasible. Since subjects are unlikely to have an EVD after the first week post-injury, CSF
      samples will be collected only for as long as the EVD is in place.

      BioHOBIT will utilize data collected in the HOBIT trial. This data includes: demographic data
      and clinical data such as injury characteristics, vital signs, head CT findings, laboratory
      data and data on physiologic parameters such as intracranial pressure (ICP), partial pressure
      of brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cerebral perfusion pressure
      (CPP), among others.
