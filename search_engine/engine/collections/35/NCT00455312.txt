    
      This is an open label, single arm, phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the treatment regimen. Efficacy will be measured by long-term engraftment of
      the transplanted cells.The primary endpoint of neutrophil engraftment is defined as an
      absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >5 x 108/L (first of three consecutive laboratory
      measurements on different days) with at least 10% donor cells by day 100. We will evaluate
      the proportion of success (P) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for the entire group. The
      null hypothesis of 90% engraftment will be rejected if 4 or more patients fail to engraft out
      of 15 evaluable patients. The secondary endpoints of regimen related mortality, acute and
      chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and secondary malignancies will be estimated by
      cumulative incidence treating non-event deaths as a competing risk. Survival will be
      estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Immune reconstitution will be summarized with descriptive
      statistics.

      SAA and DC arms will be analyzed separately.
