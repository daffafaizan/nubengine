      which can be assessed by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is found to be a strong and
      independent predictor of future COPD outcomes. Statins are a class of cholesterol lowering
      drugs that decrease mortality from cardiovascular disease and stroke. In addition, they have
      anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and immunomodulatory properties. Statins lower C-reactive
      protein by the ability to reduce the production of interleukin (IL)-6, the cytokine that
      activates the acute phase CRP response.

      Thus the rationale for this study is to evaluate effect of statins on the levels of CRP and
      ET-1 in COPD patients.
