      mifepristone treatment under Corcept protocol C1073-400 (NCT00569582) will be eligible to
      continue treatment for an additional 1 year. Assessments of safety, as evaluated by physical
      examinations, vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events, will be made. Persistence of
      improvement in response to mifepristone treatment will also be evaluated during this
      extension study by assessing the continued or sustained improvement in the signs and symptoms
      of Cushing's syndrome.
