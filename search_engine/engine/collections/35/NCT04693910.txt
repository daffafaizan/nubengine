      who have only received hormonal therapy will be enrolled. With reference to past research
      findings, self-efficacy theory, and experts' advice, a multimedia hormone therapy information
      program was developed. The multimedia hormone therapy information program covered 6 topics,
      namely the recognition of hormone therapy and multimedia information programs, mindfulness,
      exercise, stress relief, positive thinking, and prevention or reduction of fatigue. A pilot
      study will be conducted to check the feasibility of intervention study design and the
      effectiveness of the program will be tested. Patients will be randomly sorted into an
      experimental group (multimedia information group, n = 36 to 40) and a control group (routine
      care group, n = 36 to 40) after completing a pretest questionnaire. The experimental group
      will receive the multimedia information intervention once per week for 6 consecutive weeks,
      while the control group will receive routine care. The follow-up data collections will be
      completed at 8 and 12 weeks after the pretest. For quantitative measurement, the main
      variables will be social support, self-efficacy, quality of life, positive thinking, and
      satisfaction with program. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) will be used to o analyze
      data.
