        1. Duloxetine will reduce depressive symptomatology over a period of 12 weeks in elderly DD
           patients.

        2. Duloxetine-treated dysthymic patients will have significant improvement in measures of
           overall functioning.

      This pilot trial enrolled 30 patients â‰¥ 60 years old with dysthymic disorder. Patients were
      recruited by clinician referral and by radio or newspaper advertisements that offered free
      evaluation by experienced clinicians for participation in clinical trials in the Adult and
      Late Life Depression Clinic at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. After a telephone
      screen to rule out exclusions for enrollment in the clinic, a psychiatrist conducted a
      detailed evaluation and completed the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS)-Geriatric
      [CIRS-G]. Patients with a provisional clinical diagnosis of dysthymic disorder were
      interviewed by a research rater (social worker or nurse) with the Structured Clinical
      Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)
      Axis I disorders- Patient edition (SCID-P). Based on the psychiatrist's evaluation and the
      SCID-P interview, a consensus DSM-IV diagnosis was made at a staff conference.
