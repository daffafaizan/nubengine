    
      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Study subjects are blinded to their
      randomization to avoid bias. The control group will undergo split thickness autografting
      using the standard protocol, involving injection of lidocaine with epinephrine at the donor
      site. The experimental group will undergo injection of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) at the
      time of harvest of the skin graft. Baseline pain levels will be obtained for all subjects
      using a validated pain assessment scale. Postoperatively, time to first opioid pain
      medication (excluding immediate postoperative recovery from anesthesia), total opioid
      consumption on a daily basis, and donor site interval pain scores using a validated pain
      assessment scale will be obtained. The experimental group will then be compared to the
      control group to determine if there is a significant difference in pain levels, time to first
      opioid, and overall opioid consumption between the two groups.
