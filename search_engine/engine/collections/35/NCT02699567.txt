      bitter, salty and umami (the savory, meaty taste of some amino acids). It is believed that
      these qualities evolved to help us find nutrients (e.g. sweets, umami signaled calories) and
      avoid potential harmful substances (e.g. bitter signalized poison). Despite the fact that
      some fats, which can only be obtained through the diet, are essential for life, fat is not
      considered a basic taste; and, the issue of how fats are precisely sensed is unresolved.
      However, increasing evidence suggests that, in addition to smell and texture, taste plays an
      important role in fat perception. Putative fat taste receptor classes have been identified in
      animal models. One such receptor is the glycoprotein CD36, previously documented to be
      involved in trafficking and storage of fat. CD36 was recently found in rodents' and humans'
      taste buds. In rodents, CD36 deletion blunts specifically fat recognition. Although CD36
      variants are frequent in humans, its role in humans' fat taste perception and preferences
      remains incompletely understood and will be the focus of the current proposal. The main goal
      of this study is to determine the effect of a common human variant in the CD36 gene on fat
      taste perception by using standardized sensory evaluation techniques. In addition, we will
      examine whether common variants in taste related genes (other than CD36) are associated with
      individual differences in the perception of flavors of milkshakes prepared with different
      amounts of fats.
