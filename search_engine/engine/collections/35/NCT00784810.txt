    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, 12-week study to assess the
      efficacy and tolerability of oxycodone/naloxone compared to codeine/paracetamol tablets in
      the treatment of moderate to severe chronic low back pain or moderate to severe pain due to
      OA of the hip and /or knee.

      The screening period will be 3 - 7 days duration. If a subject meets all the screening
      criteria they may enter the Run-in Period.

      During the screening period subjects will continue to take their pre-study pain medication.

      The run-in period will be 7 - 14 days duration. During the run-in period subjects will
      continue to take their pre-study pain medication.

      Visit 3 will occur at the end of the Run-in Period (7-14 days after Visit 2). To qualify for
      entry into the treatment period of the study, subjects must have uncontrolled pain as shown
      by average daily pain scores of >5 on 4 of the last 7 days of the run in period.

      Eligible subjects will be randomised to either oxycodone/naloxone or codeine/paracetamol
      tablets. Subjects will receive double-blind study medication for up to 12 weeks.
