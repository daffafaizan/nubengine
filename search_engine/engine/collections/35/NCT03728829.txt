      China, and neoadjuvant therapy is considered the standard treatment for them. The
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate takes for an indicator for regimens efficacy, and
      the achievement of pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with favorable outcomes
      including disease-free survival and overall survival.

      HER2+ breast cancer represents an invasive and poor prognosis subtype, and the efficacy of
      neoadjuvant therapy for these patients has been greatly augmented by the addition of
      trastuzumab. However, more than 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab
      combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy cannot achieve pCR, even experience primary drug resistance
      and rapid disease progression. Therefore, to explore the genomic features of the population
      that benefited from trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy is of great significance for
      personalized treatment of HER2+ breast cancer, aiming to avoid overtreatment and identify
      clinically actionable mutations for future therapy instructions.
