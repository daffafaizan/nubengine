    
      This is a multi-center randomized study, Phase 2 study. 115 patients were enrolled in Phase
      2. Two regimens were evaluated in Phase 2: a plinabulin monotherapy regimen and a combination
      therapy regimen of plinabulin + pegfilgrastim. The monotherapy regimen includes 4 arms:
      pegfilgrastim 6.0 mg alone; and 10, 20, or 30 mg/m2 plinabulin.

      The combination regimen includes 4 arms: pegfilgrastim 6.0 mg alone; and 20 mg/m2 plinabulin
      + pegfilgrastim 1.5, 3, or 6.0 mg. The pegfilgrastim 6.0 mg alone arm is the control arm for
      comparison with the monotherapy and combination therapy arms for the interim evaluation.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in patients
      with early stage (Stage I and II) and Stage III breast cancer (node positive or node negative
      with high risk of recurrence) receiving docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC)
      and monotherapy plinabulin or combination therapy plinabulin/pegfilgrastim. Severe
      neutropenia is an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 × 10^9/L.

      Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) were used as the chemotherapy in this
      study. These agents are among the most active and commonly used chemotherapeutic agents
      employed for treating patients with breast carcinoma.

      In particular, TAC chemotherapy has been used for the adjuvant treatment of HER2 negative
      early breast cancer patients with node positive disease as well as for node negative breast
      cancer patients who have a high risk of recurrence.

      Plinabulin is a novel small molecule that is being developed for the mitigation of
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Administered by IV infusion on the same day of
      (approximately 1 hour after) chemotherapy (TAC), plinabulin was given in a single dose per
      cycle. Plinabulin is being studied to see if it is a convenient alternative to G-CSF,
      pegfilgrastim, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

      64 patients were enrolled for monotherapy evaluation and 51 patients were enrolled for the
      combination therapy Arm 5, 6 and 7 for efficacy and safety evaluation. The arm designation
      and planned intervention is as follows:

      For monotherapy:

      Arm 1: TAC + pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg)

      Arm 2: TAC + plinabulin (10 mg/m2).

      Arm 3: TAC + plinabulin (20 mg/m2).

      Arm 4: TAC + plinabulin (30 mg/m2).

      For combination therapy:

      Arm 1: TAC + pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg)

      Arm 5: TAC + plinabulin (20 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (1.5 mg)

      Arm 6: TAC + plinabulin (20 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (3.0 mg)

      Arm 7: TAC + plinabulin (20 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg)

      Cycles 1 to 4 will consist of TAC (or TC for Cycles 2 to 4) administered IV on Day 1, every
      21 days. Patients in Arms 2, 3 and 4 will receive a single dose of plinabulin, 30 minutes
      after the end of the TAC (or TC for Cycles 2 to 4) infusion on Day 1. The plinabulin dose
      will be infused over 30 minutes (±5 minutes) in Arms 2 and 3 and over 60 minutes (±5 minutes)
      in Arm 4 (in order to improve tolerability at the higher 30 mg/m2 dose level).

      On Day 2 of each cycle (≥24 hours after completing chemotherapy) patients in Arm 1 and in
      combination therapy will receive a single dose of pegfilgrastim (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg)
      (subcutaneous injection).
