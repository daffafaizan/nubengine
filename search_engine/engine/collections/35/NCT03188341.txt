      complications. The range may include acute coronary syndrome, acute circulatory failure,
      severe arrhythmias, syncope and sudden cardiac death. The patient population is considered as
      a high risk, too. Popular calculators used for risk stratifications are based on preoperative
      patient's history and some general laboratory results. However, general status of the patient
      changes dynamically during vascular procedures leading to acquired increased risk. For this
      reason, sole preoperative risk prediction based on standard calculators is unsuitable and
      suboptimal. Advanced monitoring systems may record some temporary disturbances (e.g.
      ventricular repolarization disturbances), which may be asymptomatic. The clinical
      significance in postoperative risk prediction of such observations remains undefined. On the
      other hand, many of perioperative cardiac complications are caused by modifiable factors. The
      identification may help in the global perioperative risk reduction.
