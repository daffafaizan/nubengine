      evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MRG002. Based on the initial safety and
      efficacy data obtained from the Phase IIa, the study design of the second stage Phase IIb
      single-arm study either will be adjusted or the trial will be stopped. If the Phase IIa data
      support the continuation of the study, in the second stage, approximately an additional 55
      subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRG002.
