      undergoing moderately to severely painful surgery scheduled for â‰¥90 minutes in general
      anaesthesia. Patients were randomized to receive either a single shot of methadone (0.2mg/kg)
      or fentanyl (0.003mg/kg) for induction of anesthesia. In cases of insufficient intraoperative
      analgesia repeated fentanyl administration was possible. Postoperative analgesia was provided
      with patient controlled morphine in both groups (PCA = Patient Controlled Analgesia). Pain
      was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) at rest and after coughing, at 15 minutes
      post extubation, and repeated every 6 hours up to 72 hours postoperatively. The levels of
      sedation and nausea/vomiting were also evaluated in parallel.
