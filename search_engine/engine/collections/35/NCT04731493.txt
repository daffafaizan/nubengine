      months apart without intervention. The data obtained during this first phase will make it
      possible to characterize the functional impact in patients, to verify the reproducibility of
      our evaluations, and to evaluate the spontaneous evolution of the parameters over a period of
      3 months.

      During the second phase of evolution analysis, the quality of life will be assessed at 3
      month intervals (M9, M12) after the therapeutic Education Program (M6). The comparison
      between the evolution during the two phases, before and after the TEP will allow us to assess
      the benefits of the TEP.
