    
      This study is a pilot, feasibility trial of a clinical intervention.

      The investigators will initially pilot the app with three clinical participants, who will be
      asked to use the app for a period of three days and provide feedback as to whether there are
      any difficulties with usability, glitches, display, etc.

      Two therapy groups will then be run consecutively. The therapy delivered will be a modified
      version of Group Training for Social Cognition in Psychosis (GRASP). Both groups will receive
      their homework tasks delivered via an app. Participants will undergo an assessment before and
      after the therapy, and a follow up interview as detailed in the measures section below.
      Primary objective: To evaluate a mobile app to deliver therapy homework between sessions of a
      social cognition therapy group for individuals with psychosis. The investigators are
      interested in whether offering homework via an app is a) feasible, and b) acceptable.

      Secondary objective: To assess whether there is an initial indication that our intervention
      improves social cognition skills.
