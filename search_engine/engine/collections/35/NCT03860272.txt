      refractory cancer (solid tumors) regardless of diagnosis. Subjects may be enrolled into the
      following cohorts:

      Cohort 1: AGEN1181 every 3 weeks at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg Cohort 2: AGEN1181 every 6
      weeks at 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg Cohort 3: AGEN2034 every 2 weeks at 3 mgkg + AGEN1181 every 6
      weeks at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg.

      The trial will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different dose levels of
      AGEN1181 monotherapy and in combination with AGEN2034. Each subject will stay on the dose
      level an schedule assigned at trial entry. Subjects can be replaced for any reason other than
      a DLT. Subjects will receive treatment for â‰¤ 2 years or until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or
      any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal of trial occurs.

      Additionally, the study is intended to further explore the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and
      clinical activity in selected cancer types at dose levels (AGEN1181 monotherapy and
      combination therapy with AGEN2034) determined as potentially effective. Indications of
      interest include, but are not to limited to Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) refractory to
      prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment, melanoma refractory to prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor
      treatment, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), endometrial cancer, and angiosarcoma.
