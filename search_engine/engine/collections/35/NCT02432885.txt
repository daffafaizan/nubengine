    
      Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) are diseases characterized by progressive
      skeletal muscle degeneration and replacement by fibrofatty tissue. Data on cardiac
      involvement (defined as myocardial fibrosis), effect of ACE-inhibitors and specific genetic
      mutations on myocardial involvement detected by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is lacking.

      The study will include 76 patients with DMD/BMD. All patients will be referred to two CMRs
      for assessment of ventricular function and myocardial fibrosis. Patients with myocardial
      fibrosis and normal left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) will be randomized into two
      groups, each group receiving ACE-inhibitor treatment or no treatment for cardiomyopathy. A
      genetic profile will be performed in every patient to identify possible mutations related to
      cardiac involvement.
