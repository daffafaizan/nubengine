      in the mid-face. Augmentation and contouring of the area can be corrected using dermal
      fillers such as Restylane.

      Currently, product choice and amount of volume used for injectable procedures varies between
      physicians as there is no standard for treatment. Individual assessment based on the
      attending physician's preference and experience determines final product selection and
      technique. An algorithm is needed to standardize best practices between physicians and
      clinics and to better regulate the use of dermal fillers in facial plastic surgery.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to is to develop an algorithm to decide on which
      product (i.e., Restylane Volyme or Lyft) to use in the cheek area based on subject
      characteristics such as age, skin quality, subcutaneous fat quantity and positioning, and
      bony structure.
