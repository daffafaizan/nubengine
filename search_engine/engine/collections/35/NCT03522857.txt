      potentially exacerbated by loading exposures, conditioning, psychological, socio-economic,
      lifestyle, comorbid mental health and non-modifiables such as genetics, (O'Sullivan et al
      2016). Pain education can be a useful basis for helping patients to manage their symptoms and
      return to good daily function. However a biomedical approach to chronic pain persists in
      medical communities, whilst persistent pain populations increase and incidences of opioid
      addiction are growing secondary to poor pain management. Biomedical models of pain are likely
      to induce fear avoidant behaviour and exacerbate chronicity (Wertli et al 2014). In order to
      change the prevailing biomedical approach to chronic pain the International Association for
      the Study of Pain (IASP) have provided detailed pain curricula content for different medical
      and allied health professional courses. Briggs et al (2015) found that out of 15
      'representative European countries' less than a handful of universities from 3 countries had
      implemented distinctly identifiable pain education teaching. However they may be other forms
      of pain education that are taking place in pre-registration healthcare professional
      education. This study aims to establish the levels of chronic pain management knowledge and
      attitudes prevail in the UK and Ireland amongst pre-registration healthcare professionals.
