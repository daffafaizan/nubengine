      becoming increasingly effective, overall survival is still poor and side effects of current
      treatment modalities are substantial. There is an urgent need for novel therapies, and in
      addition, better predictive tools are needed to select the right drug to the right patient.
      New data suggest that modulation of the microbiome of the gut might provide opportunities to
      increase anti-tumor efficacy of immunotherapy. Whereas the relation between the gut
      microbiome and immunotherapy is intensively studied, the relation between the gut microbiome
      and efficacy of conventional chemotherapy is unknown. A better understanding of the
      composition, function and dynamics of the gut microbiome before and during chemotherapy might
      help to identify factors that can be influenced during the treatment of patients with
      metastasized or irresectable CRC.

      Therefore, in this study the characteristics and alterations of the gut microbiome during
      chemotherapy for metastasized or irresectable CRC are studied, as well as the relation
      between the gut microbiome and the effects of chemotherapy.
