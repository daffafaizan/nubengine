      from baseline or 50% improvement of clinical signs and symptoms, or no response, they are
      eligible to receive up to 2 additional cellular infusions from the same donor, at a minimum
      of 21-day intervals. If the same donor is no longer available, another donor may be
      considered for a maximum of 3 total cellular infusions at the discretion of the study PI and
      treating physician. A subject will not exceed a maximum of 3 total infusions from 2 donors.

      Subjects are followed for 1 year post initial viral-specific T cell infusion. If subjects
      receive additional infusion(s), GvHD and adverse events will be followed for an additional 90
      days from last infusion. Data may be abstracted from subjects' medical charts for an
      additional 1 year after most recent viral-specific T cell infusion.
