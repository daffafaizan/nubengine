      is methadone, however, buprenorphine (BUP) is also used for this indication, as it is
      FDA-approved for opioid addiction although not specifically for pregnant women. There has
      been increasing evidence that BUP may have comparable efficacy to methadone, and may have
      fewer severe neonatal complications especially neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and
      decreased severity of adverse reactions. The dosing of BUP currently is based on studies in
      men and non-pregnant women (adjusted to the patient's symptomatology using the Clinical
      Opiate Withdrawal (COW) score, some of which is subjective and some based on objective
      physiological parameters) and limited animal data that related plasma concentrations of BUP
      to the degree of saturation of the Âµ receptor in the brain.

      The study team will define the pharmacokinetics and limited pharmacodynamics of BUP in early
      and late pregnancy and the postpartum period and determine what contributes to the variation
      in plasma concentrations and response and will also relate plasma concentrations of BUP and
      its major metabolites to physiologic parameters that can be used to gauge the amount of drug
      in mother's plasma. It is expected to demonstrate that higher doses of BUP are needed
      throughout pregnancy and that the dosing regimen can be adjusted using patient covariates and
      biophysical measurements in addition to the COW scores.
