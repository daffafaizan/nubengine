      investigative site in Tucson Arizona1. The purpose of this study is to determine if the
      device, CATS tonometer prism, measures intraocular pressure significantly differently than
      the current standard of care tonometer prism (Goldmann) before and after institution of
      topical prostaglandin analogs (PGA) for glaucoma treatment. Fifty percent of patients will be
      randomly placed on topical beta blockers as a control. The difference PGAs and beta blockers
      would be a measurement of the amount of corneal biomechanical changes made due to the PGA
      controlled for the effect of IOP lowering by the beta -blocker group.
