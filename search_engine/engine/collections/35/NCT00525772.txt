    
      To study the effects of 4 doses of ciclesonide on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction,
      bronchial responsiveness to mannitol, sputum parameters and other parameters of asthma
      control in asthmatic patients. The primary aim was to evaluate exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction as a method of determining the dose and time responses of inhaled
      corticosteroid therapy. The secondary aims were to evaluate the dose and time responses of
      sputum parameters and responsiveness to mannitol to inhaled corticosteroid therapy.
      Furthermore to explore the relationship(s) between exercise induced bronchoconstriction,
      sputum parameters and mannitol responsiveness.
