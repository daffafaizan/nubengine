      mellitus in patients with schizophrenia. As part of the study, we collect
      neuroendocrine-immune data on patients with first episode, treatment naive psychosis,
      patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia and normal healthy controls.

      Regardless the treatment status, we collect the same neuroendocrine-immune on the
      participants (patients and controls) after 2 months. Thus, our study does not control
      treatment. Patients take treatment in consultation with their physician. Some of them even
      decide not to take any medications. At the 2nd visit, we do ask them about the the
      medications they are taking if any.
