      be non-specific, attenuated, or intermittent. These symptoms nevertheless frequently
      interfere with an individuals' ability to effectively carry-out multiple aspects of their
      everyday lives, including social, vocational, and educational functioning. Functional changes
      may in fact occur before individual symptoms reach the threshold for clinical significance.
      Relying solely on the emergence of early symptoms of psychopathology can delay treatment or
      lead to the improper selection of treatments that are not effective. Therefore, measuring
      changes in real-world functioning that correlate with or predate symptoms may be a useful
      tool for developing an effective treatment plan.

      While psychopharmacology and psychotherapy can improve some symptoms of severe mental
      illness, much less is known about the mechanisms for improving impairments in social
      cognition. Importantly social cognition affects not just social functioning, but many
      critical aspects of real-world functioning. Thus, advancing our understanding of how social
      cognition and real-world functioning change over time, and their association to changing
      clinical symptoms, will help improve our understanding of early mental illness, and should
      inform patient care in new ways. Currently, there are only a limited number of tools
      available for assessing aspects of real-world functioning as they connect to social
      cognition. Therefore, the overarching goal of the present study is to conduct a pilot study
      to develop a new tool that measures functioning and evaluate the relationship between this
      new tool and measures of social cognition and symptoms.
