      on a 0, 1, 2 month schedule results in a more rapid rise in binding and neutralizing antibody
      response than on a 0, 1, 6 month schedule. Such an effect may be particularly desirable in
      vaccine delivery. This study compares these two delivery schedules using the unadjuvanted
      vaccine formulation rsgp120/HIV-1 with or without addition of alum.

      Healthy volunteers (20 per group) receive MN rsgp120/HIV-1 (300 or 0 mcg) in combination with
      QS21 (100 mcg), either with or without alum, at 0, 1, and 2 months or 0, 1, and 6 months. For
      both vaccination schedules, an additional five volunteers receive only vehicle with alum. The
      0 mcg antigen groups are included primarily as negative controls. Subjects may be contacted
      for follow-up on health status once or twice yearly for at least 5 years.
