      delirium, an organic state of confusion that affects over 80% of mechanically ventilated
      patients during their intensive care stay. A growing body of literature suggests that the
      severity of delirium symptoms may also have a significant impact on negative outcomes
      associated with delirium, including mortality, length of hospital stay, duration of
      mechanical ventilation, and functional and cognitive impairment. Similarly, recent literature
      suggests that patient outcomes may be worsened by a subthreshold severity level of delirium,
      known as subsyndromal delirium. Despite the urgent need to understand delirium and
      subsyndromal delirium etiology for better detection and management strategies, the
      multifactorial pathophysiology of delirium is still largely unknown. Clinical biomarker
      studies evaluating levels of S100 calcium-binding protein beta (S-100β), neuron-specific
      enolase (NSE), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), and brain-derived neurotropic
      factor (BDNF) have suggested evidence for their role in delirium pathophysiology, but
      significant associations with delirium severity and subsyndromal delirium have not been
      reliably established. Evaluating the dose-response relationship of S-100β, NSE, UCHL1, and
      BDNF with delirium severity and subsyndromal delirium in a homogeneous population of
      mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis will provide novel insight on the etiological
      pathway of delirium. The investigators will evaluate effect modification and confounding by
      inflammation and blood-brain barrier permeability by measuring well-established biomarkers,
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and E-selectin, respectively. Understanding the role of neuronal damage
      in delirium may be a promising avenue to develop better screening practices and
      neuroprotective management strategies that may reduce long-term cognitive and functional
      deficits associated with delirium.
