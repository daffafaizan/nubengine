      dizziness is one of the only manifestations of migraine headaches. Various classes of drugs
      have been advocated as treatment for migraine-associated dizziness, though none has been
      shown to be superior over the others.

      Topiramate is a drug approved for migraine prophylaxis. This study is designed to assess if
      there are significant changes in dizziness frequency and severity in patients diagnosed with
      migraine-associated dizziness treated with topiramate. Demonstrating benefit of topiramate
      with a placebo-controlled study to alleviate symptoms of dizziness would serve to clarify
      effective treatment options for patients with migraine-associated dizziness.
