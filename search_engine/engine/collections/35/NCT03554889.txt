      will be selected and expanded ex vivo and infused back into patients. Nimotuzumab will be
      used 24 hours before infusion. 21 advanced cancer patients are planned to receive two cycles
      of NK cells and Nimotuzumab treatment. Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and
      analyzed as well.
