        -  Sequence the microRNAs present in 20 infant AML samples as a pilot study.

        -  Compare microRNAs present in infant AML samples to infant ALL samples that are being
           concurrently sequenced in a separate study to identify lineage- and
           translocation-specific microRNAs.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected cryopreserved cells from diagnosis are sequenced using reverse
      transcriptase-PCR.
