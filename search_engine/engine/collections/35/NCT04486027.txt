      role of the cytokines takes an important part of this mechanism. The investigators aimed to
      bring a new approach to the concept of 'remission' in patients with RA.

      Background: RA is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease that involves small joints in
      the form of symmetrical polyarthritis and progresses with exacerbations and remissions. Pain,
      swelling, tenderness and morning stiffness are typical of the joints involved. Although it is
      approached as a primary joint disease, a wide variety of extra-articular involvements may
      also occur. It is an interesting pathophysiological process, the exact cause of which is
      still unknown, with many environmental, genetic and potentially undiscovered possible factors
      in a chaotic manner.

      Objective: In this prospective study, sedimentation rate (ESR), C- Reactive protein (CRP),
      Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, soluble-TNF-α receptor (TNF-R), Interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-10
      were measured in three groups which were healthy volunteers, patients with RA in active
      period, and patients with RA in remission. Disease activity score-28 (DAS-28) was calculated
      in active RA and RA in remission.

      Methods: This study included 20 healthy volunteers, 20 remission patients with RA and 20
      active RA patients. Venous blood samples were collected from patients in both healthy and RA
      groups.
