      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone in patients
           with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of ixabepilone when administered alone and in combination with
           ketoconazole in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of ixabepilone.

      During course 1, patients receive oral ketoconazole on days 0-5 and ixabepilone IV over 3
      hours on day 1. During course 2 and subsequent courses, patients receive only ixabepilone IV
      over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of ixabepilone during course 1 until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 12 patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
