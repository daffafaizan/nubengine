      that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been
      demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause
      mortality. However, despite cardiac rehabilitation being a Class I (standard of care)
      recommendation in multiple American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines,
      more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive appropriate cardiac rehabilitation and much
      of this is due to challenges in access to these programs. Recent innovations in technology
      allow us to passively monitor an individual's physical activity using wearable devices.
      Incentives designed using insights from behavioral economics have been demonstrated to
      motivate device engagement and behavior change. A remotely-monitored cardiac rehabilitation
      program could improve access for many individuals and potentially be more cost-effective
      because it is less resource- and personnel-intensive. The objective of this study is to use a
      randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based physical activity
      program using wearable devices and financial incentives.
