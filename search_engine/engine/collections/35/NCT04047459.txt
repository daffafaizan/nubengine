      skeletal muscle microenvironments, which are respectively preferential and non-preferential
      metastasisation sites for breast cancer cells, in order to identify specific pathways driving
      breast cancer cells extravasation. To this purpose, differences in the transcriptional
      profile of ECs derived from bone and muscle endothelium will be investigated. These analyses
      will be used to select target genes differentially expressed by bone- and muscle-specific
      ECs. Then, ECs obtained from bone and muscle endothelium will be respectively used to mimic
      bone and muscle microvessel environments in microfluidic in vitro 3D models allowing for the
      study of breast cancer cell extravasation. The genes selected according to the results of the
      transcriptomic analysis (e.g. genes expressed in ECs derived from bone endothelium, but not
      expressed in ECs derived from muscle endothelium) will be silenced and the effect of gene
      silencing will be evaluated monitoring breast cancer cell extravasation in order to verify
      the involvement of the selected genes in this process.
