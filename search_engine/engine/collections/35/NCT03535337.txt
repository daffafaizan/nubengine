      of participants to receive either CPS or SMS using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Both intervention
      conditions will receive 3 months of intervention (i.e., 12 weeks of CPS or SMS).

      The second step involves a stratified randomization in blocks with 8 possible intervention
      trajectories. Within each condition, participants are categorized into two groups -
      responders with VL<200 (Rsp) and non-responders with VL â‰¥200 (NRsp). Responders in the CPS
      condition will be randomly assigned to receive either 3 months of CPS tapered (CPS-T)
      intervention followed by standard care (SC) or only SC. Similarly, responders in the
      SMScondition will be randomly assigned to receive either 3 months of SMS tapered (SMS-T)
      intervention followed by SC or only SC. Non-responders in both CPS and SMS conditions will be
      randomly assigned to receive either 3 months of incentivized CPS (CPS-I) followed by 3 months
      of CPS-T and 3 months of SC or 3 months of incentivized SMS (SMS-I) followed by 3 months of
      SMS-T and 3 months of SC.
