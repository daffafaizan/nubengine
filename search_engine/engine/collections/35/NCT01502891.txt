      effectiveness research (CER) review into practice, the investigators have developed a
      literacy-sensitive depression treatment decision aid, DEPRESSION MEDICATION CHOICE, which
      adapts the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)'s Effective Healthcare
      comparative effectiveness review and associated patient guide about antidepressant medicines
      to satisfy the needs of clinicians, patients, and other major stakeholders. The investigators
      will conduct a randomized study to estimate the effect of the decision aid on patient
      knowledge, patient involvement in decision making and decision-making quality, and on three
      and six-month measures of medication adherence and mental health, when compared with usual
      care.
