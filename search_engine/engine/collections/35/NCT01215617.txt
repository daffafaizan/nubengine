    
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repetitive obstruction and
      collapse of the upper airway resulting in successive episodes of cessation of or decreased
      respiratory airflow, causing oxygen desaturation, awakening, loud snoring and daytime
      sleepiness in patients. Sleep apnea is frequently associated with co-morbidity such as
      obesity, diabetes, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Lack of
      exercise is associated with OSAS severity, independent of body mass. Participation and
      motivation to exercise is low in OSAS patients, with less that one third of the patients
      reporting regular exercise routines. We aim to investigate if aerobic interval training
      improves OSAS in obese subjects.
