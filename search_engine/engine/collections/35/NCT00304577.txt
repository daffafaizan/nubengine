      Germany and the Netherlands to either BR or RR. Patients did not have demonstrable binocular
      vision at baseline. The angle of strabismus was measured pre- and postoperatively in a
      standardized fashion. The primary parameter to assess difference between BR and RR was the
      variation of the latent angle of strabismus at distance at three months postoperatively,
      secondary outcomes were reduction of convergence excess and binocular vision.
