    
      This is a single-site, randomized, crossover study of experienced adult e-cigarette users to
      assess nicotine exposure, toxicant exposure, and the short-term CV effects of e-liquid pH.
      Three e-liquid pH conditions will be assessed on all participants: 5, 7, and 9.

      Hypothesis 2a: The rate of systemic nicotine absorption is inversely related to e-liquid pH
      and results in lower peak blood nicotine levels at higher pH.

      Hypothesis 2b: Heart rate acceleration will decrease and subjective measures of sensation in
      the throat, reward, and satisfaction will increase with increasing e-liquid pH.
