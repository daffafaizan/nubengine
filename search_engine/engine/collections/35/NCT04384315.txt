      been shown to be safe and efficacious in its initial trials, these studies have been limited
      to generally a caucasian-based population, where the vein size, anatomy and distribution of
      venous incompetence can be different from their asian counterparts. The study will evaluate
      the technical, anatomical and clinical performance of EVRFÂ® performed on multiple truncal
      varicose veins, and without mandatory postoperative compression stockings of the GSV, SSV or
      AASV. The two primary endpoints for this evaluation are technical success at the time of the
      procedure, and anatomical success, reported as complete closure at 2-weeks, 3 months, 6
      months and 12 months.
