    
      The objective of this protocol is to prospectively evaluate whether a clomid-based, low dose
      gonadotropin protocol (225 IU) would be non-inferior in terms of mature oocyte yield (eggs
      that are ready to be fertilized) as compared to a high-dose protocol.

      Patients meeting the criteria for poor ovarian response will be consented and randomized to
      either a stimulation protocol involving pretreatment with a 0.1mg estradiol patch in the
      luteal phase starting 10 days after the LH surge (the hormone released by the brain to cause
      ovulation to occur, which is detectable in urine) followed by oral clomiphene citrate 100mg
      on days 2-6 of the menstrual cycle and 225 international units of gonadotropins starting on
      day 5, or to the control group involving the same pretreatment with 0.1mg luteal estradiol
      patches starting 10 days after the LH surge, with high dose gonadotropins (600IU) alone,
      starting on day 2 of the cycle. After randomization, patients will undergo routine IVF
      procedures, monitoring, blood draws, cancellation criteria, oocyte retrieval, and embryo
      transfer as non-study participants.
