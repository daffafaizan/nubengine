      acute renal failure (ARF) after hepatic surgery

      We will enhance a pre-existing score predicting ARF based on pre-operative as well as
      intra-operative predictors.

      Development process: we will identify the strongest predictors of ARF in a multivariable
      logistic regression model followed by a stepwise backward logistic regression analysis and
      bootstrapping.

      Validation process: we will perform an internal validation by calibrating the prediction
      model as well as by k-fold cross validation (c statistics) and bootstrapping. Additionally,
      we will calculate the discrimination by the area under the curve (AUC).

      Decision curve analysis: Furthermore we will perform a decision curve analysis to evaluate
      the clinical consequences of both prediction scores whether a patient with increased ARF risk
      would post-operative benefit of a treatment on the ICU.
