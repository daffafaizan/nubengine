      Between March 2016 and December 2016,the investigators initially recruited 450 individuals
      reporting severe habitual snoring. Primal evaluations including office blood pressure,
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score(ESS), antihypertensive medicine demographic and anthropometric
      data. Then overnight polysomnography were performed. Of them,100 were severe OSA (AHI>30
      episode/h) with hypertension, who were agreed to stop taking antihypertensive medicine. The
      investigators calculated the time to stop based on the half-life of patients taking oral
      drugs and last time administration time. The subject who withdrawal time was less than three
      days was enrolled in this study. These patients were hospitalized and close monitoring of
      blood pressure, for blood pressure three times greater than 180/110mmHg or appearing
      dizziness, headache and other clinical syndrome, the investigators will give a timely
      clinical intervention and get rid of this study. The control group consisted of 100 subjects
      just with severe OSA whose blood pressure is normal. The investigators recorded nocturnal
      blood pressure, oximetry, beat-to-beat BPV, AHI, BP event was calculated. Screening of 40
      newly diagnosed patients with hypertension and subjects with poor blood pressure control, the
      investigators would give one-night continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) to compare the
      AHI, the mean nocturnal systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, the number of
      blood events before and after short-term CPAP therapy, to compare the AHI, the mean nocturnal
      systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, the number of blood events before and
      after short-term CPAP therapy.
