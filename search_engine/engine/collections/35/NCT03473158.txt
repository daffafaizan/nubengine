      decades. Multiple pregnancies are frequently complicated by maternal and fetal morbidities
      and mortalities. Data show that the incidence of morbidity and mortality correlate with fetal
      number. In the United Kingdom, the single embryo transfer policy has reduced the incidence of
      multifetal gestation. Also, in the United States the ASRM (American society of reproductive
      medicine) has revised the guidelines to optimize the number of transferred embryos during
      IVF. However in Egypt, transfer of 3 to 4 embryos is still practiced. The procedure of fetal
      reduction aims to decrease the occurrence of maternal and perinatal morbidities related to
      multifetal gestations. It can be carried out transvaginally or transabdominally under
      ultrasound guidance. It may be done by potassium chloride injection through needle injection,
      mere mechanical disruption by a needle, or by radiofrequency ablation. In this study
      multifetal pregnancy reduction will be carried out through transvaginal route, at an early
      gestational age (6 weeks - 9weeks + 6days), and compare the efficacy, complications and
      pregnancy outcome using mere mechanical disruption against potassium chloride injection.
