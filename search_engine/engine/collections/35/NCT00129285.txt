      conditions. Due to its stimulant-like properties, modafinil is also likely to relieve severe
      cocaine withdrawal symptoms. In turn, this may lead to better clinical outcomes. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether modafinil improves abstinence during early recovery
      from cocaine dependence.

      This 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll 210 participants with
      current DSM-IV diagnoses of cocaine dependence. Treatment will occur for 8 weeks.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single morning dose of low-dose modafinil
      (200 mg/day), high-dose modafinil (400 mg/day), or matching placebo tablets. In addition,
      each week participants will receive manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy at the
      Treatment Research Center. At the end of the 8-week treatment period, modafinil or placebo
      will be abruptly discontinued. One week following, an end of medication evaluation will
      occur. In addition to this, two follow-up evaluations will take place 3 and 5 months after
      initial randomization. Efforts will be made to continue evaluation of subjects who decide to
      discontinue the modafinil treatment. Urine benzoylecgonine levels will be used to measure
      cocaine abstinence. Craving, withdrawal, retention, and adverse events will also be
      evaluated.
