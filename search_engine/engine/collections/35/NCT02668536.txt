      novel bioadhesive nanoparticle sunscreen in 20-25 human volunteers.This technology makes
      sunscreens safer and longer-lasting by encapsulating UV sunscreen active agents in non-toxic
      nanoparticles. Strong preclinical data exists demonstrating the potential for improved
      safety, long-duration of retention, and increased effectiveness of this product.

      This innovative solution focuses on preventing damage caused by UV exposure through the use
      of a nanoparticle delivery vehicle. The bioadhesive feature of this technology enables longer
      protection. In addition, encapsulation of the UV filter in a bioadhesive nanoparticle (BNP)
      improves filter photo-stability, delays filter photo-degradation, and prevents reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) escape, thereby reducing the risk of cell damage and epidermal toxicity
      from UV filters.

      Furthermore, the bioadhesive feature of our technology eliminates penetration into deeper
      skin layers or into the blood, minimizing the potential side-effects of UV filters. It is
      believed that the translation of this technology will provide a longer-lasting, safer, more
      protective UV sunscreen.
