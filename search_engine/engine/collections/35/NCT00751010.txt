    
      In a mailed survey (Part 1 of this study), 127 women with a documented diagnosis of IC agreed
      to be contacted for an in-office examination. The mailed survey was internally developed
      specifically for this project and included items related to demographics, adolescent and
      adult history related to genital pain and current health. The last section allowed the
      subject to include contact information if they would also like to participate in Part 2
      (additional questionnaires and examination) of the study.

      The study coordinator will review those surveys containing contact information and all women
      at least 18 years of age will be invited to the WISH program (Beaumont Women's Initiative for
      Pelvic Pain and Sexual Health) to be examined by a certified Nurse Practitioner (NP) who will
      be blinded to their survey responses.

      Questionnaires will be completed by the subject. These questionnaires relate to one's
      history, pain symptoms, quality of life, bladder symptoms and sexual function and will be
      completed prior to the examination. The NP will perform all the clinical evaluations. A
      vaginal pH and wet mount slide will be done first. Testing for vulvodynia will be done
      utilizing an algesiometer q-tip followed by Neurometer® surface CPT testing for pain
      threshold (not tolerance) to quantify pain levels in the distribution of the pudendal nerve
      on the perineum and vulva will be done. The Neurometer® current perception threshold (CPT) is
      a device for evaluating and measuring sensation It is a battery-operated stimulator which
      delivers painless electrical stimulation via surface electrodes at frequencies of 5 Hz, 250
      Hz, and 2000 Hz and at a current of 0.01 to 99mAmps.
