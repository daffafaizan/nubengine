      repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who respond to treatment may continue therapy until disease progression.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, and peripheral blood sample collection
      periodically for correlative laboratory studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks.

      The phase II portion of this trial was never conducted due to lack of funding.
