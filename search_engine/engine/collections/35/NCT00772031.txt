      preventative treatments to deal with this disabling condition. Three randomized,
      placebo-controlled trials found that topiramate was an effective, safe and generally
      well-tolerated drug for treating chronic migraine. As a result of these trials, topiramate is
      becoming the standard treatment among headache specialists. Experts agree that treatment with
      combinations of preventive agents is required in the majority of individuals with chronic
      migraine for maximal headache relief. No randomized trials have assessed the value of
      frequently used combinations of preventive agents for chronic migraine.

      The goal of this trial is to determine if adding a second drug to topiramate treatment will
      further reduce the headache burden for people with this condition. In the study, 250
      participants with chronic migraine will be randomized to two groups - treatment with
      topiramate and propranolol or topiramate and placebo. Participants will be followed for six
      months.
