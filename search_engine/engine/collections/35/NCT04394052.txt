      ultra-high resolution CT between benign and malignant lesions using histological analysis as
      the standard of reference.

      Comparison of the diagnostic performance of texture parameters derived from different MRI
      sequences and ultra-high resolution CT for musculoskeletal tumor characterization.

      Evaluate the impact of ultra-high resolution with respect to standard resolution on CT images
      Comparison of the diagnostic performance of the texture parameters for the tumor on the
      diagnostic performance of texture analysis derived parameters for the characterization of
      musculoskeletal tumors.

      Evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of automatic artificial intelligence (AI) based tumor
      segmentation tools.

      Evaluate the use of trabecular analysis on ultra-high resolution CT images for the evaluation
      of tumor-bone interfaces.
