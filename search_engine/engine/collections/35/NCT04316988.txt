      Hospital (TUTH) and Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Center (MCVTC) operating
      rooms from January 2017 to July 2017. Ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) of Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Department of Anaesthesiology, Maharajgunj
      Medical College (MMC) was taken. Written informed consent was taken.

      ASA I and II patients over 16 years of age were included in this study. Patients with
      difficult airway and anticipated difficult intubation, respiratory diseases, poor functional
      status, emergency case, and patients at risk of aspiration were excluded.

      The diagnostic characteristics of real-time, suprasternal, transtracheal ultrasonography and
      capnography were tested by calculating their respective sensitivities, specificities,
      positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), accuracies and likelihood
      ratios. Comparison of time taken for confirmation of endotracheal tube position from the
      beginning of laryngoscopy, by ultrasonography versus capnography was done using t-statistics.

      The degree of agreement of result between ultrasonography and capnography was tested with
      kappa statistics.

      Out of the 95 patients studied, 11 had oesophageal intubation (Incidence of 11.57%). The
      overall accuracy of both ultrasonography and capnography was 96.84%. The sensitivity,
      specificity, PPV, NPV with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
      ultrasonography were 97.62% (91.66% - 99.71%), 90.91% (58.72% - 99.77%), 98.80% (92.67% -
      99.81%), 83.33% (55.66% - 95.22%) respectively; and that for capnography were 96.43% (89.92%
      - 99.26%), 100% (71.51% - 100%), 100% (100% - 100%) and 78.57% (54.69% - 91.76%)
      respectively.

      The likelihood ratio of a positive and a negative result for ultrasonography were 10.74 and
      0.03 respectively, and that for capnography were infinity and 0.04 respectively.

      The kappa value was 0.749 (95% CI: 0.567 - 0.931) which meant a good degree of agreement of
      result between these two methods.

      The average time taken for confirmation of endotracheal tube by ultrasonography and
      capnography were 26.79 ± 7.64 seconds and 43.03 ± 8.71 seconds (mean ± standard deviation)
      respectively. The median time for confirmation was 26 seconds with interquartile range [15 -
      37] seconds for ultrasonography and 42 seconds with interquartile range [29 - 55] seconds for
      capnography. Ultrasonography was found to be faster than capnography by 16.36 ± 3.23 seconds
      (mean ± standard deviation) and the difference in time was significant (p = 0.011).

      During the study, one patient had unanticipated difficult intubation, and four had
      hypotension after induction of anaesthesia. These patients were excluded from the study and
      no sequalae of hypotension was seen in the patients, or no hypoxemia occured in the patient
      with unanticipated difficult intubation.
