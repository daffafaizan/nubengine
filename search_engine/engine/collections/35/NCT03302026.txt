      Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a
      quit attempt. Nicotine replacement therapy, the most widely used pharmacotherapy, yields end
      of treatment quit rates of <25% suggesting that managing nicotine withdrawal is not
      sufficient. A smoker's response to smoking cues is one factor that increases risk of relapse.
      This study will examine how real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI)
      feedback can be used to modulate brain activation in the context of smoking cues in order to
      resist craving. First, we will conduct a pilot study in 12 smokers for technical development
      and to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed study procedures. Participants will complete
      a total of three fMRI scanning sessions with a cue suppression task with or without
      neurofeedback training (NFT). Participants will be randomized to an active group (active NFT)
      or a control group (no NFT) during the scanning sessions. At the end of the third session,
      all participants will complete a validated smoking lapse laboratory paradigm to evaluate
      effects of NFT on smoking behavior. Upon successful completion of the technical development
      phase, we will proceed to a proof-of-concept phase, which will recruit 72 smokers to evaluate
      the efficacy of NFT for smoking behavior.
