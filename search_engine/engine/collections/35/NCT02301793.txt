        -  In an attempt to improve venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis adherence the
           investigators carried out qualitative studies to obtain patients' viewpoints on how
           nurses should be educated about VTE prevention and to assess nurses' beliefs and
           perceptions about pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis

        -  The investigators observed deficiencies in nurses' knowledge and misconceptions about
           VTE prophylaxis that likely lowers adherence to administration of prescribed VTE
           prophylaxis doses

        -  As a part of our original Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) proposal,
           the investigators planned to educate nurses to address the observed deficiencies and
           misconceptions and improve their ability to communicate effectively with patients

             -  Historically, nurse education has been done via a linear, PowerPoint-based platform
                with voice-over but with no interactive component (TRADITIONAL)

             -  A newer platform for nurse education became available for use and includes
                scenario-based teaching, ongoing assessment, and immediate remediation. Most
                importantly, it is a highly interactive product (CONTEMPORARY)

      STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYTIC PLAN

        -  Research hypotheses

             -  Primary: Nurse participants who receive either of these interventions will improve
                administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis evidenced by a decrease in frequency
                of non-administered doses of VTE prophylaxis, compared with their frequency at
                baseline.

             -  Secondary: Nurse participants who receive the contemporary education format will
                have a larger decrease in frequency of missed doses of VTE prophylaxis compared
                with those who participate in the traditional education format.

        -  Study Design

             -  Cluster Randomized Trial 21 floors, block randomized by floor type (medicine [n=11]
                vs. surgery [n=10]) and (ICU [n=5] vs. non-ICU [n=16]) All nurses on each floor are
                assigned the same education type to mitigate issues related to contamination if
                nurses discuss the education with their colleagues

        -  Primary Outcome measure: Proportion of non-administered doses of pharmacological VTE
           prophylaxis (dose level)

        -  Secondary Outcome Measures:

             -  Proportion of doses documented as missed due to patient refusal (dose level)

             -  Proportion of patients with any VTE (patient level)

             -  Proportion of patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (patient level)

             -  Proportion of patients with Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (patient level)

        -  Analytic methods

             -  Primary analyses - Intention-to-treat (includes all nurses assigned, whether or not
                they completed the education) Is there a difference between units allocated to
                either of the interventions comparing their outcome measure to their baseline
                measure? Is there a difference comparing those who received the contemporary
                education format vs. the traditional education format?

             -  Secondary analysis - Per protocol (includes only nurses who completed the
                education) Do nurses who receive education perform better (improved administration
                of prescribed VTE prophylaxis) than those who did not? Do nurses who received the
                education in the contemporary format perform better than those who received it in
                the traditional format
