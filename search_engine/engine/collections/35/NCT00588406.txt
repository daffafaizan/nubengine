    
      This is a randomized clinical trial studying the effect of nebulized budesonide (Pulmicort)
      in acutely ill adults presenting to the Emergency Department with severe asthma. Budesonide
      is an inhaled steroid FDA approved for the treatment of pediatric chronic asthma. ED entry
      criteria include hyporesponsiveness to nebulized beta-agonists and an FEV1<50% predicted. The
      trial will evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses of nebulized budesonide as an adjunct to a
      highly regimented standardized treatment protocol; standard care consists of bronchodilators
      (beta-agonists/anticholinergics), systemic steroids, and intravenous magnesium sulfate (if
      the FEV1<25% predicted). The primary efficacy endpoint will be the FEV1 4 hours after
      administration of the study intervention. An additional safety and efficacy endpoint will
      take place at 5 hours after study intervention. The treatments will be coupled with a
      protocol-defined assessment regimen, with endpoints measured before each treatment and on ED
      disposition (at 5 hours after study intervention).
