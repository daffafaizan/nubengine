      fractures and increasing calcium absorption. One way to circumvent the variability of 25(OH)D
      response to vitamin D might be to use calcifediol supplementation and bypass the
      25-hydroxylase enzyme entirely. This approach also permits the physician to achieve desired
      serum levels in a matter of just a few days, rather than the several weeks required when
      using native vitamin D. Compared to native vitamin D, calcifediol is more water soluble, has
      a shorter half-life and increases 25(OH)D levels more quickly. Calcifediol is also more
      potent, about 3.5 times more potent in raising 25(OH)D levels than vitamin D. Its water
      solubility may also confer an advantage in patients who have difficulty absorbing fat soluble
      vitamins. This form of vitamin D metabolite has been used historically to increase calcium
      absorption, treat osteomalacia, and increase Bone Mineral Density (BMD). Using calcifediol
      seems to be a practical solution, but little is known about the dose response variability in
      humans and how it compares to that of native vitamin D. The investigators are intending to
      perform a clinical study in healthy subjects on the pharmacokinetics of different doses of
      Hy.D Calcifediol compared to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in order to gain insight into the
      dose response relationship and to assess kinetic differences including the steady state. The
      metabolites 1,25(OH)2D, 24,25(OH)2D will be assessed throughout the study to assess the
      metabolism of vitamin D vs. 25(OH)D. Vitamin D3 will be measured throughout the study to
      assess compliance with the restriction of exogenous vitamin D supplementation.
