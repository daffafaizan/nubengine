      ovarian cysts and has gained increasing acceptance among gynecological surgeons(1). However,
      the safety of this technique in terms of ovarian damage to the operated gonad has recently
      been questioned. In the present study, with the combined use of serum hormonal evaluation and
      ultrasound examination, we planned to prospectively investigate the ovarian reserve after the
      excision of benign ovarian cysts. The damage to ovarian reserve will be evaluated through a
      12-months follow-up after the application of bipolar, ultrasonic scalpel electrocoagulation
      or suture during ovarian cystectomy
