      communities classified as 'rural', but many may still have long distances to travel to reach
      a health care facility. This results in challenges in uniform delivery of health care
      throughout the country. There are 25,000 pacemaker (PM) implants and 7000 implantable
      defibrillator (ICD) implants yearly in Canada, with approximately 120 000 patients living
      with these devices. The recommended follow-up for these devices are based on consensus and
      position statements, with the majority of patients requiring at least yearly visits to a
      specialized device clinic during the lifetime of their device. During the life of these
      patients, many issues may arise, such as atrial or ventricular arrhythmias that may result in
      syncope, stroke or sudden death, need for increased monitoring resulting from device
      advisories, or minor programming adjustments to improve device performance, or simply the
      need for enhanced surveillance as the device battery depletes and replacement is anticipated.

      While remote monitoring technology is currently available and has permitted surveillance and
      device assessment from any patient location accessible to a landline or mobile phone, the use
      has been inconsistent in Canada. In addition, new technology has become available that not
      only permits surveillance, but also remote programming of these devices. The incorporation of
      remote programming capability, along with automatic recalibration of device settings, allows
      us to develop a new paradigm of remote patient management where after the patient receives
      their device, they would remain in the care of their local health team and no longer require
      travel to the specialized 'hub' clinics for follow-up.
