      carcinoma (NPC). During chemoradiotherapy, malnutrition is present in 44-88% patients which
      is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Although patients receive conventional
      nutritional intervention recommended by The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and
      Metabolism guidelines, there are still 35% NPC patients suffering from malnutrition during
      chemoradiotherapy.

      Recent studies have shown that early nutritional intervention before radiotherapy reduced the
      prevalence of malnutrition. However, there are few randomized controlled clinical studies
      comparing early oral nutritional supplements (ONS) intervention to conventional nutritional
      intervention in NPC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.

      This single center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to
      investigate whether early ONS intervention compared to conventional nutritional intervention
      improves nutritional status, treatment tolerance and quality of life, and decreases the
      incidence of grade 3-4 treatment related side-effects in NPC patients undergoing
      chemoradiotherapy.
