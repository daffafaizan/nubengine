      also for the health of the unborn child. Pregnancy is time when nearly all women have regular
      contact with the healthcare system. Pregnancy is also a time during which women consider
      their situation and are open for change.

      Healthcare staff have the opportunity to ask pregnant women if they experience IPV and need
      to know how to respond to women experiencing IPV. Healthcare staff can refer to other
      services. If staff are uncertain if referral is needed or wanted they can teach women how to
      increase their own safety and prepare for leaving through a number of safety promoting
      behaviours.The safety behaviours were originally developed in the USA to counsel women who
      attended a family violence unit and qualified for a protection order.

      Women do not always disclose the true nature of their IPV to staff. However, they could still
      benefit from learning about safety promoting behaviours. Using a video for teaching allows
      for the use of pictures and sound and options for several languages.
