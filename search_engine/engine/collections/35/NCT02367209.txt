      MRI (FD MRI) has been introduced that allows for simultaneous assessment of regional lung
      perfusion and ventilation-related information without exposure to ionizing radiation or
      administration of intravenous or inhalational contrast agent.

      In this project, the investigators plan to investigate whether Fourier decomposition (FD) MRI
      is able to provide similar clinical information on regional lung perfusion as the standard
      methods SPECT/CT and DCE MRI in patients with COPD. As MRI in patients with COPD is
      particularly challenging due to the rarefication of lung parenchyma, the FD MRI technique
      will be combined with an ultra-fast Steady-State Free Precession (ufSSFP) acquisition method
      for improved signal efficiency. The investigators ultimate goal is to provide a mean to
      predict and monitor the outcome of different therapies, such as medication, valves and
      surgery in COPD patients without requiring ionizing radiation or administration of contrast
      agents.

      In the framework of this study, 30 patients with COPD will be enrolled prospectively. The
      study participants will be recruited by the clinic for thoracic surgery at the University
      Hospital Basel among all patients undergoing lung perfusion scintigraphy with SPECT/CT for
      surgery planning. Each participant will undergo one MRI examination of 30 min containing
      non-contrast-enhanced (FD MRI) and contrast-enhanced (DCE MRI) imaging studies of regional
      lung perfusion.
