    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the efficacy (complete remission [CR], complete remission without blood count
      recovery [CRi], complete remission without platelet recovery [CRp]) of liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) in combination with venetoclax in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety of CPX-351 in combination with venetoclax in patients with AML.

      II. To assess the event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with AML.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance in AML treated with CPX-351 and
      venetoclax.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax.

      INDUCTION: Participants receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously
      (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 of cycle 1 and on days 1 and 3 of cycle 2.
      Participants also receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-21. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Participants receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90
      minutes on days 1 and 3 and venetoclax PO QD on days 2-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 3 years.
