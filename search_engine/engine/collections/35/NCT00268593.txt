    
      The trial is a multi-centre, open-label randomised phase II study in patients with
      androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC), with a lead-in combination tolerance study. The
      aim of the lead-in phase is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PI-88
      administered either 4 days/week or 7 days/week) in combination with fixed doses of docetaxel
      (75 mg/m^2 every 21 days) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily). In the randomized phase II
      component, patients will receive PI-88 at the MTD, either 4 days/week or 7 days/week, in
      combination with docetaxel and prednisone. The patients will receive up to 10 treatment
      cycles of the combination therapy. Response to treatment will be assessed by measuring serum
      levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Other efficacy measures will include radiological
      assessment, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life.
