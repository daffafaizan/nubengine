      preferred fistula in many clinical practical guidelines for vascular access, there are no
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the recommended anatomic order of
      distal-to-proximal access construction up to now. A modified non-transposed brachiobasilic
      arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) that has a long length of suitable superficial vein for
      cannulation and a sufficient blood flow for effective dialysis has been introduced by
      investigator for several years. In addition, mNT-BBAVF has good primary patency and a low
      risk of complication and leave opportunities for further procedures in the event of failure.
      Investigator plan to conduct a multicenter, open-labelled, randomized study to compare the
      primary patency and safety of elbow mNT-BBAVF and wrist RCAVF in hemodialysis patients.
