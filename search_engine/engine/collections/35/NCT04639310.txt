    
      The EPIK Phase 3 clinical trial is designed as a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study targeting to enroll approximately 40 pediatric subjects
      (aged from 1 month to less than 6 years) with documented genetic evidence consistent with a
      diagnosis of KCNQ2 Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (KCNQ2-DEE). After screening,
      subjects will enter a baseline period before being randomized to receive either XEN496
      (ezogabine) or placebo, added to their existing antiseizure medications (ASMs), for 12 weeks
      (maintenance), once a titration period of up to 24 days is complete. At the end of the
      maintenance phase, eligible subjects will have the opportunity to qualify for and participate
      in the separate open-label extension (OLE) study and receive XEN496 or, should they choose to
      exit the study, will undergo a dose taper period of up to 18 days and 4-week follow-up.
