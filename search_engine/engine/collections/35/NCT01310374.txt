      influenza virus vaccine in a single center in China. 200 subjects aged 18-60 years will be
      enrolled under the premise of informed consent and receive one dose of vaccine. All
      vaccinations will be done by specific study personnel, who do not take part in the assessment
      of safety or immunogenicity. Adverse events will be recorded after vaccination and blood
      samples were collected at 0,7,14,28 days for antibody detection and split vaccine
      neutralizing antibody detection, determination of cellular immune function in the same time.

      The clinical program approved by the ethics committee will be performed by the researchers
      independently. Inspectors designated by the sponsor will take meticulous on-site audits to
      ensure the safety specifications during the whole process of research.
