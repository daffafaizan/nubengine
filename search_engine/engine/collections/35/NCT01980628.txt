      tyrosine kinase (BTK). Inhibition of BTK blocks downstream B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling
      pathways and thus prevents B-cell proliferation. In vitro, ibrutinib inhibits purified BTK
      and selected members of the kinase family with 10-fold specificity compared with non-BTK
      kinases. Phase 1 and 2 studies of ibrutinib in B-cell malignancies demonstrate modest
      toxicity and significant single agent activity in a variety of B-cell malignancies, including
      NHL.
