    
      This is an open-label, phase 2 signal-seeking study.

      Screening will begin by establishing a participant's initial eligibility and signing of the
      informed consent document. Eligible, enrolled patients will be assigned to one of 3 cohorts
      in a non-randomized fashion according to prior treatment history.

      Cohort A: Patients who have not received prior anti-PD-1 therapy, but may have previously
      experienced progressive disease or intolerance after up to two other systemic therapies
      (e.g., one or more hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitors) will receive nivolumab 480 mg IV
      every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks.

      Cohort B: Patients whose disease has progressed after anti-PD-1, either as a part of this
      trial or outside of this trial, may receive nivolumab 480mg IV q4weeks x 12 doses +
      ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV q4 weeks x 4 doses, then q12weeks x 2 doses.

      Cohort C: Patients who have anti-PD-(L)1-refractory BCC (defined as PD or ongoing SD at 36
      weeks) BCC after receiving anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy on CA209-8DP (Cohort A) or outside the
      study, with or without having received a hedgehog pathway inhibitor.

      Patients enrolled on Cohort A who demonstrate PD after nivolumab monotherapy may, if
      appropriate in the opinion of the investigator, move to Cohort B or Cohort C.

      Discontinuation of nivolumab or ipilimumab +nivolumab or relatlimab + nivolumab may be at the
      discretion of the investigator under circumstances including but not limited to the
      following:

        1. A complete response to therapy.

        2. A severe IMAR, defined as Grade 3 or greater.

        3. Documented disease progression warranting alternative systemic therapy

        4. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of study treatment

        5. Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons
