      John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biała Podlaska, no. 3/2018.

      The study was designed as single-blind Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and conducted on a
      group of 18 female football players from University Club of the Academic Sports Association
      of Pope John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biała Podlaska. Participants were
      randomly divided into two 9-person groups: A - used standard training and neuromuscular
      training (Kinetic Control) and B - used only standard training.

      None of the physiotherapists were personally involved in the preparation and the manner of
      performing the test. Before commencing the tests, each participant was familiarised with
      their course, expressed their informed written consent for the participation and random
      assignment to the specified tested group.

      The random placement was performed with the use of computer software.

      The players participate in two training cycles over a year: from July to December and from
      January to June. Therefore, the above mentioned training regime will be performed twice.

      A medical interview takes place before the training cycle. Physical examination, back pain
      functional scale (BPFS) and tests on the dynamographic platform will be performed two times -
      before and after each season.
