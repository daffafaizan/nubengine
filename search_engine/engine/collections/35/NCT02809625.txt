    
      About 100 patients with Brucellosis were conducted with conventional MRI and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI(DCE-MRI) scan. The variations of the value of ktrans（endothelial
      transfer constant），kep（reflux rate）,Ve(fractional extracellular fluid space volume) and
      Vp(fractional plasma volume) between the vertebral lesions,Early lesions of vertebral body
      and normal tissues were measured and compared. And under the receiver operating
      characteristic（ROC） curve analysis,we will calculate the sensitivity and specificity of
      Ktrans,Kep,Ve and Vp in the diagnosis and early diagnosis of brucella spondylitis .The values
      of Ktrans,Kep,Ve and Vp will be studied between the vertebral lesions and normal tissues, the
      early lesions of vertebral body and normal tissues.The sensitivity and specificity of both
      parameters (Ktrans、Kep、Ve、Vp)will be done.The valve of DCE-MRI in the diagnosis and early
      diagnosis of the brucella spondylitis will be analysed.
