      Center in Dallas, TX. Patients may be identified and referred by local area audiologist. The
      ANSHL study population will be defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to limit
      enrollment to individuals with idiopathic, progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss,
      to ensure appropriate candidates for treatment with study medications, and to identify those
      with a high likelihood of complying with the study protocol.
