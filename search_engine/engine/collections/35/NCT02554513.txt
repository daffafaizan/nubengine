    
      EPG has been used to treat apraxia of speech (AOS) as well as other speech production
      disorders (i.e., articulation disorders & cleft palate). SPT is one of the most
      systematically studied treatment approaches for AOS. Both treatment approaches are considered
      clinical treatment approaches/standards of care for AOS. The pseudopalate used in conjunction
      with EPG treatment is an acceptable device for treating speech production disorders including
      AOS. The pseudopalate is custom-fit for each patient and is similar to a dental retainer and
      is considered minimally invasive.

      The purpose of this research is to systematically examine the effects of treatment on speech
      production using EPG treatment vs. an SPT approach. The planned investigation is intended to
      explicate the acquisition, maintenance, and generalization effects of each treatment
      approach. The specific experimental questions to be addressed are as follows:

        1. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater accuracy of
           articulation of trained speech sounds produced in words?

        2. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater accuracy of
           articulation of untrained exemplars of trained speech sounds produced in words (i.e.,
           response generalization)?

        3. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater long term
           maintenance effects for trained speech sounds?

        4. Do different treatment approaches result in distinct ratings of functional communication
           skills via the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM; Doyle et al., 2012) and an
           outcome measure of speech intelligibility using the Assessment of Intelligibility of
           Dysarthric Speech (AIDS; Yorkston & Beukelman, 1981)?
