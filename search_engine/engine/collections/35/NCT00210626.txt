      cells and their effect often does not occur while a subject is in the ICU and acutely ill.
      The study hypothesis is that a higher hemoglobin (red blood cells) carries more oxygen and
      delivers oxygen to the tissues. This should increase the ability of the injured subject to
      tolerate the physical exertion involved in the recuperative process and thus recover earlier
      than someone with a lower hemoglobin.

      One milliliter of a colorless liquid is injected under the subjects skin weekly during their
      hospital stay and weekly for up to an additional 12 weeks after hospital discharge.
