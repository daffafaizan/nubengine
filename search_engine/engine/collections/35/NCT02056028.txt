      in a prospective cohort of patients who underwent hepatic resection between 2004 and 2012.
      Drains were maintained at least 7 days, and the bilirubin levels were measured in POD3, 5,
      and 7. Drains were removed if the bilirubin level in POD7 was inferior than in POD5, and less
      than 10 mg/dl. Statistical analysis on prognostic factors for biliary fistula was performed.
