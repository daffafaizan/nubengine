      virtually all of the chronic diseases that cause the majority of disability and death in the
      U.S., including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and cancer. Diet plays a central
      role in the regulation of chronic inflammation. However, until the investigators developed
      the dietary inflammatory index (DII) there had been no scientifically valid way to relate
      what individuals eat to the capacity of foods consumed to modulate inflammation. The new
      generation DII has now produced an impressive research base that ranges from predicting blood
      levels of inflammatory markers, to clinical conditions associated with inflammation, to a
      variety of health-related endpoints including cancer incidence, CVDs and mortality (several
      of which are already published). Connecting Health Innovations (CHI), LLC and the scientific
      and clinical research partners at the University of South Carolina are committed to
      translating these research findings to places of clinical need and public health relevance.
      That commitment to translation provides the motivation for the current proposal. The DII
      provides a tool that will form the basis of a counseling/instructional system aimed at
      helping patients and their providers to control chronic, systemic inflammation by improving
      the diet with specific, actionable dietary recommendations, counseling, and expert
      instruction. This project is part of Phase II of the grant, which includes: 1) Designing and
      implementing an intervention trial based on DII response associated recommendations aimed at
      reducing levels of chronic inflammation in two diverse populations in Columbia, South
      Carolina and 2) Providing data for developing methods for commercialization/ dissemination of
      the product and associated software.
