      hospital admissions. These attacks are difficult to predict and can devastate the lives of
      patients. A new tool is needed that can help to predict when an asthma attack is going to
      happen. This would help people recognise an attack earlier and allow treatment to be started
      sooner. This study will evaluate a new breathing monitor, to see whether it can detect asthma
      attacks. The study tests a new device, called 'N-Tidal C', which uses a method that has the
      potential to predict when attacks are about to happen. The investigators have found that
      people with asthma breathe out a gas, called carbon dioxide (CO2), in a different way to
      healthy people. The pattern of breathing out CO2 (the waveform) changes further when patients
      are having an attack of their disease. If patients could monitor their CO2, they may
      recognise when their asthma is getting worse, and take earlier action to avoid attacks
      getting out of hand and going to hospital.
