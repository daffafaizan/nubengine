    
      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells
      (CD22 CAR T-cells) in patients with high risk, relapsed CD22+ haematological malignancies
      (Leukemia and lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients
      will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD22 CAR Tcells.
      Patients will receive the CD22CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study
      will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD22 CAR T-cells in
      patients with high risk relapsed CD22+ malignancies
