      supplement daily for 12 weeks compared to placebo (a tablet that does not have active
      ingredients). This is a remote study, meaning all study data will be collected via the
      ClaimIt app, with the exception of a screening lab appointment and a Week 12 lab
      appointment.Participants will be asked to report on study compliance and respond to a series
      of questionnaires relating to symptoms of menopause, hot flashes, and quality of life.
