    
      A phase I study with an initial concentration/volume escalating part followed by an expanded
      cohort at the recommended dose (RD). This is an open label, multicentre study assessing the
      safety, tolerance, PK and efficacy of LTX-315 injected directly into transdermally accessible
      tumours on days 1 and 8.

      Additional weekly injections may be made, for up to a total of 6 injections.

      Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:

        1. Histologically confirmed malignant tumour

        2. Transdermally accessible lesion (in or close to the skin)

        3. Age â‰¥ 18 years

        4. ECOG Performance status (PS): 0 - 2

        5. Life expectancy: At least 3 months

      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety profile of LTX-315 by
      assessment of adverse events and abnormal laboratory values recorded during the study and to
      determine the recommended dose of LTX-315.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to preliminarily assess the anti-tumour activity of
      LTX-315 in patients with transdermally accessible tumours, monitor immunological response,
      pharmacokinetic assessment, and determine duration of response.
