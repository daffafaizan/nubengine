      weeks and followed by two booster sessions. Five sessions consist of in-vivo exposures. Prior
      to these sessions patients undergo a training of physical activity. Half of the patients
      complete training on a treadmill at 70% of their maximal oxygen uptake while the other half
      complete training at 30%.
