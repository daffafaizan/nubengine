      to their medical history, physical examination, blood testing, and computed tomography (CT)
      scan of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Those patients who qualify for the study will receive up
      to 4 intravenous doses of CRS-207, 21 days apart. After each infusion, they will be monitored
      overnight in an in-patient facility, including collection of blood specimens. Study
      participants will return after each infusion for outpatient follow-up visits for further
      blood tests and additional monitoring of safety and immune response to CRS-207. Participants
      will have repeat CT scans to measure tumor size after the 2nd dose and again after the 4th
      dose. On Day 91 participants will be discharged from the study. All study participants will
      be eligible to participate in a long-term follow-up study with a visit 6 months after the
      final dose of CRS-207 and annually thereafter for evaluation of disease progression,
      survival, and potential long-term toxicity of CRS 207.
