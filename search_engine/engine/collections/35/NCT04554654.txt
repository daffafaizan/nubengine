      embryo transfers within 6 months in a single center. Patients planned to be included in the
      study are started estrodiol 6 mg / day on day2-3 of mensturation. 12 days after the start of
      estrogen, patients who have endometrial thickness over 7 mm are then started vaginal
      progesterone supplementation as per routine practice and are eventually proceeded to embryo
      transfer either on day 4 or 6 of progesterone supplementation. In this study investigators
      are intended to measure endometrial thickness transvaginally on the day of embryo transfer to
      accurately determine the presence of endometrial compaction, assess serum progesterone
      levels, evaluate any possible correlations between endometrial compaction, serum progesterone
      levels and pregnancy rates.
