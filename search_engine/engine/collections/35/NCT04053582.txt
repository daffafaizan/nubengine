      disruptions in neurobiological processes and long-term psychiatric and health consequences,
      yet very little is known about interventions that may prevent them and the optimal time to do
      so. Not only is ELA associated with earlier onset and greater severity and comorbidity of
      depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, these individuals also evidence significantly
      poorer responses to psychological and pharmacological interventions when treated for these
      conditions. Consequently, there is a dire need to develop preventive interventions that
      target individuals with ELA exposure. The first step in this process is to establish
      malleability of neural mechanisms disrupted by ELA exposure to acute interventions. We use
      augmented mindfulness training, that is, a standard mindfulness training combined with
      real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) to influence and
      increase the plasticity of brain areas affected by ELA, in turn affecting state changes in
      symptoms in youth with ELA exposure. These fMRI tasks are designed to engage the PCC and
      mindfulness practice.

      Over the course of three years, 120 eligible youth with early life adversity or healthy
      controls will be recruited into the study. All healthy controls will receive AMT, and
      ELA-exposed youth will be randomly assigned to AMT, consisting of real-time fMRI with
      neurofeedback during mindfulness practice, or Sham, consisting of artificially calculated
      neurofeedback signals during mindfulness practice. Adolescents will complete self-report
      measures to assess state affective symptoms before and after receiving mindfulness training
      and scanning, and again one week later.
