      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan hydrochloride when administered
           with carboplatin in patients with relapsed or metastatic cervical cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase
           II)

      Secondary

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  To assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase
           II)

        -  To assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  To assess the tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of topotecan hydrochloride
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive oral topotecan hydrochloride on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete a quality-of-life questionnaire at baseline and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
