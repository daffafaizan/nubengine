    
      This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical
      characterization of individuals with ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, age-related
      macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.). We will accrue
      approximately 800 patients as experimental group. The control group consists of age/sex
      frequency-matched subjects who will be confirmed without ocular diseases. We will explore the
      environmental (including family history, life style, diet, physical activity,
      neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of oxidative stress and angiogenic factors,
      etc.) and genetic (including oxidative stress and angiogenic factors, etc.) risk factors. We
      will study the association between various environmental risk factors with the clinical
      characterization and correlation between the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of
      various ocular diseases.
