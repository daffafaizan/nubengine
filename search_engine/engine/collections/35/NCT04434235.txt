      during daily living activities and to withstand external loads. Stabilization-aspects of the
      cervical spine is very complex, passive (ligaments, joint capsule and the skin and active
      (muscles), and neurological subsystems are involved. Mostly proprioceptive testing and
      exercises like head and neck position sense testing and re-training have been an integral
      part of rehabilitation. Another method to evaluate spinal motor control is the assessment of
      spinal stiffness. The main objective of this study is to explore the effects of additional
      axial loading on motion control in healthy individuals. Does the motor control of the
      cervical spine in healthy subjects change with additional axial load or body position? A
      better understanding of spinal stiffness and neck position sense leads to novel insights into
      spinal cervical stabilization mechanisms.
