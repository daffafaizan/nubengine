      an annual incidence of 1 to 2 deaths per 1000 population. In the United States this
      translates to between 300,000 to more than 400,000 deaths annually. Results from numerous
      large, well designed clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for improving survival in patients with ischemic heart
      disease. However, measures used to risk stratify patients, such as left ventricular ejection
      fraction do not adequately identify those patients who can most benefit from ICD therapy. As
      a result, many patients who currently receive an ICD do not use the device. In addition, many
      more patients who could benefit from ICD therapy are outside of current guidelines and do not
      have access to this life-saving therapy.

      This prospective study was intended to determine how well the Harbinger Wedensky Modulation
      Index (WMI) technique risk stratifies patients into two groups: those needing antiarrhythmic
      therapy and those who do not need antiarrhythmic therapy.
