      disruption in the swallowing process. This swallowing dysfunction, also known as dysphagia,
      is often evident early in life and when severe can be permanent. Dysphagia can lead to an
      inability to take in enough food to maintain an adequate weight and result in malnutrition.
      It also can result in food going into the lungs instead of the stomach, resulting in an
      illness called aspiration pneumonia. Both of these complications may require feeding by tube
      either through the nose into the stomach or directly into the stomach via the abdominal wall,
      to bypass the swallowing process. This process is resource intense, can be associated with a
      number of complications and may result in a reduced quality of life for both the infant and
      caregivers. Currently, there are no effective treatments to change the natural course of
      dysphagia in this context.
