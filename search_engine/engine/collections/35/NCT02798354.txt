      Primary

      â€¢ To determine whether a QIC consisting of evidence-based best-practice methodologies,
      mini-root cause analyses, data sharing, and behavior change techniques, is associated with a
      reduction in 3 specific diagnostic error rates in a national group of pediatric primary care
      practices.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 40% reduction in missed diagnosis
           of adolescent depression.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 30% reduction in missed diagnosis
           of pediatric elevated blood pressure.

        -  Hypothesis 3: Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 45% reduction in delayed diagnosis
           of actionable laboratory results.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if a QIC's effect changes for wave 1 versus wave 2 participants, or for the
           second versus the first error a practice intervenes on.

        -  To further investigate the epidemiology of three ambulatory pediatric diagnostic errors:
           missed diagnosis of adolescent depression, missed diagnosis of pediatric elevated blood
           pressure, and delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory results.

        -  To evaluate patient outcomes related to these diagnoses including outcomes after
           positive depression screening, missed elevated blood pressure screening and delayed
           diagnosis of actionable laboratory values.
