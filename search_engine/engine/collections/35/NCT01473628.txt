    
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being in either
      group. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse
      than the other group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive radiation alone.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive radiation and rituximab.

      Radiation Therapy and Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive radiation therapy 5 days a week for 2 Â½ weeks (12 treatments). You will
      receive a separate consent form that will describe this procedure and its risks in more
      detail.

      If you are in Group 2, you will receive rituximab every week for 4 weeks, beginning with the
      start of radiation therapy. You will receive rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours. After
      radiation therapy, you will continue to receive rituximab every 2 months for a total of 4
      doses.

      Study Visits During Radiation Therapy:

      Every week during radiation therapy:

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

      Study Visits After Completing Radiation Therapy:

      Every two months for a total of 4 doses (during rituximab-only therapy):

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height and weight.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.

      Rituximab can be received outside MD Anderson as long as the outside doctor gives the drug in
      the same way.

      Routine Follow-up:

      You will also have routine follow-up visits every 3 months for the first 2 follow-up visits,
      every 6 months during the first 2 years, once a year during years 3 to 5 and every 2 years
      for years 5 to 15. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be recorded:

        -  Your skin lesions will be photographed.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have CT scans of your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

      End-of-Study Drug Visits:

      If you leave the study early:

        -  Your skin lesions will be photographed.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have CT scans of your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

      Every 3 months for 2 years:

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking. You will be asked how you are
           feeling and about any side effects you may be having.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 2 teaspoons) pregnancy
           test.

      Length of Study:

      You will continue treatment for up to 4 doses of rituximab and/or up to 15 radiation
      treatments. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      You will be off study after up to 15 years.
