      (COVID-19), including 2348 deaths. As the national medical team sent to Wuhan, the
      investigators proposed a psychological and physical rehabilitation based humanistic care
      regimen generated from experience in treating patients with COVID-19. The healthcare workers
      faced greater mental and physical pressure under long-term, high-intensity, high-risk working
      conditions. The investigators want to apply this regimen to the healthcare workers who
      participated in the treatment of COVID-19, to evaluate the positive effect of humanistic care
      on preventing depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
