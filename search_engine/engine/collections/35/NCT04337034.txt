      and occupational performance and satisfaction of a mobile phone supported and family-centred
      rehabilitation intervention (F@ce1.0) after stroke in Uganda. The purpose of the present
      proposal is to implement and evaluate F@ce on functioning in activities in daily living (ADL)
      and participation in everyday life among persons with stroke and their families.

      With recommendations on evaluation of complex interventions both outcomes and processes will
      be studied and hence both quantitative and qualitative methods will be applied. In a
      randomized controlled trial F@ce 2.0 will be evaluated compared to ordinary rehabilitation in
      urban/rural Uganda regarding; self-efficacy, perceived performance and participation in
      everyday activities, independence in ADL, health care utilization and the familiesÂ´ perceived
      participation in everyday activities. Qualitative data will explore experiences of people
      with stroke and family members of participating in F@ce 2.0. This research program has a
      multidisciplinary perspective for sustainable rehabilitation, a prerequisite for better
      living conditions for people with stroke in low/middle income countries.
