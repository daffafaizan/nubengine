      designed to evaluate feasibility and safety. The primary purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate the clinical feasibility of implanting the BBPM near a peripheral nerve for the
      treatment of chronic, intractable, pain in this case represented by chronic regional shoulder
      pain in hemiplegic stroke patients. This is a 48-week efficacy study with safety data
      collection throughout the study period and up to 2 years for all available subjects. Each
      study arm will receive therapeutic level stimulation for a total of 12 consecutive weeks
      (Weeks 1-12 for Active treatment group and Weeks 24-36 for the sham group) during the 48
      weeks.
