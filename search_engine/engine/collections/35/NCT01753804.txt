    
      This is a prospective study. All DMD patients that fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      are eligible although the study is weighted towards ambulant subjects aged 3 years or older.
      There will be 7 study visits and subjects will be in the study for a maximum of 3 years.
      Visits will occur every 6 months (+/- 1 month).

      Up to 250 DMD subjects planned in the following categories :

        -  75 % ambulant subjects aged between 3 and 18 years at study entry

        -  25% non-ambulant subjects with a maximum age of 18 years at study entry

      Subjects will be asked to perform muscle testing assessment with a clinical evaluator, such
      as walking for 6 minutes, climb stairs, breathe in a tube, see how they can move their arms
      and legs. They will be asked questions about how they feel overall and perform daily
      activities. These measurements will be assessed every 6 months.

      Urine and blood samples will be collected once a year to measure biomarkers that will allow
      to have a better overview of DMD.
