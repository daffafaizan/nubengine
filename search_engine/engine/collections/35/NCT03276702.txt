    
      This is a prospective, non-therapeutic study with two components: biopsy of tumor for genomic
      studies and prospective assessment of parental factors related to participation. All patients
      at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      approached for study participation. The re-biopsy is not mandatory and will only be performed
      after the patient and family have consented. A questionnaire to assess the impact and
      perception of an optional/research only biopsy will be administered following the decision
      regarding re-biopsy. For those consenting to the re-biopsy, approximately 4-8 weeks after
      biopsy, the family and patient will be asked to complete a second questionnaire to assess
      decisional regret.

      Participants may repeat participation in this trial with subsequent relapses, provided
      informed consent is obtained prior to each re-biopsy procedure. For those participants who
      consent to repeat participation, all protocol procedures will be repeated.
