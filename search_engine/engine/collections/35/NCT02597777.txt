      Hexapeptide-8 can improve oily skin. Up to 15 adult subjects will be recruited. Each half of
      the face will randomized to receive either topical treatment with AH8 10% Lotion formulated
      in Cetaphil® Moisturizing Facial Lotion or the placebo vehicle treatment consisting of
      Cetaphil® Moisturizing Facial Lotion only, at twice daily application for 4 weeks.

      The study consists of a total of 3 sessions: baseline visit, and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks for
      follow up assessment. Subjects will also be asked to complete an Oily Skin Self-Assessment
      Scale (OSSAS) and an Oily Skin Impact Scale (OSIS) survey at the first session. They will be
      filling out two OSSAS surveys (one for each side of the face) at the second and third
      sessions. The OSSAS survey includes subjective assessment of four components of oily skin:
      visual, blotting, tactile, and sensation. At each visit, the cosmetic appearance the facial
      skin will be scored clinically by a dermatologist using a validated 3-point scale for shine
      (1 = high, 2, moderate or 3 = low), and oiliness (1 = normal, 2 = easily visible or 3 =
      extensive) 16. High-resolution digital photographs of the facial skin with the use of
      photography and facial analysis instrumentation will be taken at baseline and at each visit
      to document facial appearance and for image analysis of shine level. Sebum of the left and
      right cheeks will be measured by a sebumeter to correlate to the oily appearance noted on the
      high resolution facial photographs.
