    
      The study is a retrospective register study of critically ill patients from Charité -
      Universitätsmedizin Berlin during 2000 and 2016 that had at least one measurement of plasma
      ferritin. Outcome, underlying diagnoses and HLH-2004 criteria (Henter JI et al. 2007) will be
      analyzed and the HScore of these patients will be calculated (Fardet L et al. 2014). All
      recorded data of the specific admission term in ICU will be used for the analysis. No
      follow-up of the patients after discharge will be performed in this study. The study does not
      involve any randomization or any drug testing.

      Update 2019: We expanded our database for the years until 2018 and also for the surgical and
      medical ICUs of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (from 256 to 2623 patients).
