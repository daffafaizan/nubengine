      blood pressure. Overall they are syndromes with multifactorial ethology and partly
      unclarified pathophysiology. Insulin resistance also occur in more seldom diseases with a
      more unified pathogenesis. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults with hypopituitarism is
      an example of one of those seldom diseases. Prolonged GHD is associated with abdominal
      overweight, dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular morbidity. Besides, GHD-patients have
      decreased insulin sensitivity presumably secondary to the altered body composition. Long term
      effects of GH-substitution improves insulin sensitivity but it is well-known that
      subcutaneous administration of GH acute worsen insulin sensitivity in both muscles- and
      liver-tissue. Recently it has been reported that insulin resistance in patients with type 2
      diabetes is associated with the induction of a signal protein called suppressor of cytokine
      signalling (SOCS). ItÂ´s interesting that GH also induces a stimulation of SOCS.
