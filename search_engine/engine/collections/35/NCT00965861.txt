    
      Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) is committed to improvement and excellence in clinical
      research and correlative science. To this end, the SCRI Oncology Research Consortium will
      collect written consent from patients allowing the use of their tumor tissue sample(s) for
      testing/analysis at a future date. Future testing may include assays for newly identified
      markers of potential prognostic and/or therapeutic value. These markers may be specific to an
      individual cancer type, or they may be present more generally in cancer and/or other
      conditions.

      This study will consist of a registry of patients who have agreed to allow their tissue
      sample(s) (even those taken prior to their participation in an SCRI-sponsored trial) to be
      used by the SCRI Oncology Research Consortium at some point in the future for testing and
      analysis of expression analysis and/or analysis of tumor markers. The registry will be
      contained in an electronic database, and will be sorted by disease indication. (Note:
      Patients will not be asked to return at a future date and have tissue samples collected;
      rather, SCRI will have the authorization to obtain pre-existing samples).
