      would be enhanced by shortened duration therapy in key populations. The "next generation" DAA
      regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (300mg/120mg), an NS3/4a protease inhibitor and NS5A
      inhibitor, provides key features for potential simplified shortened duration therapy in
      people with early liver disease (F0-2), including pangenotypic activity, high efficacy, and
      favourable on-treatment HCV RNA kinetics. The addition of sofosbuvir (400 mg) may provide
      further feasibility for shortened duration therapy with a potent triple class DAA regimen.

      Shortened duration therapy (4-6 weeks) has been evaluated in chronic HCV populations with
      several DAA regimens, with generally unfavourable outcomes (SVR<50%) for 4 week
      durations.8-11 In a study among a predominantly African American population of 4 week
      duration therapy of 3 or 4 DAAs, with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/GS-9451 (protease inhibitor) and
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/GS-9451/GS-9669 (non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor), SVR was only 40%
      (10/25) and 20% (5/25) in the 3 and 4 DAA regimen groups, respectively.10 In separate phase
      II studies that included evaluation of 6 weeks sofosbuvir (400mg)/velpatasvir
      (100mg)/voxilaprevir (100 mg) in treatment naÃ¯ve patients without cirrhosis, SVR was 88%
      (29/33) among patients with genotype 2, 3, 4, or 6,12 93% (14/15) in patients with genotype
      13,13 and and 71% (24/34) in patients with genotype 1.14 Non-published data (provided by
      Gilead Sciences) from the latter study demonstrates a higher SVR (88%, 14/16) in the
      sub-population of patients with F0-2. Thus, in patients with relatively early liver disease
      virological failure is uncommon with 6-week duration sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
      therapy.

      These studies would suggest that a 6-week duration therapy, particularly with a potent 3 DAA
      triple class regimen, may be feasible for many patients with chronic HCV infection, but a
      4-week duration would probably compromise treatment outcomes. However, in a small study
      (n=16) among younger people who inject drugs (PWID) with early liver disease (<50 years,
      F0-2) in Denmark, a 4-week regimen of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir plus ribavirin provided a per
      protocol (PP)(n=13) SVR of 92% (one relapse) with intention to treat (ITT) SVR of 75%. In the
      same study 16 PWID were treated with the same regimen plus pegylated interferon with PP and
      ITT SVR of 100% and 94%, respectively. Further evidence for the potential of ultra-short
      duration DAA therapy comes from a response-guided study in Hong Kong. Patients with HCV
      genotype 1b were treated with three different triple class DAA regimens, including
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir + asunaprevir, sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + simeprevir, or sofosbuvir +
      daclatasvir + asunaprevir, and those with an ultra-rapid virological response (HCV RNA <500
      IU/mL at day 2; 18/26) had treatment duration shortened to three weeks. The SVR rate was 100%
      (18/18) in the three-week treated population.

      While efficacy has been suboptimal in most studies of short duration DAA therapy to date, the
      emergence of clinically significant resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) has not been
      seen, and retreatment with the same regimen for 12 weeks has been successful.8,9 The FOURward
      study examined the safety and efficacy of short-duration therapy (4 or 6 weeks) with
      sofosbuvir + daclatasvir/asunaprevir/beclabuvir in patients with HCV genotype 1 and without
      cirrhosis.9 Although efficacy was suboptimal (SVR12 43%), among those with virological
      relapse (n=16), 44% (n=7) had no emergent RAS detected at failure. Furthermore, in the nine
      patients with treatment-emergent NS5A RAS, the clinical significance was uncertain, as all
      emergent NS5A RAS conferred low-nanomolar resistance in vitro. Regardless of RAS emergence,
      retreatment of patients who experienced virological relapse with 12 weeks sofosbuvir +
      daclatasvir/asunaprevir/beclabuvir + ribavirin resulted in SVR of 100%. C-SWIFT evaluated the
      efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir + elbasvir/grazoprevir in patients with HCV genotype 1 and
      without cirrhosis for four and six weeks, with SVR12 rates of 32% (10/31) and 87% (26/30),
      respectively.8 All patients with virological relapse who received retreatment with 12 weeks
      of sofosbuvir + elbasvir/grazoprevir + ribavirin achieved SVR12, despite the majority having
      NS5A and/or NS3 RAS.

      The combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg) + glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (300mg/120mg) has not been
      evaluated as a shortened duration triple class DAA regimen. It has been evaluated as a 12 and
      16-week regimen in combination with ribavirin for treatment of prior glecaprevir-pibrentasvir
      virological failure (8 or 12-week duration prior therapy), with very high efficacy of 96%
      (22/23) and good tolerability (Wyles D. et al. ILC 2018). A non-ribavirin containing regimen
      would be expected to have further enhanced tolerability.
