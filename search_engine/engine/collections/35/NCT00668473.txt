      the skin and internal organs. One of the earliest pathologic changes in patients with SSc is
      damage to the blood vessels. Many abnormalities have been found in the inner layer of the
      blood vessel, the enothelial tissue. It is known that there are mediators in the blood and
      tissues of the body that affect the endothelial tissue. These are called angiogenic (promote
      blood vessel formation) and angiostatic (inhibit blood vessel formation) mediators. Many of
      these mediators have been examined in the peripheral blood of patients with SSc, but fewer of
      these mediators have been examined at the site of action, in the tissue near the
      microvasculature. We hypothesize that there are differences in the levels of
      angiogenic/angiostatic mediators between healthy subjects and subjects with SSc. In addition,
      we propose that there are differences at skin sites that have varying levels of involvement
      with SSc of these angiogenic/angiostatic factors in subjects with SSc.
