      engage in additional exercise sessions at home 4 days/week. The exercise program will be run
      out of two sites (Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI) - Rumsey Centre in Toronto, and the
      Centre for Community, Clinical Applied Research Excellence (CCCARE) at the University of
      Waterloo). The supervised exercise sessions modeled after the standard TRI Cardiovascular
      Prevention and Rehabilitation program, including aerobic training, resistance training and
      education/counseling. The active group will receive strategy training to simultaneously
      improve their diet in conjunction with our newly developed Brain Health Food Guide (EX+BHFG);
      the placebo control group (EX+BHEd) will receive brain health education to control for time
      and social participation. [NOTE All participants must also be enrolled in the SCD cohort of
      the CCNA and undergo the CCNA's COMPASS-ND assessment at the beginning of the trial.] The
      study is 6 months in duration and requires participants to attend 2.5 hr weekly sessions (1
      hr supervised exercise, 0.5 hr exercise/stress education and 1 hr nutrition or brain health
      education) and to exercise on their own an additional 3-4 times per week. Participants are
      assessed on measures of cognition, brain health (MRI), functional status at baseline, post
      intervention and 6 month follow-up.
