      leukocytes, INR, bilirubin, creatinine, c-reactive protein, CK, CK-MB, Tnt, BNP, sodium,
      potassium, magnesium) are taken at 8 a.m. Study laboratory tests (sensitive ischemia markers,
      remodelling marker MMP-9 and CgA as surrogate marker for increased sympathetic activity) are
      taken four times during study period at the same time as cardiac ECHOes and Holtering. Gene
      sample is taken once on day one.

      Primary outcome measurement is to document the incidence of myocardial dysfunction and the
      predictive factors during the hospital stay and at three months.

      Secondary outcome is to assess the impact of cardiac problems on morbidity and mortality
      during first three months.
