      objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of 2 different modes of TENS: conventional
      TENS (c-TENS) and mixed-frequency TENS (m-TENS). Randomization will determine the mode that
      the patient has to test during the first month.

      Each patient will test successively each mode during 1 month at home (3 sessions 1 hour/day).
      Then, the patient will test the other mode during the second month. Up to 6 months, the
      patient will be free to use the mode of TENS he wants.
