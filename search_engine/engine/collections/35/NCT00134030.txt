      I. Compare whether adjuvant maintenance therapy comprising doxorubicin, cisplatin, and
      high-dose methotrexate (MAP) alone vs MAP combined with ifosfamide and etoposide improves
      event-free survival of patients with resectable high-grade osteosarcoma who achieve a poor
      histological response (HR) to neoadjuvant induction therapy comprising MAP.

      II. Compare whether adjuvant maintenance therapy comprising MAP alone vs MAP and
      PEG-interferon alfa-2b improves event-free survival of patients with resectable high-grade
      osteosarcoma who achieve a good HR to neoadjuvant induction therapy comprising MAP.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. II. Compare short- and
      long-term toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare quality of life of
      patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare event-free survival and overall survival of
      patients with localized osteosarcoma treated with these regimens.

      V. Correlate biological or clinical changes with histological response and outcomes in
      patients treated with these regimens.

      VI. Determine outcomes of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: (MAP; weeks 1-10) Patients receive doxorubicin IV continuously over 48
      hours on days 1-2 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1 and 6. Patients
      also receive high-dose methotrexate (MTX)* IV over 4 hours on day 1 in weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10.
      Patients then proceed to surgery.

      NOTE: *Patients must receive >= 2 but =< 6 doses of high-dose MTX.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo amputation or limb salvage surgery in week 11. Tumor tissue is
      evaluated for histological response to induction therapy. Patients whose tumor is not
      amenable to macroscopically complete surgical resection undergo radiotherapy and/or other
      investigational therapy off study. Patients who undergo macroscopically complete surgical
      resection of the primary tumor or metastases AND who have no disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity proceed to maintenance therapy.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to histological
      response (good [< 10% viable tumor] vs poor [? 10% viable tumor]). Patients in each group are
      stratified according to site of primary tumor and presence of metastases.

      GROUP 1: (good histological response) Patient are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms within
      35 days after surgery.

      ARM I: (MAP; weeks 12-29) Patients receive doxorubicin IV continuously over 48 hours on days
      1-2 in weeks 12, 17, 22, and 26 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 in weeks 12 and
      17. Patients also receive high-dose MTX IV over 4 hours on day 1 in weeks 15, 16, 20, 21, 24,
      25, 28, and 29.

      ARM II: (MAPifn; weeks 12-104) Patients receive doxorubicin, cisplatin, and high-dose MTX as
      in arm I. Patients than receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once daily on day 1 in
      weeks 30-104.

      GROUP 2: (poor histological response) Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms within
      35 days after surgery.

      ARM I: (MAP; weeks 12-29) Patients receive doxorubicin, cisplatin, and high-dose MTX as in
      group 1 arm I.

      ARM II: (MAPIE; weeks 12-40) Patients receive doxorubicin IV continuously over 48 hours on
      days 1-2 in weeks 12, 20, 28, and 36 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 in weeks
      12 and 28. Patients also receive high-dose MTX IV over 4 hours on day 1 in weeks 15, 19, 23,
      27, 31, 35, 39, and 40. Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 in weeks 16,
      24, and 32 and on days 1-3 in weeks 20 and 36 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in
      weeks 16, 24, and 32.

      In both groups, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 1?-3 months for 2 years,
      every 2-4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 6 years, and then every 6-12 months
      thereafter. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK
