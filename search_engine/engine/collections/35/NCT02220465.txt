      to disproportionate rates of morbidity/mortality (MM) among low income underserved adults.
      Comprehensive interventions incorporating treatment of multiple risk behaviors can have
      immense public health impact. The goal of this study is to improve uptake of PA during the
      pre-quit period by promoting low to moderate intensity PA (LMPA/walking) during the pre-quit
      preparatory period to promote smoking cessation among low-income sedentary smokers. Eligible
      participants (sedentary, >5 cigs/day) will be randomized to 8-week LMPA vs. standard of care
      (SCC) intervention. LMPA group intervention focuses on (a) increasing daily steps using a
      tailored algorithm with a goal of reaching 10,000 steps/day by Week 4 (quit day) and (b)
      integrates PA with evidence-based smoking cessation programming by explicitly linking short
      bouts of PA with urge management training during the pre-quit period. The SCC group receives
      standard care smoking cessation counseling. Group differences in quit day reduction
      (extinction) of smoking urge reactivity using an analog cue-exposure paradigm, and smoking
      quit rates at 1-week and 1-month follow-up will be examined.
