      outcomes in trauma patients due to its negative hemostatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and
      renal effects. Current evidence has reported that massively bleeding hypothermic trauma
      patients have higher odds of mortality in the first 24 hours of hospital admission, increased
      length of stay, and increased need for transfusion. Standard hospital blankets are used to
      passively warm patients through resuscitation and treatment until arrival to the ICU.
      Interventions such as active heating through thermal blankets should be considered to prevent
      and treat hypothermia upon arrival of patients than standard warmed hospital blankets to
      prevent deleterious outcomes in this population.
