      person CME sessions, interactive game/virtual patient computer software and two 30 minute
      DVD/Web-based CME opportunities that the physicians can review at their leisure. These
      educational interventions were not completed as part of this research.

      A control group will be comprised of those healthcare professionals who did not complete the
      CME survey.

      Completion of the post education survey would be completed even if there was no study. The
      reward given to PCP's (free enrollment in CME session and either lab coat or $40 CME credit)
      was given for clinical purposes only and not for research. The study consists of the
      collection of PCP referral rates prior to the educational opportunity and then after the CME
      looking for a change to referral rates.

      In June of 2009, an Obesity Educational Intervention Summit was attended by PCPs. This
      research seeks approval to perform data pulls consisting of referrals from their practice to
      the GI/Nutrition Clinic for potential bariatric surgery evaluation.

      The information to be collected regarding the primary care providers' referral rates will be
      collected by a CDIS data pull by a data broker. The biostatistician will link survey
      responses to referral patterns and education type and will be true, only individual to have
      access to direct identifiers and in turn will provide PI and study team with de-identified
      summary data.
