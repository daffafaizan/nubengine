      brain may increase growth-enhancing factors of axons and generate active neurons in the
      receptor. It has been found that after introducing hematopoietic cells in the subarachnoid
      space of the spinal cord, these cells may be transported through the cerebrospinal fluid and
      can be deliver more efficiently to the injured area, when compared to the intravenous route.
      Patients will be stimulated 4 times and then harvest the bone marrow. Bone marrow will be
      processed in order to obtain hematopoietic cells (CD34+) and minimize the erythrocytes
      amount. A inoculum of 5 to 10mL of stem cells will be infused intrathecally. Patients will be
      evaluated with the "Battelle Developmental Inventory" before the procedure and one and six
      months after that. An MRI will be performed before the procedure and six months after that.
