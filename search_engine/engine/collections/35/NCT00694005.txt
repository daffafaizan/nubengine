      (<50%) usually did not require side branch stenting, but owing to several putative mechanism
      including dissection, thrombosis formation, embolization of plaque debris, ostial compromise
      by displaced stent strut, and snow plow effect, the side branch might be compromised. In this
      situation, the strategy to achieve optimal results has not been reported. Recently, FFR study
      showed that most jailed side branch (vessel size >2.0 mm. DS>50%) after main branch stenting
      did not have functional significance. We compared strategies with or without routine kissing
      balloon dilatation for less than 50% stenosis after simple DES crossing for bifurcation
      lesions (bifurcation type 1.1.0, 1.0.0, and 0.1.0 according to Medina classification) with
      serial change of FFR measurement.
