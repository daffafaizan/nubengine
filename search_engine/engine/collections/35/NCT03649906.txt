      CT-guided micro-coil locating method. After discussion, the method of micro-coil pre-loaded
      in the puncture needle and sealed first, and then for subsequent locating has more
      advantageous. The method avoids the direct penetration of the puncture needle into the
      atmosphere during operation, and the operation is simpler. In vitro tests of isolated lung
      specimens and pre-tests of 9 clinical patients were carried out. The results showed that this
      method not only reduced the number of operators on site, but also had the tendency to shorten
      the operation time, reduce the incidence of pneumothorax, and improve the success rate.
      However, there is currently no rigorous scientific research to provide objective evidence for
      its safety and effectiveness.

      Therefore, this study intends to use a single set of target values non-randomized controlled
      trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the optimized pre-loaded micro-coil
      locating method in pulmonary small nodules.
