      Primary

        -  Provide continuation therapy with oblimersen (G3139) and dacarbazine to patients with
           advanced malignant melanoma who obtained response or stabilization of disease after
           prior treatment with this therapy on GENTA-GM301.

      Secondary

        -  Determine serious adverse events in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, continuation study.

      Patients receive oblimersen (G3139) IV continuously on days 1-5 and dacarbazine IV over 1
      hour on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who complete 8 courses of treatment may
      receive additional courses at the discretion of the physician.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for up to 2 years after initiation of GENTA-GM301
      protocol.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 375 patients will be accrued for this study.
