      study of ECLS (extracorporeal life support) in OHCA suggested further prospective multicenter
      studies to define population with OHCA that would benefit from ECLS.

      Aim: to perform a prospective randomized multicenter clinical study comparing use of
      prehospital intraarrest hypothermia, mechanical chest compression device, ECLS and early
      invasive investigation and treatment (coronary angiography/percutaneous coronary intervention
      [PCI]; pulmonary angiography/percutaneous embolectomy; aortography) in all patients with OHCA
      of presumed cardiac origin compared to standard of care.

      Planned intervention: patients with witnessed OHCA without ROSC (return of spontaneous
      circulation) after a minimum of 5 minutes of ACLS by emergency medical service (EMS) team
      will be after fulfilling of inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study randomized in a 1:1
      design to standard vs. hyperinvasive arm. Patients in standard arm will be further managed as
      per recent guidelines. In hyperinvasive arm, mechanical compression device together with
      intranasal cooling will be immediately instituted and patients will be transferred to cardiac
      center directly to cathlab under ongoing CPR. After admission to cathlab, overall status,
      ROSC and ECLS inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated and in case of no
      contraindications to ECLS and no ROSC or ROSC with shock, veno-arterial ECLS will be started
      as soon as possible, not later than 60 minutes after cardiac arrest onset. After ECLS
      institution, mild hypothermia will be continued by means of ECLS cooling and immediate
      invasive investigation will be performed in all patients.

      Standard postresuscitation care will follow.
