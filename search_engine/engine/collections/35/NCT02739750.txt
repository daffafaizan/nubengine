      pioglitazone, those that are randomized to placebo or 15 mg pioglitazone for 12 months (per
      the criteria in the main study) will also undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of
      the lumbar spine at L1, L2 and L3. MR spectroscopy of the lumbar spine (if they choose as
      this is ancillary study) will be performed 3 times over the course of the study.
