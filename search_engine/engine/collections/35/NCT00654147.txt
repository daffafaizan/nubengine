    
      A009 is a prospective, randomized, open-label pilot study to assess virologic suppression and
      immune recovery rates associated with a two-drug potent antiretroviral regimen of raltegravir
      and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir and a three-drug regimen with raltegravir and
      two nRTIs (emtricitabine/tenofovir) in treatment-naïve subjects.

      HIV-1-infected subjects who are antiretroviral drug-naïve and have plasma HIV-1 RNA levels
      ≥5000 copies/ml obtained within 30 days prior to study entry will be randomized 1:1 to
      Raltegravir 400 mg BID + LPV 400 mg/RTV 100 mg BID (Arm A) or Raltegravir 400 mg BID + FTC
      200 mg/TDF 300 mg QD (Arm B).

      Subjects will have measurements of HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts at pre-entry and
      entry. The average of these measurements will be used to establish their baseline values.
      Following entry, subjects will have plasma HIV-1 RNA samples drawn at days 2, 4, 8 and at
      weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 and at virologic failure. CD38 expression on CD4+/CD8+
      cells and CD38/HLA-DR activation antigen on CD4+ and CD8+ cells and subsets T-cell percentage
      will be done at entry, day 8 and weeks 4, 8, 24 and at virologic failure by advanced flow
      cytometry.
