      that is specific to their ancestry. Smokers will be randomized to receive hypothetical
      information about their genetic status and consider how they think they would respond if such
      results were actually presented to them. They will be randomly assigned to receive one of
      four sets of hypothetical genetic results: 1) High risk of lung cancer and high genetic
      African ancestry, 2) High risk of lung cancer and low genetic African ancestry, 3) Low risk
      of lung cancer and high genetic African ancestry, or 4) Low risk of lung cancer and low
      genetic African ancestry. After being given this hypothetical information, participants will
      complete brief questionnaires assessing perceived risk of lung cancer, worry about cancer,
      psychological distress, and motivation to quit smoking.
