      invasive disease (invasive breast tumor sizeâ‰¥1cm and/or positive axillary lymph nodes) after
      platinum and taxanes based neoadjuvant chemotherapy are enrolled (n = 286). Patients are
      assigned to the chemotherapy group or the observation group at a 1:1 ratio randomly 4-6 weeks
      after surgery. Patients in the chemotherapy group are given anthracycline combined with
      cyclophosphamide regimen for 4 cycles. At the same time, the blood and tissue samples are
      collected for relevant tests. Follow up every 3-6 months and record recurrences and deaths.
