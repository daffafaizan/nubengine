    
      This is a case-control study, that will consist of one routine assessment by a vestibular
      physiotherapist in an outpatient clinic in Tel Aviv ("Clalit Health Services"). The session
      will last approximately 90 minutes, and will include 40-60 participants.

      Two groups of patients (30-70 years old) will be assigned to this study:

        1. Patients with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).

        2. Healthy patients (Control Group).

      Both groups will undergo routine physical assessment which is done to diagnose if the patient
      has BPPV or not. The physical assessment includes quick changes in body and head position.

      In addition to the routine physical assessment, heart rate variability parameters will be
      monitored during the whole session in patients in both groups (using Polar watch RS800CX).
      Furthermore, all patients will be asked to test their grip strength (using a hand-held
      dynamometer), moving from sitting to standing 5 times in a row and to fill two
      questionnaires.

      The patients that were diagnosed with BPPV will be treated with the routine vestibular
      physiotherapy, performed by the same physiotherapist who did the physical assessment.

      Statistical analysis of the data will be performed in IBM SPSS Statistics software (version
      24), and a statistical significance level of a p-value < 0.05 will be considered significant.
      Normality distribution will be tested with the Kolmagorov-Smirnov test.

      Parametric tests suitable for the analysis of the data in this study are:

        1. Paired and unpaired t-tests.

        2. Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

      Non-parametric tests suitable for the analysis of the data in this study are:

        1. Mann-Whitney.

        2. Wilcoxon.

      Spearman coefficient will be used to examine correlations.
