      free, unoperated patients using ultrasonography (non invasive). Part 2 is the administration
      of the block to patients that have persistent pain after breast cancer surgery. Before and
      after the block we will take a detailed pain history and do neurophysiological tests called
      quantitative sensory testing (QST). These tests assess the patients' ability to feel warmth,
      cold and test their thresholds for pain. The block is then administered using ultrasound
      guidance and 20mls of 0.25% bupivacaine is injected in the pectoral muscles on the side with
      pain. Thirty minutes after the block, the pain is re assessed and the QST is repeated.
