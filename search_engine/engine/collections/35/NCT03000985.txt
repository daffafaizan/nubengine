    
      Objectives We conducted a randomized study in two groups to evaluate the impact of a
      psychoeducational program for caregivers.

      Methods 60 patients with a DSM-V diagnosis of schizophrenia and their families' caregivers
      are recruited. Families' caregivers are randomly assigned to receive either a 6 session
      psychoeducation program, or no psychoeducation.

      Baseline evaluations:

      Patients: symptomatology (PANSS), medication adherence (MARS); Families' Caregivers: Quality
      of Life (S-CGQoL), Burden (Zarit), knowledge of disease (KAST), therapeutic alliance (4PAS
      caregivers), depression (CES-D), medication adherence (CRS).
