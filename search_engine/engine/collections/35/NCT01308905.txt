      improve the understanding of how tumors grow and how they respond to various treatments.
      These changes will be compared with results of the physical examination and scans (CT and
      MRI) that are done as part of clinical care. Images will be made showing the distribution
      throughout the body of substances containing a small amount of radioactive material. This
      procedure is called a PET scan. The radioactive substances (tracer compound) in this study
      are [F-18] FLT.
