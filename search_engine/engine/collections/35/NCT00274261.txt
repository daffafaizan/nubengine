      active . Approximately two-thirds or 38 million women use some form of birth control and/or
      STD prevention. With growing awareness of the risk of STDs, increasing numbers of women will
      require contraceptive methods that provide protection against STDs in addition to providing
      the basic contraceptive function. Currently there is no single, reasonably effective method
      to achieve both ends. Condoms, both male and female, present problems of acceptability for
      the partners of many at-risk women and, thus, cannot be considered an effective contraceptive
      and STD preventive for many people. A spermicide that also has the ability to prevent
      transmission of STDs would be a major advance, and of tremendous value to women worldwide.

      C31G is an effective spermicide with in vitro activity equal to that of N-9 . C31G has been
      found to be a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent in vitro or in animals, active against both
      gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including chlamydia, and a range of antibiotic
      resistant strains. It is also active against enveloped viruses including HIV and HSV. Thus,
      the primary objective of the study is to determine the contraceptive efficacy of C31G vaginal
      gel compared to Conceptrol® Vaginal Gel. The secondary objectives are to determine the safety
      and acceptability of the compounds with use over a period of six months or twelve months.
      Additional evaluations include the incidence of urinary tract infections (UTI), bacterial
      vaginosis (BV) and yeast vaginitis following the use of C31G vaginal gel compared to
      Conceptrol® Vaginal Gel.
