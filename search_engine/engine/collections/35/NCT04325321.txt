      enrolled from 3 large medical centers in the Providence, Rhode Island area. Between 2 and 4
      weeks after discharge, clinically stable patients will undergo an in-person comprehensive
      interview to identify the events proximal to the onset of TS symptoms, complete a battery of
      psychosocial questionnaires and undergo a validated laboratory stress protocol. Baseline and
      reactive changes in measures of autonomic nervous system activity (epinephrine and
      norepinephrine - primary outcome), and in the secondary outcomes of cardiac vagal control and
      left ventricular function (ejection fraction; regional and global longitudinal strain
      assessed with speckle tracking echocardiography) will be assessed. Echocardiographic
      evaluations will be repeated 12 months thereafter together with information on major adverse
      cerebrovascular events.
