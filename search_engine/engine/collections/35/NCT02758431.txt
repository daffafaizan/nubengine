      impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, is a major risk factor for the development
      of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Male aging is associated with a gradual and variable
      decline in serum testosterone (T) and low T is associated with accelerated CV aging. The
      purpose of this research is to determine the key functional mechanisms underlying accelerated
      CV aging in older men with low T. The overall hypothesis is that mitochondrial dysfunction
      and oxidative stress are mechanisms underlying the apparent accelerated CV aging in older men
      with low T. To test this hypothesis Aim 1 will use cross-sectional comparisons of young and
      older men with normal T (â‰¥400 ng/dl), and older men with chronically low T (<300 ng/dl). To
      better isolate the effects of low T from factors that change with aging and chronic low T,
      Aim 2 will expand on the cross-sectional comparisons by assessing measures of CV function,
      oxidative stress burden and mitochondrial function in older men with normal T before and
      after randomization to short-term (28 d) gonadal suppression (gonadotropin releasing hormone
      antagonist, GnRHant) + placebo (PL), GnRHant+T alone, or GnRHant+T+aromatase inhibitor (AI).
      AI will control for the effects of aromatization of T to estradiol (E2), and thereby isolate
      T effects while suppressing E2, a potent modulator of CV function. The results from this
      research should provide new mechanistic insight into the processes that mediate the
      impairment in CV function at the cellular and systemic level in older men with low T. These
      studies will lead to a better understanding of the independent role of T in age-related
      changes in CV function and the mechanisms of action, which will help guide future
      sex-specific therapies for the prevention of CVD.
