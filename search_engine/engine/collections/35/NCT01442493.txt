      States and may be associated with drug use and its associated problems. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel approach to the organization methadone
      treatment in which the patient rules and staff roles of the clinic will be modified for study
      participants as compared to patients receiving standard methadone treatment.
