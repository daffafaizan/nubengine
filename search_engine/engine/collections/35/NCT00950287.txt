      short term complications and alterations in neurodevelopment. Duration and amplitude of the
      bradycardias depend on the time delay between the beginning of the bradycardia and the
      intervention of the nurse.

      The purpose of the study is to test in clinical units and in real life a new method set for
      early detection of bradycardia in preterm infants.

      Each preterm infant cardio-respiratory traces will be recorded during two 4-hours periods of
      time (the first one at the time of occurrence of apnea-bradycardias and the second one during
      the following week). During those periods, the alarms of the monitors usually used in the
      units will also be recorded through automatic detection and these alarms will be compared
      with the alarms generated by the algorithm tested, for false positive and precocity of the
      detection. A false positive alarm is a detection which is not associated with a bradycardia
      of less than 80 bpm. The system will be considered efficient if it allows an earlier
      detection of severe bradycardias without increasing the number of false positive detection.
