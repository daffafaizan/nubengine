      difficile infection (CDI), aims to (1) to investigate the virulence mechanisms of C.
      difficile ribotype 002, by analysing its growth, cytotoxicity, and metabolite production in
      vitro and in vivo. The investigators also aim (2) to compare these virulence mechanisms with
      other common ribotypes in Asia, and (3) to correlate these with important clinical outcomes.
      The results of this study will have a major significance to the medical and scientific
      community. The results of this study will have a major significance to the medical and
      scientific community. The mechanistic data will point to important molecular pathways that
      can be targeted for novel therapies; whereas the phenotypic data will inform the
      investigators of its virulence and therefore will be useful for disease surveillance and
      public health interventions. The identified toxin(s) and metabolite(s) may be useful as
      prognostic biomarkers to stratify patients with different outcomes, as patients with a worse
      outcome may require more aggressive therapy. Given the prevalence and severity of this
      ribotype, the results will be useful for gastroenterologists, microbiologists, infectious
      diseases physicians and public health specialists in the Asia Pacific region.
