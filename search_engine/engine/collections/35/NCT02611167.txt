      at one of four doses: 1 x 10 6 MSC/kg, 3 x 10 6 MSC/kg, 6 x 10 6 MSC/kg, or 10 x 10 6 MSC/kg
      of body weight to a population of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). The
      infusion will be at 1 week after the baseline visit, following two screening visits. Patients
      will be followed until 52 weeks after the infusion visit. The safety of the therapy, as well
      as the impact of the therapy on the rate of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression, will be
      assessed.
