      and blood vessel problems like heart attack and stroke compared to people that do not have
      kidney problems. Aspirin, clopidogrel and ticagrelor prevent blood clots building up in the
      vessels. If a blood clot is present in one vessel, it could stop oxygen carrying blood to get
      to a specific organ, and that could cause problems like heart attack or stroke. There is very
      little knowledge about the way this group of medicines works in people with chronic kidney
      disease as well as it works in individuals with normal kidney function.
