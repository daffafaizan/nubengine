    
      Patients with AML with one of 5 prognostic categories based on modified cytogenetic-molecular
      stratification (European Leukemia Net Prognostic System - ENL)

      Favorable risk

      t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11 Mutated
      NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (NK) Mutated CEBPA (NK)

      Intermediate I risk

      Mutated NPM1 with FLT3-ITD (NK) Wild-type NPM1 and FLT3-ITD (NK) Wild-type NPM1 without
      FLT3-ITD (NK)

      Intermediate II risk

      t(9;11)(p22;q22); MLLT3-MLL cytogenic abnormalities other than favorable or adverse

      Adverse risk

      Inv(3)(q21q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21;q26.2); RPN-EVI1

      Very adverse risk monosomal karyotype (MK): -5 or del(5q); -7; abnl(17p); complex karyotype

      Goals:

        -  Evaluation of the impact of therapy tailored to the risk factors on outcome of AML
           patients aged ≤ 60.

        -  Evaluation of the possibility to improve the results of induction therapy through the
           use of early 2nd induction in patients with persistent leukemic infiltration of the bone
           marrow at the 14th day,

        -  Evaluation of the impact of the minimal residual disease (MRD) presence assessed by
           Immunophenotyping method, on the results of treatment of AML patients aged ≤ 60,

        -  Assessing the significance of monitoring the number of leukemic stem cells (LSC) in bone
           marrow and peripheral blood and their influence on clinical course and outcome of AML
           treatment,

        -  Assessment of the LSC determination usefulness in MRD monitoring in patients with AML,

        -  Evaluation of the prognostic significance of the expression of CXCR-4 on the surface of
           leukemic cells and their impact on the clinical course and outcome of AML - trying to
           select a group of patients who potentially would benefit from the use of
           chemosensitization with plerixafor,

        -  Evaluation of autologous HSCT effectiveness in consolidation therapy in AML patients
           from 3 following cytogenetic-molecular risk groups: Favorable, Intermediate I,
           Intermediate II,

        -  Comparison of the overall survive (OS) and leukemia-free survival after autologous and
           allogeneic HSCT in AML patients from Intermediate I and Intermediate II
           cytogenetic-molecular risk groups (biological randomization donor vs. donor).
