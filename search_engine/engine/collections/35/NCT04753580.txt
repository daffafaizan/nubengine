    
      This is a pilot study to validate a process of ex vivo stool transfer from humans to rats.
      Single-center intervention research with minimal risks and constraints.

      Exploration of the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiota in healthy adult
      volunteers, healthy elderly and frail elderly. The evaluation of the bacterial population of
      the stool will be done by analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.

      The secondary objectives will evaluate the muscular functional abilities the body composition
      measurement, at Day 0 (visit 2) and the inflammatory status at Day 0 - 7 (visit 2).

      Seconds parameters are the following :

      seated, standing, walking, and direction changes, a balance test, a walking speed test and a
      chair lift test, the maximum voluntary force of manual gripping, the maximum muscle strength
      of the quadriceps and the level of autonomy

      This protocole includes 3 visits :

        -  Visit 1 : Day 0-7 = inclusion

        -  Visit 2 : Day 0 = tests and questionnaires

        -  Visit 3 : Day 0 Â± 7 : stool collect
