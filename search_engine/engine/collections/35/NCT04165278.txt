      informed consent. All participants who meet the inclusion criteria will undergo a complete
      history and physical examination, including an assessment using the Movement Disorder
      Society-United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), H&Y stage, MMSE and MOCA. Each
      participant will receive two subjective measures (the Movement Disorder Society-United
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor examination total scores and the modified
      Webster Symptoms Score) nine times in an open medication state (open state). Each participant
      will take hyperthermic baths (HTB) at the same time on the first, third and fifth days. The
      participants will receive subjective measures before and after the HTB. The time at which the
      subjective measures begin after the HTB will be recorded. In the second week, no participants
      accept any intervention. To avoid the effects of fluctuations in dopaminergic drugs
      concentrations, subjective measures will be given without HTB at the recorded times on the
      fifteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth days.
