      (IP) antibiotics. In severe cases not responding to the IP antibiotics treatment, timely
      Tenckhoff catheter removal is needed. There is no known adjunctive measure that can improve
      the clinical outcome of the patients suffering from severe PD peritonitis.

      Based on the past experience in the investigators' center, switching IP to intravenous route
      of antibiotics administration, together with adjunctive lavage was proposed to improve the
      clinical outcome of severe PD peritonitis, in particular a possible improved catheter salvage
      rate. This method will be evaluated in the present clinical trial.
