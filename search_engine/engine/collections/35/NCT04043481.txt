      methods including plethysmography, pulse oximetry and duplex ultrasonography are used
      nowadays. The perfusion index is calculated as the ratio of the pulsatile blood flow to non-
      pulsatile blood flow in peripheral tissue.

      In this study, we will try to detect the relation between results of the peripheral perfusion
      index and modified Allen's test.
