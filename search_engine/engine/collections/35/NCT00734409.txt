      require sedation in order to keep them comfortable and prevent injury. The national
      guidelines for sedation management include a daily interruption of sedation performed once
      each morning. To determine the amount of sedation needed, the current standard practice is to
      use a system called the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). The patient is stimulated
      by calling their name or by tapping their shoulder until the patient's responses indicate
      that a satisfactory level of sedation has been achieved.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a device called the BIS monitor in
      addition to the RASS will give better assessment of a subject's level of sedation. The BIS
      monitor is a sensor strip taped to the forehead and attached to a device that reads
      electrical activity from the brain. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for monitoring patients under sedation.
