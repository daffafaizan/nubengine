      patients with LSBE (without dysplasia) who have adequate and inadequate control of acid
      reflux in the distal esophagus. The study will be conducted in two phases.

      Phase 1 (Pilot): 20 patients with LSBE without dysplasia will undergo endoscopy with biopsies
      and a 24 hour pH study on treatment. Patients will then be divided into 2 groups:

        -  Group A (GER): Those with ongoing acid reflux (characterized by either presence of
           esophagitis [LA classification B,C or D1] on endoscopy, and/or a positive pH study on
           treatment defined using standard criteria)

        -  Group B (NGER): Those with controlled acid reflux (negative endoscopy and pH study on
           treatment).

      Stromal markers that will be assessed and compared between the 2 groups will include:
      presence of activated myofibroblasts (detected by immunohistochemistry for vimentin and
      smooth muscle actin).
