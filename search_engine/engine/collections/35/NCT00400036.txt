      Dietary fish protein may also enhance insulin sensitivity in overweight insulin-resistant
      subjects by improving a primary defect in insulin signaling to PI 3-kinase, leading to
      reduced activation of the downstream effectors Akt and PKC. To determine whether this is the
      case, we will study the effects of fish protein on insulin sensitivity in humans, and how it
      improves the ability of muscles to use glucose. Such studies will help to advise individuals
      with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes about eating fish.
