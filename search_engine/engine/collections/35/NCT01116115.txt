      of human milk fat and enabling optimal intake of the essential calcium and energy (in the
      form of fatty acids) and easy digestion. These benefits are the result of a unique fatty acid
      composition on the glycerol backbone, which ensures high level of palmitic acid at the middle
      (sn-2) position.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of high sn-2 palmitic acid based infant
      formula on intestinal parameters, anthropometric parameters and stool characteristics in
      formula fed term infants.
