    
      The is a phase 2b, single-center, randomized, observer-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled trial of the immunogenicity and safety of adjTIV and seasonal TIV among
      healthy children aged 6 months through 71 months in the town of Niakhar, Senegal. A total of
      300 healthy children will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio of adjTIV to TIV to placebo. Each
      child will receive two doses of one of the three study vaccines, with each dose given 28 days
      apart. Each child will be followed closely for safety after each dose for the period from one
      month post-dose two to 3 months post-dose two. For determination of immune response to
      vaccination or background influenza infection, 3 mL of blood will be obtained at three time
      points: pre-vaccination, 28 days post-dose one (prior to receipt of dose two), and at 28 days
      post-dose two. Serum anti-influenza antibodies produced against virus strains contained in
      the vaccine will be detected using hemagglutination inhibition assay.
