      morbidity and a major contributor to mortality. One of the key factors contributing to this
      renal dysfunction is the use of calcineurin inhibitors. There is some evidence to suggest
      that the first 7-10 days following liver transplantation are crucial in terms of renal
      function and the ability to avoid the use of nephrotoxic agents such as calcineurin
      inhibitors may have a significant impact on long-term outcome.
