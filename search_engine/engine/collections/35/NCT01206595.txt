    
      This Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind, dose escalating/de-escalating study
      evaluated the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of SKY0402 compared to
      a single 125 mg dose of bupivacaine HCl for the treatment of postoperative pain in subjects
      undergoing bunionectomy.

      Up to 88 subjects were to be randomized in five consecutive cohorts. The dose of bupivacaine
      HCl (125 mg) was to remain constant for all cohorts. After completion of Cohort 1, the
      decision to increase or decrease the dose of SKY0402 was made by a Cohort Data Review
      Committee following a review of pharmacokinetic, safety, and selected efficacy data from the
      previous cohort.

      Study drug was to be administered as an ankle block, with or without a tourniquet, between 1
      hour before the induction of general anesthesia and 20 minutes before the end of general
      anesthesia. The ankle block procedure consisted of five injections via three skin entries
      targeting the following nerves: posterior tibial, sural, deep peroneal, superficial peroneal,
      and saphenous.

      The use of intravenous fentanyl during general anesthesia was permitted, but was not to
      exceed 250 micrograms. The intraoperative use of morphine was prohibited. Postoperatively,
      subjects had access to both opioid and non-opioid supplemental pain medication under general
      guidelines. Blood samples for the determination of plasma bupivacaine concentrations were
      obtained at Baseline and at specified time points through 96 hours.
