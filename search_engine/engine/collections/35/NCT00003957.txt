      lymphoma receiving sequential high dose chemotherapy achieve a collection of a minimum 5
      million CD34+ cells/kg in one large volume apheresis. II. Determine the feasibility and
      safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine disease free and overall survival of
      patients receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour followed by paclitaxel IV over 24
      hours on day 1. Filgrastim (G-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) are administered subcutaneously
      beginning on day 3 for approximately 7-14 days (until the completion of leukapheresis).
      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected over 3-5 days. Three weeks after
      leukapheresis is completed, patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice a day on days
      -6 to -3. Mitoxantrone IV is administered over 1 hour on day -6. CD34+ PBSC are reinfused on
      day 0. Four weeks later, patients receive etoposide IV over 11 hours on day -2 and melphalan
      IV over 30 minutes twice on day -1. CD34+ PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Concurrent G-CSF is
      administered subcutaneously and continues until blood counts recover. Patients are followed
      at 4 weeks, every 3 months for the first 2 years, and then every 6 months for the next 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
