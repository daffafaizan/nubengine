      should be familiar to all practicing clinicians. Antibiotics are used in dentistry for two
      major reasons: to control oral infection, and to prevent a bacteremia precipitated by dental
      manipulations from causing severe systemic sequelae.

      In recent years, there has been an increasing tendency to reduce the widespread use of
      antibiotics for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. This is based, both on increasing
      scientific evidence and enhanced professional experience. The development of resistant
      strains of microorganisms, doubt on the efficacy of the proposed prophylactic regimens,
      possible toxic and adverse reactions to antibiotics and poor compliance by patients and
      dentists raised questions about risks and benefits.

      The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) has published guidelines for antibiotic
      use, recognizing the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. The
      guidelines are intended to provide guidance for the proper and judicious use of antibiotic
      therapy in the treatment of oral conditions in children.

      Good knowledge about the indications of antibiotics is the need of the hour in prescribing
      antibiotics for dental conditions. Dental practitioners should know the protocol to be
      applied in their patients and should apply the most recent guidelines regarding antibiotic
      regimen.
