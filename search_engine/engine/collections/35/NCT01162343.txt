      diagnosis. Most delirium assessments can take up to 10 minutes to perform making them less
      likely to be incorporated into the routine physician assessment. Using brief (<2 minutes) and
      easy to use delirium assessments may ameliorate this quality of care issue. The Confusion
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) possesses these characteristics, but
      has only been validated in mechanically and non-mechanically ventilated intensive care unit
      patients. Recently, the investigators also developed the Brief Confusion Assessment Method
      (B-CAM) which is a modification of the CAM-ICU. The benefit is that it takes even less time
      than the CAM-ICU. The investigators also developed the Emergency Department Delirium Triage
      Screen (ED-DTS) designed to be highly sensitive and moderately specific delirium assessment
      for the nurse's triage assessment. It is hypothesized that a negative ED-DTS would rule out
      delirium, while a positive ED-DTS would require a more formal delirium assessment such as the
      CAM-ICU and B-CAM. These new delirium assessments require validation in older ED patients. As
      result, the investigators propose the following and the following specific aims:

      Aim #1: To validate the B-CAM in older ED patients. The B-CAM will be performed by a clinical
      trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in 200 ED patients that are > 65 years old.
      This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrist's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment as the reference standard.

      Aim #2: To validate the CAM-ICU in older ED patients. The CAM-ICU will be performed by a
      clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in approximately 200 ED patients
      that are > 65 years old. This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrist's
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment
      as the reference standard.

      Aim #3: To validate the ED-DTS in older ED patients. The ED-DTS will be performed by a
      clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in 200 ED patients that are > 65
      years old. This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrist's Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment as the
      reference standard.
