      drinking a commercially available sugar-free energy drink. These studies utilized traditional
      platelet function studies, such as light transmission aggregometry (LTA), where platelet
      function is examined while adding varying concentrations of a panel of agonist to platelets.
      These studies are technically difficult, time intensive studies requiring specialized
      laboratories. They are relatively non-physiologic and do not mimic platelet response to
      vessel wall damage. Other tests better represent the reactions to vessel wall damage,
      including the PFA-100, which measures platelet aggregation and adhesion under conditions of
      high shear.

      Overall, PFA-100 is less expensive, requires less technical skill, and is less time consuming
      than LTA. It has been utilized in bleeding disorders and is demonstrating promise as a marker
      of thrombophilia. PFA-100 has demonstrated sensitivity to drug and dietary effects. It has
      also shown differences in closure time between sedentary and athletic individuals PFA-100 has
      not been used to investigate the effect of energy drinks.
