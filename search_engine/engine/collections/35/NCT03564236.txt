      controlled trial comparing the effect of nHFT on subjective recovery in COPD patients
      admitted to the hospital for a COPD exacerbation as compared to the standard care. First, we
      will define the optimal setting and gain more insight in insight in mechanisms why and how
      nHFT might work in a subpopulation, then continuing with inclusion in the randomized
      controlled trial including the 136 patients in total to prove efficacy in terms of
      patient-centered outcomes. To get more insight in mechanisms why and how nHFT might work we
      incorporate: a) neuromechanical investigations and analyses; and b) anatomical
      investigations, both in patients and in experimental models, the latter in order to minimise
      patient effort.
