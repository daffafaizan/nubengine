    
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in developed
      countries. By the year 2040, the number of people suffering from AMD is estimated to increase
      by 50%. Stargardt disease is the most prevalent form of macular dystrophy in children, with
      an estimated prevalence of 1 in 10000.

      There is no effective treatment available that stops progression or improves vision in
      patients with dry AMD or Stargardt disease.

      Considering the success in animal studies and observational human studies with omega-3 fatty
      acids supplementation when the blood ratio AA (arachidonic acid)/EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)
      is <2, the sponsor hypothesizes that, when the blood ratio of AA/EPA is maintained below 2,
      the visual acuity in the group with active supplements will improve, in comparison to the
      control group, in patients with moderate and severe dry AMD and moderate and severe
      Stargardt.
