      function and resulting influx of proinflammatory molecules have been described. This might
      contribute to systemic inflammation and the development of diabetic complications like
      nephropathy and ischemic heart disease. Interestingly, the gut microbiota is altered in
      persons with type 1 diabetes, who have less butyrate-producing bacteria. The short-chain
      fatty acid butyrate improves the intestinal barrier function, and the altered bacterial
      composition is hypothesized to play a role in the intestinal inflammation. Treatment with
      butyrate has improved metabolic, colonic and renal function in animal models of chronic
      kidney disease.

      The aim of the study is to test whether orally ingested sodium butyrate can reduce intestinal
      inflammation in patients with type 1 diabetes and albuminuria in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-site trial.

      Persons with type 1 diabetes and albuminuria are recruited from Steno Diabetes Center
      Copenhagen (SDCC) and Folkhälsan Research Center, FinnDiane, Helsinki, Finland and screened
      for intestinal inflammation. 48 participants with intestinal inflammation (fecal calprotectin
      ≥50 μg/g) are randomized to receive 3.6 g sodium butyrate or placebo for 12 weeks.
