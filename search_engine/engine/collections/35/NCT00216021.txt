    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      CAPOX (21 day cycle):

        -  Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 orally twice daily Days 1-14.

        -  Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously Day 1

      Patients may continue combination therapy until progression or toxicity intervenes. Patients
      who discontinue either agent due to toxicity may, at the investigators discretion, continue
      therapy with the remaining single agent on study.
