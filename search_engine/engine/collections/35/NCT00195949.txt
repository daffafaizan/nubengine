      With advancements in minimally invasive surgery in infants a laparoscopic approach has been
      developed. These two approaches have never been critically evaluated with regard to
      superiority of one technique over the other. This is a prospective randomized trial involving
      infants with pyloric stenosis. It will enroll 100 patients in each arm (statistical and power
      analysis was performed by Steve Simon, PhD). Parental consent will be obtained and the
      patients will be randomized to undergo open or laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. Patient age at
      diagnosis, electrolyte disturbances at diagnosis, ultrasound findings, operative approach,
      length of pyloromyotomy, operative times, time to tolerating full feeds, number of emesis
      episodes, length of hospitalization, operative charges, and hospital charges will be
      collected for comparison between the groups.
