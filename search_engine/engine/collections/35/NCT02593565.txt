      pregnancy-related experiences, and pregnancy outcomes. Participants will be asked to complete
      questionnaires at study entry, during the second trimester, during the third trimester, and
      postpartum. Investigators estimate that it will take approximately 20 minutes to complete
      each survey. The survey is available in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Turkish.

      All women enrolled in the Vasculitis Patient-Powered Research Network (VPPRN) (with specified
      disease, sex, and age inclusion criteria described below) will be invited via email to
      participate in this on-line study. The survey data will be stored by the Data Management and
      Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. Upon conclusion of the study
      period, the data will be sent to the Study Chairs.
