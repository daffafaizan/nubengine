      Primary

        -  Compare the safety of vaccination comprising autologous dendritic cells loaded with
           autologous tumor lysate and keyhole limpet hemocyanin with vs without non-myeloablative
           fludarabine in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Compare, preliminarily, the efficacy of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether this vaccine induces tumor-reactive peripheral T-cell responses or
           delayed-type hypersensitivity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients undergo surgery to remove tumor at metastatic sites to generate autologous tumor
      lysate. Patients then undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells for
      the generation of dendritic cells (DC). The DC are then exposed to autologous tumor lysate
      and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH).

        -  Arm I: Three weeks after leukapheresis, patients receive vaccination comprising DC
           loaded with autologous tumor lysate and KLH (DC vaccine) intradermally once every 14
           days for a total of 4 injections in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Two weeks after leukapheresis, patients receive fludarabine IV over 15-30
           minutes once daily for 3 days. Beginning approximately 5 weeks after leukapheresis,
           patients also receive DC vaccine as in arm I.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 7-9 weeks, at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every 6
      months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients (14 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2-3 years.
