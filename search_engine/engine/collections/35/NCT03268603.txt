      clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal treatment of aaMSCs in
      ALS. Patients will be treated with 1 x 10^8 aaMSCs every 3 months for a total of 4
      intrathecal injections over 12 months. Reduced dose treatments will be allowed based on
      specific adverse events. Multiple biomarkers will be tracked throughout the clinical trial
      and correlated with response to treatment. This study was initially performed at Mayo Clinic
      in Rochester and subsequently expanded to the two other Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona and
      Florida. All biopsies and stem cell injections take place at Mayo Clinic Rochester,
      regardless of where the subject initially enrolls into the study.
