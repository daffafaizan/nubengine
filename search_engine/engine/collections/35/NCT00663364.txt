      can be continued up to a four-weeks period. Additionally, the patient receives a
      documentation sheets to note several parameters. In a sensory assessment, product specific
      parameter such as spreadability, permeability, lubricating, smell of lotion and cosmetic
      acceptance during the treatment will be assessed (at the beginning, after 2 weeks, after 4
      weeks, 2 weeks after stopping treatment). After four weeks the skin care measurement will be
      terminated and the patient can continue with a treatment of his choice. A monitoring of at
      least 50 patients per preparation is intended.
