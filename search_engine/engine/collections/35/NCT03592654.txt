      access to good quality caregiver coaching provided in the most natural environment possible.
      However, this is currently not the case for the majority of families. There are no
      empirically validated treatment programs for infants showing ASD risk. The proposed research
      project will use Applied Behavior Analysis-based single-subject experimental designs to
      further develop a promising caregiver-mediated intervention designed for infants showing
      early signs of ASD. Caregiver coaching will be provided using telehealth technology, in order
      to maximize recruitment opportunities and to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of the
      telehealth medium of intervention delivery for caregivers of infants with concern for ASD.
