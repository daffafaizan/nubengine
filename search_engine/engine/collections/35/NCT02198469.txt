      confined to the epidermis, and results from chronic or excessive ultraviolet exposure. AC is
      an early manifestation of lip squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and SCC of the lip is usually
      associated with an identifiable pre-existent AC. Furthermore, the likelihood that AC will
      progress to SCC is higher than actinic keratosis (AK). Consequently, early identification and
      treatment of AC is recommended. PDT involves the activation of a photosensitizer by
      irradiation with 400- to 700-nm light to create cytotoxic oxygen and free radicals that kill
      dysplastic cells.

      Methyl aminolaevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) is advantageous in that it has few
      cosmetic side effects and minimises patient discomfort. However, its relatively low efficacy
      prevents its application to the treatment of actinic cheilitis(AC).

      Erbium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Er:YAG) ablative fractional laser (AFL) therapy has been
      used frequently to improve treatment efficacy of PDT. Er:YAG AFL can ablate stratum corneum
      with minimal penetration depth and producing minimal thermal injury. This approach creates
      microscopic vertical holes in the ablated tissue, surrounded by thin layers of coagulated
      tissue. Er:YAG AFL does not injure the entire thickness of the epidermis; therefore, healing
      times are minimised. Erbium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Er:YAG) ablative fractional laser (AFL)
      has been proven in recent studies to facilitate the delivery and uptake of topical MAL deep
      into the skin, enhancing porphyrin synthesis and photodynamic activation.

      The aim of our study was to compare efficacy, recurrence rate, cosmetic outcome, and safety
      between Er:YAG AFL-assisted MAL-PDT (Er:YAG AFL MAL-PDT) and standard MAL-PDT in patients
      with AC.
