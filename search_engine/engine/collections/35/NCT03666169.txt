      individual's genetics could help to reduce the prevalence. However, how the public will
      respond to this information is unknown. The use of technology is very common and could
      provide an accessible platform to communicate genetic results to the public. Therefore, this
      study will evaluate the public's response to receiving genetic information via an electronic
      platform.

      This study will comprise of an internet run quantitative survey. The survey will be
      circulated using relevant websites, internet forums, emails and social media. Participants
      will be required to complete the survey once which will take around 10 minutes. The
      participants will not be required to complete the survey in a controlled setting, it may be
      complete wherever the participant feels comfortable. Data analysis will take place at St
      Mary's University.
