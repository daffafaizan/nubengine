      the world. Care should include education, psychotherapy and treatments, but despite these
      therapeutics, the smoking cessation process is often characterized by relapses. The main risk
      factor for relapse is craving. Neurophysiological studies have provided evidence in the
      understanding of craving. This craving involves surface structures including the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex, accessible by neurostimulation. Repetitive neurostimulation applies on
      this structures involved in craving could therefore modulate it. Two non-invasive stimulation
      techniques exist: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS). The choice of tDCS is based on its ease of use, excellent
      tolerance, its better quality of placebo and low cost.
