      long-term clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS in
      complex, real-world patients across multiple geographies. As SPIRIT IV was designed as a
      continued access trial, completing the clinical follow-up at the three-year visit does not
      conflict with any FDA requirements. Abbott Vascular is committed to providing clinical
      outcomes through three years. The clinical evidence provided from across multiple
      geographies, in complex populations thus supports Abbott Vascular's proposal to complete the
      SPIRIT IV RCT at the three-year clinical follow-up.

      The SPIRIT IV Clinical Trial is a randomized, active-controlled, single-blinded, multicenter
      clinical trial in the US that will enroll approximately 3,690 subjects (2:1 randomization
      XIENCE V®: TAXUS®). The trial allows the treatment of up to three de novo native coronary
      artery lesions, maximum of two lesion per epicardial vessel, with reference vessel diameters
      (RVD) ≥ 2.5 mm to ≤ 4.25 mm and lesion lengths ≤ 28 mm. (NOTE: RVD ≥ 2.5 mm to ≤ 3.75 mm
      until 4.0 mm TAXUS® is commercially available). All subjects will be screened per the
      protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria and enrolled subjects will have clinical follow-up
      at 30, 180, and 270 days and 1, 2, and 3 years.
