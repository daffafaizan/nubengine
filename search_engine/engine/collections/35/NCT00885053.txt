      mellitus (type 2). Adipose tissue can be regarded as an active organ, which produces an array
      of inflammatory mediators. This creates a state of chronic low-grade inflammation.
      Inflammation has been proven to be a key element in the development of atherosclerotic
      plaques.

      The marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have beneficial effects on cardiovascular
      disease. These effects are partly attributed to the anti-inflammatory effect of the n-3
      PUFAs.

      Previous studies have shown an anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 PUFAs in overweight subjects,
      but the studies have been conducted with a high daily dose of n-3 PUFA. We want to examine
      the effect of a lower dose of 1 g n-3 PUFA/day (the dose recommended by the Danish Heart
      Foundation).

      The study is randomized, placebo-controlled and double blinded. Fifty subjects aged 30 - 75
      years (postmenopausal women; waist circumference > 80 cm and men; waist circumference > 94
      cm) will be included.

      Blood samples and fatty tissue biopsies will be collected at baseline, after 1 day and after
      6 weeks.
