      parasitology for confirmation of ulcerative CL. Recruitment will primarily be from patients
      exposed to leishmaniasis. A target enrollment of 30 patients will receive WR 279,396 (15%
      paromomycin + 0.5% gentamicin topical cream) once daily for 20 days.

      The index lesion and all other ulcerated lesions will be assessed for clinical response by
      measurement of the length and width of area of ulceration. A lesion will be considered to be
      completely cured if 100% re-epithelialization is observed. Non-ulcerated lesions will also be
      measured to monitor the total area of exposure of lesions to study drug and will be evaluated
      for cure.
