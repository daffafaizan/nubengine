      poorer health outcomes than the population without spinal cord injury. For PwSCI, habitual
      exercise is critical for both physiological and psychological well-being. Prior research
      indicates that exercise programs conducted in a controlled setting have positive effects on
      the physical and psychosocial fitness of PwSCI, but the efficacy and feasibility of these
      programs are not well understood in community-based settings. The proposed project aims to
      examine potential health benefits in response to the intervention and identify the barriers
      and facilitators to successful implementation of a CBEI in PwSCI. The long-term goal of this
      research is to improve health outcomes of PwSCI by identifying strategies to promote health
      and support exercise in the community.

      The project research aims are to:

        1. Estimate improvements in physical function, cardio-metabolic health, and psychological
           well-being of participants enrolled in a CBEI compared to an education-only group.

        2. Identify barriers, facilitators, and reasons for positive determinants for PwSCI to
           exercise in a community-based setting.

      A single-blind pilot RCT will be conducted. Forty individuals with SCI will be recruited.
      Each participant will be randomized into either a 12-week CBEI (n=20) or an education control
      group (n=20). Participants' cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, metabolic blood
      chemistries and strength will be assessed pre- (T1) and post- (T2) intervention.
