      disease within 2 years of diagnosis.

      Patients with MBC usually receive treatment with endocrine or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
      agents, and treatment decisions are generally guided by the hormone receptor and Human
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative status of the disease, the number and location of
      metastases, and prior treatment history in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. In first-
      and second-line treatment settings of Metastatic Breast Cancer, numerous cytotoxic
      chemotherapy agents have demonstrated activity, including anti-tubulin drugs (Taxanes,
      Vinorelbine), Anthracyclines, and anti-metabolites (Capecitabine, Gemcitabine). However, no
      single agent has demonstrated a clear survival advantage over another, and use of sequential
      single-agent therapies is the most frequent approach. The choice of chemotherapy agent(s) is
      often determined by a number of factors, including history of prior therapy, treatment-free
      interval, and patient preference. Thus, no single standard treatment exists for patients with
      advanced disease. Patients who progress during or after their first treatment for Metastatic
      Brest Cancer typically have a short progression-free interval of 4-6 months and survive for
      8-12 months. New treatment modalities are needed to improve clinical outcome and maintain the
      quality of life for these patients.
