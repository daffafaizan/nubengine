      program and to test if the observed improvements are stable over time (nine months of
      follow-up). A sample of 108 SZBP-OFF and 52 community controls will be included. Both groups
      will be assessed with clinical scales, neuropsychological, CR and neuroimaging assessments at
      baseline. Then, the SZBP-OFF group will be randomized to psychological program to enhance CR
      (N= 54) or to support treatment (N=54). SZBP-OFF subjects will be evaluated with clinical,
      CR, neuropsychological and neuroimaging tests after the psychological intervention and at
      nine months follow-up in order to assess if the obtained results are stable over time. The
      investigators hypothesize that SZBP-OFF will show lower CR scores and higher percentages of
      psychopathology, cognitive difficulties and brain abnormalities. The investigators also
      hypothesize that SZBP-OFF who received the psychological intervention will increase their CR
      and will decrease the severity of the observed difficulties (in clinical, neuropsychological,
      CR and neuroimaging areas). These results will be stable in the nine month follow-up
      assessment.
