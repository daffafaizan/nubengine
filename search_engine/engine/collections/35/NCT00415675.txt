      tumor.

      You will be trained to breathe in a certain way that will help the study staff to perform
      motion CT scans. You may be asked to breathe normally, or hold your breath, or breathe while
      following a TV monitor. On the monitor, you will be viewing your breathing trace and using
      the trace to regulate your breathing as instructed by the health professionals.

      While you are in the right position for the scan, the study staff will perform motion CT
      scans. A total of up to 12 scanning sessions will be held over your entire course of
      radiotherapy. The first scanning session may last from 45 to 90 minutes, but later sessions
      may be shorter. These CT scans are separate from the routine CT scans you may receive as part
      of regular radiation treatment planning.

      Scans may be taken at various periods of time. The scans can be taken one right after
      another, or with a short separation between them. One scan can be taken on the first day, and
      the next scan on the next day, or up to a week later.

      By looking at the scans, researchers can better understand how your tumor and other organs
      move from breath to breath, from day to day, and from week to week.

      This is an investigational study. About 210 patients with the same tumor location as you will
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
