    
      Patients with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas will be assessed for eligibility and will be
      enrolled in the present protocol-study.

      At entry, in each woman age, parity, body mass index (BMI), menopausal, socioeconomic and
      work status, symptoms related to the gynecologic disease, previous major surgical
      laparotomies, and associated medical condition will be assessed.

      All eligible patients will be randomized in single blocks using a central computer generating
      randomization lists (University of Catanzaro). The subjects will be assigned to one of four
      subgroups of surgical treatment, i.e. group A1 myomectomies performed using GYNECARE
      MORCELLEX, group A2 supracervical hysterectomies performed using GYNECARE MORCELLEX, group B1
      myomectomies performed using ROTOCUT G1 and group B2 supracervical hysterectomies performed
      using ROTOCUT G1.

      Before surgery, for each patient gynaecological and rectal examination, Papanicolau smear
      test, ultrasonographic and hysteroscopic assessment with endometrial biopsy will be
      performed.

      For each surgical intervention the following parameters will be recorded: duration of
      surgical procedures, intra-operative blood loss, amount of blood transfusion, intra-operative
      complications, number of laparotomic conversion, postoperative pain, post-operative
      complications, hospital stay, and time to return to full activity and/or work.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
