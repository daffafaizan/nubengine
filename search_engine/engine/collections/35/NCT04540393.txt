      provide data on the use of AZD1222 in the Russian Federation. The protocol is part of the
      international AstraZeneca program of AZD1222 development with several studies being conducted
      in the UK, US, Japan, and other countries. This study is intended for registration purposes
      of AZD1222 in Russia. The study data will complement the data from other pivotal controlled
      studies conducted in other countries with the Russian participants' data, which is considered
      the most expedited way to make the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2
      (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine available to the Russian Federation for contribution to controlling the
      current public health crisis.
