    
      This is a single blind randomized study designed to understand the effects of different
      interventions, walking interventions and cognitive remediation in particular, towards
      cognition and gait in the elderly. The study uses a 4 arm approach consisting of 4
      intervention groups, with each intervention lasting for 12 weeks. The investigators will
      investigate the effect of each intervention towards cognitive function and gait. All
      interventions will be conducted on site at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, and
      will be focused on determining the effects of different combinations of walking, cognitive
      remediation, healthy living courses, and reading. Cognitive measures will include objective
      clinical measures related to dementia, and the gait analysis will include in clinic and "free
      living" measures related to falls.
