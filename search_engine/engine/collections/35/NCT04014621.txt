    
      The goal of this study is to identify Acute Ischemic Stroke patients who have a potentially
      salvageable penumbra and to test if 6 hours of SPG (Sphenopalatine Ganglion) stimulation may
      "freeze" the volume of the penumbra and reduce the extent of tissue death.

      Following a minimally-invasive implantation of the ISS injectable implant, patients will be
      randomized to either the Treated or Control arm in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be dynamic
      according to the patient's baseline covariates of core volume, total volume, Hypoperfusion
      Intensity Ratio (HIR), time to baseline imaging, age, NIHSS. Patients in the Treated arm will
      be treated with active SPG stimulation while patients in the Control arm will undergo sham
      treatment. After treatment/sham treatment, patients in both groups will undergo a follow up
      brain non-contrast CT, CT perfusion and CT angiography imaging, 6:45hrsÂ±15min after baseline
      CTP initiation.

      In the case the patient is cooperative, hand strength (pinch and grasp) evaluations should be
      assessed before and during the 1st treatment/ sham SPG stimulation session.

      Following the assessment of the penumbra (after 6 hours) patients will be treated or sham
      treated for 5 additional consecutive sessions (4 hours each), the first starting within 18-24
      hours from stroke onset and the others 18-26 hours from previous treatment initiation and
      will be followed for 90 days to assess their clinical outcome. In one session (preferably at
      day 2) Common Carotid Doppler examination is performed to evaluate blood flow dynamics before
      and during the treatment/sham session.

      After the last treatment session, the implant is removed.
