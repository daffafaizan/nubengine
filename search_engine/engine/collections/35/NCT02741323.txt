      following transplantation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MVC in HIV-infected adults in need of a kidney transplant. The study will
      also evaluate whether using both immunosuppressant drugs and MVC will improve kidney function
      after a kidney transplant.

      This study will enroll HIV-infected adults on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) who
      need a kidney transplant. At the time of their kidney transplant, study participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either MVC or placebo as an addition to their cART regimen. (MVC
      or placebo will be provided by the study. However, the HIV medicines in their cART regimens
      will not be provided by the study.) Participants will receive MVC or placebo throughout their
      participation in the study, which will be 1 to 3 years depending on when they enroll in the
      study.

      Study visits will occur at enrollment (Day 0) and post-transplant Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26,
      39, 52, 78, 104, 130, and 156. Study visits may include a physical examination, blood
      collection, lymph node collection, urine sample collection, and a kidney biopsy. During the
      study, participants will also be monitored closely for evidence of drug toxicities, HIV
      treatment failure and rejection.
