      medication has proven difficult. To date, there have been no prospective blinded studies to
      evaluate efficacy of surgical treatments for these tremors. Based on prior data, this study
      will examine the use of 2 DBS electrodes on the same side of the brain in the thalamus region
      (one at an area referred to as the "ventralis intermedius nucleus/ventralis oralis posterior
      nucleus border," or "VIM," and one at a region called the "ventralis oralis anterior
      nucleus/ventralis oralis posterior nucleus border," or "VO") for treatment of MS tremor. This
      study will test the effectiveness of VIM combined with, and independent of, VO DBS, and
      characterize safety, benefits and side effects of this procedure for treatment of MS-related
      tremors.
