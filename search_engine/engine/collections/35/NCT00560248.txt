      Sites will collect information on patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with
      chest pain. The purpose of the BEACON Registry is to evaluate the impact of new technologies,
      practice patterns and initiatives on patient time to diagnosis, patient time to treatment,
      patient survival and overall economics.
