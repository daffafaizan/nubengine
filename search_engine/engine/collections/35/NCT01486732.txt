      animal study, FLT-PET was used as a tool that enables imaging and measuring of proliferation
      in the brain, thus it detects activity of endogenous neural stem cells noninvasively. This
      study aims to assess cell proliferation activity changes in the brain after Umbilical Cord
      Blood (UCB)Therapy for Cerebral Palsy patients using FLT-PET.
