    
      Open-label, multiple arm, safety, microbiology and pharmacokinetic (PK) study in healthy
      adult male and female subjects 18-75 years of age conducted in two parts.

      Part A of the study will evaluate up to 6 study arms, depending on the microbiology response
      evaluated. Before dosing of C16G2, eligible subjects will undergo professional dental
      prophylaxis on Day 0. Clinic visits for all Study Arms include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to
      0), Treatment Visits 2 through 6 (Baseline/Day 0 through Day 4), and follow-up Visits 7
      through 11 (Day 5, 8, 12, 19 ± 1 and 33 ± 2).

      All subjects will be assessed for safety and microbiology parameters for approximately 5
      weeks. A subset of subjects in Study Arms 2 and 4 will be assessed for pharmacokinetic
      parameters. Part A of the study is no longer enrolling study subjects.

      Part B of the study will evaluate up to 5 study arms, depending on the microbiology response
      evaluated during 2 interim microbiology reviews. Clinic visits for all study arms except
      Study Arm 5 include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to 0), Visit 2 (Baseline/Day 0), Visits 3
      through 17 (Days 1 through 6, morning and evening visits, and Days 7, 10 and 14). All
      subjects will be assessed for safety and microbiology parameters for approximately 2 weeks.
      Before dosing of C16G2, eligible subjects will undergo professional dental prophylaxis on Day
      0. Study drug will be administered for 7 consecutive days. The Sponsor will perform a
      microbiology review to evaluate the S. mutans response in Study Arms 1 & 2 and, if
      applicable, in Study Arms 3a or 3b. In Study Arm 5, subjects will receive multiple C16G2
      doses on a single day and will be evaluated for safety, microbiology and pharmacokinetic
      parameters. Clinic visits for Study Arm 5 will include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to 0),
      Visit 2 (Baseline/Day 0), Visit 3/Day 1 and Visit 4/Day 6.
