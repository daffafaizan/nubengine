      polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts) in the pleural space following a lung resection procedure
      by administering the Non Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Naproxen in tandem with
      Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) Pantoprazole, ideally leading towards a significantly reduced
      volume of transudate and exudate generated.

      This will be achieved by running a placebo-controlled double blinded randomized control trial
      where investigators and participants will be blinded so as to eliminate experimenter bias.
      After screening for suitable participants using stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      patients will be administered by allied health professionals 500mg Naproxen twice daily and
      40mg Pantoprazole once daily, or an identical placebo for four weeks following resection
      surgery. Patients will undergo a thorough examination during their scheduled follow-up
      appointments to monitor general vitals as well as possible gastrointestinal complications.
      The primary outcome is a significant reduction (Î”100ml) of chest fluid extracted in the
      intervention arm of the study in comparison to that of the control arm. Secondary outcomes
      will include a reduction in length of stay measured in days between control and intervention
      arms as well as a reduction in the total number of days chest tubes are retained in-situ.
      Conditions such as mortality and morbidity, the onset of complications, and general
      re-admission rates will also be recorded.
