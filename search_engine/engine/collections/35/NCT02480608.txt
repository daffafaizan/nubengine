      to determine the safety of the combination as well as the maximal tolerated dose. If the
      toxicity of the combination is acceptable, up to 200 more patients may be recruited and
      randomized to receive either Imatinib/HU or Imatinib alone (part 2).

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be started on 400 mg Imatinib daily. In part 1
      of the protocol, the dose of HU will be increased by 500 mg at 3-weekly intervals until the
      maximal tolerated dose has been reached. In part 2 of the study, patients will be randomized
      to receive either the combination or Imatinib monotherapy.

      Hematological and cytogenetic response will be evaluated at 3-months intervals during the
      first year, and at 6 months' intervals thereafter. Primary endpoints for part 1 are
      dose-limiting toxicity and maximal tolerated dose. Primary endpoints for part 2 are the rates
      of major and complete molecular response at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively.
