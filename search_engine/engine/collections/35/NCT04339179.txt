    
      This is a study to identify the causative agents and describe the clinical characteristics of
      infectious disease outbreaks and difficult cases of unidentified etiology in Indonesia. It is
      a retrospective and prospective observational study with an exploratory design. There will be
      no intervention to the participants that is intended to affect their SoC or clinical outcome.

      Retrospective study activities will be ongoing throughout the duration of the study. The
      INA-RESPOND Reference Lab will perform research tests on various specimens collected as part
      of historical outbreaks and previous difficult cases where an etiology was never identified.

      Prospective study activities will be initiated upon official request from health authorities
      and health facilities/institutions. Requests are expected to be filtered through and
      evaluated by the 19 active INA-RESPOND Network sites before inclusion in the study. Samples
      collected during outbreaks and from difficult cases of unknown etiology will be analyzed at
      the INA-RESPOND Reference Lab at their own pace. Results from any research tests will be
      shared with the requesting authorities as research-use-only and are not intended to alter
      standard of care.
