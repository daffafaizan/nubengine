    
      Eligibility criteria:patients with symptomatic, CT verified, acute ischemic stroke, being
      able to initiate IV rt-PA within 3 hours and IA thrombolysis within 6 hours of stroke onset,
      when uncertainty about appropriateness the two approaches exists as established by the
      treating physician.

      Eligible patients are randomized to receive either 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) IV rt-PA (control
      arm) or up to 0.9 mg/Kg IA rt-PA (max 90 mg) over 60 minutes into the thrombus, eventually
      associated with clot mechanical disaggregation/dislocation or retraction/aspiration.
      Mechanical thrombolysis is possible also without the use of rt-PA. The procedural choices of
      the interventional neuroradiologist depend on the type of occlusion, circumstances and
      experience.

      The study is designed to detect or disprove (alpha=5% and power probability=80%) a 15%
      absolute difference between the treatment groups in the percentage of patients with a
      favourable outcome (Modified Rankin Scale Score = 0-1).Enrollment will be completed with 350
      randomized patients.

      Neurological deficit will be scored with NIH Stroke Scale at day 7 or discharge, or transfer
      to another hospital, whichever occurs first.Patient's clinical condition will be again
      evaluated by a telephone call after 90 days.
