      children and 40% of adults were treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for pulmonary
      exacerbations (PEx) in 2016; this translated to 20,286 care episodes. Case series have
      identified important complications of PICCs and TIVADs in CF patients such as deep venous
      thrombosis (DVT) and infection; central venous stenosis; and other types of mechanical
      dysfunction. The incidence of PICC-associated DVT in CF patients ranges from 2 to 8%.
      Proposed risk factors in CF patients fall into several broad categories. First are
      catheter-related factors: larger catheter size, number of catheter lumens, and catheter
      composition; second are patient factors: lung function, nutritional status, respiratory
      flora, diabetes status, thrombophilia; and number of previously placed catheters; and third
      are catheter-management factors: insertion technique and site selection, inpatient versus
      outpatient care, anticoagulant use, blood sampling practices, and duration of line use. The
      importance of some of these factors remains controversial, leading some to call for detailed
      prospective studies of PICC use in specific patient populations. To date, no multicenter
      trial has prospectively studied PICC and midline complications in adult and pediatric CF
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that the rate of PICC and midline vascular
      complications is associated with specific patient level and line level factors as well as
      with line insertion and management practices. The proposed trial is a multicenter,
      prospective surveillance study to evaluate (patient level-, catheter level- and catheter
      management-) risk factors associated with various complications of PICCs and midlines in
      pediatric and adult CF patients.
