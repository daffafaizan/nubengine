      during treatment with chemotherapy and approximately 30% of women continue to experience
      these symptoms months to years after treatment completion. There is mounting data to suggest
      that inflammation may be involved and indicate that chemotherapy-treated breast cancer
      patients exhibit higher inflammatory markers than non-chemotherapy-treated patients, and
      inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR2)
      have been associated with chemotherapy-induced depression and fatigue.
