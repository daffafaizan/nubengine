        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome released through
           thermal microwave therapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profile of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 30 minutes. Patients then undergo a
      60-minute course of prostate thermotherapy. Treatment may repeat every 28-42 days for up to 6
      courses, at the discretion of the physician.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 8, 15, 30, and 90 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
