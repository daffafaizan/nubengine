      allergen inhalation challenges. In general, each sample will be composed of >10% neutrophils
      and >10% macrophages. Samples collected pre-allergen will have a low frequency of eosinophils
      and lymphocytes (<1%), however the percentage of eosinophils will increase to approximately
      12% following allergen challenges. The sputum samples will be processed in DPBS (without
      dithiothreitol), and the cell suspension will be adjusted to 1 million cells/ml in DMEM with
      penicillin and streptomycin. A cytospin will be made for differential cell counts. The mixed
      cell population at 5 million cells/ml will be incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celcius ±
      β-chain MAb at a concentration of 100 mcg/ml. After 48 hours the cell culture medium will be
      removed for assay of cytokines and chemokines by ELISA. Cells will be resuspended in PBS and
      Binding Buffer (BD Pharmingen, Cat no. 556454),stained for assessments by flow cytometry, and
      analyzed in duplicate.

      Experiments will use blood (80 ml) and bone marrow aspirates (5ml) from atopic asthmatics
      taken pre and 24hr post allergen challenge. Methylcult micro-culture colonogenic assays will
      be performed to enumerate outgrowth of Eo/Baso-CFU and GM-CFU from CD34+ cells populations
      collected from the blood and bone marrow samples. Methylcult assays will be performed with
      CD34+ enriched cell populations in the presence of IL-5,IL-3 and GM-CSF +/- CSL311. Following
      14 days culture, colonies will be enumerated.
