      participants achieving a 12-week sustained virologic response (SVR12), [HCV ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) < lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 12 weeks following treatment]) of co-formulated
      ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r) and dasabuvir
      co-administered with RBV for 12 weeks in HCV genotype 1b-infected adult participants with
      compensated cirrhosis. The secondary objectives of this study were to assess the number and
      percentage of participants with virologic failure during treatment and the percentage of
      participants with relapse post-treatment.
