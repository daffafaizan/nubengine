      diseases, diabetes and also with occupational and traffic accidents due to fatigue and
      daytime sleepiness. Treatment of moderate OSA is usually by a mandibular advancement device
      (MAD) and in sometimes even Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). MAD and CPAP
      treatment effectiveness is impeded by limited compliance with long term treatment. Knowledge
      about mechanical barriers in upper respiratory tract has triggered interest in finding a new
      treatment method that may prevent collapse of airways during sleep. The investigators believe
      that stabilization of the neck by using a cervical collar (CC) during sleep helps sustain
      airway patency. This would mean improved oxygen saturation in the blood and a reduction of
      daytime fatigue in patients with OSA.
