      (MDI) by participants in the study. The actuation data can be remotely viewed and analyzed by
      the investigators.

      The hypothesis is that employing such technology to measure medication patterns and to help
      provide patient feedback improves inhaler adherence and potentially clinical outcomes (asthma
      control and exacerbations) in asthma patients with recent asthma attacks in a practical,
      real-world setting.

      We will assess whether electronic inhaler data capture can identify patients requiring more
      frequent reviews or treatment change and enable proactive self- management.

      Using qualitative methods, we will explore participants' attitudes to their asthma
      management, whether the use of inhaler technology has had an impact on this and whether they
      found its use acceptable.
