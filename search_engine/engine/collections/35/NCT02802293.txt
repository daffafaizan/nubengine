      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for subjects with MDD all of whom at the patient's
      treatment clinic are concurrently receiving pharmaceutical and psychotherapeutic
      interventions. Arm 1 delivers active rTMS to the left DLPFC using the standard aiming
      strategy. Arm 2 delivers active rTMS to the left anterior DLPFC using connectivity-based,
      image-guided aiming. Arm 3 delivers active rTMS to the left posterior DLPFC using
      connectivity-based, image-guided aiming. In all three arms, rTMS is administered in an
      image-guided, robotically-positioned TMS (irTMS) manner to ensure therapist blinding and
      equivalent subject experiences across arms. In all three arms, the following stimulation
      protocol will be used: 10 Hz irTMS delivered in 4 sec trains with 26 sec inter-train
      intervals, 37.5 minutes/session (i.e. 3,000 pulses/session), 5 sessions/week, for 4 weeks.
      Neuroimaging will be used both for treatment planning and to characterize any TMS-induced
      network plasticity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) at
      week 4 of each treatment arm. Clinical assessments will be administered weekly throughout
      treatment (weeks 1-4) at the patient's treatment clinic. Additional psychological tests will
      be performed at UT Health-San Antonio's Research Imaging Institute (RII) at the baseline and
      post-treatment visits in order to track patient progress.
