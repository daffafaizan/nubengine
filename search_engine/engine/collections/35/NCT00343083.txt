    
      Primary Objective- To evaluate whether the addition of Cetuximab (C225) in combination with
      chemotherapy and radiation can cause an enhanced anti-tumor effect resulting in improving
      local regional control of patients with locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell
      carcinoma of head and neck. (SCCHN).

      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN Open label, non-randomized, single arm trial.

      P = Paclitaxel will be administered on a weekly schedule at a dose of 40mg/m2 IV by 1-hour
      infusion prior to cetuximab dose. This will be administered for a total of 8 weeks (from
      weeks 2-9)

      C225 = Cetuximab: 400 mg/m2 IV will be given as the initial OR loading dose in week 1 and
      then 250 mg/m2 IV weekly will be given for 8 weeks (weeks 2-9).

      C = Carboplatin will be given at a dose of AUC=2/week - will be administered as a 30 minute
      infusion after cetuximab infusion (weeks 2-9)

      RT = Radiation therapy will be delivered at 1.8 Gy fraction/day, 5 days a week for a total of
      70.2 Gy. RT will be given from weeks 2-9.

      Note: Sequence of administration will be paclitaxel followed by cetuximab followed by
      carboplatin followed by XRT.

      Approximately 60 patients from MSGCC/BVAMC will participate in this study. Prior to entering
      the study the doctor will examine the patient and order blood tests ( which will be done by
      blood draw, approximately 2 tablespoons) and tests to measure the patients disease (scans).
      The patient will also be evaluated by a dietician who will follow the patient throughout the
      course of the therapy to help the patient meet his/her nutritional needs
