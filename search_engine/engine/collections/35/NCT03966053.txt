    
      This is a dose escalation safety/tolerability study to evaluate the presence of TFP-related
      adverse events in DBA subjects, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TFP in
      DBA.

      If tolerated, this trial will support either a proof of concept trial of low-dose TFP in DBA,
      or the advancement of a chemically modified TFP-like drug (to alleviate the neurologic
      toxicity) for the treatment of DBA.
