      prevalent leukemia in the Western Hemisphere, accounting for ~25% of all leukemia's. It
      represents a monoclonal expansion of small, long-lived, apparently slowly dividing CD5+ B
      cells. Because of the low proliferative index and a presumed uniform proliferative rate of
      B-CLL cells in vivo (a fact not yet tested or documented), B-CLL appears to be primarily a
      disease of accumulation rather than proliferation.

      B-CLL remains an incurable illness and there is no survival benefit to early intervention.

      Therefore, patients with early stage disease are usually followed closely without initiating
      treatment. Patients with more extensive disease or progressive cytopenias are eventually
      treated with cytotoxic agents, with or without prednisone, or with nucleoside analogues that
      promote apoptosis in the leukemic cells. The clinical outcome of the disease is determined
      both by the profound dysregulation of the immune system that results in infection and
      autoimmunity and by leukemic infiltration and destruction of organs. Autoimmune phenomena are
      common and frequently directed against hematopoietic cells, resulting in autoimmune hemolytic
      anemia (10-25%) or immune thrombocytopenia.
