      achieving a hypoalgesic effect during the onset of cervicobrachial pain symptoms. This
      happens through a series of complex physiologic interactions which are not fully understood.
      The CLG Physical therapy technique consists of controlled movements of the cervical and
      brachial plexus neural tissue. Hypoalgesic effect produced by CLG is associated to an
      increase in neural tissue mobility, edema, inflammation and intraneural pressure reduction,
      without any known side effects when applied properly, except for a momentary worsening of
      symptoms (the only known side effect of CLG), which is an important contrast to the wide and
      sometimes severe spectrum of side effects derived from drug therapy used to treat
      cervicobrachial pain.

      It is believed that the hypoalgesic effect offered by neural tissue mobilization is a
      consequence of descending nervous system pain modulation activity and an improvement in the
      distinct biomechanical properties of the involved neural tissue.Despite the increase in
      scientific interest in evidence based options to treat pain and neural tissue mobilization
      techniques there is a current lack of enough controlled double blind clinical trials that
      measure the effectiveness of neural tissue mobilization techniques such as the CLG and its
      specific effect over cervicobrachial pain. For this reason the present investigation
      consisted in the application of a treatment protocol based on CLG neural tissue mobilization
      in a controlled double blind clinical trial with the aim to assess its clinical effectiveness
      in treating pain symptoms
