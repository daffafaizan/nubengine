      abnormalities which could slow the kinetics of O2 uptake(VO2)and diminished tolerance to
      incremental exercise. Although previous studies have shown that aerobic training is able to
      accelerate VO2 kinetics in several disease populations, little is known if these positive
      findings are also applicable to hemodialysis patients.
