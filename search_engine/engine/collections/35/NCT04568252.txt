    
      MISTIC is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind study. Eligible patients will
      have to report their migraine crisis in a diary during a one month pre-selection phase. Then,
      patients will be randomized into one of two treatment groups :

        -  active millimeter wave emission bracelet

        -  or placebo bracelet

      Patients will have to use the medical device twice a day for 3 months. The investigators will
      follow them for an additional 3 months to assess the persistence of the effect.

      Throughout the follow-up, patients will report their migraines crisis in a journal.

      The primary outcome will be the impact of wearing a millimeter wave bracelet for 3 months, on
      the number of days with migraine headaches.
