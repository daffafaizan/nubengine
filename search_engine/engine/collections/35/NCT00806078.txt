      food. This is an open label randomized single dose two-way crossover study to compare the
      bioavailability of a single oral dose of quinine sulfate 648mg(2 x 324 mg capsules) when
      opened and mixed with 120 ml of chocolate pudding relative to the same dose given as two
      intact capsules. Eighteen healthy adult subjects will be enrolled. Following a fast of at
      least 10 hours subjects will be randomized to receive either 648 mg of quinine sulfate as the
      intact capsules or opened mixed in 120ml of chocolate pudding. Following a washout period of
      at least 7 days all subjects will be given the alternate dose under similar conditions.
      Following each dose, blood samples will be collected at times sufficient to determine the
      difference in bioavailability (if any) between the two methods of drug administration. In
      addition patients will be monitored for any adverse events including Electrocardiogram (EKG)
      changes (at baseline and 4 hours after each dose).
