    
      The objectives of this study were to examine clinical outcomes after reconstruction with
      intramedullary fixation (IMN) or endoprosthetic reconstruction (EPR) with a specific focus on
      (1) the rate of complication or failure; (2) differences in complication rates by anatomic
      site; (3) functional results as assessed by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society System (MSTS);
      (4) differences in complication rate between patients treated with INM versus EPR; and (5)
      differences in survival in patients with metastatic bone disease based on disease-specific,
      laboratory, and demographic information.
