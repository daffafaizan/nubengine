      Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative condition worldwide, and
      while both motor and non-motor symptoms can be improved with symptomatic therapies, there are
      currently no drugs that slow or halt progression of the disease. All previous trials of
      neuroprotective therapies have failed, in large part due to the lack of objective, sensitive
      biomarkers of Parkinson's disease progression.

      Plan:

      The proposed study aims to characterize the rate of change in a peripheral blood marker of
      inflammation (Treg percentage) and three quantitative motor measures (finger tapping, 9-hole
      peg test and peak turn velocity) in a cohort of 25 untreated PD patients with motor testing
      and blood sampling performed at baseline and at 6 months

      Methods:

      Participants will have three visits to the Portland VA over a 12 month period. Assessments
      will be made regarding their Parkinson's disease progression (motor ability and gait and
      balance). At each visit, a VA phlebotomist will draw whole blood. The VA lab will analyze
      whole blood for metabolic CBC with differential. The research team will hand carry blood
      samples from the VA phlebotomist to Dr. Quinn's VA lab in BLDG 103 - E143. A plasma sample
      will be added to the Neurologic Disorders Repository (MIRB # 3129). Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated from buffy coats using Ficoll-Paque. The PBMC will
      be frozen and batch analyzed for T lymphocytes using flow cytometry at OHSU.
