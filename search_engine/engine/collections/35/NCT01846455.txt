      will undergo an outpatient screening period of up to 21 days. Screening procedures will
      include an assessment of mental status which will be repeated before dosing. Eligible
      subjects will then undergo hospital intake procedures and reside at the investigational site
      until Day 5. Subjects will be enrolled in 5-treatment groups as follows: (1) Group 1:
      Subjects with hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh A; (2) Group 2: Subjects with
      hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh B; (3) Group 3: Subjects with hepatic impairment
      classified as Child-Pugh C; (4) Group 4: Subjects with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection but
      without hepatic impairment; and (5) Group 5: Subjects without hepatic disease or impairment.
      Group 5 is used as a control group
