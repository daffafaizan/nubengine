      metastases treated with intravenous vs. intrahepatic arterial infusion of
      fluorouracil/leucovorin. II. Assess the effect of these 2 treatments on symptoms and quality
      of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients randomized to Arm II should have a preoperative hepatic
      angiography; at laparotomy, an intrahepatic arterial catheter is fused into the
      gastroduodenal artery to establish an infusion of both lobes of the liver. Arm I:
      Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; with
      Leucovorin calcium, CF, NSC-3590. Intravenous infusion. Arm II: Single-Agent Chemotherapy
      with Drug Modulation. 5-FU; with CF. Intrahepatic arterial infusion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 312 patients are expected to be randomized within 3-4 years.
