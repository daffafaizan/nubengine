      of bone marrow engraftment. The dose of treatment will be escalated between participants.
      Denosumab is supposed to be effective for several months (4 to 6 months). The biologic
      activity of Denosumab will be followed by the measure in the blood of a biomarker of bone
      destruction called CTX. This biomarker is supposed to decrease after Denosumab infusion,
      reflecting the blockade of bone destruction by the treatment. Bone density will be assessed
      by a radiologic test named DXA which a standard test. All blood and radiologic tests mandated
      by the study will be done at the same time as standard follow-up after bone marrow
      transplant. Thus, participants will not have extra visits at the outpatient clinic, or extra
      blood punctures, for the specific purpose of the study. Participants will be followed for 36
      months after bone marrow transplantation.For experiencing graft versus host disease, a second
      dose of Denosumab will be allowed, followed by subsequent doses evry 4 to 6 months till a
      maximum of 4 doses within 24months after bone marrow transplantation.
