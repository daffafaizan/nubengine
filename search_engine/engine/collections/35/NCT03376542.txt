      potential for morbidity and mortality. Preoperative evaluation is of paramount importance to
      optimize results. There is much evidence about the benefits of the cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing (CPET) in the evaluation of preoperative risk in non-cardiac surgeries. Thus, it is
      important to evaluate the relationship between parameters obtained in the CPET and the
      outcomes after cardiac surgery, especially CABG.

      This is a prospective cohort study in which participants undergo submaximal CEPT on a
      treadmill prior to CABG. Participants will be followed up for one month after surgery to
      assess mortality and non fatal complications. It is expected that poor cardiopulmonary
      fitness is related to worse outcomes in CABG, as already observed in other cardiac
      pathologies and in non-cardiac surgery.
