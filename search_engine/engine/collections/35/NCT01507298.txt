      speed of capsule transit through the GI tract. Capsule endoscopy involves a patient
      swallowing a pill which contains a camera, in order to image the parts of the bowel that a
      conventional endoscope cannot reach. A rapid transit may result in insufficient mucosal
      visualisation, which would reduce the sensitivity of the investigation.

      For oesophageal pH monitoring, it is essential that the patient behaves as they would
      normally to produce measurements that represent a standard day. Using accelerometry, the
      investigators can compare the amount, and nature, of physical activity taken throughout the
      investigation to that of the preceding day, or week. In addition, further analysis of motion
      data captured will allow us to correlate specific activities and body orientation with pH
      readings to get a better insight into the pathophysiology of a patient's condition.

      The studies will be conducted over 6-9 months in Imperial College Trust's medical outpatient
      service. All patients undergoing capsule endoscopy or ambulatory oesophageal monitoring will
      be asked to consider participating. Patients will receive the eAR sensor up to 2 days before
      their investigation, and will be asked to wear it until the end of their investigation (not
      whilst sleeping). Capsule endoscopy normally takes less than 12 hours, and pH monitoring
      takes between 24 and 48 hours. Participation makes no difference to the standard or type of
      care that they will receive, the sensor data is additional.
