      arterial health, there is confusion surrounding the specific health benefits of plant based
      alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) versus marine derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This research will examine the health benefits of ALA from
      consumption of diets rich in canola oil, novel monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and DHA
      enriched canola oils, and flax oil compared with a control diet representative of North
      American diets rich in omega-6 and saturated fats. Treatment oils will be examined for
      potential influence on endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidation, body composition,
      and plasma lipoprotein characterization. Furthermore, in an effort to elucidate the genetic
      factors that promote ALA conversion to EPA/DHA and strengthen the role of ALA in
      cardiovascular health, a major objective is to correlate common genetic variants in the fatty
      acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) gene cluster with ALA
      conversion to EPA/DHA and n-3 fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids in response to
      consumption of the treatment oils. Besides, psychosocial predictors of vascular function will
      be investigated.
