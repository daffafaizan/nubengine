      Primary

        -  Determine the activity of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
           (ABI-007; Abraxane^®) and bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival and
           response rate, in women with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (ABI-007; Abraxane^®)
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
