    
      Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. The
      parasites are transmitted from an animal or human reservoir through the bite of infected
      female phlebotomine sand flies. This study is a randomized, open-label clinical trial
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the LEISH-F3 recombinant
      protein antigen formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE adjuvant in healthy adults 18 to 49
      years of age. Each subject's duration of participation will be about 18 months. Subjects will
      receive a total of 3 doses of vaccine, which will be given by intramuscular injection on Days
      0, 28, and 168. The volume of each vaccine dose will be 0.5 mL. A computerized system will be
      used to acquire any data regarding halting criteria throughout the study. Primary objective
      is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LEISH-F3 formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE
      following intramuscular administration of 20 µg of LEISH-F3 together with 5 µg of GLA-SE, 10
      µg of MPL-SE, or SE alone. Secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of LEISH-F3
      formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE by evaluating IgG antibody responses to LEISH-F3 at
      Days 0, 28, 56, 168, 196, and 365, and T cell responses to LEISH-F3 at Days 0, 14, 42, 168,
      182, and 365. A substudy will be performed using up to 12 subjects from each Study Group
      (Groups 1, 2 and 3) and an additional 12 subjects to serve as controls. This substudy will
      investigate whether, as in murine cells, cell surface markers (CD11a, CD49d) can be used as a
      surrogate to identify protective immune CD4+ T cells in human subjects receiving a vaccine
      antigen.
