      manifest as paresthesia of warmth, cold, pinprick and so on, especially affect ed
      length-dependent area. Skin biopsy is an effective method to diagnose SFN with high
      diagnostic accuracy. The procedure is simple and minimally, and the wound usually heals
      within a few days. However, skin biopsy is not widely used in diagnose of SFN in Chinese
      patients with diabetes. This study is aimed to establish a normal reference range of
      intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in the Chinese population, and to detect SFN in
      Chinese patients with diabetes by skin biopsy.
