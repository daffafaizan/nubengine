      Only 4% of patients with acute pulmonary embolism develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
      hypertension and acute pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis is reported in the
      anamnesis of 75% of those with chronic thromboembolic disease. Therefore, the etiology of the
      disease is not clear. Altought many studies are done, especially the role of inflamation is
      emhasised underlie the disease.

      Matrix metalloproteinase enzymes play a substantial role of extracellular matrix remodeling.
      The clot formed in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension does not melt and turns into
      a fibrous state, it occludes the pulmonary artery.In this study, investigators aimed to
      investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes in pulmonary arterial wall
      remodeling in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

      Matrix metalloprotinase enzymes are known to play a role in atherosclerosis. This research
      will investigate whether there is atherosclerosis together with inflamattion in the
      background of chronic thromboembolic hypertension.
