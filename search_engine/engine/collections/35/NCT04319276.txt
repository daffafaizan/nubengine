      antineoplastic activity, safety and tolerance of GaM in participants with relapsed,
      treatment-refractory GBM. Although GaM has been studied in previous phase 1 clinical trials
      in normal individuals and in participants with a variety of different solid tumors, it has
      never been evaluated in this population of participants. Dosages in this study have been
      defined to have limited side effects in other phase 1 trials. The maximum number of
      participants to enroll in the dose escalation part will not exceed 24. The trial will follow
      a 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design.
