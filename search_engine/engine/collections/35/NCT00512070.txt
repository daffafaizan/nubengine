      this pilot study is evaluating 20 patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
      bipolar disorder over 15 weeks under three experimental conditions: 1) baseline (two weeks
      treatment with already established antipsychotic medication other than olanzapine or
      clozapine), 2) six weeks treatment with olanzapine only, and 3) six weeks treatment with
      olanzapine and melatonin. Half of the patients will receive 0.3 mg of oral melatonin and half
      will receive 3.0 mg of melatonin. Nocturnal melatonin production, as estimated by assay of
      urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin(aMT6s) adjusted for creatinine, will be measured weekly. In
      addition, weekly measurements of weight and other metabolic indices, including waist and hip
      measurements, fasting glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and leptin will be
      taken. It is anticipated that there will be an olanzapine-induced decrease in melatonin
      production. Furthermore, it is expected that the decrease in melatonin production associated
      with olanzapine treatment will be reversed by administration of melatonin with olanzapine.
