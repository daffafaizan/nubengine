      inhibitors as potential new therapies for cancers driven by c-Met activation. HS-10241 is a
      potent and selective small molecule c-Met kinase inhibitor for both enzyme and c-Met
      phosphorylation in the cell. Consistent with its potent enzyme and cell activity, HS-10241
      was found to inhibit cell growth in vitro against tumors with c-Met gene amplification or
      c-Met overexpression. On the basis of these findings, the current trial will be conducted in
      participants with advanced solid tumors for whom standard treatment is not currently
      available.

      This study consists of 2 phases. In the dose-escalation phase, up to 5 dose levels of
      HS-10241 (100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, 340 mg/day, 500 mg/day, and 700 mg/day) will be
      investigated with a sequential "3+3" design (3 or 6 participants in every dose level).
      Participants will have a single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period (7 days). Following
      the first dose, participants will enter a 1 week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and
      single-dose PK. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the 1-week period,
      HS-10241 administration will resume at the same dose level.

      In the expansion phase, up to 12 additional participants will be enrolled at the MTD.
      Anti-tumor effects will be assessed every 2 cycles (4 weeks=1 cycle) by using RECIST version
      1.1 criteria.
