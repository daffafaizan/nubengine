      receptor-modified autologous T cells targeting CLDN18.2 (CT041 autologous CAR T) in subjects
      with Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) expression-positive, advanced gastric/esophagogastric combination
      adenocarcinoma that has failed at least second-line therapy and advanced pancreatic cancer
      that has failed at least first-line therapy. Cells, which will be referred to in the text as
      CT041) for effectiveness, safety and cellular metabolic kinetics.
