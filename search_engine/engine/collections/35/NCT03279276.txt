    
      The overall purpose of this study is to show whether the Primoris® hip prosthesis results in
      a smaller loss of bone density than standard hip prosthesis, which in the longer term may
      result in an improved survival of prosthesis No. 2 after revision / replacement of a
      Primoris® hip prosthesis.

      The primary outcome is periprosthetic bone quality in Primoris® hip prosthesis compared to
      standard hip prosthesis measured by DXA scanning.

      The secondary outcomes are to assess:

        1. The hip function measured by gait analysis.

        2. Hip strength at pressure gauge.

        3. Prosthetic migration / migration measured by radio-stereometric analysis (RSA).

        4. Patient satisfaction measured by PROMs.
