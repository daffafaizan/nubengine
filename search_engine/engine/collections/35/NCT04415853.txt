    
      The experimental group and the control group were administered until the disease progression
      assessed by the RECIST V1.1 standard (unless The investigator evaluates that the subject
      continues to have clinical benefits, and the subject can be allowed to continue receiving
      treatment), start new anti-tumor therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw informed consent,
      ect.

      The research phase of this study is divided into screening period, treatment period,
      treatment end visit, safety follow-up and survival follow-up.

      Subjects who have finished the screening examination and evaluation after the screening
      period enter the treatment period, and evaluate the efficacy. Subjects who have finished the
      treatment need to continue to undergo safety follow-up ; For subjects who have finished the
      trial treatment due to toxic reactions or other reasons, and have not observed the
      progression, they still need to carry out imaging evaluation according to the original
      frequency until the occurrence of tumor progression judged by RECIST V1.1 standard, start of
      new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or end of
      study, whichever occurs first; all subjects receive survival follow-up until death,lost of
      ,the follow-up or the study endedï¼Œwhichever occurred first.

      PK studies: Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are conducted only in centers with appropriate
      conditions. Only some subjects in the experiemtal group are required to undergo a PK study.
      Participate in intensive PK blood collection (8-12 cases), and participate in sparse PK blood
      collection (150 cases). Subjects participating in intensive PK blood collection do not
      participate in sparse PK blood collection.

      Biomarker research: Detect EGFR overexpression and amplification research on tumor tissue
      samples for all subjects and explore the relationship between its efficacy and changes in
      EGFR overexpression and amplification status before and after treatment.
