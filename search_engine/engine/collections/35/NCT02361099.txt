      of cancers are diagnosed at advanced stages. Relapses are common and rarely curable. At least
      75% of relapses are symptomatic and there is no standard monitoring after curative treatment
      or not. Currently, the most common monitoring strategy involves the completion of a clinical
      examination every 3 to 6 months associated with chest X-ray or CT-scan.

      An intensive clinical and imaging monitoring has not yet shown any survival advantage but
      monitoring of symptoms appears to have a significant medical and economic advantage compared
      to imaging monitoring. This non-personalized approach is a source of anxiety for patients,
      especially with the approach of the date of the imaging assessment. In contrast, this
      monitoring can leave symptomatic patients with untreated relapse for several weeks because
      many symptomatic patients wait the date of the imaging assessment to consult.

      the investigators have developed a score based on the dynamics and the association of
      clinical signs to alert the physician to a possible recurrence of lung cancer. The referring
      physician is alerted so early and convenes the patient for a checkup. One of the explanations
      which could demonstrate the gain in survival is the possibility offered by the application
      SENTINEL is to treat the relapses earlier, thus avoiding to wait a too much important
      deterioration of general condition between two monitoring follow-up more or less spaced.
