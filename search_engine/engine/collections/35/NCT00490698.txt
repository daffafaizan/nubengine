      bones from pain and from breaking as a result of cancer. Atorvastatin is a drug that lowers
      cholesterol levels in the blood. Combining these medications may make zoledronate more
      effective.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be given zoledronate
      intravenously (IV--through a needle in your vein) over fifteen minutes,1 time every 4 weeks.
      You will take a pill, atorvastatin, by mouth once time a day every day that you are on the
      study. Every 4 weeks is considered 1 study "cycle".

      You will need to return to M. D. Anderson for check-ups every 8 -12 weeks. Urine will be
      collected for routine tests. You will have x-rays, bone scans, and/or CT scans to check on
      the status of the disease.

      You will receive at least 2 cycles of treatment unless intolerable side effects occur or your
      disease gets worse. You may receive more than 2 cycles if you are benefitting from the study
      drugs.

      You will be followed every 8 weeks for up to 1 year for skeletal events (symptoms related to
      disease moving to or getting worse in your bones). You will be taken off study if you
      experience a skeletal event or at the end of the 1-year monitoring period. Monitoring may be
      done with a local doctor or at M. D. Anderson. No extra testing or procedures are needed
      during this period.

      This is an investigational study. The combination of the 2 drugs given in this study is
      investigational for the treatment of bone metastases. Zoledronate is approved for the
      treatment of bone metastases. Atorvastatin has been approved by the FDA for lowering
      cholesterol. About 38 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.
      Anderson.
