      however, the majority of adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYACS) report at least
      one chronic health condition. These medical and cognitive-psychological late effects can
      disrupt or interfere with continual adaptation to post-treatment life, thereby negatively
      impacting identity formation and inhibiting AYACS from seeking fulfilling academic, career,
      and social relationship experiences. The Shadow's Edge mobile app was created for adolescent
      and young adults with complex medical conditions as an enjoyable and engaging digital,
      first-person perspective game that uses principles of narrative and creative arts therapies
      to encourage youth to reflect on, and create brief, developmentally-relevant narratives
      about, their life experiences. In this trial, investigators will conduct a two-arm, waitlist
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the Shadow's Edge game in
      promoting resilience and identify formation among AYACS. Participants will be 175 AYACS who
      receive clinical care in a large, pediatric cancer survivorship program. Data will be
      collected from medical records, mobile game play statistics, participant narratives and art
      created in the game platform, and participant responses to standardized assessments.
      Information gathered through this study will be used to establish initial game efficacy and
      to lead to Shadow's Edge game enhancements that will further improve acceptability and
      effectiveness of the game. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a freely
      accessible, enjoyable and engaging self-led game that may bolster resilience resources,
      improve quality of life, and promote identity formation among adolescents and young adults
      with complex medical conditions.
