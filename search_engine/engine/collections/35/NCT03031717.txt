      occlusive PVT might influence the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Transjugular
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been reported to be an effective treatment of PVT
      in cirrhosis, with the advantage of avoiding the risk of bleeding linked to anticoagulation.
      In this study, we will evaluate the outcome of TIPS for PVT in patients with and without
      cirrhosis and determinate survival.
