      etiologies that are characterized by impaired hepatocellular secretion of bile, resulting in
      accumulation of bile acids, bilirubin and cholesterol.This could result in different clinical
      features including pruritus, malabsorption and vitamin deficiencies with subsequent
      coagulation disorders and bone disease. Persistence of cholestasis leads to biliary fibrosis
      which can progress to liver cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.

      Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate ligand-activated transcription factor networks of genes for
      the elimination and detoxification of potentially toxic biliary constituents accumulating in
      cholestasis. Activation of several NRs also modulates fibrogenesis, inflammation, and
      carcinogenesis as sequelae of cholestasis. Hence, It represent attractive targets for
      pharmacotherapy of cholestatic disorders.

      Several already available drugs may exert their beneficial effects in cholestasis via NR
      activation eg, ursodeoxycholic acid via glucocorticoid receptor and pregnane X receptor, and
      rifampicin via pregnane X receptor. Unfortunately, Some patients may not respond to these
      medications.

      Fibrates, serum Lipid lowering medication, has a stimulation action on proliferator activated
      receptor alpha. It is a nuclear receptor with an integral role in bile homeostasis. Several
      case reports and pilot studies have demonstrated the efficacy of fibrates in reducing serum
      biomarkers of cholestasis and liver function abnormalities in patients with incomplete
      response to ursodeoxycholic acid monotherapy. These results are of interest, because fibrates
      are attracting increased attention as adjunct therapy for chronic cholestatic liver diseases.
