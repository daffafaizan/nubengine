      disturbance of endothelialization. We will investigate the following issues.

        1. Impact of asymmetric expansion induced by kissing balloon technique on mid and long term
           results

        2. Difference between SES and EES

        3. Impact of abnormal OCT findings on long-term clinical outcome (3yr)
