      abdominal pain. rTMS is an effective treatment of neurogenic chronic pain. The aim of the
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS on rectal hypersensitivity in patients with IBS in
      a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.

      Patients and method: 20 patients with rectal hypersensitivity secondary to IBS will have one
      active session of rTMS located on the cortical area of the abdominal muscles during 5
      consecutive days and one session of simulated rTMS during 5 over consecutive days
      corresponding to the placebo session. The order of the two session will be randomized. The
      efficacy of rTMS will be assessed by a rectal barostat to determine the pain or discomfort
      threshold and by a RIII reflex. The barostat and RIII reflex will be performed at the
      beginning and at the end of each session.

      The investigators hope to demonstrate an improvement of the rectal hypersensitivity during
      the active stimulations compared to the placebo one.
