      PCI in Shanghai, were enrolled in the prospective sysytem. Several strategies were applied in
      these patients, including physician vs. patient transfer strategy, upsteam vs. downstream
      strategy, Firebird stent vs. Excel stent (bio-absorbable SES), etc. Once the patient was
      randomized to one of these study, he will be denied to the others. Clinical and angiographic
      outcomes were compared, with the final purpose to find an optimal strategy in treating AMI
      patients.
