      polypharmacy for symptomatic relief. Current treatment options for neuropathic pain include
      both oral and topical medications. Most commonly prescribed oral treatments include
      antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline, desipramine, and duloxetine), antiepileptics (eg,
      gabapentin, pregabalin), and opiates such as tramadol and morphine. Current topical
      treatments include the lidocaine patch and the capsaicin patch. Many patients have inadequate
      pain relief in spite of these treatment options.

      Currently, there are no treatments available for treatment of neuropathy itself other than
      treating the underlying cause and addressing the symptomatic relief for pain. Current drug
      therapies for neuropathic pain provide inadequate pain relief and undesirable side effects
      including sedation and cognitive dysfunction. It is not uncommon to use a combination of
      agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain to minimize the side effects. Although treating
      the mild to moderate pain may be relatively easy, it is very challenging for severe
      neuropathic pain. Although the use of opiates for neuropathic pain is well accepted, it
      remains controversial because of the potential for abuse and diversion.
