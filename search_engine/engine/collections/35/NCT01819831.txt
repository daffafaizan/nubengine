      large or high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS). The advantages of preoperative
      radiotherapy are lower doses and smaller radiation volumes; these may be used to effect
      improvement of long-term side effects and extremity function. Another potential advantage is
      assisting surgery through tumor shrinkage and reduction of tumor cell seeding. The
      disadvantage of preoperative radiation is the higher likelihood of postoperative wound
      complications, but in a prospective phase III trial these complications were found to be
      generally temporary and without significant effect on long term function.

      Combined conservative surgery and radiotherapy has shown to achieve excellent local control
      in sarcoma patients following margin-negative surgery, but late radiation morbidity and
      reduced quality of life may result from adjuvant radiation. The dosimetric advantage of
      proton radiotherapy may translate into reduced acute and late effects due to improved
      normal-tissue sparing in the treatment of extremity and truncal STS. However, these potential
      advantages need to be validated in clinical trials. The investigators propose a phase II
      study to evaluate the effect of preoperative proton radiotherapy on the reduction of late
      radiation morbidity, patterns of failure, and impact of late radiation morbidity on general
      quality of life (QOL).
