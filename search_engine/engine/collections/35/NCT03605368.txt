      targeting the core deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and promote
      acquisition of skills necessary for effective navigation of challenging social situations,
      such as engagement with law enforcement. Researchers have explored the potential of virtual
      reality technology in targeting autism-related deficits, but at this time there are no
      evidence-based VR interventions for ASD. While most research labelled VR for the purposes of
      therapy has not been immersive, in recent years, the commercial introduction of head-mounted
      displays (HMD) and lower cost of virtual reality technology have led to greater interest in
      therapeutic applications of VR. As part of a mission to develop VR products for individuals
      with ASD, investigators will collaborate with a commercial tech start-up company, Floreo
      Technology, to study a mobile VR module for police safety skills. Investigators seek to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of the mobile VR police safety module (PSM) and the
      effectiveness of the module in improving police interaction skills in adolescents and adults
      with ASD.
