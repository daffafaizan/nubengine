           may reflect disease-related changes in blood flow to some areas, particularly those
           involved with tumors.

        -  Patients with known tumor sites amendable to DAT evaluation will be imaged at the time
           of staging and at later time points. Thermal profiles will be compared to those of
           normal adjacent tissues and correlated with the images of the tumors on conventional
           images.
