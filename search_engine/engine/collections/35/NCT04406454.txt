      cellular resolution OCT has the characteristics of non-invasive, non-radioactive, labelfree,
      real-time and high tissue penetration depth that are highly valuable for clinical use. This
      technology allows visualization of important structural features such as the epidermis and
      dermis and the epidermal-dermal junction. OCT has the advantage of generating cross-sectional
      images, like the orientation of pathology slides.

      The ApolloVue® S100 Image System is intended to be used as a non-invasive imaging tool in the
      evaluation of external human skin tissue microstructure by providing two-dimensional,
      crosssectional (B-scan) and en face (E-scan) real-time visualization for assessment by
      physicians to support in forming a clinical judgment. For the ApolloVue® S100 Image System
      image, both cross-sectional view and en face view can be obtained to assist physicians'
      diagnosis. With both views, physicians can obtain important spatial information in regards to
      the skin. Besides, the ApolloVue® S100 Image System is equipped with an image guiding system
      which provides a high-resolution dermatoscope like image, for the positioning of skin sites
      for optical biopsies.

      In this protocol, it is proposed to study the optical imaging features of healthy human skin
      and nevi and the evaluation of usability. We propose to recruit 60 subjects for such a trial.
      Healthy volunteers will be approached and consented to this protocol. The volunteers will be
      imaged.
