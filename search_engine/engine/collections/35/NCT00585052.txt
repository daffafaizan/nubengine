      number of people whose tumors shrink or whose disease responds to the treatment. Another
      purpose of the study is to find out how long tumors stay reduced in size before growing again
      as well as how long people live after receiving paclitaxel and lovastatin. The study will
      also gather information on the side effects, if any, of this combination of paclitaxel and
      lovastatin.
