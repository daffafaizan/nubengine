      homocysteine levels following bariatric surgery remain controversially discussed.

      708 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass over a 6 year
      period. Throughout their routine follow-up, demographic data as well as homocysteine, folate
      and vitamin B12 were retrospectively collected at the timepoints: preoperatively, at 3, 6, 9,
      12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 months postoperatively.

      In order to reveal clinical relevance of the results, patients were sent a special
      questionnaire accompanied by an informed consent form for participation and asked for
      cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep venous thrombosis) or any
      other hospital stay after the surgery and cross checked with two region wide databases which
      account for approx. 80% of all hospital contacts in the region. Additionally, the database
      was networked with the statewide death registry in order to reveal deceased subjects and data
      about their demise through the beforementioned databases was collected.
