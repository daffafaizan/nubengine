    
      This Phase II study is designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study for
      subjects with evidence of PSCI.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to the Group I arm (ALZT-OP1a adjuvant treatment), which
      will consist of ALZT-OP1a for inhalation, taken twice daily (morning and evening), OR the
      Group II placebo arm, which will consist of inhaled placebo, taken twice daily (morning and
      evening).

      A minimum of 350 subjects will be randomized to receive one of two possible treatment
      assignments: ALZT-OP1a adjuvant treatment of active study drug or placebo.

      To account for subject dropouts (estimated rate of 30%), it is anticipated that up to 500 (or
      250 subjects per treatment arm) may be recruited and randomized, to achieve a minimum of 175
      evaluable subjects per treatment arm.

      Randomization assignments will be stratified by site to ensure balance by site.
