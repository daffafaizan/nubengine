      consciousness/sedation in pediatric patients with developing brain by using PLEM100(Inbody®)

      PLEM100 (Inbody®) is a medical equipment to measure, based on phase lag entropy algorithm,
      the level of patient consciousness, which is expressed by PLE score ranging from 0 (burst
      suppression or deep sedated) to 100 (awake).

      In this study, pediatric patients aged from 3 to 6 years old who undergo total intravenous
      general anesthesia are chosen as target subjects. The investigators measure how PLE score
      changes during 1) anesthesia induction, 2) anesthesia maintenance, 3) emergence from
      anesthesia. Then, the PLE score would be validated by analyzing the correlation with the
      consciousness level expressed in University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS).
