      integrity of executive functions (EFs). EFs comprise a complex, multi-faceted brain system
      necessary to pay attention, overcome habitual and automatic behaviors, regulate mood, and
      ensure that current behavior is in line with short and long-term goals.Yet, protracted
      periods of high uncertainty, high demands, and high stress can lead to decreases in the
      efficiency and availability of EFs. Given the high demands and psychological vulnerabilities
      that U.S. Army personnel may face, it is critical to provide them with training programs to
      protect against degradation of EFs (particularly attention and working memory) over
      high-stress, high-demand intervals. Prior research on mindfulness training (MT) in civilians
      and military servicemembers showed that MT can effectively protect against degradation in
      attention and working memory and benefit psychological well-being over high-demand intervals.

      Problem: While being successful, prior MT programs required a considerable amount of time
      dedicated to training (e.g., 24-hour training) and it is challenging to integrate these long
      programs into the busy schedule of the U.S. Army personnel. To accommodate the time
      constraints, the principal investigator together with a mindfulness expert developed a
      short-form mindfulness training program contextualized for the U.S. Army; the program
      consists of 8-hour training and is known as MBAT, Mindfulness-Based Attention Training.

      Project Goal: The present study aims to investigate the best practices for delivery of a
      short-form mindfulness training to U.S. Army Cohorts. Specifically, the present study will
      examine the best delivery structure for the MBAT by comparing MBAT course delivered in 2
      weeks vs. 4 weeks.
