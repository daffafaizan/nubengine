      with relapsed persistent or chronic ITP with or without prior splenectomy. Patients who
      participate in this study must have completed the Phase 2 study 0913M0621 (NCT01054443), a
      double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study that evaluated the efficacy and safety
      lusutrombopag during which they either completed treatment or discontinued treatment due to a
      platelet count > 400,000/Î¼L.
