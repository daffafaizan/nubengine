      and PK information for ganaxolone 1200mg/d, 1800mg/d and placebo. Cohort 2 will investigate
      the efficacy, tolerability and safety of ganaxolone 1800mg/d compared to placebo. Cohort 1
      (N= approximately 50) will enroll into a 67-week study comprised of a 4-week prospective
      baseline period plus 4 week retrospective baseline followed by two treatment phases: a 9-week
      randomized DB placebo-controlled treatment phase followed by a 52-week open label (OL)
      treatment phase. Cohort 2 (N=150) will enroll into a 72-week study comprised of a 8-week
      prospective baseline period followed by two treatment phases: a 14-week randomized DB
