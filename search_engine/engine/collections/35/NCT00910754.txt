    
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drugs will be known) study to evaluate the
      effects of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on the conduction of electric charges within
      the heart in male patients diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (a
      progressive form of prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body). At various time
      points outline in the protocol from Day -1 of Cycle 1 up to Day 2 of Cycle 2, patients will
      have electrocardiograms extracted from a 24 hour holter-monitor to evaluate the electrical
      activity of their heart. Efficacy will be assessed according to Prostate Cancer Working Group
      2 and modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria. Serial blood samples
      for pharmacokinetic analysis (how the drug concentrations change over time) will be collected
      and safety will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will take 1000 mg of abiraterone
      acetate once daily plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily orally (by mouth) until disease
      progression and will be followed up for up to 60 months.
