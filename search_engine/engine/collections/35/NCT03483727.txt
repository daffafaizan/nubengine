    
      In a first study (MAX, BJA 2017, Lelaidier et al) the investigators designed a digital
      cognitive aid (MAX for Medical Assistant eXpert) under the form of a smartphone application
      including 5 scenarios of anaesthesia and intensive care crises (malignant hyperthermia,
      anaphylactic shock, acute toxicity of local anaesthetics, severe and symptomatic
      hyperkalaemia, ventricular fibrillation), designed to be used in the hand of the leader
      managing the situations. Technical and non-technical skills were improved in 4 out of 5
      scenarios.

      Combat casualties are dealt with a stereotyped management in the French army, and all
      soldiers learn the algorithm (acronym) designed for this purpose, the MARCHE RYAN. Situations
      requiring the use of the MARCHE RYAN are extremely stressful (on the battlefield, performed
      by non-medical personal, often on a comrade).

      The present study exclusively deals with the management of combat casualties with the digital
      cognitive aid MAX adapted for MARCHE RYAN algorithm.
