    
      This is a post-market, monocentric, open-label, randomized study of superiority, with the
      untreated eye considered as a comparator for the eye treated with VisuXL®, to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of VisuXL® in professional water-polo athletes exposed to pool water after
      VisuXL® ocular instillations for 2 months. Considered the category of subjects to study, the
      study is to be considered a fact-finding pilot study in a particular category of subjects.

      The study population will be enrolled only after having signed the informed consent; in each
      enrolled subject, only one eye will be treated with VisuXL®, while the other no, as will be
      considered the comparator, so the two randomized groups will be divided by treated eyes:

        -  Untreated control eye

        -  Eye treated with VisuXL®

      Each enrolled subject will be instructed to instill, TID, 1-2 drops of VisuXL® always in the
      same eye during the entire study, according to the present modality:

        -  Morning

        -  Before training (at least one hour before entering the pool)

        -  After training (maximum one hour after the end of the activity) Subjects will continue
           to instil 1-2 drops of VisuXL®, TID, always in the same eye, even in days without
           training (including weekends).
