      home-based IMT protocols: (1) TIRE, (2) Standard, and (3) Sham (i.e. Low Resistance). All
      subjects will undergo 8 weeks of daily unsupervised IMT using either a PrO2Â® device (Design
      Net, Smithfield, USA) or Threshold device at home. All training modalities require the
      subjects to be seated and wearing a nose clip while performing the required breaths. Subjects
      will be instructed on respective training procedures and complete first training session in
      the presence of a research team member upon enrollment. Regardless of training method,
      participants will be instructed to fill in diary cards at the end of each training session,
      in which participants document how many breaths were able to perform. This information will
      be later used for compliance assessment. Participants will be also provided with user guides
      developed by investigators research team with detailed instructions regarding equipment
      set-up, training protocol and contact information. In addition, subjects will receive weekly
      phone calls from week 0 to week 8 to encourage compliance and adherence to the study
      protocol, to address any subject questions or concerns, and to collect information regarding
      participants current symptomatology.
