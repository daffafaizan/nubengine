      rapid blood test can be used to detect EGFR mutations in patients with newly diagnosed lung
      cancer and use that information to rapidly start patients on a pill-based therapy.

      This blood test has not previously been used to select patients for treatment with Erlotinib
      without confirming this finding on a biopsy.
