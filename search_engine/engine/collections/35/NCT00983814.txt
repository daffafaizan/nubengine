    
      This will be a 12-week study of twenty enrolled subjects with DSM IV adult ADHD (age 18-55),
      with a goal of completing twenty subjects in the trial. The primary objective of this study
      is to determine the effect of droxidopa therapy on adult ADHD symptoms over the course of a
      six-week open-label titration period followed by a two-week double-blind, placebo-controlled
      period. The primary outcome measure will be changes from baseline in total score on the Adult
      ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS). Secondary measures will be changes in
      self-report ADHD symptoms on the ASRS v1.1 Symptom Checklist, global impairment on the
      Clinician Global Impression Scale (CGI).
