      research and today presents itself as a very promising alternative solution in the analysis
      of repeat amplifications. The Oxford Nanopore NGS automaton offers the prospect of bringing
      together 1st and 2nd line analyzes of all loci potentially indicated in neurogenetics at the
      same time. The project aims to compare the use of this new technology with methods currently
      used in reference laboratories.

      Multicenter cross-sectional early phase diagnostic study on already existing biological
      collections. Analyzes with the new technique (NGS) will be carried out blinded to the results
      obtained with the current reference algorithm based on the sequential performance of PCRs The
      main objective is to evaluate the ability of next-generation high-throughput Oxford
      Nanopore-type sequencing (NEURONGS3) to diagnose 9 neurogenetic diseases compared to
      reference protocols via PCR (+/- Southern blot).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the repeatability of the NGS (intra-sample
      reproducibility) analysis in the diagnosis of 8 neurogenetic diseases.
