      occupational exposure to this important chemical is associated with increased risk for
      myeloid leukemia. However, there is still uncertainty about the biologic plausibility of the
      association because of questions regarding the ability of formaldehyde, which is extremely
      reactive, to directly or indirectly cause toxicity to the bone marrow. There have been
      several relatively small studies of the impact of occupational formaldehyde exposure on
      peripheral blood cells that found some evidence that peripheral blood cells of the myeloid
      lineage (i.e., granulocytes, platelets) were significantly decreased in exposed workers. We
      propose to follow-up these findings in a relatively large study population in China. We will
      study hematologic parameters in 240 higher exposed workers (>1 ppm), 240 workers exposed to
      lower levels of formaldehyde (0.3 to 1 ppm), and a group of 240 unexposed controls
      frequency-matched to exposed workers. This study will make an important contribution to our
      understanding of the leukemogenic potential of formaldehyde, which has important public
      health and regulatory implications.
