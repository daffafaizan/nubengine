      undertaken.

      2. The process of the experiment (brief describe)

        1. The 30 participants of the experimental group will be recruited from the "community
           eldercare service" activities, and this group will receive a 12-week combined exercise
           intervention program with extra emphasis on balance, muscle strength, and walking
           ability. The other 30 community-dwelling older people of the comparison group who have
           been involved in a other regular exercise style will not receive our exercise
           intervention. The comparison group only receives 2 times measurement at an interval of
           12 weeks.

        2. Subjects completed medical histories, exercise histories, and information on lifestyles
           by questionnaire and physical examination before participation in the study to ensure
           they were free from exclusion criteria. The baseline measurements will be conducted
           before the exercise intervention.

        3. The experimental group will receive a 12-week combined exercise intervention program
           with extra emphasis on balance, muscle strength, and walking ability which involved two
           2-hour sessions per week. The exercise program contained aerobic exercises, activities
           of balance, coordination exercises, strength training, and walking training.

        4. After 12 weeks group exercise, the experimental group will receive the second
           measurements.
