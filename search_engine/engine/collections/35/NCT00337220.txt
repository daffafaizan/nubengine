      patients. However, organ rejection remains as an important threat to the long-term survival
      of the transplanted organ. An increase in the serum creatinine level is often the first
      clinical indicator of kidney transplant rejection; however, this marker lacks sensitivity and
      specificity. Rejection is currently diagnosed using an invasive transplant biopsy procedure;
      in addition to being expensive, transplant biopsies can result in bleeding from the
      transplant and even graft loss. In early studies, it has been observed that significant
      increases in the levels of perforin, granzyme B, and CD3 messenger RNA (mRNA) in urinary
      cells signal the development of acute transplant rejection. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate whether the noninvasive procedure of measuring perforin, granzyme B, and CD3 mRNA
      levels in urine samples can accurately diagnose and predict kidney transplant rejection, make
      transplant biopsy unnecessary, and provide an opportunity to initiate treatment for early
      rejection with the aim to minimize damage to the kidney.

      This study will last 3 years post-transplant. There will be a total of 14 study visits. Blood
      and urine collection will occur at all visits. Additional visits may be necessary for those
      participants who develop abnormal kidney function.
