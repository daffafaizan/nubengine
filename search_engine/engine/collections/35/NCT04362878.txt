      health) and quality of life investigation of adolescents affected by chest wall deformities,
      in relation to the severity and type of deformity, and patients' age; identifying risk
      factors for psychological disorders.

      The following hypotheses were tested: differences between patients with different chest wall
      deformities regarding body image and mental health were expected; no hypothesis on the
      possible results concerning the effect of the severity of deformity on each studied variable
      was formulated, since previous findings are unclear. Concerning age, some differences
      according to different age ranges were expected. Regarding risk factors for mental health
      problems, older age and greater body image dissatisfaction were expected to be significant
      risk factors for psychological problems; regarding the severity and type of deformity,
      results of previous studies are unclear or lacking, so no hypothesis was tested; quality of
      life and self-esteem variables were also tested, as previous studies showed they are
      significantly related to general well being and mental health in adolescents.

      Adolescents coming at the outpatient clinics for the first evaluation of their chest wall and
      one of their parents/caregivers were enrolled. After the medical examination, patients
      meeting inclusion criteria are invited to participate in the study and to be assessed by a
      trained psychologist who administered them all questionnaires after they expressed their
      informed consent.
