    
      Subjects will be recruited up to the day of surgery. 90 subjects will be randomly allocated
      into 2 groups, using a computer generated table of random numbers: anesthetic maintenance
      with Sevoflurane or anesthetic maintenance with Propofol . Subjects will be premedicated with
      intravenous (IV) midazolam 0.04 mg/kg. Routine ASA monitors will be applied. Anesthesia will
      be induced with remifentanil infusion started at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute titrated to keep blood
      pressure within 20% of the baseline and propofol 1.0 -2.0 mg/kg or sevoflurane induction.
      Tracheal intubation will be facilitated with rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) or succinylcholine (1-2mg
      /kg). Anesthesia will be maintained with Sevoflurane or a Propofol infusion titrated to keep
      a bispectral index between 40-60, remifentanil infusion started at 0.1mcg/kg/min titrated to
      keep blood pressure within 20 % of baseline values, and rocuronium that will be administered
      at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Upon termination of the surgery, neuromuscular
      blockade will be antagonized with a combination of neostigmine 0.05mg/kg and glycopyrrolate
      0.01 mg/kg. Subjects will also receive Ketorolac 30 mg IV after discontinuation of
      remifentanil for postoperative pain control. Ondansetron 4 mg IV will be administered to
      decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting. Subjects will receive IV hydromorphone 0.4 mg q 5
      minutes as needed to achieve a verbal rating score for pain <4 out of 10.They will also
      receive reglan 10 mg IV as a rescue antiemetic, if not effective, a second dose of Zofran 4
      mg IV will be given in PACU. 24 hours after surgery a QOR 40 will be administered to the
      patient by one of the investigators. The primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed by
      an independent observer who will be blinded to group allocation.
