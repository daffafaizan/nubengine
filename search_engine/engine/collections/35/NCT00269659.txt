    
      Within a time period of 3 years we evaluate different groups of patients and measure regional
      and global cardiac function.

      Therefore, we developed an echocardiography screening-protocol in which we use conventional
      2D echocardiography and conventional Doppler echocardiography, extended with tissue Doppler
      imaging and real-time 3D echo acquisitions.

      In a limited group of patients we perform a specially designed cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance imaging protocol which uses artificially induced grid-lines to evaluate regional
      and global cardiac function.

      Patients are referred to our hospital because of evaluation of their LBBB and or heart
      failure. We ask them if they would like to undergo the echocardiography and the
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.

      After a year we want to repeat the measurements in a small group of the patients to
      re-evaluate regional and global cardiac function.

      All patients should have a sinus rhythm and adequate acoustic windows. Patients should not
      have contraindications for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.
