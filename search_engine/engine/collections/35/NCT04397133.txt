      of extremity motions but also loss of inspiratory muscle strength. In this study we aimed to
      determine the optimum duration for inspiratory muscle training exercises for stroke survivors
      since there is not enough data about it in the literature.

      The study will include at least 54 patients in total and 18 in each groups ( two intervention
      and one control) . The patients will be evaluated for angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, congestive heart disease; in these conditions the patients will be excluded from the
      study. Also in first examinations we will evaluate the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) of
      patients, of them the ones with MIP measurements above 80 mmH2O will also be excluded since
      it is the expected value in normal people.

      After admission and randomizing the patients, baseline measurements of MIP, 6-minutes walking
      test will be done. In intervention groups the patients will get 30 minutes of inspiratory
      muscle training exercises ( 15 minutes of two session each day) with threshold IMT device
      every weekday. And in control group, the patients will get sham intervention for 8 weeks. The
      MIP and 6-minutes walking test will be done in 8th,12th and 24th weeks. And also in 24th week
      we will record the pneumonia incidence if occured.
