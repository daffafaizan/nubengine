    
      This study is a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a single, online,
      group-based session of hypnosis followed by self-hypnosis for people with migraines or
      tension-type headaches with a wait-list control. A battery of self-report measures and a
      2-week headache diary will be administered online at baseline (weeks 0 and 1),
      post-intervention (weeks 7 and 8) and at follow-up (weeks 11 and 12).
