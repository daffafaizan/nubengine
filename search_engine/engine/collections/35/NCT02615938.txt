    
      This study is an explorative, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      investigation of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pediatric ILD. The treatments are organized in
      START and STOP blocks, which can be initiated in sequence, as needed by the subjects. Each
      patient can participate in each block only once. In the START block subjects are randomized
      to parallel-groups, then the placebo group is switched to active drug. In the STOP block,
      subjects on HCQ are randomized into parallel-groups treated with placebo or HCQ to
      investigate the withdrawal of HCQ for assessment of its efficacy.
