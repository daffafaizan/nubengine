      teleconsultation in the emergency department focused on neurological diseases other than
      stroke (for which a specific protocol already exists) in two Hospitals of Modena province,
      Italy.

      The study is aimed at developing a remote neurological consultancy system (teleconsultation)
      for patients with acute neurological symptoms in charge of hospital facilities without
      24-hour availability of neurologist consultant.

      Pilot project setting: a) ED of Modena Policlinico Hospital in the afternoon, night, and
      public holidays, time windows in which the Neurologist consultant is not present at
      Policlinico Hospital; b) ED of Mirandola Hospital.

      The project (enrolment) is expected to be developed over a period of 6 months in which 100
      patients will be enrolled.

      The primary objective is to assess whether a TeleNeurological Evaluation and Support for the
      Emergency Department can guarantee a faster but qualitatively not inferior
      diagnostic/therapeutic work-up if compared with in person examination, assuring the
      availability of all the necessary examinations and treatments with a consistent time
      reduction.

      Secondary objectives: to determine if the usage of a teleconsultation physician for
      neurological evaluation compared to a conventional physician "de visu" in urgent but
      non-life-threatening neurological cases, is superior regarding 1) effect evaluation, 2)
      process evaluation, and 3) cost-benefit analysis.

      Outcome and process indicators will be assessed and compared in the following groups:

        -  Experimental group (cases): a) patients who access the Policlinico Hospital ED in the
           afternoon and night-time and on holidays; b) patients who access the Mirandola Hospital
           ED during the period of the study.

        -  Control Groups: a) retrospectively collected data on neurological consultation performed
           by OCB Neurology for Policlinico Hospital patients in the same time slots in the same
           months of the last two years.; b) retrospectively collected data on neurological
           consultation performed by Carpi Neurology for Mirandola Hospital patients in the same
           time slots in the same months of the last two years.
