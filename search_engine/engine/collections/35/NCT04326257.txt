    
      In this Phase II non-randomized trial, n=40 eligible patients will have tumor tissue (core or
      excisional/incisional) for gene expression of LAG3 and CTLA4 via RNA seq per OmniSeq Immune
      Report Card to determine which drug (either Relatlimab or Ipilimumab) will be added to
      Nivolumab for treatment. The patient will then receive the prescribed therapy continuously
      for up to 24 cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks of treatment). The drug to be added to Nivolumab will
      be based on which relevant gene has the highest expression as long as the minimum difference
      required is met. If the minimum difference is not met than a patient will be randomized to
      either Nivolumab plus Relatlimab or Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab.

      The patient will then receive the prescribed therapy continuously for up to 24 cycles (1
      cycle = 4 weeks of treatment) with repeat imaging prior to every 3rd cycle until progression
      of disease. Response, evaluated by RECIST 1.1, with modifications to allow for continued
      therapy until progressive disease is confirmed if the patient is clinically stable, will be
      used in the trial. If the patient has confirmed progression the patient may be eligible to
      undergo a second biopsy and second treatment on trial. If these criteria are met the patient
      will then be treated with this new combination with repeat imaging prior to every 3rd cycle
      as per initial treatment, until progression of disease.
