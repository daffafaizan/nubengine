    
      In this multicenter prospective phase 1/2A open label trial, the feasibility, tolerability
      and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy following hepatic portoenterostomy
      (HPE) will be assessed in 29 infants with biliary atresia (BA), efficacy will be estimated
      and exploratory mechanistic research studies will be performed. After written consent is
      obtained from the parent or guardian, the subject will be enrolled and will receive three
      intravenous doses of IVIG at designated intervals over the first 60 days following HPE and
      will be followed for 360 days after enrollment. Blood will also be obtained during this study
      to assess potential mechanisms by which the IVIG may alter or reduce bile duct inflammation
      and injury and improve bile flow. All infants in this trial will also be treated with
      standardized doses of other routine standard-of-care treatments for BA during this trial
      (ursodeoxycholic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole, and fat-soluble vitamin supplements).
      This routine clinical care will not be modified by participation in this study. Subjects in
      this study will not receive corticosteroid therapy for treatment of biliary atresia, as this
      is of unproven benefit at the present time.
