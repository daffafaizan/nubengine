      the prevalence and mortality rate of stroke in Japan is about 3-4 times as those of acute
      myocardial infarction. Investigators will study whether immediate statin treatment after the
      onset of stroke is beneficial on the neurological protection since most of previous studies
      with statins just showed the preventive effects from onset of primary or recurrent cerebral
      infarction.
