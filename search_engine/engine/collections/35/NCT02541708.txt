      Primary objective:

      To assess the superiority in terms of effectiveness of iv iron substitution with ferric
      carboxymaltose versus per oral iron substitution in women with iron deficient anemia at
      delivery in Tanzania.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate safety and feasibility of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution
           compared to per oral iron substitution in a resource limited country

        -  To evaluate acceptance of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution compared to per
           oral iron substitution in a resource limited country

        -  To evaluate wellbeing of women receiving intravenous ferric carboxymaltose compared to
           women receiving per oral iron substitution

        -  To evaluate the sensitivity of diagnosis of iron deficiency by measuring hemoglobin,
           mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) only,
           compared to the diagnosis by measuring iron metabolism parameters in a resource limited
           country
