        -  Compare the effect of adjuvant combination therapy comprising interleukin-2, interferon
           alfa, and fluorouracil vs observation only on disease-free survival or overall survival
           of patients with renal cell carcinoma at high risk of relapse after radical surgery.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously (SC) on days 3, 4, and 5 of weeks 1
           and 4 and on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2 and 3. Patients also receive interferon alfa SC
           once weekly during weeks 1 and 4 and 3 times weekly during weeks 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
           Patients then receive fluorouracil IV on day 1 of weeks 5, 6, 7, and 8.

        -  Arm II (control arm): Patients receive no adjuvant treatment before disease progression.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 2 and 6 months after randomization.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months (arm I only), every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 550 patients (275 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
