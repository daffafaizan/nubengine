    
      Specific Objectives:

        1. To provide detailed information on the demographics and clinical characteristics of
           treatment-na√Øve FN and Metis versus non-FN and Non-Metis patients proceeding to
           treatment for CHC.

        2. To document and compare SVR and sustained biochemical response (SBR) rates, adherence to
           therapy, side effects, dose adjustments and discontinuation of treatment between FN and
           Metis and non-FN and Non-Metis patients.

        3. To determine whether the immunologic features associated with SVR (increased NK cell
           activity and enhanced interferon gamma production by CD4 cells in response to viral
           antigens) differ in FN and Metis and non-FN and non-Metis patients.

        4. To document and compare the direct costs of health care utilization and delivery for CHC
           between FN and Metis and non-FN and Non-Metis patients.

        5. Develop a model predicting outcome of therapy, using demographic, clinical and viral
           characteristics, and test the model with race as one of the explanatory variables.

        6. To forecast future prevalence, mortality and medical costs of CHC care in Canada.
