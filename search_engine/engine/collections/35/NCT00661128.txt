      stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. Ninety-five percent of people who
      experience SCA die from it, most within minutes. SCA is usually caused by abnormal heart
      rhythms, known as arrhythmias, which can be triggered by several factors, including coronary
      artery disease, physical stress, and structural changes in the heart. Certain genetic factors
      may also increase the likelihood of experiencing SCA. Study researchers will analyze genetic
      samples from people affected by SCA and people unaffected by SCA to identify and characterize
      genetic variations that are associated with an increased risk of SCA in European Americans
      and African Americans.

      This study will examine previously collected blood samples from people who have experienced
      SCA and were participants in the Cardiac Arrest Blood Study (CABS) and the Cardiovascular
      Health Study (CHS). These participants will not attend any study visits or be contacted by
      study researchers. People who experience SCA in the first 4 years of this study will have
      blood drawn from paramedics at the time of SCA. If these participants survive, they will be
      asked whether study researchers can review their medical records. Study researchers will also
      examine previously collected blood samples from participants who have not experienced SCA and
      were participants in CABS, CHS, and the Heart and Vascular Health Study. These participants
      will not attend any study visits or be contacted by study researchers. Study researchers will
      also enroll a new control group of people who have not experienced SCA. These participants
      will attend one study visit for blood collection and a medical record review.
