      thrombopoiesis and platelet function. We hypothesized that the effect of erythropoietin may
      be reflected by changes in thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and endothelial cell function.

      Methods: Six male and six female subjects received recombinant human epoetin alpha (Erypo®)
      intravenously (300 Units per kg). Biomarker levels were assessed at baseline and 4, 24, 48
      and 72 hours after administration.

      Results: Epoetin alpha increased TXB2 levels, which reached significance at 48h (2.5- fold
      increase: 6.6±5ng/mL vs. 15±9ng/mL; p=0.044) and remained at that level at 72h. In line,
      epoetin alpha increased E-selectin levels by 25% already at 24h (39±21ng/ml vs. 49±26ng/ml;
      p<0.001) and stayed at this level until 72h (p<0.001). The raise in platelet activation
      markers corresponded with a 2-fold increase in reticulocyte count (81±17G/L vs. 43±10G/L;
      p<0.001) and a 9% increase in platelet count at 72h (224±45G/L vs. 244±52G/L; p=0.005).
      Thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor concentrations were not significantly altered by
      epoetin alpha. Interestingly, gender differences in the baseline levels of E-selectin and
      thrombomodulin were observed. E-selectin and thrombomodulin levels were doubled in men
      compared to women (51±24ng/mL and 28±10ng/mL; p=0.025 and 30±5ng/mL vs. 16±5ng/mL; p=0.002,
      respectively).

      Conclusion: Epoetin alpha increases levels of platelet activation markers. Further studies
      are needed to investigate whether measurement of TXB2 or E-selectin levels might be useful
      for estimation of thromboembolic risk during EPO-therapy.
