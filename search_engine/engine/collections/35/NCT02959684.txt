      amongst migrants originating from certain countries, hence the official guidelines
      recommending targeted testing. The rapid testing devices (TROD) give immediate results and
      reduce missed opportunities. However their use is not yet widespread and migrant populations
      remain insufficiently tested. Regarding the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal, France is failing the
      screening part of the treatment cascade, while 90% of patients are treated and have
      undetectable viral load. Risk scores based on the best known risk factors for these
      infections (HIV/HBV/HCV) have previously been developed. They have helped build a pilot of a
      new unique questionnaire: TROD screen. An electronic survey, called TB screen, was designed
      to screen for tuberculosis amongst asylum seekers in Switzerland and validated. This survey
      enables to detect signs of active tuberculosis and may replace the use of pulmonary
      radiography, thus reducing exposure to X-rays.

      It is a prospective multi-centric observational study validating screening tests for
      HIV/HBV/HCV in two phases:

        -  Phase 1: a risk score will be validated, including a qualitative study analyzing its
           acceptability

        -  Phase 2: its performance will be compared with that of a screening targeted based on the
           country of origin The phase 1 and phase 2 will include respectively 10.000 and 5000
           participants.

      For tuberculosis, the efficacy of the improved version of TB screen will be compared with a
      systematic radiography.

      Participation to this study will be voluntary and independent from the delivery of a
      residence permit. Participants will be informed of it and will systematically receive
      information about prevention of those infectious diseases.
