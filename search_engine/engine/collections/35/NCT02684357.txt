      A. All participants received 2 sets of injections to maintain the blind: the placebo arm
      received placebo for risankizumab and placebo for ustekinumab), the risankizumab arm received
      risankizumab and placebo for ustekinumab, and the ustekinumab arm received ustekinumab and
      placebo for risankizumab. Participants who received placebo in Part A switched to
      risankizumab in Part B; participants who received ustekinumab or risankizumab in Part A
      continued to receive the same treatment (ustekinumab or risankizumab) in Part B.
