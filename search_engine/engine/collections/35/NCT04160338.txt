      pathology characterized by a progressive thinning and protrusion of the cornea that ends in a
      cone-shaped cornea. This results in progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism with
      associated progressive loss of vision and thus reduced quality of life.Collagen cross-linking
      (CXL) is a relatively new conservative approach for progressive corneal ectasia. The main
      indication for CXL is to slow the progression of corneal ectatic diseases, such as
      keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD), keratoglobus and iatrogenic ectasia.The
      basic principle of this method is the chemical interaction of ultraviolet A radiation
      (315-400nm ) and riboflavin to induce covalent bond formation between collagen fibers of the
      cornea. In this way, the stiffness and rigidity of the cornea are provided.Corneal collagen
      cross-linking (CXL) was first introduced by Wollensak with an ultraviolet-A (UVA) protocol of
      3 medium wave mW/cm2 intensity at 370 nm over an exposure time of 30 minutes (now termed the
      "Dresden protocol"). Researchers have proposed accelerated CXL (ACXL) protocols, to improve
      convenience and comfort for patients. These ACXL protocols have the aim of decreasing UVA
      exposure time by increasing UVA fluency to achieve the same overall total UVA dosage.Despite
      corneal CXL is a safe and effective procedure with few known side effects .Persistent corneal
      edema and possible endothelial cell damage have been reported in a few cases after CXL. Based
      on the extent of endothelial damage, patients may require penetrating keratoplasty.
