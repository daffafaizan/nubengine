      phenotypic variability is large, and symptoms can manifest at different ages and degrees, the
      clinical diagnosis is challenging. To date, there remains an unmet need for a valid and
      reliable endophenotype that would facilitate ASD diagnosis early in life, enable efficient
      study of ASD risk factors, and eventually serve as a useful biomarker to inform the
      development of effective therapies and assess treatment response in future clinical trials.

      As compared with behavioral or neuroimaging methods, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      offers the advantage of providing behaviorally independent results that are largely
      unaffected by attention or cognitive ability. Therefore, a TMS based endophenotype may be
      applicable to all individuals across the autism spectrum.

      At Boston Children's Hospital, each subject's participation in the study will consist of four
      visits: two screening visits, and two TMS sessions. At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
      each subject's participation will consist of three visits: one screening visit, and two TMS
      sessions. Each screening visit is expected to last between 2-3 hours, during which
      participants will first provide informed consent. Participants will then receive a thorough
      medical examination by a neurologist, and a neuropsychological evaluation (including IQ
      measures and ASD specific evaluations). If eligible to continue, participants will then come
      back for two identical TMS visits, that are spaced 1-5 weeks apart. These visits are expected
      to last between 3-4 hours, and include the TMS measures of brain plasticity.
