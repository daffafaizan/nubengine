    
      A double-blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      MSC (mesenchymal stromal cells) intravenous administration in patients with COVID-induced
      ARDS compared to a control arm.

      All trial participants will receive SOC*.

      Randomization will be 1:1 between:

        -  Treatment arm: allogenic MSC.

        -  Control arm: Placebo (solution with the same composition as the experimental treatment,
           without the MSC).

             -  SOC can include any medicines that are being used in clinical practice (e.g.
                lopinavir/ritonavir; hydroxy/chloroquine, tocilizumab, etc.).
