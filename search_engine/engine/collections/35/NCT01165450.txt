      dose-escalation study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nexagon® in subjects with
      persistent corneal epithelial defects (PED) resulting from corneal epithelial debridement
      during diabetic vitrectomy surgery, HSV keratitis, HZV keratitis, corneal burns, post-PRK, or
      post-corneal transplant surgery. In general, traditional therapy of PED consists of
      aggressive lubrication with preservative-free artificial tears and ointments, the use of
      bandage soft contact lenses, pressure patching, punctal plugging, and the surgical closure of
      the eyelids. Unfortunately, the success rates with these conventional treatment modalities
      are varied, and overall, disappointingly low. As such, much research is currently being
      directed at finding better treatments for PED. Nexagon® is a novel therapeutic agent that has
      been shown to be effective in treating skin lesions, and it has been shown in animal studies
      and in preliminary human studies to be safe and efficacious in treating PED.
