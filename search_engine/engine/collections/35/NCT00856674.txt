      nephropathy continue to secrete large amounts of protein in the urine and have a high
      likelihood of progressing to end-stage renal disease over 5-10 years and eventually requiring
      dialysis or kidney transplant. In IgA nephropathy, the injured kidney tissue secretes a
      messenger that recruits white blood cells (leukocytes) into the kidney. This messenger is the
      chemokine, CCL2. As a consequence CCL2 also is excreted into the urine and can be measured as
      evidence of inflammation in the kidney. This study evaluates the safety of a new potential
      therapy,CCL2-LPM (leukocyte population modulator), for IgA nephropathy. CCL2-LPM is composed
      of the messenger chemokine, CCL2, fused to an enzyme that inhibits protein production by the
      leukocytes and prevents the leukocytes from migrating into the kidney. The CCL2 end of the
      molecule targets only a small subset of leukocytes that have the corresponding receptor for
      CCL2 on the surface. After CCL2 binds to its receptor it is drawn inside the cell and carries
      the enzyme into the cell. The targeted cells are prevented from entering the kidney and
      causing further damage. Thus, CCL2-LPM may interrupt the ongoing cycle of inflammation that
      leads to end-stage renal disease.
