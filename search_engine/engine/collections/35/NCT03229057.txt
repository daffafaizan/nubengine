      either be assigned to OCP + Placebo, Metformin + Placebo or OCP + Metformin. Metformin will
      be initiated in a step-up fashion on cycle day 1-3 of spontaneously or induced menses.
      Extended release pills will be utilized as they are associated with fewer gastrointestinal
      side effects. Subjects will begin with one tablet of metformin every night for 5 days,
      eventually building up to 4 tablets every night, with the maximum dose of metformin being
      2000 mg. In regards to OCP, previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown that 20mcg
      ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone 1.0 mg was well tolerated. The study will utilize a 20mcg OCP
      but a less androgenic third generation progestin (desogestrel 0.15mg) with potentially lesser
      impact on lipids and insulin sensitivity. The OCP will be started on the first Sunday after
      spontaneous or induced menses. All subjects with no menses the 4 weeks before randomization
      will be given medroxyprogesterone acetate after a negative pregnancy test (in order to induce
      menses). Placebo pills will be administered to individuals randomized to OCP or metformin
      only in order to maintain study blinding. Subjects will undergo 6 in person study visits and
      life style modification counseling regarding diet and exercise. Phone contact will be made 2
      weeks after randomization and at the end of each month when there is no in person visit to
      ensure study compliance with medications, keeping study logs and to review side effects
