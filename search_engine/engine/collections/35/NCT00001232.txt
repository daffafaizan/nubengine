    
      This protocol is designed to accompany clinical protocol #81-M-0126, "The Phenomenology and
      Biophysiology of Menstrually Regulated Mood and Behavior Disorders", as well as the submitted
      protocol, "The Phenomenology and Biophysiology of Climacteric and Menopause-Related Mood and
      Behavioral Disorders." Its purpose will be to evaluate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis
      regulation as measured by pituitary gonadotropin, i.e., follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      and luteinizing hormone (LH), response to intravenous administration of gonadotropin
      releasing hormone (GnRH) in menstrual cycle-related mood disorders.
