      I. To determine the antitumor activity of pazopanib, in terms of objective response rate
      (partial and complete response), in patients with recurrent or metastatic invasive breast
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of objective response, rate and duration of stable disease.

      II. To determine 6-month progression-free and median and overall survival rates in patients
      treated with this drug.

      III. To document the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected at
      baseline and at 1, 4, and 8 weeks for correlative laboratory studies. Blood samples are
      evaluated for the following tumor markers by ELISA: VEGF, bFGF, sFLT-1, sTIE-2, sE-Selectin,
      VCAM-1, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB. TSP-1 in plasma is measured by Accucyteâ„¢ competitive
      immunoassay.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
