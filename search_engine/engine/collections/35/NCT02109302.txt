    
      2.1 Main Objective

        -  To identify the molecular basis of primary premature ejaculation (PPE) in humans for the
           development of new adapted therapy.

        -  Check and confirm the genetic hypothesis of PPE to fill the void of genetic knowledge
           about this syndrome.

        -  Improve knowledge of physicians on this disease to increase the comfort of life of
           patients.

      2.2 Secondary Objectives

        -  Provide the basis for new therapeutic approaches.

        -  Expanded knowledge of the aetiology of PE and allow better management of patients.

        -  Develop strategies to prevent the consequences, sometimes severe , of this condition on
           the intimate, personal, social and professional life of these patients. Because all the
           PE do not have the same pathophysiology and treatment success depends on its relevance
           to the specific mechanism of the clinical form concerned.

        -  Increase the comfort of life of the patients.

        -  Eliminate public prejudice based on misconceptions.
