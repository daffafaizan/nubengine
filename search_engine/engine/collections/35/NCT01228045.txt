      875,000 patients are diagnosed world-wide with gastric cancer each year. Gastric cancer is
      often diagnosed at an advanced stage1. At diagnosis, while some patients have gastric
      carcinoma that extends within loco-regional confines and can undergo a curative resection,
      many patients cannot undergo curative resection. Gastric cancer continues to pose a major
      medical challenge.

      While advanced gastric carcinoma is incurable, chemotherapy can have a palliative effect in
      symptomatic patients. Chemotherapy improves outcome compared to best supportive care in
      gastric cancer. Various chemotherapeutic agents including 5-FU, mitomycin, etoposide,
      cisplatin, irinotecan and the taxanes, have demonstrated activity as monotherapy. Combination
      chemotherapy has been shown to have better survival outcomes than single agent chemotherapy
      Standard chemotherapy for advanced gastric carcinoma includes a fluoropyrimidine and platinum
      -based combination chemotherapy.
