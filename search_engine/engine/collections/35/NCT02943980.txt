      surgery. Here, the IONM can be done by placing electrodes on an endotracheal tube. In order
      to guarantee a sufficient signal quality of the IONM, the electrode must be adequately
      positioned on the glottis. The present study pursued the question of whether the conventional
      direct laryngoscopy compared with video laryngoscopy allows a visually adequate tube
      placement.
