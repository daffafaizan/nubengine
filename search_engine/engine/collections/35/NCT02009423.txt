      c-Kit, the juxta membrane domain of c-Kit, and PDGFR. Masitinib is also thought to promote
      survival via modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of
      the tumor microenvironment. The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib
      at 4.5 mg/kg/day with respect to placebo in the treatment of patients with localized, primary
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after complete surgery and with high risk of
      recurrence.
