      Persistent high grade proteinuria or progressively decrease of renal function is a risk
      factor for end stage renal disease in idiopathic membranous nephropathy. It has been reported
      that cyclosporin in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy decreases proteinuria and
      improve renal function. Mycophenolate mofetil is a recently developed immunosuppressive agent
      with fewer side effect than cyclosporin. In this study patients with high risk group of
      progressive idiopathic membranous nephropathy will be treated with mycophenolate mofetil and
      low dose prednisone. The outcome will be compared to controls treated with cyclosporin and
      low dose prednisone.
