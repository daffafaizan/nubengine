      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in subjects harboring a known pathogenic mutation in
      their mtDNA at position 3243 (A>G). Subjects will be induced in to ketosis by administration
      of supplemental medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) for a period of 6 months. mtDNA
      heteroplasmy will be assessed 3 months prior to treatment, at treatment initiation, and 6
      months after initiation.

      The primary objective of the current study is to determine if there is a shift in
      heteroplasmy in patients harboring the 3243 A>G mtDNA mutation to a more favorable (higher
      wild-type) genotypic profile while in a state of ketosis.
