    
      So far, in respiratory intensive care units, the usual treatment of patients with acute
      hypercapnic respiratory failure with acidosis is non-invasive ventilation set with a pressure
      support mode (S/T or VS/AI mode depending on the ventilator manufacturer).

      AVAPS-AE mode is a volume targeted pressure support mode with an automatic PEP. With the
      forced oscillations method, the ventilator is able to detect the obstruction and the
      resistances of upper airways.

      It allows the ventilator to change its pressure settings to keep the targeted volume and
      avoid apneas and hypoventilation.

      That is why in patients with a BMI > 30 kg/mÂ², at risk of obesity hypoventilation syndrom or
      obstructive apneas, this ventilation mode may be interesting.

      AVAPS-AE has been evaluated in the home ventilation showing it is as efficient as S/T mode in
      controlling PaCO2.

      However it has never been compared to S/T mode in acute respiratory failure care.
