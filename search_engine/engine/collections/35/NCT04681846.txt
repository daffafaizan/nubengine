      stage, thorough debridement of the infected bone and soft tissues and copious lavage will be
      done.

      After radical debridement, primary fixation will be done by either external fixation or
      antibiotic cement coated internally fixed implants.If there is a bone defect, it will be
      measured and filled with an antibiotic-impregnated (PMMA) cement spacer. The second stage
      procedure will be performed 4 to 8 weeks after the first one if soft tissue permits and only
      if there is no clinical or biochemical evidence of ongoing infection as indicated by normal
      white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It includes
      the exchange of the antibiotic cement spacer by a cancellous bone graft.
