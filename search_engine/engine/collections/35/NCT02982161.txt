    
      This is a multicenter double-blind, randomised, phase III study in male and female subjects
      with acute pain after third molar tooth extraction. The dental procedure must have involved
      extraction of at least two impacted third molars requiring bone removal. If only two impacted
      third molars are extracted, they must be ipsilateral and both require bone removal under
      local anaesthesia.

      The Screening Visit (Visit 1) can take place up to 28 days before the planned third molar
      extractions. The randomisation visit (Visit 2) consists of three different sections, a part
      before the surgery, the part with the surgery and before randomisation, and a part with the
      randomisation and post-randomisation assessments. The visits 3 and 4, one respectively two
      days after the randomisation can be performed by telephone if the subject does not
      participate in the pharmacokinetic sampling.

      The last dose of IMP should be taken by the subject about 72h after the initial dose and
      before the Completion/Discontinuation Visit (Visit 5) is performed.

      The Adverse Event (AE) Follow-up Visit (Visit 6) is the last study visit and should not be
      done earlier than seven days after the subject's last dose of IMP. It can be performed by
      telephone.
