      pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients receiving ECMO. Eight patients with suspected
      suspected sepsis and who are receiving ECMO will be enrolled. Each participant will receive
      four to six doses of imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam according to current approved prescribing
      information, followed by ten blood samples to determine concentrations. Non-compartmental and
      population pharmacokinetic analyses will be determined to assess the effects of ECMO on
      imipenem and relebactam pharmacokinetic parameters.
