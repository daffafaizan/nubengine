      Corneal ectasia is a relative weakness in the structure of the cornea, which produces a
      progressive change in its shape with resultant visual distortion.

      Excimer laser surface ablation can be used to re-shape the corneal profile. When the corneal
      shape is very irregular, corneal topography data gives the best information as to how to
      re-shape the cornea into a normal profile, and this Topography-Computer Assisted Treatment
      (T-Cat) will be used to modulate the surface corneal shape.

      It is known that collagen cross-linking in the cornea occurs naturally with age, and in
      diabetes, both of which seem to prevent progressive ectasia. Corneal collagen cross-linking
      with riboflavin has been shown to stabilize the cornea in keratoconus, and prevents
      progression of the disease. If cross-linking is performed at that moment that the cornea has
      been re-shaped by T-Cat treatment, it should help prevent the corneal thinning resultant from
      the laser treatment from destabilising the cornea and causing progressive ectasia.

      Purpose:

      To determine whether excimer laser corneal surface ablation (T-Cat) can be safely combined
      with simultaneous corneal collagen cross-linking treatment to produce an improved and stable
      corneal profile.

      Design:

      Prospective, interventional trial.
