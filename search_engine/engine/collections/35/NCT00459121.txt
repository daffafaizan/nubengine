      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of neoadjuvant vandetanib in combination with carboplatin and
           paclitaxel in patients with resectable stage IB, II, or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the 30-day postoperative mortality rate in these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients who complete all planned courses of therapy.

        -  Assess the clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the pathologic complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vandetanib once daily on days 1-21. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV
      over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up
      to 3 courses.

      Patients undergo surgery at least 3 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
