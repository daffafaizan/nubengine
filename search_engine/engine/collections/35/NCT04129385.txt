    
      A prospective randomized controlled study with 54 patients in each of the two arms. Group S
      (control) will undergo the standard laparoscopic procedure and the patients will be placed in
      supine head up position postoperatively. In group T (interventional); the patients will be
      positioned in Trendelenburg position once fully awake and cooperative in the post-anesthesia
      case unit (PACU) and will remain in this position for the first 24 hours postoperatively.
      Postoperative NRS(numeric rating scale) score for shoulder pain and nausea will be collected
      at arrival to PACU, & 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively. In addition, total amount of
      rescue pain and nausea medication used by the patient will be recorded. Data collected will
      be analyzed and compared between the two groups. The independent t- test will be used to
      compare postoperative shoulder pain, with NRS scores treated as continuous variable, between
      the two groups.
