      parallel-group study design to detect change of the Action Observation (AO) and Repetitive
      Task Practice (RTP) combined practice schedule on upper limb (UL) motor impairment outcomes
      in the chronic, moderately impaired stroke survivor. Individuals will be randomized to 1)
      experimental conditions of AO + RTP practice schedule, or 2) control condition of Placebo
      Video (PV) + RTP, and will receive an assigned regimen from a blinded intervention therapist
      for one hour, 3 times per week, for 8 weeks (total of 24 sessions), and a daily 30 minute
      HEP. A blinded assessor will complete assessments on each subject at three distinct time
      points of pretest, post intervention, and 1 month post intervention.
