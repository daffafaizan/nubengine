        -  Determine the overall survival of women at intermediate risk for locoregional recurrence
           of breast cancer treated with ipsilateral chest wall adjuvant radiotherapy after
           mastectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning 12 weeks after mastectomy or 6 weeks after adjuvant chemotherapy,
           patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3-5 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard of care and observation only. After completion of
           study therapy, patients are followed up twice in the first year, and then annually for
           up to 10 years.
