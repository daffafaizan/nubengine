      instrumented with a metabolic system and heart rate sensor. They played the games in two
      counter balanced blocks: repeated (standard of care and self-paced repeated custom) and
      random (Microsoft-Kinect game and game-paced random custom). Games were played for 8.5
      minutes with ten minutes of rest in between so they could return to physiological baseline.
      During exercise they reported exertion and at the end of teach exercise trial they completed
      an enjoyment questionnaire. At the end of the first block, participants removed the metabolic
      system's mask and were assessed for motor recovery. Performances were video taped. At the end
      of data collection preferences for the activities were ranked and participants answered open
      ended questions. Data for neuromuscular and cardiovascular intensity, enjoyment and perceived
      effort were reduced and analyzed using a Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (RMANOVA)
      with the appropriate post-hoc corrections. Where possible clinically meaningful changes were
      calculated.
