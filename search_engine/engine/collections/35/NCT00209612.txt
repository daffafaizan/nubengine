    
      Patients with pre-treated measurable metastatic gastric cancer were included in this trial.
      Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until progression
      disease. Starting dose (dose level 1) were CPT-11 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and 15, Paclitaxel 60
      mg/m2 on day 1 and 15. DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.0); Grade 4
      neutropenia, thrombocytopenia(≥25000), Grade 3 neutropenia accompanied fever (>38℃) , and
      Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea, vomit, appetite loss , general
      fatigue, alopecia). Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the incidence of critical
      toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level. Response rate will be calculated according to
      RECIST criteria.
