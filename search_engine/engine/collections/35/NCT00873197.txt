    
      SancusoÂ® is designed to provide antiemetic prophylaxis for chemotherapy of up to 5 days
      duration. In exceptional clinical situations in which the patch is not applied at the
      appropriate time (i.e. 24-48 hours pre-chemotherapy), clinicians might use a single IV dose
      of granisetron to provide prophylaxis while the granisetron from the patch reaches a
      therapeutic plasma concentration.

      Most chemotherapeutics are dosed in a single day, with a 2- or 3-week interval between doses;
      however, several regimens are administered over more than 5 days and others are given at
      frequencies (e.g. every 5 days). Thus, more than one patch may be required to provide
      continuous antiemetic prophylaxis. Characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of multiple
      transdermal dosing offers useful information for clinicians who treat patients with the
      latter types of regimens.
