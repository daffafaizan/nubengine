    
      This is a prospective, counter-balanced study involving 85 subjects at up to 8 investigative
      centers. Each subject will be an appropriate candidate for an instrumented PLF and will meet
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects will undergo an instrumented, pedicle
      screw PLF procedure. Autograft or other interbody devices identified by the surgeon to be in
      the best interest of the patient may be used. Enrolled patients will receive CopiOs BVF
      sponge soaked with bone marrow aspirate on one side and autologous bone on the other side.
      All patients will receive both CopiOs BVF and autologous bone. Patients will serve as
      self-controls in this counter-balanced study. Data will be collected pre-operatively,
      operatively and post-operatively at six and twelve months.

      The study objectives include: Radiographic success of CopiOs is non-inferior to autograft
      with clear evidence of bridging bone. Radiographic analysis will be used to show that CopiOs
      works as well as autograft when comparing the rate of fusion at 6 and 12 months. The CT scan
      (12 month) will show that CopiOs works as well as autograft when comparing the fusion mass
      between the transverse processes. Additionally, clinical success will be determined by an
      improvement of 15 percentage points using the Oswestry Disability Index and maintenance or
      improvement in the motor and sensory components of the neurological assessment from
      preoperative to postoperative. Since patients serve as self-controls there will be no
      clinical success comparisons between the groups. Rather, clinical success will be measured on
      overall improvement based on patient outcomes.
