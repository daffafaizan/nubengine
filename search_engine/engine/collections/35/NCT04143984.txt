      radiotherapy appeared to be an effective treatment for this group of patients, and has
      substantially improved the 2-year overall survival (OS) to approximately 85%, compared to
      photon-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy. However, a group of the patients may still
      develop disease progression after CIRT, and the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was
      approximately 45%-50%. Camrelizumab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has been
      demonstrated that it is effective in the recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma;
      however, the role of camrelizumab in concurrence with radiotherapy, especially CIRT, for
      LR-NPC is not clear. The purpose of this phase 2 clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of
      CIRT plus camrelizumab and CIRT alone in the treatment of LR-NPC. Eligible participants will
      be randomized (1:1) to 1) CIRT alone group (control group); 2) CIRT plus camrelizumab group
      (experimental group). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints
      include overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS), regional
      progression-free survival (RPFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and toxicities.
      All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety
      population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
