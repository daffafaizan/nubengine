    
      This is a single-center, prospective, single-group unblinded phase I study that will enroll
      subjects with chronic kidney disease secondary to bladder dysfunction or bladder absence that
      is refractory to medical treatment and requires surgical intervention to prevent long-term
      sequelae. The primary inclusion criteria will be patients who are diagnosed with chronic
      kidney disease secondary to disorders involving the urinary bladder or absence of a urinary
      bladder. Patients exhibiting "hostile bladders" defined as end filling pressure or detrusor
      leak point pressure (DLPP) of 40 cm H2O or greater as measured by urodynamic studies or
      detrusor overactivity with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia will be included. Candidates for
      renal transplantation will be vetted and approved by the Mayo Clinic multidisciplinary
      transplant team (MDC). Subjects meeting these primary inclusion criteria can be referred to
      the PI, co-investigators, or study coordinator to approach for possible participation in this
      research study.

      If the subject still meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria after the baseline
      evaluations are completed, the subject will undergo concomitant renal and vascularized
      urinary bladder allograft transplantation.
