      literature. Research on different models of training, aerobic, muscle strength and combined
      (aerobic and muscle strength), have already demonstrated their beneficial effects on
      different physical abilities. Recent studies indicate benefits of water-based exercise for
      the population with metabolic diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemias
      and obesity. However, for subjects with metabolic syndrome (MS) there are few studies that
      investigated which training model in the aquatic environment could generate physical and
      metabolic improvements.

      This study is characterized as a randomized clinical trial, which treated three intervention
      groups with physical exercise programs. A subsample participated in a period of eight weeks
      without physical exercise to characterize a control period. The subjects in this subsample
      were later randomized into the intervention groups.
