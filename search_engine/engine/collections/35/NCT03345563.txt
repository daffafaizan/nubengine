      in fatigue (the study's primary outcome). Secondary patient-reported outcomes include quality
      of life changes (e.g. changes in sleep and perceived psychological distress), changes in the
      biomarkers of inflammation; including genome wide transcriptional factors, and expression of
      fatigue-related genes.

      There are over 9 million cancer survivors that are 55 years of age or older. Cancer survivors
      in this age group have unique challenges coping with late and long-term effects of having had
      a cancer diagnosis and treatment, coupled with age-related declines and comorbidities. This
      may influence their ability to engage in lifestyle interventions because of slower
      post-treatment recovery, increased functional limitations, and other quality of life (QOL)
      impairments. Fatigue is common, under-recognized, undertreated and correlated with
      impairments in psychological distress, social and functional well-being and health-related
      QOL in cancer survivors. For male cancer survivors suffering from fatigue, body-mind training
      (BMT) may be more appealing because it is not overly physically exertive and is safe for
      people 55 years of age or older.
