      Health care associated infection (HCAI) is a serious health hazard as it leads to increased
      morbidity and mortality of patients, length of hospital stay and costs associated with
      increased hospital stay. Infections from OT is well known and is well established which are
      often referred to as "hot zones" for emergence & spread of microbial resistance.
      Contamination in an operation theatre is an important cause of HCAIs and is the third leading
      cause of HCAIs.

      This was a prospective observational study conducted in the operation theatre of a tertiary
      hospital once a month randomly from April 2014 - April 2016. All Operation theatre (OT) staff
      were included in the study. All the patients in OT and samples from the OT air & equipment
      were excluded from the study. A total of 361 subjects divided into four groups were included
      in this study. The first group comprised of 179 doctors, the second had 31 nurses, third
      group had 110 OT Technicians and the fourth group included 41 subjects which included
      housekeeping staff and cleaners. Swabs were collected from OT staff at the time of entry and
      at exit from the OT. Places of swabs taken were: A) Web space, B) OT dress and C) Anterior
      nares.
