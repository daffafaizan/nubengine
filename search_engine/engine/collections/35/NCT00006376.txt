      with advanced transitional cell cancer of the urothelial tract. II. Determine the safety of
      this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to disease progression in
      these patients with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours for 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for at least 2 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.
