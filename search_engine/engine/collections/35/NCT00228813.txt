    
      This study is a single-arm, non-randomized feasibility study. Patients meeting the criteria
      for this study will be entered sequentially until completion or closure of the study. Early
      stopping rules will be employed to ascertain whether an unacceptable rate of toxicity
      (non-engraftment, and/or acute GVHD) occurs.

      Patients will be prepared for transplant through the administration of the following
      conditioning regimen based on their primary disease:

        -  Total body irradiation (1400 rads in 8 fractionated doses) and high dose chemotherapy,
           including cytosine arabinoside, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. Patients with bone
           marrow failure syndrome will not receive etoposide in the conditioning regimen.

        -  Post transplant immunosuppression prophylaxis against acute GVHD will include sequential
           administration of cyclosporine, methotrexate, basiliximab and mycophenolate.

        -  The donor will receive 3 daily G-CSF injections prior to marrow harvest starting on day
           -3. The injections may be initiated by the donor's primary physician prior to donor's
           arrival, or by the BMT service at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

        -  Patients will receive daily GM-CSF injections (250 mcg/m2) starting from day +7 post
           transplant until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than 2,000/ÂµL for three
           days.
