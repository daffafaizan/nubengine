      results in equivalent euploid embryos with Follicular Stimulation (FS) in young reproductive
      age women. The use of the "oocyte donor model" allows extrapolation of the results and
      application of LS routinely not only in healthy women undergoing fertility preservation but
      also in all patients irrespective of the menstrual date. This may indeed allow widespread
      introduction of LS in IVF programs which may result in proper scheduling of ovarian
      stimulation which is a major issue in everyday clinical practice.

      Given that the pharmacokinetics and follicular dynamics of 150Î¼g corifollitropin alfa for
      luteal stimulation has never been evaluated, the current study of luteal stimulation with
      corifollitropin alfa could be very interesting for several reasons:

        1. Potentially immediate synchronization of oocyte donors with recipients aiming to fresh
           oocyte donation.

        2. Fertility preservation patients for medical, oncological and non-medical indication

        3. Any situation in which endometrial receptivity is not pursued.
