    
      This is a single-centre, phase II randomized study. Eligible patients will be randomized to
      docetaxel with or without intermittent sunitinib. A total of eighty patients with measurable
      tumor will be enrolled over a period of 24-36 months. Eligible patients will be randomized
      1:1 to either arm A or arm B. Patients will be stratified according to site of primary tumor
      (breast vs non-small cell lung cancer vs others) for randomization purposes.

      Arm A (Control arm):

      Docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks

      Arm B (Experimental arm):

      Docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, preceded by 7 days of sunitinib 12.5mg orally daily
      during each cycle.

      Patients will be treated for a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy in the absence of tumor
      progression or unacceptable toxicities.

      Patient will be evaluated weekly for toxicity assessments and full blood count during cycle
      1, and on days 1 and 15 of each subsequent cycle.
