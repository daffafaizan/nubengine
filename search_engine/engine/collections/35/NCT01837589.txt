      well described in adults. However, in the pediatric population the results are more
      heterogeneous. The evaluation is hindered by difficulties in standardization of DXA
      interpretation.

      This measurement depends from the mass and size of the bone as well as the mass of soft
      tissue covering the bone area. These two characteristics, intrinsic to the measurement, pose
      a significant problem of interpretations in children because a change in bone density may
      reflect both a change in bone mineral content or changes related to growth, for example, the
      increase in bone size or volume of soft tissue covering the bone of interest.

      Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) provides a direct measure of bone mineralization
      densitometry volume. It quantifies bone mineral content in relation to the volume of the
      bone, in reference to an external phantom. This method therefore overcomes the size size.

      This technique can be considered without an additional radiation exposure to patients during
      a lung CT because it is usual that lumbar vertebrae are included in the measurement window
      because of pulmonary hyperinflation. This exam would be ideal for patients with Cystic
      fibrosis.

      All patients have these two evaluations during their routine management. This study compare
      study on the bone mineralization evaluated by (QCT) compared to the reference technique by
      (DXA) for the patient affected by cystic fibrosis for each patient.
