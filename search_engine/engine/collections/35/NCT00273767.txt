      been discovered. Indeed, it has been reported that this hormone, following binding to its
      cardiac or cerebral receptors, is able to induce a spectacular cellular protection against
      ischemic injury. These cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects have been observed
      experimentally in rodents as well as clinically in humans. In particular, our team has
      demonstrated that the administration of NeoRecormon® protects the heart against ischemia in
      the rat by significantly improving its recovery.

      In view of these exciting experimental results and of the growing interest of the scientific
      community for cytoprotective effects of EPO, we are planning the first clinical study
      examining the cardiac and cerebral protective effects of EPO (NeoRecormon®) in the setting of
      cardiac surgery.
