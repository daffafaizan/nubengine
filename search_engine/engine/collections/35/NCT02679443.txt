    
      Chemotherapy Regimen:

      All patients will receive pemetrexed and cisplatin in doses of 500 mg and 65 mg,
      respectively, per square meter of body surface area each on day 1 of a 3-week cycle. Patients
      with contraindications to administration of cisplatin, those who are intolerant to cisplatin,
      or develop grade 3 or 4 adverse events from cisplatin will be given carboplatin in
      combination with pemetrexed. Carboplatin will be given at a dose calculated to produce an
      area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5.0mg/mL/min. Dose modifications of either
      pemetrexed or the platinum agent or both will be done in case of significant change in PS or
      toxicity from or intolerance to dose administered in the previous cycle.

      Supplementation:

        1. Folic acid (FA) supplementation will be given to all patients orally in the dose of 5 ml
           (1000 μg) once daily of VITCOFOL (FDC Limited, Mumbai, India) pediatric formulation,
           which contains 200 μg FA/ml of the preparation. Patients will be instructed to measure
           the prescribed dose using a 5 ml plastic syringe containing markings at every 0.5 ml.
           Patients will also be instructed not to take any additional multivitamin supplements. In
           addition to FA supplementation, all patients will also be started simultaneously on oral
           iron (ferrous sulphate 200 mg twice a day). Once initiated, both FA and ferrous sulphate
           will be given on a daily basis and continued throughout the duration of chemotherapy and
           for at least 3 weeks beyond the last cycle.

        2. Vitamin B12 supplementation will be given to all patients intramuscularly in the dose of
           1000 μg along with each cycle of chemotherapy (maximum of six doses during the study
           period).
