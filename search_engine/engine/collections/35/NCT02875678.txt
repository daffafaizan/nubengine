      will assess the effects of ABX-1431 on gastric physiology in patients with functional
      dyspepsia, who have clinical evidence of impaired gastric accommodation with meals.

      All patients will undergo a screening visit for enrollment criteria. Eligible patients will
      be treated with a single dose of ABX-1431 HCl or placebo followed by IGP measurement,
      measured with a high resolution manometry probe during a nutrient volume tolerance test.
      After a washout period of at least one week, patients will undergo identical procedures with
      the other treatment.

      This study will enroll 12 functional dyspepsia (FD) patients.
