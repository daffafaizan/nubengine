    
      This study is a phase III single-blind placebo-controlled safety study with a 52 week active
      dosing period with Androxal. Safety will be assessed by physical and visual acuity exams,
      slit lamp and fundoscopy eye exams, clinical laboratory tests, DEXA scanning, lean soft
      tissue assessment (LST), and adverse event reporting. Results will be compared to an
      age-matched placebo group.
