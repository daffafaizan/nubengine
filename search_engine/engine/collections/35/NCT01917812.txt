    
      Using an innovative, convenient, mHealth trial design, this pilot study aims to test the
      feasibility of a seamless model of information flow integrating digital activity tracker
      information with a mobile phone texting system to deliver a technology-enhanced intervention
      that does not require in-person follow-up.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. individuals overestimate their physical activity, especially that done at work.

        2. biofeedback from an activity tracker can increase physical activity via increasing
           self-awareness.

        3. "smart" text message feedback can increase physical activity via personalizing health
           coaching.

      Digitalized activity tracking will use the Fitbug Orb, which syncs via Bluetooth with one's
      smartphone. It is a display-free triaxial accelerometer, allowing one to blind participants
      to numeric feedback. Text messaging will use Reify Health's "smart" platform for
      personalized, interactive texting by an automated and repeatable algorithm. Texting will be
      informed by real-time activity information.

      Potential advantages of the trial strategy include elimination of attendance at in-person
      sessions, personalization of health coaching, more continuous patient contact; inexpensive
      intervention, the ultimate ability to scale our intervention to larger target populations.

      After initial pilot trial completion, additional study will include long-term physical
      activity follow-up of participants and focus groups.
