      will purchase. Yet little is known about how specific groups, such as obese/overweight
      individuals and those with lower incomes, change their food purchasing decisions depending on
      food price changes. Evidence shows that these groups have lower quality diets and worse
      health outcomes than their normal weight and higher income counterparts. Therefore, it is
      important to gain a better understanding of how food price changes affect purchasing
      decisions among these population groups in order to develop targeted nutrition interventions
      to improve their diet quality. To investigate this, the researchers will create a
      laboratory-based grocery store, in which pictures of foods will be used in lieu of actual
      foods. Food prices will be indicated on each picture. The participants will be given play
      money and a budget, and asked to "purchase" foods in the mock grocery store. The price of
      foods will be changed throughout the study to investigate how participants change their
      purchasing decisions based on these price changes.
