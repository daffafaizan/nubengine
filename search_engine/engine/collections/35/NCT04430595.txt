      in the United States developing breast cancer in her life is about 13%. That means that there
      is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop breast cancer. Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
      (HER2) is one of the more well-researched genes in breast cancer so far. It has been reported
      that HER2 gene is overexpressed in 20% to 30% of breast cancer patients. HER2 is an important
      target for tumor gene therapy. In 2003, scientists confirmed the existence of breast cancer
      stem cells. In 2012, ganglioside GD2 was confirmed as an emerging marker of breast cancer
      stem cells. Targeting therapies for GD2 may help improve the survival rate and cure rate of
      breast cancer patients. Invasion and metastasis of tumor cells is the main cause of cancer
      death. CD44v6 is an adhesion molecule on the cell surface, which not only promotes
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition, degradation and remodeling of extracellular matrix, but
      also participates in organ-specific metastasis of tumor cells. Studies have shown that
      overexpression of CD44v6 is an important factor for the invasion and metastasis of breast
      cancer, and is closely related to the tumor size of the breast cancer, tumor staging, and
      lymph node metastasis. Therefore, CD44v6 may be an important target for the treatment of
      breast cancer. Using Her2-, GD2- and CD44v6-specific CAR-T cells may effectively improve the
      immunotherapy treatment, prevent tumor cells from escaping treatment, and achieve the effect
      of long-term disease relief.
