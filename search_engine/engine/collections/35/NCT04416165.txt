      PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was
      quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity,
      positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 18F-FDG and
      68Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy.
