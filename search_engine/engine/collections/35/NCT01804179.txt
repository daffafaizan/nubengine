      comprehensive primary health care for underserved patients. Recently, high-sensitivity and
      high-specificity fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) have
      emerged as a preferred initial screening modality within clinics due to convenience, ease of
      use, and low cost compared with colonoscopy. FOBT/FIT may help to reduce colorectal cancer
      screening (CRC) screening disparities and overcome several previously mentioned factors that
      often account for suboptimal CRC screening rates.
