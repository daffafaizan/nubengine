      site. In our patients, it has been have noticed those whose donor sites have been treated
      with platelet rich plasma (PRP) have endorsed decreased pain compared to those who have not.
      During our literature review few studies have looked at this issue. One such study by Miller
      et. al. looked at 5 patients whose donor site was treated with PRP showed a significant
      decrease in pain on a Likert visual pain scale. Kakudo et al. performed a side-by-side
      comparison on a single patient with half the wound treated with PRP and the other as a
      control. They found better epithelization and reduced pain during dressing changes for the
      treatment group. Both of these studies show promising results for pain reduction with PRP
      use, unfortunately there are no high quality randomized control trials that have looked at
      this. Another issue is many studies on PRP assess reduction of pain as a secondary outcome
      and instead focus on wound healing and epithelization primarily.

      This study hopes to elucidate the effect of PRP application on graft donor site pain.
      Patients will be recruited to the study and randomized into either treatment or control group
      based on medical necessity for a skin graft. This study will assess pain at the donor site
      via Likert pain scale and monitor narcotic pain medication use.
