      associated with serious complications. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the
      treatment of choice for most patients but its use in the real world is limited by low patient
      adherence which may result in sub-optimal outcomes for some patients. A single hypnotic with
      low risk of adverse effects is a cost-effective intervention to augment the currently low
      adherence to CPAP, especially if only prescribed for a limited time. The hypnotic is generic
      zopiclone 3.75-7.5 mg at bedtime for up to 14 doses.

      The clinical population targeted will be newly expert physician-diagnosed patients
      polysomnographically supported OSA who are not currently taking hypnotics for concomitantly
      diagnosed insomnia. Outpatients who are also judged to be capable to follow the study
      procedures (consent, timelines, visits, questionnaires) and who do not have any concurrent
      disease that in the view of the investigator will interfere with participation in the trial
      to completion will be included.
