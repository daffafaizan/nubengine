      blood-clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Individuals with hemophilia A suffer repeated bleeding
      episodes, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes even death due to the inability
      for blood to clot efficiently. The current treatment is intravenous infusion of clotting
      factor concentrates, either prophylactically or in response to bleeding. The procedure is
      life time long and expensive while still cannot achieve a cure.Gene therapy is a novel
      technology that has been successfully demonstrated in a number of clinical studies for
      diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases. In this study, an advanced lentiviral vector
      system NHP/TYF will be used to deliver a functional FVIII gene to overcome human clotting
      FVIII gene defect in patients with hemophilia A. This study is a Phase I trial evaluating the
      safety and efficacy for infusion of gene modified autologous stem cells in patients with
      hemophilia A.
