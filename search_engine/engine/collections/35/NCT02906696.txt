      I. To assess the response rate within 24 weeks in patients in chronic phase receiving
      bosutinib with the starting dose of 300 mg per day, with potential escalation to 400 mg, 500
      mg and 600 mg per day.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety of dosing schedule. II. Frequency of treatment interruptions and dose reductions.
      III. Determine the rate of BCR-ABL/ABL < 10% at 3 months and < 1% at 6 months on the
      international scale and the rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 6 months after
      the start of treatment.

      IV. Determine the cumulative rate of CCyR. V. Determine the rate of major molecular response,
      molecular response (MR)4, MR4.5 and complete molecular response.

      VI. Determine long-term outcomes, including progression-free survival, event-free survival,
      and overall survival.

      VIII. Investigate the correlation between ABL kinase domain mutations, if present at the time
      of enrollment, with outcome.

      IX. Determine the rate of development and type of ABL kinase domain mutations during therapy
      with bosutinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bosutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up
      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2
      years, every 24 weeks for 2 years.
