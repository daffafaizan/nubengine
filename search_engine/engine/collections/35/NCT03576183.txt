      study designed to confirm a human challenge model with E. coli strain LSN03-016011/A (LT+
      (Labile toxin), ST- (Stable toxin), CS17), as well as collect expanded safety and
      immunogenicity data.

      The study will be carried out in two phases:

      Vaccination phase: up to 34 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 2 doses of either
      VLA1701 or placebo orally. The doses will be given 7 days apart and subjects will be followed
      as an outpatient for safety.

      Challenge Phase: 30 Subjects, out of the 34 subjects, will be challenged.

      After challenge, subjects will be monitored for diarrhea and other signs/symptoms of enteric
      illness by daily medical checks, vital sign determinations, grading and weighing of all
      stools.
