    
      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of panobinostat based on when you join this study.

      If you are enrolled in the first portion of Part A, up to 4 dose levels of panobinostat will
      be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of panobinostat is found.

      If you are enrolled in the second portion of Part A, you will receive panobinostat at the
      recommended dose from the first portion of Part A.

      If you are enrolled in the first portion of Part B, up to 3 dose levels of panobinostat will
      be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of panobinostat is found.

      If you are enrolled in the second portion of Part B, you will receive panobinostat at the
      recommended dose from the first portion of Part B.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Other Instructions:

      You can take the study drugs anytime during the day but you should take them at the same time
      every day.

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you
      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do
      NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). If you take more than the
      prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care if needed and contact
      the study staff right away.

      Your study drug doses may be lowered if you have side effects.

      You will be given a drug diary for each cycle to write in to help keep track of your study
      drug doses. You should bring the drug diary and pill bottles to your study visit at the
      beginning of each new cycle.

      The panobinostat capsule(s) should be swallowed with 1 cup of water. You should try to take
      the dose at around the same time each day. If you vomit after taking panobinostat, you should
      not take it again until your next scheduled dose. If you forget to take a dose in the
      morning, you can take it up to 12 hours later. If you miss a dose for more than 12 hours, you
      should wait until your next scheduled dose. Do not make up missed doses.

      On Day 1 of every new study cycle and Cycle 1, Day 5, you should wait to take your
      panobinostat until you come to the clinic for study tests. Some of the Day 1 tests need to be
      performed before dosing.

      You need to follow all panobinostat dosing instructions as written. Do not miss any
      panobinostat capsules. You will be asked to return all unused study drug in the bottles
      provided, along with empty bottles, on Day 1 of every cycle, starting with Cycle 2. Capsules
      should not be transferred between bottles at any time. Please do not allow anyone else to
      handle or touch the study drug.

      You can stop anytime after Cycle 4 of Induction to have a stem cell transplant. If you decide
      with your doctor to delay the transplant, you will still be recommended to have your stem
      cells collected. You will continue with Induction therapy until you have had 4-8 cycles.
      After that, you will receive Maintenance therapy.

      You will be given other drugs to help prevent side effects. The study staff will tell you
      about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

      This is an investigational study. Panobinostat is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Bortezomib is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of MM. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome and for MM. The use
      of this drug combination to treat MM is investigational.

      Up to 54 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
