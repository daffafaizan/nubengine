      Primary

        -  Determine remission rates and duration of remission in patients with T-cell large
           granular lymphocytic (T-LGL) leukemia needing intervention because of anemia or
           neutropenia and are treated with parenteral methotrexate (MTX) as first-line therapy

        -  Determine remission rate and duration of remission in patients who fail to respond to
           MTX therapy and are subsequently treated with fludarabine as second-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the side effects of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of molecular remissions in patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive methotrexate subcutaneously once weekly in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving a response to methotrexate
      receive fludarabine IV on days 1-3. Treatment with fludarabine repeats every 28 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
