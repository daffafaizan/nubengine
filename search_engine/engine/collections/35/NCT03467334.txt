      Recent studies carried out in healthy infants have shown that the consumption of B. breve
      CECT7263 and L. fermentum CECT5716 during the first months of life are related to a lower
      risk to present episodes of crying characteristic of infantile colic.

      The objective of the present study is to compare the effect of B. brevis and B. brevis\L
      mixture. fermentum with respect to simethicone.

      It is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, blind, parallel-group, 4-weeks nutritional
      intervention study which will be conducted in 18 public and private hospitals and health
      centers from Spain.
