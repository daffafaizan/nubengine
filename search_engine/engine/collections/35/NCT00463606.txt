      mg, ABT-335 135 mg monotherapy, and rosuvastatin 5 mg monotherapy. The 3 primary outcome
      measures only compare 2 of the treatment groups for each variable (mean percent change in
      HDL-C and TG comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to rosuvastatin 5
      mg monotherapy, and mean percent change in LDL-C comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with
      rosuvastatin 5 mg to ABT-335 135 mg monotherapy. The 6 secondary outcome measures only
      compare 2 of the treatment groups for each variable (mean percent change in Non-HDL-C
      comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to ABT-335 135 mg monotherapy,
      mean percent change in Non-HDL-C, VLDL-C, ApoB, and Total Cholesterol comparing ABT-335 135
      mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to rosuvastatin 5 mg monotherapy, and median percent
      change in hsCRP comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to
      rosuvastatin 5 mg monotherapy).
