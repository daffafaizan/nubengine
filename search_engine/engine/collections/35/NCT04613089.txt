      disorders, also known as Batten disease. Until now, 13 different genes causing different
      subtypes of disease are known. The genetic mutations cause a symptom complex of progressive
      loss of acquired skills in the domains of motor function, cognition and visual function,
      leading to ataxia, movement disorder, dementia, blindness and seizures. In the area of
      genetic testing, variable clinical phenotypes become more and more prevalent. The
      disease-mechanisms as well as the exact clinical course of the diseases are currently still
      not fully understood and documented. Although descriptions of the clinical spectrums exist,
      the natural history needs to be defined as accurately as possible. These data are urgently
      needed as clinical control data helping to test the therapeutic efficacy of emerging
      experimental therapies.

      Since samples of genetically defined patients are rare and therefore limited for research,
      there is an urgent need for researchers to localize and access samples internationally. With
      the establishment of a local NCL-biorepository and virtual sample localization
      internationally, scientists worldwide may have a faster way to access needed samples for
      advancing research.

      Any NCL patient with a confirmed molecular diagnosis can join the retrospective and
      prospective natural history data collection. It is also possible for families with already
      deceased patients to participate in the retrospective analysis part of the data collection if
      the genetic mutation is known.
