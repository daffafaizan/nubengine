      lasting weight loss benefits to patients. We are projecting that the percent of Excess Body
      Weight Loss (% EWL) will be greater in study subjects when compared with our control group
      with LAGB alone. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the % EWL in study subjects will be
      similar to patients who have laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.
