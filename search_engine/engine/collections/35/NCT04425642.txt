      malignancy and inherited diseases who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT, nutritional
      status, parenteral nutrition tolerability and effectiveness will be assessed before and one
      month after HSCT. All patients who require parenteral nutrition will pass randomization via
      envelope technique - solutions containing glucose/amino acids or glucose/amino acids/lipid
      emulsions. The results will be compared with a control group which will not receive
      additional nutritional support. The methods used for measurement of nutritional status are:
      weight, body mass index, bioimpedance and hand grip strength (for adults only), blood tests,
      diet amount record.
