      formed: the control group (GC: n=8, 69±4 years old), the strength training group (GF: n=6,
      67±4 years old) and the power training group (GP, n=7, 68±4 years old). No extra activity was
      induced to GC's routine. Meanwhile, GF and GP underwent 12 weeks of strength and power
      training, respectively, with three weekly sessions. While GF performed the exercises with
      moderate speed (70-90% of 1RM), the GP executed them in fast speed (40-60% of 1RM). A
      kinematic and electromyographic gait evaluation, as well as balance and functional capacity
      evaluations, were conducted prior and after the intervention period.
