    
      The goal of this study is to design a Negotiation and Dispute Resolution (NDR) training
      intervention to improve communication and address resolution of conflicts that family
      caregivers of patients with cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease (AD) frequently
      experience. Specifically this study will:

      Aim 1: Employ a caregiver (user)-centered design approach to modify and tailor a negotiations
      and dispute resolution (NDR) training intervention to support communication skills of family
      caregivers of adults with AD.

      Aim 2: Utilizing Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), conduct a randomized controlled
      trial of the NDR intervention that targets better communication between caregivers and health
      teams to determine the feasibility of delivering the intervention, and derive estimates of
      the effect of 3 intervention components on changes in patient-centered outcomes at
      post-intervention and follow-up.

      Exploratory Aim 3: Explore if intervention components (lectures/exercises) interact to change
      communication between caregivers and health care teams at post-intervention and follow-up.
