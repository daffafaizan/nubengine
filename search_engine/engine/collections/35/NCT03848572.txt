      with PCI with a novel strategy of change of therapy during follow-up on the base of the Delta
      PRECISE-DAPT score, as assessed every 3 months in PCI patients receiving DAPT. The primary
      end-point of the study is the occurrence of bleeding, as defined according to the criteria of
      the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC). The second end-point is a composite of
      cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST), or
      BARC criteria type 2, 3 or 5 bleeding.
