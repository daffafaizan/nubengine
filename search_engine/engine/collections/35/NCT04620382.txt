      one day of screening tests, followed by 2 study days.

      Screening tests include a physical examination and history, routine safety laboratory
      assessments, and testing of the autonomic nervous system. Medications affecting blood
      pressure and the autonomic nervous system such as pressor medications will be withdrawn for
      at least 5 half-lives before studies, except for fludrocortisone. Other medications will be
      held constant throughout the study.

      Eligible participants will then be studied on two separate days in random order: one day with
      midodrine combined with sham abdominal compression, and one day with abdominal compression
      combined with a placebo pill.

      On each study day, participants will be instrumented to measure blood pressure, heart rate,
      hemodynamic parameters, segmental impedance, and markers of cardiovascular risk. A baseline
      tilt table test will be performed to obtain supine and upright baseline measurements,
      including the assessment of orthostatic symptoms. Participants will then receive a single
      oral dose of placebo or midodrine, and a deflated binder will be placed around the abdomen.
      Thirty to sixty minutes later, a second tilt table test will be done with sham or active
      abdominal compression. Outcome measurements will be repeated in the supine and upright
      positions. At the end of the second tilt table test, the investigators may also assess
      splanchnic venous capacitance.
