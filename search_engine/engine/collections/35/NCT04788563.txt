      beings. The conventional western drug therapy often has side effects and many patients are
      unable to achieve ideal blood pressure control with drugs alone. Therefore, the treatment of
      primary hypertension still requires active exploration of complementary and alternative
      therapies with clear clinical efficacy.

      Heat-sensitive moxibustion is an innovative moxibustion therapy. By stimulating the patient's
      special moxibustion sensation, heat-sensitive moxibustion can achieve better results than
      traditional moxibustion for many diseases, including primary hypertension. Heat-sensitive
      moxibustion is an easy, inexpensive and safe treatment method. The practitioner does not need
      to be professionally qualified to perform moxibustion, making it a suitable technique for
      patients to self-medicate on a daily basis. Traditional moxibustion has been shown to lower
      blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension. Theoretically, heat-sensitive
      moxibustion could achieve better blood pressure lowering effects, but its effects in lowering
      blood pressure in the setting of self-management in community patients is unclear. To verify
      the efficacy and safety of heat-sensitive moxibustion community self-management for
      hypertension, we plan to perform a randomized controlled trial. In this trial, we designed
      the trial grouping scheme as a randomized controlled trial with patient preference arms in
      order to improve patient adherence and reduce the impact of patient preference effects.
