      from esophageal samples correlate with the symptom of dysphagia in adolescent and adults. The
      investigators hypothesize that intraluminal secreted metabolite(s) will change during
      episodes of dysphagia. The aim of the study will be to use a novel method of producing
      esophageal luminal samples, the esophageal string test, to capture esophageal metabolites
      when a patient is and is not experiencing dysphagia.
