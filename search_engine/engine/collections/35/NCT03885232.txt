      evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative provider communication strategy (PIVOT-MI)
      intervention in improving provider-parent vaccine discussions and increasing vaccine
      acceptance. Providers at intervention clinics will be trained to use the PIVOT-MI strategy in
      which a presumptive format is used to initiate the childhood vaccine recommendation with all
      parents, followed by use of motivational interviewing (MI) with parents who voice resistance
      to that recommendation. Providers at control clinics will deliver care as usual.

      Specific aims are to evaluate the impact of PIVOT-MI, relative to control, on (1) child's
      immunization status; (2) parent-rated visit experience with their child's provider; and (3)
      change in provider experience of the vaccine discussion with vaccine-hesitant parents.
