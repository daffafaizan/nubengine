      missed canals with lack of data of its morphological variations in the Egyptian
      population.There are different methods to study canal morphology as tooth clearing and root
      canal staining, conventional and digital radiographs, radiographic assessment enhanced with
      contrast media. Recently cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images have been found to be
      useful in providing accurate anatomic details in 3 dimensions for diagnosis and treatment
      planning before endodontic therapy.

      in this study the investigators do an Observational analysis of available records of
      cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) of root and canal morphology in the permanent maxillary
      first and second premolars in this population
