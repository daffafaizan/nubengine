      pancreas and biliary tract. Indeed, the biliary tract has been referred to as "an incomplete
      pancreas" and embryologically the two originate from the same structure. It is thus plausible
      that oncogenesis in the pancreas and biliary tract are related and that pancreas and biliary
      cancers have reciprocal effective treatment strategies.

      To date, the only chemotherapeutic agents effective in advanced biliary tract tumors is the
      combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Known and approved therapies for advanced pancreas
      cancer include single agent gemcitabine, the four drug combination of FOLFIRINOX
      (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan), the questionable limited benefit
      of inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, and most recently the combination
      of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.

      Based on promising results in pancreas cancer, investigators hypothesize nab-paclitaxel in
      combination with gemcitabine + cisplatin will be an effective cytotoxic combination in BTC
      treatment.
