      (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new organs. Most
      patients who receive a transplanted organ must take these anti-rejection medications for the
      rest of their lives, or for as long as the transplanted organ continues to work. Taking
      standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects, including
      pancreas and kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection
      medications that work just as well, but could lessen the amount of anti-rejection medications
      that are taken long term.
