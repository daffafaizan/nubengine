      as a complementary treatment to prevent the relapse of depression, and to reduce stress and
      improve well-being in many chronic conditions.

      Epilepsy, which results from the activity of hyperexcitable circuits, is also associated with
      a disorganization of the physiological brain networks. Studies in cognitive neuroscience in
      healthy subjects suggest that meditation induces lasting changes in the physiological
      networks of attention and default mode and could potentially compensate for dysfunctions of
      these networks in epileptic patients.
