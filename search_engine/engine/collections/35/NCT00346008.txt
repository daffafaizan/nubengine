        -  Assess the feasibility of Iceland Genomics Corporation (UVS) to identify melanoma in
           multiple-case families, individuals with multiple tumors, and selected additional family
           members in Iceland.

        -  Assess the feasibility of mutation detection using sequencing and HPLC.

        -  Determine UVS' ability to create datasets with demographic, epidemiologic and molecular
           data.

      OUTLINE: Participants and patients undergo blood collection and complete lifestyle
      questionnaires. All patients and population-based controls have DNA samples sequenced for
      MC1R. Demographic and epidemiologic data on all study participants is collected. Sequencing
      of the major melanoma susceptibility genes CFDKN2A, CDK4, and MC1R is also performed.
