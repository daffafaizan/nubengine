      (anterior capsulorhexis and irrigation/aspiration and posterior capsulorhexis and anterior
      vitrectomy) are enrolled. The patients are assigned to two groups according to the strategy
      of primary surgery: Group I: the participants received minimal invasive surgery, while in
      Group II, the participants received a traditional cataract surgery. Investigators perform a
      secondary intraocular lens implantation for the patients. Investigators compare the visual
      acuity, incidence of high intraocular pressure, incidence of visual axis opacification,
      uveitis and iris/pupil abnormality between two groups after the first and the second surgery,
      aiming at comparing the prognosis of minimal invasive lens surgery and traditional cataract
      surgery for treating congenital cataracts.
