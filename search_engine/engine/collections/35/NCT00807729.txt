    
      Objective: We compared outcome parameters for good-risk patients with classic signs,
      symptoms, laboratory and abdominal imaging features of cholecystolithiasis and
      choledocholithiasis randomized to either LC + LCBDE or ERCP/S + LC.

      Design: Our study was a prospective trial conducted following written informed consent with
      randomization by the serially-numbered opaque envelope technique.

      Setting: Our institution is an academic teaching hospital and the central receiving and
      trauma center for the City and County of San Francisco.

      Patients: We randomized 122 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I or II)
      meeting entry criteria. Ten of these patients, excluded from outcome analysis, were protocol
      violators having signed out of the hospital against medical advice before one of both
      procedures were completed.

      Interventions: Treatment was pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      sphincterotomy (ERCP/S) followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), or laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy plus laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LC + LCBDE).

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was efficacy of stone clearance from the
      common bile duct. Secondary endpoints were length of hospital stay, cost of index
      hospitalization, professional fees, hospital charges, morbidity and mortality, and patient
      acceptance and quality of life scores.
