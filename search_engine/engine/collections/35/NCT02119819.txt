      the investigator will know to which treatment each individual is assigned. Thereafter follows
      a 12 week period where participants and the investigator will know which treatment they are
      assigned to. Participants' on LY2944876 and on exenatide extended-release continue treatment
      in this period, those who received placebo will be followed without treatment.
