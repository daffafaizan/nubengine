      testing the safety and feasibility of atomoxetine (40 or 80 mg/day) treatment, compared to
      placebo, in methadone-stabilized stimulant users. The study will have 3 phases: 1) a one to
      two week- methadone-induction phase; 2) an 8-week "treatment" phase; and 3) 1 week
      atomoxetine taper and about a 4-week methadone "taper and detoxification or transfer" phase.
      Subjects will be randomized to three treatment arms: 40 mg (n=15) atomoxetine, or 80 mg
      (n=15) atomoxetine, or placebo (n=15). During the methadone induction phase, subjects will be
      stabilized on methadone. During induction onto methadone, participants will be administered
      increasing doses of methadone starting at 30 mg daily, and this dose will be increased for
      stabilization of opiate withdrawal symptoms from 40 mg up to 140 mg depending on individual
      need. Based on the clinic schedule between 1 to 2 weeks after methadone treatment is
      initiated , atomoxetine treatment will be started at 40 mg/day. For those assigned to 80 mg
      of atomoxetine, the dose will be titrated up to 80 mg/day on the second week of treatment
      phase. At the end of the treatment-phase, subjects will undergo detoxification from methadone
      over a 4-week period based on an individual's needs, and they will concurrently be tapered
      off atomoxetine. All participants will receive a weekly one-hour of individual psychotherapy
      (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) with experienced clinicians specifically trained to deliver
      the therapy, and who will receive ongoing supervision.

      This study has been terminated as of march 2014 due to the lack of funding, only 14 were
      enrolled with 11 subject completers. (June 2016)
