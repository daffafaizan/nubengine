    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, two-arm randomized phase II screening trial34 in young
      patients (18-65 years) affected by relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
      at diagnosis, eligible to high-dose therapy.

      Aim of the study is to to assess whether the addition of Bortezomib to R-DHAP is more
      promising than standard R-DHAP, as induction therapy before high dose chemotherapy with ASCT
      with respect to response and safety. Patients will be randomized at first relapse between: a)
      the standard salvage therapy Rituximab in association to DHAP every 28 days (R-DHAP) for 4
      cycles and b) Bortezomib in association to the same regimen (BR-DHAP). In both arms the
      induction therapy is followed by autologous stem cell transplantation or, if indicated, by
      allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      A patient is considered evaluable if it is possible to assess response by PET after 4 cycle
      or, if a patient withdraws from the study for PD, before completion of study treatment.

      After providing written informed consent, patients will be evaluated for eligibility during a
      21-day screening period. If they continue to meet eligibility criteria, they will be
      randomized to receive the first dose of BR-DHAP or R-DHAP .
