      practices among adult women who are enrolled in the Risk Assessment Clinic at the National
      Naval Medical Center Breast Care Center and are found to be at increased risk for developing
      breast cancer. II. Correlate the use of CAM with individual risk for breast cancer. III.
      Define the types of CAM practices used by this study population. IV. Identify reasons why
      this study population is using CAM.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prevalence of complementary and alternative
      medicine practices (enteral/parenteral vs psychologic/neurologic). Patients complete a
      Personal Risk Assessment form, pre-test/post-test knowledge questionnaires, and a survey
      questionnaire.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 2 years.
