      cancer incidences, strategic planning of health care systems etc.) data entry in such
      programs is often collected in restricted variables and physicians participating in the
      registration process may not be able to interact with each other during the management of
      their patients. For these reasons, a complete record in national general cancer registries
      can only be established retrospectively and the direct contribution to patient-specific
      diagnosis / treatment is limited. On the other hand, local registries have many advantages
      like easy integration of the data into the hospital electronic systems and multidisciplinary
      proactive enrollment.

      Thus, characteristics of ongoing colorectal cancer registries (Swedish, South Australian,
      Oregon, Lublin, Ontario etc.) reported previously in the English medical literature are
      reviewed and an electronic form is tabulated for the Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer
      Registry. This study will examine the validity and reliability of this registry. Aspects of
      the analysis will cover construct validity, content validity, parallel forms reliability,
      test-retest reliability, split half internal consistency and face validity.
