      early effectiveness measured by changes in plasma biomarkers, tissue biomarkers from muscle
      biopsies, cardiac imaging, and on clinical function assessments of participants' muscle
      strength. All patients will receive oral (+)-epicatechin for a total duration of
      approximately 52 weeks. Three doses of (+)-epicatechin will be tested in sequential 2 month
      periods with total daily doses of 75, 150, and 225 mg/day (+)-epicatechin. Doses will be
      escalated every 2 months, if tolerated, for the first 6 months of the study. Participants
      will then continue to receive the highest does they tolerated for an additional 6 months.
