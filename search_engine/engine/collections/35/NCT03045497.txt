      I. Evaluate if contrast-enhanced ultrasound of hepatocellular carcinomas at one to two weeks
      and one month correlate with the clinical evaluation standard of a contrast-enhanced MRI at
      one month (the current clinical standard) in patients who have undergone transarterial
      chemoembolization with drug eluting beads.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish whether changes in quantitative blood flow parameters relative to baseline
      correlate with effective embolization.
