      patients, undergoing elective or emergency surgery under general anaesthesia were included
      and randomized into three equal groups: ISO, SEVO or DES. We used MIRUS, a gas delivery
      system with a VA reflector, just like AnaConDa, that can be paired with common ICU
      ventilators. Additionally, MIRUS features the unique ability to maintain the end-tidal
      concentration (etVA) in target by automatically adjusting the delivery rate. Every 8 hours,
      the RASS was assessed by the nurse. The log of the EEG-Narcotrend Index (NI) was also
      included in the study.
