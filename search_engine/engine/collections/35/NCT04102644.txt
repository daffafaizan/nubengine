      delivery or for management of respiratory infection. Women will be recruited and screened for
      study participation at the time of presentation to the hospital. Participants will be
      assessed through hospitalization, labor, delivery, and discharge and at 1- and 6-week
      postpartum contacts. Liveborn infants will be enrolled at birth and followed through 42 days
      of life. The pilot phase of this protocol will enroll up to 500 women in labor and their
      newborns and follow them through labor, delivery, and 42 days postpartum.
