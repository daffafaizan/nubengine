      recruited from the faculty, staff and student body of the University of Pennsylvania, and
      from the University City area of Philadelphia. Participants will be randomized to one of
      three anatomic sites deemed relevant: the nasofacial sulcus, the lateral forehead, and the
      upper back. Participants will then be randomized to receive injection with the KAD first or
      second. The injection will be 0.5 cc of room temperature buffered lidocaine injected at
      constant slow speed (approximately 5 seconds) through a 30-gage needle held perpendicular to
      the skin by the same surgeon, with verbal cues standardized. Injections will be given in
      accordance with the standard of practice. When the KAD is used it will be used as directed:
      firmly pressed on the skin adjacent to the injection, with the needle aimed into the lighted
      area. Volunteers will evaluate each injection immediately after it is complete using the
      visual analog scale. When both injections are completed, participants will indicate their
      preference of injection, complete qualitative questions, and note necessary demographic
      information. Injection location and order of intervention (i.e. first or second) will be
      noted.
