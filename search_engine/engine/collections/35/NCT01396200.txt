      advances have improved patient outlook, but the disease remains incurable and patients become
      refractory to treatments, develop organ dysfunction from myeloma itself, and encounter severe
      toxicities from therapies, limiting further treatment options. Subjects over the age of 18
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have had at least one prior therapy, have a
      life expectancy of at least 4 weeks and an ECOG performance status of 0,1 or 2 will be
      included. The investigators propose an initial pilot trial to test the feasibility of giving
      standard chemotherapy with infusional cyclophosphamide and pulse dexamethasone (cy/dex) for
      four days, together with the investigational agents, oral rapamycin (cohort A), and in a
      separate parallel arm, oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (cohort B). The investigators will
      enroll 3 patients on cohort A and 3 patients on cohort B, both at the planned 1st dose level
      for the overall phase I/II trial which will succeed this trial if feasibility is
      demonstrated. The 6 patients from this pilot trial will be included in total number of
      patients for the overall study which will be completed when further funding is secured.
      Feasibility will be defined by the ability to deliver the regimen as planned and the ability
      to perform the planned correlative studies. Subjects will receive up to 12 cycles and will be
      followed for 12 months after the last cycle. Data collected will include toxicity, response
      rates, correlative studies to examine the pharmacodynamics of mTOR inhibition and autophagy
      and the pharmacokinetics of rapamycin and HCQ.
