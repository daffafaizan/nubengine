      Department of Pediatric Dentistry of the International University of Catalonia. Patients
      between the ages of 3 and 12, who attend the dental university clinic of the International
      University of Catalonia, will be part of the study.

      Parents or legal guardians will be informed of the treatment procedure with a patient
      information sheet and informed consent will be given. Once signed, the patient will be
      assigned to one of the 3 study groups.

      Accepting an alpha risk of 5% and with a power of 80% in a bilateral contrast, 15 subjects in
      each group are required to detect a minimum difference of 4 points between two groups,
      assuming that there are 3 groups and a standard deviation of 4.9. a follow- up loss rate of
      10% has been estimated. The total number of children will be 45 by 15 for each group.

      In order to analyze the degree of agreement of one examiner, 15 children will be evaluated
      twice, with a separation of one month.
