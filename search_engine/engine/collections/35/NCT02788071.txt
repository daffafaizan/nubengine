    
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition. IBS
      is associated with a high use of health-care costs and can substantially reduce quality of
      life and work productivity.

      Several studies have demonstrated that the composition of the gut microbiota in IBS patients
      is different from healthy controls.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could therefore be a treatment option for IBS patients
      by exchanging the microbiota of an IBS patient with the microbiota of a healthy donor.
