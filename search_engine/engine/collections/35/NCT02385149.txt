      with refined wheat (RW) products will be included prior to the intervention for all subjects.
      Thereafter, two different treatments will be evaluated e.g. a 12-week intervention with whole
      grain wheat (WGW) products (98g of WGW per day) and a 12-week control intervention with RW
      products. Two experimental visits will be planned before and two experimental visits will be
      planned after the 12-week intervention period. In the first experimental visit the
      investigators will determine liver fat and abdominal fat distribution by magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the second experimental visit the
      investigators will comprehensively phenotype the participants which will include the response
      to a mixed meal challenge test.
