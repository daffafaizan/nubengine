      is the most controversial fractures regarding diagnosis and management.

      For several years, closed reduction has been preferred over open reduction to avoid surgical
      complications. Nowadays the preference started to change towards open reduction because of
      the late complications that might happen in case of closed treatment.

      A Transmasseteric Anteroparotid (TMAP) approach for open reduction and internal fixation of
      condylar fractures overcomes the problems of difficult access and facial nerve injury risk of
      other conventional approaches.

      Different plating options are available for internal fixation of the condyle and subcondylar
      region. Trapezoidal Condylar Plates (TCP) specifically developed for the osteosynthesis of
      low and high subcondylar fracture. These plates were designed to closely follow the tensile
      strain lines along the rim of the sigmoid notch anteriorly combined with a posterior arm to
      parallel the condylar axis free of harmful bending strains.

      Aim: Our aim in this study is to assess the use of TCP in the subcondylar fracture in
      comparison to the use of conventional two miniplates method.

      Materials and methods: This prospective randomized clinical trial will enroll 20 patients
      with subcondylar fracture indicated for open reduction and internal fixation. Group A will
      undergo fixation with TCP and group B will have two miniplates fixation. Both groups will
      have Transmasseteric Anteroparotid approach.

      Results: The results of the two groups will be compared clinically and radiographically.
