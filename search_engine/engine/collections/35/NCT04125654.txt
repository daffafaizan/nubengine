      Firstly, the study will test 3 types of sample by means of mNGS, including ascites fluid,
      peritoneal dialysis fluid and postoperative drainage fluid and evaluate the sensitivity and
      specificity of NGS.

      Secondly, the clinical validation of mNGS will be performed in multicenters for ascites
      infection in cirrhosis patients. Furthermore, the study will collect the paired plasma sample
      for NGS testing at the same time to evaluate the protential sources of microorganisms in
      ascites.The aim of the study is to observe the performance of mNGS in ascites infection
      diagosis and the protential clinical effect in cirrhsis patients.
