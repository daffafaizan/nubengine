        1. To understand the natural history of osteoarthritis (OA) at different joints (knee, hip,
           hand, foot and lumbar).

        2. To identify different phenotypes of OA (e.g., generalized OA, rapidly progressive knee
           and hand OA, tibiofemoral OA and patellofemoral OA), their association with pain (e.g.,
           peripheral pain, central pain, nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain) and consequences.

        3. To examine risk factors of OA (lifestyle habits, nutritional, metabolic, anatomical and
           genetic factors, etc.) at each joint as well as multiple joints.

        4. To determine the association between x-ray structure change, ultrasound synovial changes
           and pain and other symptoms of OA at knee and hand joints within the large-sample
           community-based population.

        5. To predict the progression of knee and hand OA within new-onset early-stage knee and
           hand OA patients, and to identify the rapidly progressive knee and hand OA phenotypes
           and their related risk factors.

        6. To investigate the association between gut microbiota and OA.

      Design: This is a prospective community-based cohort study.

      Participants: Subjects included in this study were a randomly selected sample of residents,
      aged 50 years or older from rural mountainous communities of Longshan County, Hunan Province,
      China. 4000 people were planned to be recruited, divided into three sub-cohorts. 1,469
      participants were enrolled in sub-cohort 1 in 2015, and two follow-ups have been completed in
      2016 and 2017. 1,267 participants were enrolled in sub-cohort 2 in 2018. And it is planed to
      recruit 1,300 participants in sub-cohort 3 in 2019. Each sub-cohort will be followed every
      three years regularly.
