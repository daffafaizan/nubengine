      correlation between the tidal volumes measured with the Linshom detector and those measured
      with the mechanical ventilator. after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and written
      informed consent from the volunteers.

      The Linshom detector, which is comprised of two rapid responding medical-grade thermistors in
      close proximity to the mouth/nose (sensor) and a thermistor remote to the airway, will be
      mounted in the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) face mask to measure the
      temperature during breathing. The CPAP will be connected to a Servo-I ventilator (Maquet)
      with a circuit and disposable filter. The volunteers will be instructed to breathe normal
      through the CPAP mask on room air. The excursions of the thermistor tracings (from valley to
      peak) will be recorded by the Linshom device and displayed continuously on a laptop monitor
      in a waveform. The tidal volume will also be measured by the ventilator and the data
      downloaded in a Compact Flash card. The temperature profiles from the sensors and the
      relative tidal volume will be correlated with the tidal volumes measured by the ventilator.
