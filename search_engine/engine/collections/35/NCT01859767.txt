      patients with probable AD and HVs on the basis of neocortical tracer binding pattern, the
      SPECT scans will be visually assessed by a nuclear physician experienced in the field of
      neuro-imaging. SPECT scan findings will be classified either as abnormal (i.e., significant
      neocortical uptake in predefined regions) or as normal (i.e. no significant neocortical
      uptake in predefined regions). The visual analysis of the MNI SPECT images will be compared
      to the clinical diagnosis and Amyvid PET imaging results to determine the efficacy of MNI-672
      as an agent to detect B-amyloid. The nuclear physician evaluating the SPECT images will be
      unaware of the clinical diagnosis.
