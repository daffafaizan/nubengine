      regarding patients' overnight sleep quality. This questionnaire is given to complete to
      eligible patients between 7 am and 10 am. The same questionnaire is given to the night-shift
      nurse between 7 am and 7:30 am, who was taking care of that particular patient overnight.
      This RCQS assessment is based solely on each nurse´s perception of the patient´s sleep
      quality last night. Neither the nurse nor the patient know each other´s RCSQ response.
