      AD patients. CSF melatonin levels are known to significantly drop in patients with
      Alzheimer's dementia. It is known that CSF melatonin levels are much higher than blood
      melatonin levels, due to melatonin secretion from the pineal recess directly into the third
      ventricle. It has never been investigated whether blood melatonin accurately correlates with
      CSF melatonin in AD, nor whether saliva or urine melatonin levels accurately reflect
      blood/CSF melatonin in the AD continuum. The investigators want to validate the use of blood,
      saliva and urine melatonin levels as alternative for CSF melatonin in the AD continuum to
      pave the way for further use of less invasive collection techniques (blood, saliva, urine
      instead of CSF) and to possibly study circadian rhythm in a less disrupting, in home
      environment (saliva, urine).

      Furhtermore, melatonin exerts several potential anti-AD properties, including
      anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, tilting APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic
      pathway, exerting positive effects on sleep and so on. In vivo studies furthermore point to
      anticonvulsive and antiepileptic effects of melatonin in a whole range of rodent models. Some
      evidence exists for a role of melatonin in prevention of epileptic seizures in humans.

      The investigators want to investigate influence of melatonin on changes in cognition in a
      longitudinal way, and investigate influence on (sub)clinical epileptiform activity.
