      several autoimmune disorders. BCD-121 is a novel humanized monoclonal bispecific antibody
      against human IL17 and TNFa developed by JCS BIOCAD (Russia) which is now on the first step
      of clinical evaluation. BCD-121-1 study is the first-in-human clinical trial which is
      intended to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      immunogenicity of BCD-121 when used as a single step-by-step escalating subcutaneous dose in
      healthy male volunteers. During this study it is expected to determine diapason of safety
      doses of BCD-121 (incl. MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2 studies.
