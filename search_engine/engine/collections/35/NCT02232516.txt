      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of romidepsin plus lenalidomide in patients
      with previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of the combination of romidepsin and lenalidomide. II. Further
      evaluate efficacy of the combination of romidepsin and lenalidomide.

      III. Evaluate the delay to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the use of Northwestern Medicine (NM) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) vs CT imaging in PTCL.

      II. Validate a new prognostic model for newly diagnosed PTCL. III. Investigate the tumor
      immunohistochemical profile to identify potential biomarkers associated with prognosis and
      treatment response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 1 year in the absence of disease progression, inter-current illness that prevents further
      administration of treatment, unacceptable toxicity, patient decides to withdraw from study
      treatment (or study as a whole), or general or specific changes in the patient's condition
      render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
