      to take care of oneself emotionally, improve positive emotions, and decrease stress and other
      negative emotions. The user interacted with the app through evidence-based activities (e.g.
      writing gratefulness notes, helping others, practicing mindfulness). The activities were
      selected based on the goals the user selected upon initiation of program and throughout
      engagement with the app. In order to promote sustained use of the program and mastery of the
      positive emotion based skills, the design of the program included activities that range in
      difficulty so that the user could progress and improve (i.e., simple "1 and done" types of
      goals versus multi-week goals).

      Research in positive psychology interventions suggests that increases in well-being are
      highest when the activity: 1) fits the person's interests and values and 2) is performed
      neither too frequently nor too seldom. Because of our desire to have a product with
      long-lasting usability and sustained engagement, it was critical that there were a diverse
      number of activities from which individuals could choose based on interest, current mood, and
      past success. The Jauntly user experience is structured around free use of the app partnered
      with regular emails, in-app messaging, videos, and articles. Emails remind users to utilize
      program content (including users in the control group who were reminded to visit the
      stress-management website). Use of the app and viewing of videos and other content is not
      restricted and users are able to self-tailor use according to their interest.
