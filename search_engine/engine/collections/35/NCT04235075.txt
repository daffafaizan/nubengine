      high-quality fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) signal from non-invasive sensors on the maternal
      abdomen.

      As early as the 20th week of amenorrhea, heart rhythm disorders (tachycardia, bradycardia)
      can be detected in the fetus, most often by fortuitous circumstance, during routine
      obstetrical ultrasound examinations. It is then necessary to analyze these rhythmic
      anomalies, understand their origin and, if necessary, initiate pharmacotherapy. The
      effectiveness of the treatments is then monitored by ultrasound in the high-risk pregnancy
      department.

      The analysis of a fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) provides information that allows to
      determine the nature of the rhythm disorder, its origin and therefore its potential severity.

      The innovative methodological approach considered for the extraction of non-invasive ECGf is
      to combine 2 complementary modalities of the same cardiac phenomenon. This is achieved by
      combining the use of ECG sensors with sound sensors giving access to phonocardiographic
      signals (PCG).
