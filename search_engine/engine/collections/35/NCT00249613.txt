    
      In this five-year study, a total of 300 women entering court-referred treatment throughout
      Los Angeles County and who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to a
      women-focused or to a mixed-gender outpatient treatment program. The study will assess the
      impact of women-focused substance abuse treatment using outcome measures including
      recidivism, substance abuse and relapse, and social adjustment (e.g., employment, parenting
      behaviors, psychological improvement, and HIV risk reduction behaviors), compared to the
      impact of traditional mixed-gender programs. Assessments will occur at baseline and at 1
      month, 12 months, and 24 months after admission.
