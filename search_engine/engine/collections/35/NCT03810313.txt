      approximately 76 weeks. Treatment visits will be scheduled in 4-week intervals. After 6
      initial monthly injections of brolucizumab or aflibercept (loading phase), subjects will
      enter a one-year individualized flexible treatment (IFT) phase. During the IFT phase, an
      assessment of disease stability will be performed at each monthly visit and subjects will
      receive either an active or a sham injection. Treatment with active will be interrupted when
      disease stability is reached. Maximum study duration per patient is 80 weeks.
