      depending on the series) and is associated with an increase in medical complications such as
      bronchoaspirative pneumoniae which is responsible for approximately half of the deaths that
      occur in these patients. Besides, the risk of pneumonia in patients with dysphagia is three
      times higher compared to those patients without. Since there is no drug able to restore the
      swallowing and respiratory muscle function, neurological rehabilitation apperars to be as the
      mainstay of treatment of these disorders.

      Respiratory muscle weakness is common after stroke, but how it contributes in the development
      of bronchoaspiration pneumonia is not well determined. In acute phases of stroke, the
      mechanism seems to be more related to an impaired central drive than the reduction of
      strength in respiratory muscle.

      Otherwise, the NMES aims to improve muscle strength. The NMES accelerates swallowing recovery
      since it induces brain reorganitzation after stroke through sensory and motor stimulation of
      peripheral nerves, mainly in swallowing aerea.
