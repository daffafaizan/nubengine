      prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines within the National Capital Region/Military Health
      System (NCR/MHS), with the aim of decreasing concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine
      prescribing. Both the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain
      (2017) and the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (2016) strongly
      recommend against the concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines. Taken together, these
      drugs could cause respiratory depression, enhanced sedation, and death. The intervention
      population will be prescribers and primary care managers associated with patients who have
      recently received concurrent prescriptions of opioids and benzodiazepines. Using a randomized
      approach, we will allocate the NCR/MHS providers associated with patients with concurrent
      prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines to one of two conditions:

        1. E-mail alert - A messaging approach, in which we will send encrypted emails to the
           patient's opioid and benzodiazepine prescriber(s) and primary care manager that identify
           the concurrent prescriptions and detail the patient's prescription history, inform them
           of the VA/DoD guideline and risk to patient, and provide action steps and relevant
           resources. When multiple providers are involved, the email message will also encourage
           coordination across providers and provide relevant contact information

        2. As-Usual - An as-usual approach, in which providers are not sent messages. These
           providers can access patient information through the MHS Opioid Registry as before.
