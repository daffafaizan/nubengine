      proven method of improving the signs and symptoms of meibomian gland dysfunction including
      lid margin vascularity, meibum viscosity, OSDI mean score and tear break up. This study looks
      at the safety and effect of treatment of upper lids only to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of direct upper lid treatment on the signs and symptoms of dry eye.
