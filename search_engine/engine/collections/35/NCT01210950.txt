      nonunion, osteomyelitis, and bone loss. It has been found that most difficult conditions can
      be resolved with this method. In this study the aim is to observe if mesenchymal stem cell
      transplantation can enhance new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis.Patients
      undergo bone distraction , and about 2-3 weeks after distraction mesenchymal stem cell are
      injected at the callus site. In the case of large bone gap, mesenchymal stem cells are seeded
      on bone matrix and then placed in the bone gap. Each patient is assessed at interval time of
      1 month for 6 months post surgery by X-Ray and at month 6 post surgery by computed
      tomography(CT) scans.
