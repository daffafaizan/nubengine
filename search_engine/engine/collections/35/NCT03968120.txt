      volume-controlled mode. During two-lung ventilation, VT will be set at 8 mL/kg predicted body
      weight. During one-lung ventilation, in GroupFix VT will be decreased to 6 mL/kg PBW with 5
      cmH2O PEEP.

      In GroupVar VT mechanical ventilation with constant (6 ml/kgIBW) tidal volume with variable
      PEEP with recruitment maneuvers.
