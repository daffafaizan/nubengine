      cognitive and emotional development during infancy and childhood. Low SES women face unique
      stressors and social challenges. Rates of postpartum depression are significantly higher in
      this group (23-33%) than in the general population (10-15%).

      The purpose of this study is to understand how social circumstances, women's mood, and
      parenting techniques affect infant and child development. Specifically, investigators are
      interested in finding out whether a behavioral intervention, already being administered in
      IRB approved protocol #6285, targeting maternal caregiving of young infants can increase
      infant sleep and reduce fuss/cry behavior, thereby reducing the incidence and/or severity of
      maternal depression and anxiety symptoms, improving the quality of the mother-infant
      interaction, and improving infant developmental outcomes.

      By collecting stress reports from women from low SES backgrounds during pregnancy and the
      postpartum period and by conducting follow-up observational assessments of the quality of
      mother-infant interaction, infant learning, infant cortisol reactivity, and infant
      neurocognitive development, investigators hope to identify whether this intervention can
      effectively meet these aims.
