      their residual limb. These daily changes can cause a prosthesis to fit poorly. They can also
      cause limb health problems including skin breakdown and injury to deeper tissues. Prosthetic
      socket systems that accommodate limb volume changes can help address these issues, but they
      require users to make adjustments throughout the day.

      The objective of this research is to develop and test an automatically-adjusting prosthetic
      socket system for prosthesis users. The system integrates with a range of adjustable socket
      technologies, including those that are commercially available. The system allows small size
      adjustments for both tightening and loosening the socket. In early aims of the study, the
      prosthesis will be adjusted manually, but can be controlled remotely, eliminating the need to
      remove the prosthesis or bend down to make adjustments. The system will later be enhanced to
      automatically change the fit of an adjustable socket at the appropriate times, without
      distracting the user. We hypothesize that this system will help to maintain consistent limb
      fluid volume while the prosthesis user is wearing the socket and that socket fit will be
      improved. The system functions by continuously collecting measurements from sensors within
      the socket and uses small motors to control adjustable panels in the socket wall.
