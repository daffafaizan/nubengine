      patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have been previously treated with or are
      intolerant to first line chemotherapy. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of
      this agent by assessing the disease control rate (DCR) (objective response plus prolonged
      stable disease (>16 weeks).

      The current standard therapy for patients who have advanced, metastatic or inoperable
      pancreatic cancer previously treated with or intolerant to first line chemotherapy is best
      supportive care. New treatment options are urgently needed.

      Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone protein involved in the
      stabilization of a number of membrane and intracellular proteins including HER2, BCR-ABL,
      C-SRC, EGFR, RAF, VEGFR, AKT, and RAS. Many of these proteins are highly expressed in
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      AUY922 is a novel isoxazole-based HSP90 inhibitor. AUY922 acts by inhibiting HSP90 ATPase
      activity (IC50 of 30 nm) and preventing the formation of a multichaperone complex between
      HSP90 and other heat shock proteins. This then prevents HSP90 from performing its functions
      on client proteins.
