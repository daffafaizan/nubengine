      intervention to confirm the presence and consistency of OH. During these sessions, the
      participant will lie supine on a tilt table at 0°, and, using a blood pressure cuff secured
      around the arm, the researchers will measure and record supine blood pressure. The
      researchers will then adjust the tilt table to 30° for three minutes and take and record
      another blood pressure measurement. If the participant reports no OH symptoms and the
      researchers observe no changes in appearance or signs of distress at that time, the
      researchers will query the participant about willingness to adjust the table to an additional
      10° of tilt. Following three minutes at this level, the researchers will again measure and
      record the participant's blood pressure. These procedures will continue with increments of
      10° of increased tilt every three minutes to a maximum of 90° tilt until the session time
      (maximum of 60 minutes) has elapsed or the participant expresses discomfort, measured blood
      pressure drops relative to the supine recording, or the researchers observe behaviors
      indicative of OH (e.g., sweating, change in skin color, change in breathing pattern,
      grimacing). If any of these OH symptoms occur, the researchers will adjust the tilt table to
      lower levels of incline until the participant's blood pressure stabilizes to the supine
      position measurement, and the session will be terminated.

      Intervention sessions will begin after three days of baseline measurements. Intervention
      sessions will follow the same procedures except that the conditions will alternate randomly
      among the three FES placement and the no FES conditions. All sessions will be held at Quality
      Living, Inc., in Omaha, Nebraska.
