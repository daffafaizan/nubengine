      Alcon, INC. Systane® Ultra, a non-emollient eye drop, will be compared to Systane® Complete,
      an emollient eye drop, in subjects with dry eye symptoms and lipid layer thickness < 75 nm at
      baseline in a randomized, cross-over (masked subject) design. We seek to objectively evaluate
      the increase in lipid layer thickness from baseline at 15 minutes and 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours
      after each eye drop has been instilled. Non-invasive measurements of tear break-up time will
      be also conducted at each visit. Subjects will then be dispensed the emollient eye drop
      (Systane® Complete) for use four times daily for one month and return to the study site for
      final measurements of dry eye symptoms, lipid layer thickness, and tear break-up time. The
      Stroboscopic Video Color Microscope of King-Smith is used for non-invasive lipid layer
      thickness measurement, and the Oculus Keratograph (K5M) is used for non-invasive measurements
      of tear break-up time.
