    
      Heart Failure (HF) is a syndrome where the heart is unable to pump or fill adequately to meet
      the circulatory needs of the body. The main purpose of this study is to test the ability a
      novel wearable sensor based on a smartphone app (Precordior CardioSignal app) in combination
      with a sensor device (Suunto Movesense sensor) to non-invasively measure cardiac motion and
      function. The phone and sensor are positioned on the chest and echocardiography is used as a
      gold standard to assess cardiac mechanics including myocardial strain, cardiac torsion,
      diastolic filling characteristics, hemodynamics including pressure estimates and stroke
      volume.
