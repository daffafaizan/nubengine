    
      The study was a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 110 anxious pediatric dental
      patients, of age range 7-12 years, were selected from the Pediatric Dentistry and Dental
      Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University, Egypt, after securing
      parental informed consents. Children were chosen according to the Faces version of Modified
      Child Dental Anxiety Scale scoring 26 or more.

      The participants will be randomly allocated into 2 groups: Group I: Study group and Group II:
      Control group. The patients of group I (Study group) will undergo a session of biofeedback
      regulation by using "RESPeRATETM" as an anxiety reducing method. Group II patients will be
      managed by a routine behavioral management technique "Tell,show,do". Local anesthesia
      injection will be administered to the child, after which heart rate measurement and salivary
      sample for salivary amylase analysis will be repeated.
