      populations as well as advance the public health emergency response to the community spread
      of SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially as the number of cases and deaths continues to rise in many
      geographies. A recent study conducted at The Everett Clinic showed that foam nasal swabs were
      able to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus at comparable levels to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. We now
      look to build off this work by comparing polyester foam swabs, which are more readily
      available and mass producible, to foam nasal swabs, in their sensitivity for detecting
      SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also plan to assess the viability of dry swabbing, where the swab is
      stored without saline or viral transport media (VTM) at room temperature for four days, to
      calculate the degradation of the viral sample.

      Finally, we will collect up to 50 mL/visit of blood longitudinally from patients who have
      previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at visit one, two, and four weeks following their
      initial COVID-10 diagnosis.The medical professional drawing the blood will determine if the
      patient is at an increased risk from a blood draw due to underlying conditions such as
      anemia. In these cases, the amount of blood drawn will be left to the discretion of the
      medical professional but shall not surpass 10 mL per visit.These longitudinal blood samples
      will help us gain a better understanding of the trajectory of COVID-19 (in terms of both
      clinical symptomology and viral load) and antibody development. At each visit, nasal swabs
      and blood samples will be collected, and the blood samples will be stored in a repository for
      future research.
