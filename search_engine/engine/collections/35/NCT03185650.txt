    
      Purpose: This is an early device characterization study to define the fraction of delivered
      aerosol generated by a novel nebulizer (tPAD) that deposits in conducting airways.

      Design: Open label, cross-over design, using a standard oral nebulizer (PARI LC Star) as a
      comparator. The order of visits will be randomized.

      Methods: Gamma scintigraphy will be performed following use of each device on separate study
      visits.

      Primary Outcome: Fraction of inhaled particles that clears over 24 hours.
