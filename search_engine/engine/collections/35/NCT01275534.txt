      developing various adverse side effects; also termed 'late effects'. Late effects may appear
      months or years after treatment has ended, can persist chronically and may be experienced as
      rather distressing and burdensome. Since most late effects are only experienced subjectively
      in the form of physical and mental symptoms and are seldom captured during objective
      clinician-based evaluations, using self-report instruments is important for the early
      detection, management and alleviation of these symptoms. The collection of self-report data
      in studies and clinical practice is strongly recommended by the National Cancer Institute
      (NCI): they developed a Patient-Reported Outcomes bank based on the well established Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

      Besides managing symptoms associated with late-effects, patients with SCT are also requested
      to manage their emotions associated with having a chronic illness, their new life roles in
      order to have a meaningful, fulfilling life, and their medical regimen, in view of taking
      medications, smoking cessation, regularly exercising and monitoring for signs of infection.
      However, evidence investigating the prevalence of problems related to these complex set of
      self-management tasks is scarce.

      Aims:

        -  To translate the PRO-CTCAE items into German in a culturally-sensitive way and to
           develop the content of a self-report instrument measuring symptom experience after
           allogeneic SCT

        -  To validate the newly developed scale and assess its psychometric properties

        -  To examine self reported symptom experience and objective measured late effects in 300
           adult survivors ≥ 1 year after SCT

        -  To describe self-management behaviours in 300 adult survivors ≥ 1 year after SCT

        -  To assess the relationship between symptom experience and objective burden of late
           effects, survivors' perception of late effects and self-management in view of managing
           emotions, managing new life roles and managing medical and health tasks in 300 adult
           survivors ≥ 1 year after allogeneic SCT
