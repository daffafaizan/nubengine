      impairment. To the investigators' knowledge, no trials have assessed the existence of a
      relationship between the IAH index and the cerebral arterial blood flow rate
      (macrocirculation). Developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide new insights
      into the quantitative study of blood flow through phase contrast MRI also called "flow MRI".
      The main hypothesis tested in this study is the existence of a relationship between OSAS and
      total cerebral arterial vascular inflow measured by PC-MRI (in mL/min) in the elderly
      population.

        -  Primary outcome: The apnea/hypopnea index (measured by nocturnal respiratory polygraphy)
           and total arterial flow rate (measured by PC-MRI)

        -  Secondary outcomes:

             1. Measurement of arrhythmia

             2. Measurement of arterial blood pressure
