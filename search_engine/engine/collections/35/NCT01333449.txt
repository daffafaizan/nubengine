    
      Primary endpoint:

        1. safety and tolerability of Decitabine prior to transplant (assessed by occurence of
           non-hematologic toxicities of grade 3 or more as defined by CTC grading)

        2. reduction in pre-transplant disease burden ability to achieve blast <5% in the bone
           marrow and peripheral blood

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Proportion of patients with suitable donor able to proceed to an allogeneic
           hematopoietic cell transplant.

        2. Non-relapse mortality

        3. time to neutrophil engraftment

        4. Overall survival and disease-free survival.

      Patients will receive Decitabine until blast <5% is achieved, suitable HLA-matched donor or
      umbilical cord blood is available up to a maximum of 6 cycles. Patient who progress on
      therapy or are unable to find a donor by 6 cycles will be removed from protocol. The method,
      conditioning regimen and choice of donor will be determined based on patient's age and
      functional status, and transplant physician's discretion. The available regimens are
      standardized within the center
