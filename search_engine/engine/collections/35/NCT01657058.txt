      between 8:00 am and 1:00 pm. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, including body
      weight, height, and % body fat will be taken. An initial finger prick fasting blood sample
      will be taken and a subjective appetite questionnaire in the form of a 100 mm visual analog
      scale will be completed. Subsequently, one of the 5 study meals will be administered to the
      subject to consume over a 10-15 minute duration accompanied by 300ml of water. Subjects will
      then be asked to complete a palatability questionnaire. Over the following 3 hours capillary
      blood samples will be taken by finger pricks at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes post
      treatment. Appetite and symptoms questionnaires will be completed at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90,
      and 120. At 180 min, a second standardized meal will be administered, consisting of 400kcal
      of pizza and 200ml of water. Further finger pick blood samples will be taken at 15, 30, 45,
      60 and 120 min post pizza consumption. Upon completion of the visit, subjects will be given a
      24-hour symptoms questionnaire to complete at home as an additional safety measure for a
      24-hour period.
