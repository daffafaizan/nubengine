    
      The study is a multi-site trial evaluating the efficacy of DESTRESS-PC (DElivery of
      Self-TRaining and Education for Stressful Situations, primary care version), a brief,
      web-based self-management intervention for PTSD designed for delivery in primary care.
      Participants randomized to DESTRESS-PC log on to a secure website for self-CBT 3 times per
      week for 6 weeks and receive RN nurse care manager ("DESTRESS Nurse") contact every two
      weeks. DESTRESS Nurses introduce the approach, monitor, answer questions, and insure primary
      care provider collaboration. The control intervention is optimized usual primary care.
      Blinded raters assess PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, physical health
      status, and occupational functioning at four timepoints. All study participants receive RN
      care management and are under the care of a primary care provider trained in evidence-based
      PTSD treatment who receives status reports from the DESTRESS nurse to include baseline
      psychiatric status.
