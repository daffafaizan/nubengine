      for expanding treatment access and improving outcomes for heroin dependent individuals are
      needed. Recently completed research demonstrated that so-called "Interim Methadone
      Maintenance" (i.e., methadone with crisis counseling only, for individuals on waiting lists)
      was associated with greater entry into methadone treatment, less self-reported heroin and
      cocaine use, lower rates of opioid-positive drug tests, and lower rates of self-reported
      crime. The present study will build on this work by comparing three levels of counseling
      provided with methadone treatment: 1)"Interim" Methadone Treatment; 2) "Comprehensive"
      Methadone Treatment (which is the name for the usual amount of counseling provided, i.e.,
      about once per week) and; 3)"Restored" Methadone Treatment in which the counselors will have
      a lower case load and will be able to provide more attention to their patients.
