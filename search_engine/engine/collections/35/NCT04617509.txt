      single oral dose of two different formulations of GS-248 in fasting conditions. Part II will
      evaluate PK, safety and tolerability of one of the two different formulations of GS-248 in
      fed conditions.

      In Part I, a single oral dose of GS-248 in two different solid formulations will be
      administered to 14 healthy subjects. All subjects will first receive Formulation A and then
      Formulation B. A wash-out period of at least 4 days will be applied between the IMP
      administrations. Both doses contain 120 mg GS 248. For Part I, subjects will come to the
      clinic for single dose administration of Formulation A or Formulation B, respectively, and PK
      and safety assessments. Safety assessments include AE reporting, physical examination, ECG,
      vital signs, body temperature, and blood sampling for analysis of safety laboratory
      parameters.

      After evaluation of the PK profiles of Formulation A and B in Part I of the study, one
      formulation will be selected to be given following intake of a standardised breakfast in Part
      II of the study. Subjects will return to the clinic for a second dose of the selected
      formulation, yet now in fed conditions. The assessments during fed conditions will be the
      same as during fasting conditions except that the subjects will consume a high-fat
      high-calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to IMP administration.
