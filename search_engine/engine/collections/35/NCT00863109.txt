      fatigue, anxiety, and depression. These symptoms negatively affect patients' functional
      health, ability to work, self-perceived health, HRQL and well-being. Psychosocial issues and
      reduced HRQL are frequently experienced by HCV patients. HCV patients have more HRQL
      impairment than the general population. There is some evidence that HCV patients who
      experience greater fatigue, greater psychiatric symptoms, and poorer HRQL are more likely to
      discontinue treatment prematurely, with a negative impact on virological response. In
      addition to well-known side effects of interferon, one important determinant of HRQL during
      anti-viral therapy for HCV is development of RBV-induced anemia. Treatment of anemia improves
      HRQL, potentially impacting adherence to antiviral regimen and improving virologic response.
      These issues emphasize the importance of investigating the physical and psychosocial
      experiences and HRQL of HCV patients.

      The sample size of the study must allow evaluating HRQL of HCV patients based on the SF-36
      before PEG treatment and at each of the following study visits.

      To be able to detect differences of or over 4.2 points in the vitality dimension between the
      basal visit and following visits, estimating a standard deviation of 22 points, a statistical
      power of 80%, and a level of significance of 0.05, 216 patients will be needed. Considering a
      loss of follow up of 15%, a total of 238 patients are planned for this study.
