      predominant breastfeeding, often fall short of the recommended practice advised by the World
      Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Despite increasing awareness of
      the many advantages of breastfeeding the challenge remains to implement programs that can
      effectively improve short and long-term breastfeeding rates.

      The Singapore National Breastfeeding Survey 2001 (Foo et al, 2005) demonstrated an
      encouraging breastfeeding initiation rate of 94.5%. However only 21.1% continued to
      breastfeed at 6 months with fewer than 5% breastfeeding exclusively.

      The formal preparation of expectant mothers for breastfeeding is not part of routine
      antenatal care in many practices. We feel that it may prove beneficial especially in an
      environment with a low prevalence of breastfeeding. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate
      the impact of single-encounter antenatal education combining educational material with
      individual instruction, on breastfeeding initiation and duration and on infant feeding
      practice, compared with routine antenatal care and educational material alone in a tertiary
      hospital setting.

      401 women are randomized into 3 predetermined groups and are exposed to specific antenatal
      education materials targeting breastfeeding techniques; the control group receives routine
      antenatal care. Data regarding breastfeeding rate, quality and duration is collected over a 1
      year period.

      Comparisons: breastfeeding initiation rate, duration and type among women receiving lactation
      counseling with educational material, educational material without individual counseling, and
      routine antenatal care without educational intervention
