      antibacterial stewardship to reduce selective pressure and improve patient outcomes. The
      Institute of Medicine has identified antibiotic resistance as one of the key microbial
      threats to health in the United States and has prioritized decreasing inappropriate use of
      antimicrobials as the primary solution to address this threat. The emergence of carbapenem
      resistance among Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in the United States represents a recent and severe
      byproduct of excessive antimicrobial use with a high mortality rate in bacteremia. A major
      barrier toward decreasing use of antimicrobials is lack of sensitive and accurate rapid
      diagnostic tests for identifying bacterial etiologies of infection.
