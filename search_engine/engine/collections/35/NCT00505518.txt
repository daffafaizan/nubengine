      experiencing depression. After meeting with the Principal Investigator (a psychiatrist), he
      will collaborate with the primary care physician and the nursing home staff to establish a
      treatment plan for the patient. Videoconferencing will be used by the P.I. for regular
      psychiatric visits with the patient as well as meetings with the nursing home staff to
      coordinate care for the patient. After collaboration between the two groups, treatment
      suggestions will be given to the patient's primary care physician (PCP) to implement in the
      primary care setting. The patient's symptomology, mood, satisfaction of life and side effects
      of medication will be recorded regularly to measure the effects of treatment for analysis.
