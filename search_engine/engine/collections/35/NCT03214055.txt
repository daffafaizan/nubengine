      diameter is used to evaluate intracranial pressure noninvasively. Robot-assisted laparoscopic
      radical prostatectomy can induce an increase in optic nerve sheath diameter due to
      Trendelenburg position and carbon dioxide insufflation. We therefore aim to evaluate the
      change in optic nerve sheath diameters before and after mannitol administration in patients
      who undergo robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.
