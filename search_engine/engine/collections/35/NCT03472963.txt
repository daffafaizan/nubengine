      majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to the rectal mucosa through unprotected receptive
      anal intercourse. Post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP) is an intervention that is used to prevent
      HIV infection soon (72 hours) after a potential exposure. HIV-negative people with a possible
      exposure to HIV are instructed to take 28 days of a combination anti-HIV medication regimen,
      Truvada® + Raltegravir. This study is being conducted to determine if the uptake of other
      anti-HIV medications called Genvoya® and darunavir is different at several body sites,
      including mucosal tissues. These other medications might be considered for PEP regimens in
      the future.
