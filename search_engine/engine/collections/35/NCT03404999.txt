      combination with high BMI/overweight/obesity) and more frequent follow-up are associated with
      weight-status improvement in overweight (OW) children, (2) that parents rank checking for
      weight-related health problems as the #1 most important recommended weight-management
      clinical practice, but that (3) comorbidities are infrequently addressed. Thus, to improve
      weight status, interventions are needed to improve comorbidity identification, evaluation,
      and management in primary care. Because the investigators' data suggest that identification
      of high blood pressure is particularly poor, and that identifying blood-pressure elevations
      in young children at three separate encounters is complex, they are using existing
      underutilized data to automate addressing high blood pressure/hypertension in an electronic
      health record system (EPIC-based), and, if successful, applying the method to other
      obesity-related comorbidities in primary care.

      OF NOTE: in developing and pilot-testing this decision support tool, providers wanted access
      to it for patients without overweight/obesity. Thus, although the trial was borne out of work
      in weight-management research, the initial trial will focus on all children irrespective of
      weight status.
