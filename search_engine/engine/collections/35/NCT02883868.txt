      They all underwent the same procedure: accelerated-CXL protocol (10 minutes UVA irradiation
      with 9 mW/cm2 intensity), irradiation device (IROC UV-Xâ„¢ 2000, Medeuronet). One month after
      the procedure, AS-OCT examination was performed in all patients (RS-3000, NIDEK). The
      visibility of the stromal demarcation line was scored (0: not visible line; 1: visible line,
      but measurement not clearly defined; 2: clearly visible line) and its depth was measured
      centrally at anytime it was possible. Changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      spherical equivalent (SE), Kmax and thinnest pachymetry, were studied preoperatively and at 6
      months
