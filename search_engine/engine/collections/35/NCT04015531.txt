      conventional radiotherapy in breast cancer patients undergoing regional nodal irradiation.

      Eligible breast cancer patients are randomized 1:1 into the following two groups:

        1. Hypofractionated therapy: 40 Gy in 15 fractions of 2.67 Gy in breast or chest wall and
           nodal drainage with Concurrent boost 48.0 Gy / 3.2 Gy daily in tumor bed, in case of
           conservative surgery;

        2. Standard fractionation: 50 Gy in 25 fractions in breast or chest wall and nodal drainage
           with sequential tumor bed boost with 10 Gy in 5 fractions in tumor bed in case of
           conservative surgery.

      Patients will be followed for 6 months after radiotherapy to evaluate acute toxicity and
      quality of life.
