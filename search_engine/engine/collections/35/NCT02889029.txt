    
      Study design: Prospective monocentric feasibility study

      Arm number or label and arm type: Only one experimental arm

      Interventions:

      After signature of a informed consent

      Collection of clinical data (age, sex, etiology, site and mechanism of the stenosis, previous
      treatments dyspnea, quality of life (VQ11 questionnaire))

      Chest CT-scan without contrast under continuous positive pressure

      Spirometry (peak flow, FEV1)

      Computer-assisted modelization of the shape of the prosthesis using 3D reconstruction of
      CT-scan

      Machining of the shape in Ertacetal® (AnatomikModeling®)

      Fabrication and sterilization of the stent in silicon (Sebbin®)

      Insertion of the stent under rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia

      Clinical follow-up at one week, 3 months and 6 months

      Chest CT-scan without contrast at 1 week, spirometry at 1 week and 6 months

      Number of subjects : 10 patients

      Statistical analysis:

      For the primary outcome, percentages of procedures conducted without complication at 1 week,
      3 months, and 6 months and their confidence interval at 95% and incidences at 1 week, 3
      months and 6 months for each complication will be calculated.

      For secondary outcomes:

        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of dyspnea (improvement of at least
           one point of NYHA score) at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months and their confidence interval
           at 95% will be calculated.

        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of quality of life (improvement of
           at least 10% of VQ11 score) at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months and their confidence
           interval at 95% will be calculated.

        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of functional parameters
           (improvement of at least 20% of DEP or FEV1) at 1 week and 6 months and their confidence
           interval at 95% will be calculated.

        -  Percentage of procedures conducted with radiologic congruence of the stent at 1 week and
           its confidence interval at 95% will be calculated.
