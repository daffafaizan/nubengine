      Humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from several sources. Gamma-radiation exposure
      induces thereby both short- and long-term adverse effects. The radiation injuries to be
      expected in humans in the acute stage (days to some weeks after radiation exposure) correlate
      with the radiation dose that the individual has received. With very high doses
      gastrointestinal syndrome leads to death within a few days. The survival of the individual in
      the acute stage is therefore dramatically dependent on the rapid application of suitable
      therapies. It is decisive here to identify in the shortest possible time those persons who
      have been exposed to a critical radiation dose and to estimate the dose received in order to
      apply an adequate therapy. There are no satisfying test methods available today, which would
      enable the mass screening for radiation injury.

      Furthermore to identify changes in the local or systemic human metabolic fingerprint, which
      are useful for the prediction of the individual sensitivity of patients to radiotherapy and /
      or lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in radiotherapy.

      Objective

      Primary: The primary endpoint is to affirm the results from the animal model in radiation
      metabolomics in human radiotherapy treatment.

      Secondary: The secondary endpoints are to find new potential biomarkers for radiation
      biodosimetry in humans and to identify changes in the different sequences in measuring from
      local (sebum) and systemic (blood, saliva and urine) material.

      Methods

      Gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection of the metabolites present in
      a given matrix (urine, saliva, plasma, sebum).
