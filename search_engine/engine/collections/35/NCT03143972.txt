      remifentanil is clinically useful to provide anesthesia during surgical and diagnostic
      procedures and whether it could be used for anesthetic induction. Furthermore the aim is to
      gain better insights in the required dosing regimens, the inter-individual variability in
      response towards the combination and the associated side effects. Better characterization of
      this drug-drug interaction will presumably lead to more precise dosing regimens, which in
      turn, will lead to a reduction in the occurrence of oversedation, side effects and recovery
      times.

      The objective is to map the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic interaction between
      dexmedetomidine and remifentanil by observing changes in anesthetic depth, measured by
      hypnotic and analgesic endpoints such as modified observer's assessment of alertness and
      sedation scale (MOAA/S), response to electrical stimuli, response to laryngoscopy and
      electroencephalogram (EEG) derived indices. These effects will be related to drug
      concentrations using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modeling.
