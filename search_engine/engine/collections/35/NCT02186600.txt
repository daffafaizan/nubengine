      structure, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover in women with low bone mass who are
      within 5 years of menopause. Women will be randomized to one control and 2 treatment groups
      (n =103 per group): 1) calcium + vitamin D (CaD) alone (Control); 2) Bisphosphonate (BP) plus
      optimal CaD (Risedronate); and 3) a bone loading exercise program plus optimal CaD
      (Exercise). Our central hypothesis is that improvements in bone health will be greater in
      subjects randomized to the exercise group compared to subjects in either the control or
      risedronate groups. Specific Aims: Aims 1, 2, and 3 are to compare control, risedronate, and
      exercise group subjects on changes in bone structure at the tibia and hip (measured by pQCT
      and Hip Structural Analysis) (Aim 1) ; on changes in BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and
      spine (Aim 2); and on changes in serum markers of bone formation and resorption (Aim 3). In
      addition, Aim 4 will explore relationships between adherence to exercise (% sessions
      attended) or adherence to risedronate (% pills taken) and changes in bone structure.
