      controlled dialysis conditions in the proposed clinical PK study.

      Nalbuphine is a small molecular weight, water-soluble molecule with low protein binding
      (approximately 50%) and a large volume of distribution. In addition, its disposition is
      perfusion-rate limited. In the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on HD, nalbuphine
      plasma clearance may be impacted, although it is predominantly hepatically cleared in the
      feces.

      A dose-escalation design was selected to mimic nalbuphine use in uremic pruritus (UP)
      patients in subsequent clinical efficacy studies whereby patients will start at a low dose to
      minimize the AEs such as nausea and vomiting and allow the patients to develop some tolerance
      to these particular AEs.
