      threat, which could be a result of intrinsic hyper-connectivity in the defensive systems. In
      the present study, healthy subjects' trait anxiety levels will be assessed by the sub-trait
      inventory of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Then two experiments using resting-state fMRI
      technique will be conducted to first map how hubs in the defensive systems organized in high
      anxious individuals in a stimuli-free situation (Experiment 1) and then we will examine the
      modulatory effect of the intranasal administration of oxytocin on functional connectivity in
      these independently defined defensive networks (Experiment 2).
