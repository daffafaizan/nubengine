      the active dose 95 (the dose that reduces muscle force by 95%). At this dosage, curarization
      of the laryngeal adductors allowing relaxation and abduction (opening) of the vocal cords is
      considered certain. With atracurium, the dose for intubation is 0.5 mg.kg-1 and the time to
      full effect is approximately 3 minutes. With the use of newer hypnotics, there are no data
      evaluating the conditions for intubation after a fixed time of 3 minutes as with current
      anesthetic practices.
