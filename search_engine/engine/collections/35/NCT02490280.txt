      salivary cortisol (a marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity or HPA activity) and
      alpha amylase (a marker of autonomic nervous system activity or ANS activity) in a sample of
      healthy controls. Data from these healthy controls will be compared in the future to
      clinically anxious youth. In this study, participants are asked to complete a one-time
      assessment consisting of interviews, questionnaires, and a behavioral task (called the Trier
      Social Stress Task) involving a short public speaking task and an arithmetic task in front of
      study staff. Throughout the behavioral task, study staff will collect four, small saliva
      samples using a straw-like tube from each participant. The assessment will take approximately
      3 hours. Participants will be fully debriefed regarding the purposes of the stress procedure
      and assessed for any signs of residual distress. Since there is no treatment or
      randomization, blinding of study staff is not applicable. Participation in this study will
      not affect any current or future medical or psychiatric treatment.

      AIMS: To examine whether a) salivary cortisol and alpha amylase response and recovery to the
      Trier Social Stress Task is associated with anxiety in non-psychiatrically ill participants.
