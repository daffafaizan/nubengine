      1000 mg could improve clinical course of COVID-19 by its dual action: 1.direct inhibition of
      SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as 2.modulation of innate immune response - 2a. its initial
      (hyper)inflammation as well as 2b. later reparative phase, respectively.

      Moreover, the drug is known for its safety and has been approved and widely used in the
      region for liver diseases. Therefore, the investigation was set out to determine the efficacy
      of silymarin (compound closely related to Silibinin which is available in the region) in
      improving the outcome of a liver disease and of COVID-19, respectively.
