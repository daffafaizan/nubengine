           improvements in their risk factor profile than those in the control group at two years.

        2. To determine whether the net-present value intervention will enable patients to sustain
           behavioral change over the long-term.

        3. To determine whether the net-present value intervention will improve overall functional
           status and prevent further disability.

      The long-term objective of this study is to determine whether a net-present value approach
      for motivation behavior change is effective in reducing risk factors, improving treatment
      outcomes, and enhancing quality of life among a high-risk group of patients.
