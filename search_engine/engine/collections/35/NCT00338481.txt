      such as morphine is the mainstay of symptomatic treatment. Subcutaneous administration of
      morphine provides fast symptomatic relief, but it has been the impression in our institution
      that "red morphine drops" applied orally may have equal or better efficacy and faster onset
      time.

      Comparison: Patients with lung cancer or lung metastases with moderate to severe dyspnea at
      rest are treated with either orally applied "red morphine drops" or an equivalent amount of
      morphine applied subcutaneously.
