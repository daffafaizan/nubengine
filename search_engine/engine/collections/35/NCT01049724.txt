      stimulating mitogenesis in human corneal epithelial cells and promoting production of tears
      in lacrimal gland acinar cells. A recently developed immunoassay for lacritin may help
      characterize the lacritin response following refractive surgery with the possible development
      of recombinant lacritin as a novel therapeutic agent for wound healing. Heparanase (HPSE)
      acts as a regulator for lacritin by cleaving heparan sulfate chains and allowing lacritin to
      bind. We aim to measure both tear lacritin and HPSE pre- and post-operatively to elucidate
      lacritin and HPSE's response in patients undergoing PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) and
      LASIK (Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) at the Walter Reed Center for Refractive
      Surgery.
