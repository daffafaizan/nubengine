      assigned to a ten days of ketogenic diet (KD), calorie-restricted ketogenic-mediterranean
      diet (KEMEPHY) or Mediterranean diet (MD). All subjects will begin the prescribed diet at the
      beginning of their follicular phase. Body composition, fasting blood glucose and
      Î²-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), visual analogue scale (VAS) to test appetite as well as
      psychological tests (one mood test and two cognitive tasks) will be obtained 5 days before
      the beginning and on the last day of the diet-period.
