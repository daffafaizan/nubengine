      condom use are needed. Interventions should be low cost and accessible to large segments of
      the at-risk population. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention
      designed to increase condom use in at-risk, heterosexually active women and men. The
      intervention is computer-delivered and will be provided in health care settings. The study
      will also examine additional psychosocial mediators of condom use by testing the predictive
      efficacy of the Multifaceted Model of HIV Risk.

      Participants will be recruited from four health clinic sites that serve local ethnic minority
      communities. The participants will be randomly assigned to either an individualized
      intervention designed to increase condom use or to an HIV information comparison group. All
      participants will receive comparable group-specific informational materials at study entry
      and at Months 2 and 4. Participants in the intervention group will receive individualized
      feedback and specially-tailored manuals. Participants in the HIV information comparison group
      will receive general HIV information feedback and the best-available informational manual.

      Assessments for both groups will be conducted at study entry and at Months 6, 12, and 18. At
      study entry, participants will complete paper and pencil questionnaires lasting about 30
      minutes. There will also be computer question sessions at study entry and at Months 2 and 4.
      Participants will be asked about condom use, contraceptive use, risk behaviors, sexual
      transmitted disease (STD) history, and personal relationships. Telephone follow-ups at Months
      6, 12, and 18 will take approximately 20 to 30 minutes.
