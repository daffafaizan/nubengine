      hospitalized with influenza A or B infections involving the lower respiratory tract. Patients
      will be randomized to either oseltamivir and adjunctive sirolimus or oseltamivir alone and
      assessed with reference to normalization of respiratory status (SaO2 ≥93% or respiratory rate
      ≤20/min on room air) as the primary endpoint,10 cytokines/chemokines and pro-inflammatory
      mediator changes, viral clearance, symptom resolution, ICU admission/death, day 28 mortality;
      safety profiles will also be assessed.

      The investigators hypothesize that addition of sirolimus to oseltamivir would improve
      respiratory status and other endpoints more effectively than oseltamivir alone through
      reduction of inflammatory responses without affecting viral clearance.
