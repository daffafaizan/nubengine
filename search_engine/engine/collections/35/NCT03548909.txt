      populations. Patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) and patients presenting to
      outpatient centers will be approached for enrollment.

      Clinical and laboratory data will be collected to demonstrate product performance compared to
      adjudicated clinical diagnosis. Approximately 4300 evaluable subjects at geographically
      dispersed sites in the US will be enrolled in the study.

      Sample collection and testing of clinical samples with the VITROS NT-proBNP II assay will be
      performed under two separate protocols.
