      directed physiotherapy with a focus on motor function and active motor learning principles to
      enhance motor function in children with CP. For this study, the investigators want to do a
      feasibility study, to see if taking the drug metformin for 16 weeks while doing physiotherapy
      leads to better gross motor function (i.e. controlled body movements) and thinking skills
      when compared to doing physiotherapy alone.

      Participants in both groups will receive goal-directed, active physiotherapy twice a week
      during the same 16 weeks intervention period.

      This study will be done at two different locations in Toronto 1) Holland Bloorview Kids
      Rehabilitation Hospital and 2) the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids). Each participant
      will be asked to go to both hospitals to do different tests and assessments for the study.
      Fifty participants with bilateral spastic CP age 5 to 12 with evidence of white matter
      imaging (WMI) and gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels II-V will be
      recruited for participation. MRI, cognitive testing and questionnaires will be conducted at
      SickKids where paediatric protocols and processes have been developed.
