      competency-based education which has demonstrated its efficacy for skills acquisition and
      their transfer to actual settings. While traditional education defines fixed learning time
      and allows outcomes to vary, in mastery learning, all trainees must achieve a predefined
      level of proficiency while their learning time can vary. The main limitation of mastery
      learning is that it takes more time than non-mastery learning. This is of concern because the
      main barrier to simulation-based training is the lack of faculty time. Thus, new solutions
      should emerge to conciliate mastery learning and time constraints on physical simulators.

      Pre-training with a "simulation game" may be a mean to reach this objective. Simulation games
      are serious games which are at the cross roads between (1) educational games which are
      "applications using the characteristics of video and computer games to create engaging and
      immersive learning experiences", and (2) simulation, the imitation of situations which can be
      encountered in real-life. They combine the advantages of educational games (active,
      personalized learning) and simulation (realistic and safe environment for experiential
      learning). By contrast, pre-training with an online course using a PowerPoint presentation
      with voiceover narration lecture is both passive and abstract.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the time-efficiency of pre-training using a
      simulation game versus an online course to reach mastery learning in the management of an
      adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
