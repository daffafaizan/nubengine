    
      This study will be a clinical prospective study. It is observational for all aims except with
      regard to the Meditation Intervention, which will be limited to 100 pectus and 100 spine
      participants (randomized to 50/50 in each arm). We will recruit 600 qualifying participants
      over the study period to acquire the necessary data to derive a predictive model matching
      phenotype to genotype. This study will not interfere with the standard anesthetic or
      perioperative care except for blood sampling from an indwelling line, and the use of
      additional integrative health procedures (focused-attention meditation guidance, as well as
      routine massage and breathing techniques) for the randomized meditation group. Research staff
      will administer psychosocial and somatosensory assessments, as well as record relevant data
      from participant's medical records. Integrative health will assist in teaching
      focused-attention meditation to the randomized meditation participants in the preoperative
      phase. Actigraphy devices will be provided to all participants, and MUSETM to those in the
      randomized meditation group. The pain team, in accordance with the Pectus Pain Management
      Protocol, will direct perioperative pain management.
