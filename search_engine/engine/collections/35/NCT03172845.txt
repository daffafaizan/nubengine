      baseline coronary angiography, baseline OCT and percutaneous coronary intervention will be
      studied. OCT is used to assess the prevalence of vulnerable plaque, its location at
      bifurcation lesions and compare vulnerable plaque related major adverse cardiovascular events
      (MACE) during one-year follow-up in bifurcation lesions between patients with vulnerable
      plaque and those without. Relationship between endothelial shear stress and vulnerable
      plaque. Relationship between bifurcation angle and vulnerable plaque.

      Group A: presence of vulnerable plaque at the bifurcation Group B: absence of vulnerable
      plaque at the bifurcation Documentation of immediate post stent OCT and 12 months follow up
      angiography with OCT will be performed. Immediate post stent OCT to assess successful stent
      implantation and after 12 months follow up to document year major adverse cardiovascular
      events (MACE) included myocardial infraction, cardiac death and clinically driven target
      lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis.
