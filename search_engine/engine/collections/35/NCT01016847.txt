      screening visit (visit 1). During run-in subjects will have all usual asthma medications
      discontinued and will be placed on inhaled corticosteroids at moderate doses and leukotriene
      receptor antagonists will be withdrawn (LTRA wash-out). Subjects will be monitored to rule
      out any acute infection or symptoms consistent with an exacerbation. The run-in period will
      be used to assess subject compliance and understanding of study related procedures. Following
      the run-in, to be eligible for the randomization subjects must have an ACQ score >1.25 on the
      Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire.
