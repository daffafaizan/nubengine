      hypoxemia. Treatment with invasive ventilation improves oxygenation yet results in death in
      over 50% of cases. The high incidence of disease has also reduced resources needed to safely
      deliver invasive ventilation including mechanical ventilators and intravenous sedation.
      Non-invasive respiratory support has been shown to be efficacious in acute hypoxemic
      respiratory failure from other etiologies and has the potential to reduce rates of intubation
      and the time spent on mechanical ventilation in COVID-19. However, it is unknown which type
      of support is the most effective, limiting the ability to improve clinical outcomes and
      appropriately allocate resources. To help guide clinical practice and policy, it is critical
      to understand the comparative effectiveness of two forms of non-invasive respiratory support
      used worldwide, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered via a helmet interface
      and high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO).
