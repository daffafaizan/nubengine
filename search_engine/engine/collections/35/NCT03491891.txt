      coronary intervention with stent implantation for acute coronary syndrome. Multiple aspects
      including clinical, angiographic, procedural characteristics , intravascular imaging results
      and blood samples were collected at index PCI and the time of VLST or CAG during follow-up,
      in order to reveal the potential mechanisms or risk factors that contribute to the
      development of VLST.
