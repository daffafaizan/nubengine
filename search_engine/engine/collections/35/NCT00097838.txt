      responsible for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in southern Africa. Thus, development of a preventive
      subtype C vaccine is critically important in controlling the spread of HIV in this part of
      the world. This study will determine the safety and immunogenicity of an alphavirus replicon
      HIV-1 subtype C gag vaccine, AVX101, in HIV uninfected adults. This vaccine utilizes a
      propagation-defective replicon vector system derived from an attenuated strain of Venezuelan
      Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus. The vaccine replicon expresses the gag gene from a South
      African subtype C isolate of HIV-1. Participants will be recruited in the United States,
      South Africa, and Botswana.

      The study will last for 1 year. Participants will be enrolled sequentially, from lowest to
      highest dose of vaccine, into one of four groups. Groups will begin enrollment only following
      safety review of the previous group. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive active
      vaccine or placebo. During the study, participants will receive either 3 injections of one of
      four possible doses of the vaccine or 3 injections of placebo. Injections will be given at
      study entry and at Days 28 and 84. At screening, participants will undergo medical history
      assessment, a complete physical, HIV testing and counseling, and blood and urine collection;
      they will also be interviewed and asked to complete a questionnaire. After screening, there
      will be 8 study visits; the visits will occur at Days 14, 28, 42, 84, 98, 168, 273, and 364.
      Participants will be interviewed and asked to fill out a questionnaire at each study visit;
      participants will undergo a physical, additional HIV testing and counseling, and blood and
      urine collection at selected visits.
