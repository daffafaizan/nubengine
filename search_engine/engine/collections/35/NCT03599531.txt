    
      This is a prospective pilot study of participants who have stable coronary heart disease
      (CHD). Objectives of this study are to understand whether CVD Secondary Risk Panel scores
      change from baseline to follow-up (4-12 months after baseline) and actions taken, if any,
      based upon the results. Participants are surveyed to learn what the test results mean to them
      and assess if the results affect adherence to therapy and lifestyle choices (diet, exercise,
      alcohol, and tobacco use). In addition, this study will investigate the characteristics of
      patients that physicians choose to test with the CVD Secondary Risk Panel, and what actions
      the care team takes because of the results of the test. Medical treatment decisions and
      recommendations are confirmed by established clinical methods, including blood pressure
      monitoring, BMI, lipid and CRP measurements, and physician's clinical judgement. Chart
      abstractions and participants surveys occur at the baseline and follow-up visits, and charts
      may be abstracted annually for up to 10 years post enrollment.
