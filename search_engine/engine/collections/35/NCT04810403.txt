      increased eating pathology in correlational designs and that specific aspects of social media
      use cause increases in risk factors for eating disorders. The aim of the current project is
      to determine whether social media use can be altered to cause decreases in eating disorder
      risk factors. To accomplish this, college women will be recruited to participate in an open
      trial of a pilot program that adapts activities used within evidence-based eating disorder
      prevention programs to be used on social media platforms. The intervention is designed to
      target internalization of the thin ideal.
