    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of oral rociletinib at 500 mg BID and 625 mg BID compared with that of single-agent
      cytotoxic chemotherapy, in patients with previously treated mutant EGFR NSCLC. Eligible
      patients are those with mutant EGFR NSCLC previously treated with at least 1 EGFR inhibitor
      and at least 1 line of platinum-containing chemotherapy doublet for advanced/metastatic
      NSCLC.

      After providing informed consent to participate and screening to confirm eligibility,
      patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either oral rociletinib 500 mg BID, oral
      rociletinib 625 mg BID, or single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy (investigator choice of
      pemetrexed, gemcitabine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel; choice of chemotherapy agent must be
      specified before randomization).
