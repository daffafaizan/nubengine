      tobacco products (up to 134 per group) will be recruited from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
      This research will be conducted at the Tobacco Research Programs at the University of
      Minnesota. Subjects are screened for eligibility over the phone. If eligible after the phone
      screen, participants will be invited to attend orientation screening visit in the clinic
      where consent will be obtained and subjects will complete forms about their tobacco and
      e-cigarette use and medical history. Subjects who eligible will be asked to return for six
      visits over the course of six months.

      At these appointments, subjects will provide biological specimen samples (buccal cells, urine
      and blood). Saliva will be collected before and after a smoking or vaping session. Non-users
      will only have 1 saliva collection.

      Subjects will be asked for information pertaining to and e-cigarette and tobacco use and
      overall health.
