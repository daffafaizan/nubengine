    
      This study used a mixed between- and within-subjects design to investigate the separate and
      combined effects of sensorimotor replacement for smoking (very low nicotine content [VLNC]
      cigarettes vs. no cigarettes) and transdermal nicotine replacement (42 mg nicotine [NIC] vs.
      placebo [PLA] patches) in smokers with schizophrenia and control smokers without psychiatric
      illness. Each session contained a 5-h controlled administration period in which participants
      underwent the following conditions, in counterbalanced order: VLNC + NIC, VLNC + PLA, no
      cigarettes + NIC, no cigarettes + PLA, Usual Brand cigarettes + no patches. Next,
      participants completed measures of cigarette craving, nicotine withdrawal, smoking habit
      withdrawal, cigarette subjective effects, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive task performance
      followed by a 90-min period of ad libitum usual-brand smoking.
