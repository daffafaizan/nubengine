    
      This study will be a prospective, unblinded, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase
      II/III study with 2 segments, i.e. a PK evaluation (Segment I), and an assessment of
      prophylaxis in surgical interventions and pregnancy/delivery, (Segment II). During the PK
      segment, the subjects would remain on their current anticoagulation therapy except for
      subjects on heparin therapy where a wash-out period of at least 5 half lives would be
      required. In total, 15 subjects with congenital ATIII Deficiency will be enrolled for the PK
      assessment (Segment I).

      For Segment II, fifteen episodes will be treated. Recruitment of individual subjects with
      high risk for venous thrombosis for Segment II of this study is necessary because of the
      rarity of Antithrombin deficiency in the population.
