      intratympanic AM-111 injections in the treatment of severe to profound idiopathic sudden
      sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). The active pharmaceutical ingredient of AM-111 is the
      JNK inhibitor (D-JNKI-1), a synthetic peptide consisting of 31 D-amino acids, which acts as a
      c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) ligand.
