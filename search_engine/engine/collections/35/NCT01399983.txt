      on both days a traditional test will be performed and additionally a test with more effort or
      with less effort. The order of the tests will be randomized. These two days of the
      examinations should be within a maximum of three months, provided that there is no sign of
      relevant clinical changes. After every minute the walking distance is determined. Heart rate
      and the O2 saturation are measured by pulsoxymetry during the whole test. Every two minutes
      the patients are asked about their dyspnea (Borg scale).

      The purpose of the present study is to standardize the test by the incorporation of objective
      factors and to detect the correlation between the walking distance and the level of effort
      during exercise. The investigators expect that the reliability and objectivity of 6MW may
      increase by the standardization.

      The additionally performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing helps to evaluate and stratify
      patients.
