    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate device efficacy between the HelixAR
      Electrosurgical Generator (HEG) and Conventional Electrosurgical Coagulation (CEC) Systems
      for cutting and/or coagulation of tissue during mastectomy procedures and reconstructive
      surgery.

      The study is designed and powered to demonstrate the superiority of the HEG to CEC in
      relation to a key efficacy measure: post-mastectomy procedure time to hemostasis. Secondary
      outcome measures include: infection, drain duration, total drain output, blood loss, and
      device related adverse events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled population
      undergoing mastectomy procedures.
