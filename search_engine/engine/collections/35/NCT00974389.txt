        -  To evaluate giving S-1 with bevacizumab to see how well it works as third-line therapy
           in KRAS-mutation patients with unresectable or recurrent colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral S-1 twice daily on days 1-28 and bevacizumab IV on days 1, 15,
      and 29. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
