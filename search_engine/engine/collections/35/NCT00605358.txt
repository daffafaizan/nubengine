      conduct a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of a brief, psychosocial
      intervention on engagement in mental health care among homebound depressed older adults.
      Engagement is defined as accepting a referral and attending a visit with a provider who could
      provide traditional mental health care (medication or psychotherapy). The intervention, now
      called Open Door, was developed to work collaboratively with an older adult who has
      depressive symptoms to address the barriers to care with the aim of helping them consider a
      referral and engage in mental health care. In prior research, this intervention has been
      found to improve treatment participation, reduce depressive symptoms and increase adherence
      to antidepressant therapy among depressed older adults in primary care and outpatient
      psychiatric settings. We propose that Open Door will improve the access to mental health care
      by reducing psychological barriers, providing education about care, and managing the
      resignation associated with the symptoms of depression among community dwelling depressed
      elders. Additionally, we believe that despite the heterogeneity of mental health care that
      may be received, Open Door will be associated with reduced depressive symptoms by empowering
      the older adult to initiate care for him/herself.
