      treat high blood pressure based on an individual person's specific characteristics.
      Information from a blood test called plasma renin activity will be entered into an on-line
      app that may more precisely determine which medication should be used to treat high blood
      pressure than random selection. Renin is a substance in the body that is known to affect your
      blood pressure. By measuring plasma renin activity, and using that to select a blood pressure
      lowering medication it may help to more precisely select medications based on how an
      individual will respond.
