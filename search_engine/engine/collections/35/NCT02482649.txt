    
      This study is designed as a 12-week, prospective, open labeled trial, including 24 sessions
      of EAA/T. Forty six subjects will be aasigned 12 weeks of EAA/T or drug therapy, and various
      clinical tests will be administered at baseline and after EAA/T or drug therapy. Assessments
      included the investigator-administered ADHD-Rating Scale (ARS-I), Clinical Global Impressions
      - Severity scale (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scale (CGI-I), Gordon
      Diagnostic System (GDS), Korea-Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL), Self-Esteem Scale (SES),
      Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency, second edition (BOT-2), and quantitative
      electroencephalography (QEEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) study. This
      study has two objectives. The first objective is to investigate clinical effects of
      equine-assisted activities and therapy (EAA/T) for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). For this one, we determine the treatment response rate as the primary
      outcome measure. The treatment response is defined as â‰¥ 30% decline than baseline in the
      ARS-I score or in CGI-I scores of 1 or 2 to endpoint. The second objective is to compare the
      clinical effect of EAA/T and drug therapy in children with ADHD.
