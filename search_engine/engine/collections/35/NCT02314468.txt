      skin as treatment options for wound bed preparation in wounds resulting from necrotising soft
      tissue infection.

      Methodology One arm includes a NPWT system that is used in conjunction with gauze or foam
      dressings. Dressing changes normally will be carried out twice a week unless otherwise
      indicated by the wound condition, the patients clinical presentation or a seal broken beyond
      repair. NPWT wound bed preparation will be ended when two experienced plastic surgeons
      consider the wound bed suitable for autografting. (Endpoint) The second arm includes
      application of cadaveric skin. The allografts normally will be changed every seven to ten
      days or earlier depending on adhesion of the allograft to the wound bed. In practice, the
      ability of the allograft to adhere to the wound bed has a diagnostic value, referred to as a
      'take-test'. If the allograft does not adhere, one must consider an infection or non-viable
      wound surface. If the allograft adheres to the wound bed and adequate granulation tissue is
      suspected underneath, then the wound bed is suitable for autografting. (Endpoint)
