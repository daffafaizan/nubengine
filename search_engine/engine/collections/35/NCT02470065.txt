    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, non-comparative, two-arm phase II
      trial aiming to evaluate afatinib treatment in pre-operative setting in patients with EGFR
      mutated NSCLC.

      After signing of the informed consent, patients will be registered and screened for
      eligibility and upon confirmation of all eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized
      1:1 to:

        -  Arm A: once daily afatinib at a dose of 40 mg for 8 weeks followed by surgery with
           curative intent (anatomical resection and systematic lymph node dissection).

        -  Arm B: immediate surgery with curative intent (anatomical resection and systematic lymph
           node dissection).

      Response evaluation in the pre-operative arm will be performed through CT scans at baseline,
      4 and 8 weeks.

      The first 5 patients enrolled in arm A will be part of a safety run-in to check that afatinib
      treatment doesn't delay surgery.
