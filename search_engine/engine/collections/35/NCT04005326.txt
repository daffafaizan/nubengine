    
      A randomized, controlled, double blinded, trial will be conducted in Cairo university
      hospital. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Randomization will
      be achieved using a computer-generated sequence. Concealment will be achieved using opaque
      envelopes. Patients scheduled for hip replacement surgeries under subarachnoid block (SAB).
      e.g. hip hemiarthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty.

      On arrival of the patients to regional anesthesia room, patients will be secured with
      18-gauge intravenous cannula, and will receive ondansetron (4 mg), and dexamethasone (8 mg
      IV). Monitoring will include Electrocardiography, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, and
      pulse oximetry.

      Before receiving subarachinoid block, patients will be randomly assigned into one of the two
      study groups:

      QLB Group (n=17): this group will receive ultrasound-guided transmuscular quadratus lumborum
      block; (Anterior QLB or QLB III) FIB Group (n=17): this group will receive suprainguinal
      fascia iliaca block To achieve double blinding, patients will receive the block with 30 mL
      bupivacaine (0.25%) by the anesthetist. Another doctor not involved in the block procedure
      will evaluate the patients postoperative.

      After finishing the block & assessment of motor power of quadriceps femoris muscle , patient
      will receive midazolam (2mg intravenous), and then transferred to operation room.

      Postoperatively, all patients will receive 1 g paracetamol every 6 hours and 30 mg ketorolac
      every 12 hours.

      If the visual analogue scale (VAS) is 4 or more, a 2 mg morphine increment will be added per
      time to maintain a resting VAS at <3 with maximum total 24-hours morphine 10 mg.
