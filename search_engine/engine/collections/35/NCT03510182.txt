      stroke or other neurological injury. However, recovery is generally not complete and new
      therapies are needed to improve outcomes. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has
      been shown to improve outcomes with motor therapy after stroke. This study will examine the
      feasibility of using tDCS with intensive language therapy as a way of enhancing language
      outcomes in aphasia. Eligible clients enrolled in the University of Michigan Aphasia Program
      (UMAP) will be invited to participate in the study. Clients will receive 20 minutes of tDCS
      every day along with their usual treatment protocol. Pre and post testing will be completed
      to assess for improvement in language functioning. This is a feasibility and proof of concept
      study to determine if a randomized control trial should be pursued
