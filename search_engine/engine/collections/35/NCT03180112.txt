      with current prevalence estimates being about one over one hundred children.

      Herpes simplex virus encephalitis is the leading cause of sporadic, nonepidemic encephalitis
      in children and adults in the United States. It is an acute necrotizing infection generally
      involving the frontal and/or temporal cortex and the limbic system and, beyond the neonatal
      period, is almost always caused by Herpes simplex virus type on.

      The etiology of autism is unknown; data suggest that autism results from multiple etiologies
      with both genetic and environmental contributions. One proposed etiology for autism is viral
      infection very early in development. The mechanism, by which viral infection may lead to
      autism, be it through direct infection of the central nervous system, through infection
      elsewhere in the body acting as a trigger for disease in the central nervous system, through
      alteration of the immune response of the mother or offspring, or through a combination of
      these, is not yet known.

      Many encephalitic patients had temporal lobe involvement. Autism results from neuropathology
      relating to the temporal lobes. They speculate the differences in the extent and
      neuropathologies of the temporal lobes contribute to the heterogeneity of autism. Also,
      herpes viruses can induce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines during infections, along
      with elevated interferon in the brain during Herpes simplex virus encephalitis.
