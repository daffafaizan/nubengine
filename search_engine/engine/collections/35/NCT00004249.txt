      limpet hemocyanin (PSA-KLH) conjugate or N-propionylated PSA-KLH conjugate plus immunological
      adjuvant QS21 in patients with small cell lung cancer. II. Assess the clinical toxicities
      resulting from these regimens and from the immune response in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive polysialic acid keyhole limpet hemocyanin (PSA-KLH) conjugate or
      N-propionylated PSA-KLH conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 subcutaneously weekly on
      weeks 1-4 and on weeks 8 and 16 for a total of 6 vaccinations. Patients are followed at 2
      weeks, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
