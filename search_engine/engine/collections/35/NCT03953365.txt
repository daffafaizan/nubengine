      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is associated with an increased risk of developing
      Incisional Hernia in the postoperative period, with an expected incidence of 50% at 24
      months, we designed a prospective, multicenter and randomized clinical study to demonstrate
      the utility of the meshes in the prevention of Incisional Hernia, hoping to reduce the
      incidence to 15% at 24 months.
