      Reliance on this class of medications can be detrimental, contributing to complications
      including hemodynamic instability, dependency, and withdrawal which can ultimately lead to
      longer hospital admissions, as well as long term and persistent neurodevelopmental effects.
      In addition, the opioid crisis has driven practitioners to aim for methods to reduce opioid
      exposure and post-operative narcotic prescriptions in pediatric and adult patients alike.
      There is a growing body of evidence in the adult literature showing promising results with
      the use of a continuous infusion of ketorolac in postoperative patients, including in a
      pediatric population. What the current literature has failed to show is whether a continuous
      infusion of ketorolac post operatively decreases the use of opiate mediations in a pediatric
      population compared to intermittent bolus injections, which is the current standard of care.
      Given the sensitivity and fragility inherent in those patients with CHD, working to reduce
      deleterious effects from excessive and prolonged opiate exposure is imperative. This study
      aims to examine whether the use of a continuous infusion of ketorolac can reduce the amount
      of opiates needed to treat postoperative pain control in the pediatric CVICU population, in
      comparison to patients who receive intermittent ketorolac within the first 96 hours
      post-operatively.
