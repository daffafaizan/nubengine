      ARDS patients worldwide, accounting for about 10% of patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). In recent years, the incidence of ARDS has increased significantly, which has
      significantly increased the social and economic burden. The impact of ARDS can even be
      compared with tumors, AIDS or myocardial infarction. There are the basic clinical treatments,
      such as using various ventilation methods to improve hypoxia and choosing alternative
      therapies to improve renal insufficiency. Therefore, there is still a lack of specific
      treatment measures.

      Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers
      with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes.
      Studies have confirmed that MSC-Exos can improve most of the pathological changes caused by
      lung infection, reduce pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, reduce alveolar
      inflammation, and clear bacterial infections. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of
      ARDS.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell exosomes
      (hMSC-Exos) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
