      previously diagnosed with asthma (asthmatics) and 48 had prolonged cough (coughers) from the
      pediatric clinic at Meyer Children's Hospital.

      Tests were performed by inhalation of triple-concentration increments (0.06
      to13.9mg/ml/methacholine).

      Spirometry was determined at baseline and after each inhalation in duplicate sets. End of
      test was defined by a fall of 20%FEV1 baseline (PC20-FEV1). PC20-FEV1<4.0mg/ml was considered
      positive). Results from the challenge were related to data from questionnaires concerning
      respiratory symptoms were analyzed at the end of the studies.
