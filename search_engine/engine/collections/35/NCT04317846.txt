    
      Single center, randomised controlled trial, designed to evaluate the noninferiority of the
      intravenous administration of vasodilatory drugs in comparison with the actual gold standard
      intra-arterial radial route. All consecutive patients with stable ischemic disease or stable
      acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI - non-st elevation myocardial infarction) for whom a coronary
      procedure is planned will be included in the study.

      Three groups will be constituted. For all groups, the diameters of both radial arteries will
      be measured thrice by echo-Doppler: 5 minutes before sheath insertion, immediately before
      sheath insertion and 5 minutes after sheath insertion. Pain evaluation will be performed
      after injection of the vasodilatory drugs/placebo in the radial artery:

        -  Group 1 (control group): intra-radial administration of the vasodilatory drugs after
           sheath insertion (verapamil 2.5 mg + isosorbide dinitrate 0.5 mg)

        -  Group 2 (intravenous-post): intravenous administration of the vasodilatory drugs after
           sheath insertion (verapamil 2.5 mg + isosorbide dinitrate 0.5 mg)

        -  Group 3 (intravenous-pre): intravenous administration of the vasodilatory drugs 5
           minutes before sheath insertion (verapamil 2.5 mg + isosorbide dinitrate 0.5 mg)
