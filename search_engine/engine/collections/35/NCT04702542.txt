      been an increase in many nosological forms of pathology of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Scientific works of recent years show that all over the world much attention is paid to the
      problem of timely prevention and improvement of chronic diseases of the gastroduodenal zone
      in children. This is mainly due to the fact that the incidence of diseases of the digestive
      system among schoolchildren is steadily increasing. In the clinical practice of
      gastroenterologists, it is often necessary to influence the regeneration processes in the
      gastroduodenal zone. The object of the study will be children and adolescents from 6 to 15
      years old, living in the city of Tashkent and in the Tashkent region. We will study patients
      with various clinical forms of chronic gastroduodenal pathology (CGDP). The effect of enteral
      oxygen therapy in the recovery of patients with CGDP due to the positive effect of the active
      form of oxygen on the hematological system and on the regenerative processes in the
      gastrointestinal tract will be studied. At the same time, the effect of enteral oxygen
      therapy on enhancing the effectiveness of eradication therapy during the treatment of carrier
      Helicobacter pylori due to the neutralization of the products of urea hydrolysis around
      bacteria under the action of reactive oxygen species will be studied.
