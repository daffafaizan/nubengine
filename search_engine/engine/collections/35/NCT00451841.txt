      all cases, and majority of these patients with GERD-induced cough have no classic "heartburn"
      symptoms. This important cause of cough can thus be difficult to detect. Non-invasive
      radiologic tests for GERD such as barium swallow is imperfectly sensitive in subjects with
      GERD-induced cough. The 24 hour pH probe, which continuously monitors esophageal pH and can
      correlate cough events with reflux events, is considered to be the gold standard test.
      However, this test is expensive, invasive, and not universally available.

      The goal of the current study is to compare simultaneous measurements of esophageal pH with
      exhaled breath condensate pH after cough episodes, in patients with symptomatic cough. The
      cause of cough will be determined by a standard protocol, which includes 24 hour pH probe
      studies, and assessment for asthma, upper airway causes and sinus disease, and medication
      effects. All subjects will undergo 24 hour pH monitoring. During this monitoring period, they
      press an event button on the pH recording device to indicate a cough episode. After six such
      events, they will immediately perform an EBC collection, and EBC pH will subsequently be
      analyzed. Differences between pH changes in the group with cough cause by GERD will be
      compared to pH measurements in the group with cough but no GERD, to determine the sensitivity
      and specificity of pH changes for discriminating between the two groups, and optimal
      threshold values for pH changes in EBC.
