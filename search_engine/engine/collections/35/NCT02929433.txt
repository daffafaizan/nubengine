      shoulder functionality, the investigators performed a prospective randomized controlled study
      (pilot study) in patients with a symptomatic full-thickness RCT.

      Since cycloergometer works through a continuous active and passive joint mobilization, the
      investigators expect it can reduce pain and improve shoulder functionality becoming a useful
      tool for physicians in the management of RCT patients.
