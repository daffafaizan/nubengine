      with acne scars and/or wrinkles in the face will be recruited. The subjects will be treated
      once on clean acne scarred skin and three times on the the wrinkled skin with the Pixel RF
      handpiece. Each treatment duration will be approximately 30 minutes. The initial power and
      number of passes parameters shall be set according to the clinical indication and skin type
      of the subject treated (as well as the results of test sites).

      Clinical improvement will be assessed by the investigator physician from the visual
      appearance of the treated area according to the following scale: -1 for exacerbation, 0 no
      change, 1 for 1%-25% improvement, 2 for 25%-50% improvement, 3 for 50%-75% improvement, and 4
      for 75%-99% improvement. Adverse side effects will be scored by clinical evaluation of
      erythema, edema, and burns. Real-time assessments will be made as well by the investigators.
      Treatment and results will be documented in a Case Report Form and follow-up sessions (1, 5
      days after the treatment and 1 month and 3 months after the treatment).
