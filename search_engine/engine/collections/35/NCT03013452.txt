      which effectively rids the airways of mucus to prevent secondary infection and inflammation.
      While effective airway clearance is widely accepted as a first line treatment, the choice of
      airway clearance method is complicated by lacking evidence base. One of the obstacles to
      establishing evidence of efficacy of an airway clearance technique or device is the
      limitations in the choice of endpoints.

      Aerobika (Trudell medical international, Canada) is an oscillating positive expiratory
      pressure (oPEP) device, designed and developed for the effective clearance of secretions in
      people with suppurative lung diseases. It has been tested and found safe and effective in
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - chronic bronchitis.

      The lung clearance index (LCI) measured by multiple breath washout (MBW) is a measure of
      ventilation inhomogeneity and has been shown to be a sensitive lung function test in early
      lung disease. Its usefulness has been demonstrated in cystic fibrosis (CF), particularly in
      children and adults with mild disease. LCI has been assessed in bronchiectasis and has been
      found to be significantly different from normal subjects, and to correlate with Forced
      Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1).

      The aim of this study is to test the long term effect of daily lung clearance on LCI, quality
      of life and exacerbations using the Aerobika oPEP device versus autogenic drainage (AD) in
      people with bronchiectasis.

      50 patients with confirmed bronchiectasis will be enrolled in this study. Participants will
      be randomized to daily physiotherapy with either Aerobika or Autogenic drainage. Change in
      LCI, measured before and after one month, will be the primary endpoint of this study.
