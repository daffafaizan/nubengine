    
      Randomized, open, controlled, multicenter, clinical trial in patients with lupus nephritis
      previously treated with cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate. These patient can not have
      received Rituximab in the previous year. The number of patients estimated to reach
      statistical significance is 18 in each arm, a total sample size of 32 patients is needed.

      The hypothesis is that the alternative procedure (a second cycle of Rituximab)will reduce the
      relapse rate of lupus nephritis and the consequent deterioration of renal function. Besides
      it will reduce health care expenses(hospitalization, medication, hemodialysis and renal
      transplantation).
