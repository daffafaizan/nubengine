      necessary for the follow-up of patients who have benefited, most often in the emergency, of a
      centromedullary nailing of the femoral shaft. The study does not lead to any further
      examination for the patient since they are followed until the removal of the material, which
      usually takes place 24 months after the fracture episode. This observational and pilot study
      is monocentric, prospective on a continuous series of 40 patients.
