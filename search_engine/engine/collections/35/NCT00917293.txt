    
      This study will assess the effect of Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate on the reduction of expressed
      symptoms of moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorders who are on a stable dose, and regime, of either a long acting (i.e.
      depot/IM) or oral antipsychotic medication, as compared to placebo.

      Symptoms will be assessed through the administration and scoring of Abnormal Involuntary
      Movement Scale (AIMS), specifically on items 1 through 7 (facial and oral movements,
      extremity movements and trunk movements) at each visit.
