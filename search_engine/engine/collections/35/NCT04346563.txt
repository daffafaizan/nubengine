        -  Age 25-50 years, male and female

        -  People who have a shoulder condition. (By measuring in the supine position, distance
           from the posterior aspect of acromion to the bed> 1 inch on both sides)

        -  People with moderate to severe neck and shoulder pain (VAS> 3)

        -  People who have to use their arms for work Overall more than 3 hours per day

      For attaching the tape, the researcher will prepare a replacement shirt in case the For the
      convenience of tape, the experimental group, trained by Certified Kinesio tape, attached the
      kinesio tape. Attaching the tape By using functional correction techniques, apply from the
      front of the acromion process to the spinous process T10 on both sides.

      Measurements

        1. The pressure of (average of peak force) of both arms (pounds)

        2. The pulling force (average of peak force) of both arms (pounds)

        3. Time of overhead endurance test (TMT) (seconds)

        4. Visual analog scale (VAS)

        5. The distance from the posterior aspect of acromion to the bed (inches)

      process of measuring the evaluation 3 times

        1. st after physical therapy treatment Before attaching the kinase tape

        2. nd evaluation period was 48 hours apart before the next treatment.

        3. rd evaluation period is 1 week apart.
