      used for first-line therapy of NSCLC. The optimum schedule for administration of carboplatin
      and gemcitabine is currently unknown.

      The addition of bevacizumab to another comparable platinum combination showed an overall
      survival advantage and a significantly greater response rate and progression-free survival.
