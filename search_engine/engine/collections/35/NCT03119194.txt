    
      This is an open-label, single-dose, single-period, non-randomised study in healthy male
      subjects. Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study between 28
      and 2 days before dosing. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the
      evening of the day before dosing (Day -1). Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1
      following an overnight fast of approximately 8 h. Blood, urine, faeces and expired air will
      be collected at predefined time points for mass balance and PK analysis. Subjects will remain
      resident in the clinic until the morning of Day 22, when they will be discharged as a group.

      Single dose administration on a single occasion. The estimated duration of the study from
      screening until the final return visit is approximately 3.5 months.
