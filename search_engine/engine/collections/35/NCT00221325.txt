      cancer. Intravenous administration of rituximab has been demonstrated to lead to prolongation
      of survival when used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with
      systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We have previously demonstrated that a small fraction of
      Rituximab administered intravenously is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier into the brain
      and we have also previously demonstrated that direct intraventricular administration of
      Rituximab is able to achieve high concentrations within the cerebrospinal fluid ventricles
      and lumbar sac.

      We will test the hypothesis that the direct intraventricular injection of Rituximab in
      combination with Methotrexate is safe and when used in combination in patients with recurrent
      brain and intraocular lymphoma. We will evaluate the safety of this combination by testing
      different dose levels of Rituximab. We will also measure the concentration of Rituximab in
      the intraocular compartments and cerebrospinal fluid at different time points after
      intraventricular administration to determine the pharmacokinetics of intrathecal Rituximab as
      well as the potential impact of Methotrexate on Rituximab distribution.

      We will also test the hypothesis that the intraventricular administration of the combination
      of rituximab plus methotrexate has activity and is effective in the treatment of recurrent
      brain and intraocular lymphoma.
