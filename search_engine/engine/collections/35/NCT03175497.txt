      tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of telatinib. .

      This study is comprised of two stages. The 1st stage follows the traditional 3+3
      dose-escalation design. Telatinib mesylate tablets will be administrated orally to patient
      twice daily at a starting dose of 600 mg bid. Patients will be successively enrolled into
      three cohorts from low-dose to high-dose (600 mg bid, 900 mg bid, and 1200 mg bid). For each
      cohort, patient will be first enrolled for single-dose PK and safety observation. After
      one-day interval, patient will then be resumed for a 21-day continuous treatment to assess
      safety, tolerability and PK profile with multiple dosing.

      The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period will be 23 days, starting from the first
      day of single dosing till the end of the 21-day continuous treatment.

      If first 3 subjects at a dose level complete a cohort without experiencing any DLT, subjects
      for the next higher cohort will be recruited. If 1 of the first 3 subjects experiences DLT,
      then up to three additional subjects (total up to six subjects) will enrolled at that dose
      level. If more than 2 patients at a dose level experienced DLT, dose escalation will be
      halted. And the dose level will be declared the toxic dose. The MTD is defined as the
      previous (lower dose) dose level.

      If MTD is not observed even at 1200 mg bid, dose-escalation will not be continued.
