      progression (such as pathological fracture, cord compression, worsened pain requiring
      radiation therapy, or opioid analgesic dose increase or initiation), or unacceptable
      toxicity. Participants were to be allowed to continue enzalutamide until the next treatment
      was initiated. If another non-cytotoxic, non-investigational, antineoplastic agent was
      initiated after protocol-defined progression had been determined, enzalutamide was to be
      continued as long as the participant was tolerating enzalutamide and continued androgen
      deprivation therapy. Participants were to have a safety follow-up visit approximately 30 days
      following the last dose of study drug or prior to the initiation of a subsequent anti-cancer
      drug or investigational agent, whichever occurred first. Disease progression and survival
      were to be followed every 12 weeks for a maximum of 3 years from first dose. The study should
      have ended when the last participant has been followed for 1 year from the date of first
      dose, but the study was terminated and results up to the last date of evaluation (15 March
      2017) are reflected in this disclosure.
