      (Catch-up-ESUS registry study) started in 01/2018. All ESUS-patients (≥18 years) treated in
      our hospital are included and will be followed up for three years. Depending on age (< 60
      years or ≥ 60 years), the patients are processed according to a standardized treatment
      algorithm designed interdisciplinary by neurologists and cardiologists. An insertable cardiac
      monitor (ICM) is implanted in all of them by default. Patients < 60 years without evidence of
      atrial fibrillation and co-existing PFO are planned for PFO closure within 6 months after
      stroke.
