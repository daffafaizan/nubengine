      and progression to legal blindness by the 3rd to 4th decade. Most affected males show
      symptomatic night blindness before the age of 10 years, are often myopic and show fundus
      abnormalities and ERG changes in early childhood. Examination of close female relatives is
      helpful in the absence of a family history, as the recognition of the XL carrier state will
      confirm the diagnosis.
