        1. To evaluate the hypothesis that a 10-week yoga-based intervention will reduce PTSD
           severity to a statistically and clinically significant degree relative to a pretreatment
           baseline evaluation and to a waitlist control group.

        2. To evaluate the hypothesis that PTSD patients will show improvement in regulation of
           physiological arousal in the autonomic nervous system relative to pretreatment.

        3. To evaluate that hypothesis that symptoms associated with PTSD such as depression,
           anxiety, insomnia and quality of life will also be improved.

        4. To evaluate the hypothesis that military veterans with PTSD can be successfully
           recruited into a yoga intervention study and will find the intervention acceptable and
           tolerable and will exhibit high compliance.
