      to Week 24), and the Extension Phase (Post Week 24 to Week 48). Primary efficacy and safety
      will be determined from the Primary Treatment Phase. Eligible patients will be randomized
      during the Primary Treatment Phase; in a 3 to 1 ratio to receive 6 months of open-label
      treatment with either the 84 mg octreotide implant or monthy Injections of S-LAR. Each
      patient in this study will return to the investigational center every 4 weeks; safety and
      efficacy assessments will be performed during these visits. All patients who complete the
      Primary Treatment Phase and who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be offered the
      opportunity to enter the Extension Phase; patients entering the Extension Phase will be
      treated with an octreotide implant for 6 months.During the Extension Phase, patients will
      return to the investigational center every 4 weeks; safety and efficacy assessments will be
      performed during these visits.
