      of distribution (Vd) or drug clearance (CL) is extremely altered in critically ill patients
      with sepsis or septic shock due to pathophysiological alterations (e.g. influence on fluid
      status). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was recently introduced as a simple,
      non-invasive, bedside technique to assess hydration status. The primary aim of the present
      study was to explore the correlation between BIA parameters and Vd of hydrophilic
      antimicrobial agents in critically ill patients. Furthermore, the relationship between BIA
      measurements and clinical observations was evaluated.

      Methods: We performed a validation study in healthy volunteers in September 2015 that
      confirmed the reproducibility of BIA. Subsequently, a prospective observational study was
      carried out in eligible patients treat-ed with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, meropenem,
      piperacillin/tazobactam or vancomycin, admitted at the in-tensive care unit (ICU) of the
      University Hospitals Leuven from October 2015 to March 2016. BIA measurement was performed on
      the same day as the collection of blood samples to calculate PK parameters of the
      administered antibiotic.
