      significant rise in the prevalence of obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. In Canada, 4.9-7.0%
      over the age of 12 and 17% over the age of 64 are estimated to have diabetes, 90-95% of which
      will be Type 2. Strong evidence supports the importance of physical activity in the
      management of Type 2 Diabetes. However, current literature lacks clear understanding of best
      strategies for physical activity behaviour change in this target population. Existing studies
      employ resource intensive, one-to-one individual and clinically-based approaches with limited
      theoretical grounding for recommended health behaviour change. Most fail to offer practical,
      sustainable, economically viable solutions, with documented long-term intervention efficacy.
      The call to move beyond the clinical focus by including theoretically population-based and
      "real-life" approaches for the management Type 2 Diabetes remains largely unheeded. The three
      interventions are: (1) standard print-based physical activity educational materials provided
      by the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA); (2) CDA materials + pedometers and a log book +
      theoretical stage-matched print-based physical activity materials; and, (3) the same as
      intervention 2 with the addition of a 12-month physical activity telephone counseling
      protocol.
