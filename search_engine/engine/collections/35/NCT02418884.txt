      one of the main pathologic features of atherosclerosis. Widely coverage of CAC is correlated
      with the greater likelihood of coronary events.With the increasing density of CAC, the risk
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD) declines.Some studies showed that the calcified plaque in
      stable CHD is denser.

      Statins are widely used in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Treatment
      of statins may increase the density score of CAC, thus, promote the unstable atherosclerotic
      plaque to the stable plaque.
