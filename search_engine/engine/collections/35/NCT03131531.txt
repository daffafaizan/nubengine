      represents the most common hematologic malignancy. Despite the overall prognosis improved in
      the last 10 years, there are many open issues that need to be addressed, specifically
      refractoriness to standard treatment, disease recurrence and outcome with new drug in the so
      called "real world" setting. Since the Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at
      "Ospedale Papa Giovanni XIII" of Bergamo has developed specific tools to collect clinical
      data thought fully validated electronic charts and biological specimens thanks to a
      regulatory compliant biobanking program, the aim of this study is to collect clinical and
      biological information of lymphoid cancer patients. The cohort of patients enrolled will
      permit to analyze the practice pattern, perform biological correlative studies of great
      translational potential with relevance to clinical practice.
