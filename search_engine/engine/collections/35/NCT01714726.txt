    
      This is a two-part Phase 2a study compromising a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      treatment period followed by a 100-week, open label, treatment period to evaluate short-term
      efficacy, and the short- and long-term safety of MEDI2070 in subjects with moderate to
      severe, active CD who have failed or are intolerant to anti-TNFÎ± therapy as determined by the
      investigator. Approximately 120 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to initially
      receive a fixed IV dose of MEDI2070 or placebo on Week 0(Day1) and Week 4 (Day 29) during the
      12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment period. At the completion of the
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment period (Week 12), subjects will have the option
      to enter a 100-week, open-label, treatment period where they will receive open-label MEDI2070
      (SC) Q4W (Week 12 through Week 112). Subjects will be followed for safety at 3 visits over 28
      weeks after their last dose of IP. Subjects will also be contacted by phone 36 weeks after
      their last dose of IP for safety.
