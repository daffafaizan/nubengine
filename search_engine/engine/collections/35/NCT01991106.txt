      attributed to a physically inactive lifestyle and inappropriate nutrition. Early cohort
      studies illustrated that fifty per cent of obese children became obese adults and
      consequently had an higher risk for metabolic syndrome than obese adults who were not obese
      as children. Both female and male overweight children and adolescents had a 30% increase in
      all cause mortality. The increases in risk of death were independent of adult body mass
      index.

      Systematic reviews suggest that lifestyle and exercise interventions in obese children and
      adolescents can lead to improvements in anthropometric and cardio-metabolic outcomes, but
      these are not inclusive of several important outcomes such as myocardial and vascular
      function or visceral adipose tissue.
