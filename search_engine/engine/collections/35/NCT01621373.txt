    
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol
      (short acting anesthetic) in 50 neonates to whom the drug is administered as a intravenous
      bolus. This is part of routine clinical care in patients receiving (semi-) elective
      intubation. It's the aim to explore the most effective IV propofol dose for a successful
      INSURE (intubation, surfactant, extubation) procedure and for successful (semi-) elective
      intubation in non-INSURE procedures. We hereby aim to define the most optimal dose regimen
      for propofol in neonates.

      we will hereby use

        -  predefined scoring systems to evaluate sedation, relaxation and intubation conditions

        -  vital parameter monitoring

        -  pharmacokinetic analysis with blood samples

        -  brain monitoring with NIRS (Near infrared spectroscopy) derived cerebral oxygenation and
           aEEG (amplitude integrated EEG).
