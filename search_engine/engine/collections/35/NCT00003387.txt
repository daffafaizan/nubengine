      paclitaxel with or without prior induction chemotherapy on overall response rate,
      disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients with unresectable stage III non-small
      cell lung cancer. II. Compare the effects of these treatments on locoregional vs distant
      failure in these patients. III. Compare the toxicity of these treatments in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by measurable vs evaluable
      disease. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I (immediate concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy): Patients receive IV paclitaxel over 1 hour followed by IV carboplatin
      over 30 minutes on day 1, and radiation therapy to the chest 5 times a week beginning on day
      1. Treatment repeats weekly for a total of 7 courses. Arm II (induction chemotherapy followed
      by delayed concurrent chemoradiotherapy): Patients receive IV paclitaxel over 3 hours
      followed by IV carboplatin over 30 minutes; treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses.
      Patients then receive 7 courses of concurrent chemoradiotherapy as in Arm I. Total treatment
      time is 13 weeks. Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, then every 4 months for
      the next 2 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
