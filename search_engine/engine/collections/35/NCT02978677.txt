      meningioma. Standard treatment for atypical or anaplastic meningioma is surgery. For grade
      III (anaplastic) meningiomas, post-operative radiotherapy would be performed in all cases
      using standard fractionation schedules to a total dose of ~60 Gy. For grade II (atypical)
      meningiomas, although some small patient datasets support early onset of radiotherapy, the
      standard treatment is still to irradiate if tumours are recurrent or if resection was
      macroscopically incomplete. Total doses of 54 to ~60 Gy are applied using standard
      fractionation schedules.

      A major problem of the treatment of atypical or anaplastic meningioma is that beyond surgery
      and radiotherapy, there are only experimental treatment options and the probability of local
      recurrences is 50-100% within the first 5 years for grade II and grade III meningioma.

      The present trial has been developed to evaluate efficacy of a dose-intensified radiotherapy
      treatment schedule for incompletely or not resected meningioma to a total dose of 68 (grade
      II) or 72 Gy (grade III). To minimize normal tissue toxicity, the boost dose or the complete
      radiotherapy is applied using protons. The expectation is a higher recurrence-free survival
      compared to previous reports on outcome of standard dose (60 Gy) radiotherapy.
