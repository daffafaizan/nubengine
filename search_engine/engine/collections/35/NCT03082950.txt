      the study was to identify the prevalence of an hpv affiliation in retrospective-prospective
      analysed cohort of patients who suffer from vulvar cancer and their preinvasive lesions.

      After having retrospectively identified patients with vulvar cancer incl. their preinvasive
      lesions in the clinical registry the hpv status of the samples is prospectively analyzed
      using a new multiplex pcr Array. Two Groups are build: patients with hpv associated vulvar
      cancer and patients with non-hpv associated vulvar cancer.

      Then, the rate of patients who respond to radiotherapy within the Groups is analyzed by
      building Kaplan meier plots according to the patients survival and recurrence rate.
