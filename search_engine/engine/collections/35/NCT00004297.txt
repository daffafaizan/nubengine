    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified by center.

      Patients en route to the hospital in a San Francisco Department of Health Paramedic Division
      ambulance are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Informed consent is waived due to
      impaired consciousness.

      Patients receive intravenous diazepam, lorazepam, or placebo during transport. The patient is
      re-treated if the seizure is sustained after the first dose or recurs after the first dose
      without the patient regaining consciousness.

      Upon arrival at the hospital, all patients receive the standard status epilepticus treatment
      in use at that site.
