    
      Graves' Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory
      changes of the periocular and orbital region often in association with an underlying thyroid
      abnormality. These changes can be extremely debilitating and may lead to visual loss.
      Attempts at limiting or reversing the phenotypic expression of Graves' ophthalmopathy through
      aggressive orbital decompression surgery or targeting the inflammatory disease, using high
      dose systemic corticosteroids and/or orbital radiotherapy, have been limited to date by
      treatment ineffectiveness and co-morbidities. Selective B-cell depletion therapy offers a
      potential treatment alternative. This study is designed to treat patients with Graves'
      disease with Rituximab in an attempt to prevent or reverse the physically deforming and
      debilitating consequences of this disease.
