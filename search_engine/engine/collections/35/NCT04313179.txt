      undergoing painful minor procedures (heel pricks) in the Nursery unit of Lincoln Medical and
      Mental Health Center.

      One of the investigators involved in the study will obtain consent from the legal guardian
      and enroll the participants. All infants, regardless of the group that they are assigned,
      will receive similar standard non-pharmacologic method of pain relief which is 0.5 ml of 24%
      Sucrose, 2 minutes before undergoing heel prick. Pacifiers will be avoided to avoid potential
      confounding.

      Subjects will be randomized into two different groups. Group A, music intervention group and
      group B, control group. In the music intervention group, a recorded instrumental lullaby
      music track called "Deep Sleep" from "Bedtime Mozart: Classical Lullabies for Babies", will
      be played for the neonates through smart phone speakers (maximum sound up to 60 A dB),
      starting 20 minutes before the heel prick, continuing through the procedure and for 5 minutes
      after the procedure. This music track has been selected based on previous research studies
      that showed effectiveness in neonatal pain management.

      An investigator involved in the study will place the baby in a bassinet in a quite, dim
      lighted room. He/She will play the music for those babies in the music group and will NOT
      assess the NIPS. Another investigator wearing active noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones
      (for blinding) will enter the room at 5 minutes prior to the procedure and assess the NIPS at
      appropriate intervals: 5 minutes prior and at 1-minute interval during and after the
      procedure for 5 minutes. NIPS will be compared using appropriate statistical methods.
