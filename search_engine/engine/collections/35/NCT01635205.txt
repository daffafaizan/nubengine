      submitted to the corresponding procedure (paraspinous anesthetic block or placebo puncture in
      subcutaneous tissue). In the first appointment, pain will be measured with the VAS (Visual
      Analogue Scale); quality of life and function basal level will be evaluated by scales SF-36
      (Medical Outcome Short-Form (36)Health Survey)and FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index), in
      Portuguese validated versions. Procedure will be realized as planned for each group.

      Second appointment will occur one week after the procedure, and VAS scale will be applied.

      Third appointment will occur in one month. VAS scale will be applied again,and procedure will
      be repeated if patient does not have a reduction of at least 30% of pain.

      Next consultations will occur at two months, three months, four months and five months, with
      application of VAS scale to keep monitoring evolution of pain.

      At six months of study, VAS scale will be applied along with SF-36 and FSFI questionnaires,
      to evaluate improvement in pain and in quality of life and function level.
