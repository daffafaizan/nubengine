      osteoarthritis of the great toe. Using the concept of an implant acting as a spacer and
      stabilizer, the proposed study will evaluate the use of allograft knee meniscus in the
      treatment of MTP joint osteoarthritis of the great toe. Patients will be evaluated for pain
      and range of motion at 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 3-years, 4-years, and 5-years
      postoperatively or until allograft failure. Stability of the allograft will be evaluated by
      the surgeon at these time points per radiographic imaging.
