      invasive breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (before surgery) and adjuvant chemotherapy
      (after surgery) had equivalent survival rates in major randomized trials. In these studies,
      preoperative systemic therapy increased the patient's chance to achieve breast conservation.
      The down side was a clear trend towards increased ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence.
      Preoperative chemotherapy leads to patchy, irregular cell death known as honeycomb effect and
      thus may lead to a misleading false negative resection margin of a tumorectomy operation.
      Even with the advent of oncoplastic techniques which allowed larger resection volumes with
      satisfactory cosmetic results, rates of re-excision, mastectomy and local relapse did not
      differ from those after traditional lumpectomy operations. As of today, there is no consensus
      -based on evidence- on the optimal width of margin in patients who are offered breast
      conservative surgery (BCS) after systemic therapy. In view of the current uncertainty and
      lack of evidence, The present trial is designed to answer the following question (Specific
      aim): Does planning the resection margin according to the pre-treatment tumor extent improve
      the local recurrence rate in patients receiving breast conservative surgery after systemic
      therapy?
