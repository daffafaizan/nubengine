      aneurysms in conjunction with embolic coils, the neurovascular device is placed across the
      aneurysm neck, to act as a bridge to prevent coils from protruding into the parent artery.
      Stenting may allow to more safely achieve a higher packing density of coils. These effects
      may improve the rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and enhance the durability of the
      coiling treatment. The eCLIPs™ device manufactured by Evasc Medical Systems Corp. has a high
      density 'leaf' which is implanted across the bifurcation aneurysm neck and anchored in one of
      the branch arteries of the bifurcation and may provide improved bifurcation aneurysm
      treatment by allowing for a higher packing density of embolic coils implanted behind the
      eCLIPs™ device and the eCLIPs™ device in combination with embolic coils may reduce the
      recurrence/retreatment rate by increasing the rate of complete aneurysm occlusion.
