    
      This is a prospective randomized control trial among obese subjects. The scope of the study
      includes: identification of nutritional habits leading to obesity; assessment of patient's
      motivation to introduce life style changes; assessment of anthropometric parameters, body
      composition, arterial stiffness and resting metabolic rate at baseline and at specific
      control points; development of individual medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and weight
      reduction plan depending on the initial body weight of the subjects; quantitative and
      qualitative assessment of the diet at baseline and in each month for a period of 6 months
      (Part A) and 9, 12 months (Part B); assessment of nutritional knowledge at baseline and at
      specific control points; education of patients using the behavioral-cognitive method,
      conducted for 6 months; introduction of hypnotic suggestion (HS) or telemedicine (T) to
      support the achievement and the maintenance of the lifestyle changes.

      The study covers a group of 90 adults, both sexes, with obesity (BMI â‰¥30 kg/m^2), undergoing
      individual MNT, randomly assigned to one of three groups for 6 months (Part A): Group 1 -
      individual MNT (30 people); Group 2 - individual MNT and T (30 people); Group 3 - individual
      MNT and HS (30 people). All subjects will continue the program for additional 6 months (Part
      B follow up).

      The selection of subjects for the study is purposeful and the participation in the study is
      voluntary. All subjects are educated to follow a reduced calorie Dietary Approaches to Stop
      Hypertension diet ("DASH") for 6 months (Part A). Education materials (handouts and sample
      meal plans) are provided to the subjects.

      The primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, months 1,2,3,4,5, 6 (Part
      A) and months 9, 12 (Part B follow up).
