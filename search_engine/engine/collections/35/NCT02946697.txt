      and peer mentor support intervention. Chinese American breast cancer survivors who have
      completed primary treatment will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a
      control group to receive enhanced usual care while waiting for the JLA. Health outcomes are
      assessed at baseline, immediately post intervention, and 1 and 4 months follow-ups.
