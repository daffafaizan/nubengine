      laser handpieces for the improvement of skin color, tone, texture and laxity. All subjects
      will receive up to four treatments, administered in intervals of 28 +/- 2 days. Each full
      face treatment duration will be approximately 60 minutes. The initial power and number of
      passes parameters shall be set according to the clinical indication and skin type of the
      subject treated. The treatment area will be cleaned and photographed before each treatment.
      Photographs will be taken at baseline, prior to each treatment and during each follow-up
      visit. Before the initiation of the first treatment each subject will undergo clinical
      evaluation.

      Clinical improvement will be assessed by the investigator from the visual appearance of the
      treated area and from the fixed magnification clinical photographs according to the following
      scale: -1 for exacerbation, 0 no change, 1 for 1%-25% improvement, 2 for 25%-50% improvement,
      3 for 50%-75% improvement, and 4 for 75%-99% improvement. Adverse side effects will be scored
      by clinical evaluation of erythema, edema, and burns. Treatments and results will be
      documented in a Case Report Form at each treatment session and follow-up session (1 month and
      3 months after the last treatment). In case of adverse side effects and symptoms other than
      erythema or edema appear during or following a treatment, the next treatment may be skipped
      by two weeks or treatment parameters reduced until symptoms resolve. If adverse side effects
      are observed, the investigator should provide the subject with the proper care and remedy and
      will document it in the Case Report Form.
