        -  To evaluate the safety, and tolerability of AeroVanc inhalation powder in healthy
           volunteers, and in patients with CF.

        -  To determine the systemic bioavailability of vancomycin in healthy volunteers following
           single dose pulmonary administration of 16 mg, 32 mg, and 80 mg doses of AeroVanc in
           comparison with a 250 mg dose of vancomycin administered intravenously.

        -  To estimate the lung sputum concentrations of vancomycin in patients with cystic
           fibrosis (CF) following single dose pulmonary administration of 32 mg and 80 mg doses of
           AeroVanc.
