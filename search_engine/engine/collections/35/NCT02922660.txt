      Infusion) are commonly used in ophthalmic ambulatory surgery, however, there is no clear
      evidence to discriminate the advantages and disadvantages between them. This study is
      designed to evaluate a better anesthetic method in ophthalmic surgery through a clinical
      study. This is a single center, randomized, prospective study. 200 patients with American
      Society of Anesthesiologists'(ASA) physical status 1 to 2, aged 18 to 60, scheduled for
      elective strabismus ambulatory and in whom a LMA is indicated for anesthesia are recruited.
      Enrolled patients are randomly assigned into 2 groups: group TIVA (TIVA-TCI with propofol)
      and group Des (Desflurane).In group TIVA, anesthesia is maintained with propofol and
      remifentanil. Propofol is continuously administered via a target-controlled infusion (TCI)
      pump intraoperatively. In group Des, anesthesia is maintained with desflurane.All patients
      received anaesthesia depth monitoring with bispectral index (BIS). The dose of anesthetic is
      adjusted to maintained the BIS value within 40 to 60. At the end of the surgery, inhalant
      anesthetic or infused propofol and remifentanil are discontinued. LMA is removed when patient
      regains consciousness with spontaneous respiration. Patients are then transferred to the post
      anesthetic care unit (PACU) for postoperative follow-up. The primary outcome is awake time,
      the secondary outcomes include discharge time, the stay time in PACU, time of off-bed, Riker
      sedation agitation score (SAS), time of PADSS>9, NRS score when leaving PACU, incidence of
      various complications (postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), emergence agitation, etc),
      as well as anesthesia cost. All patients are followed up by calling in one day after the
      surgery.
