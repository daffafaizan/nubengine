      women. The main metabolic phenotype is hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are
      independent of body weight and worsen hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction.
      Pharmacological treatments are symptom oriented and usually effective but have metabolic and
      gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, it is important to evaluate new nonpharmacological
      treatment strategies, as most women with PCOS require long-term treatment.

      Hypothesis and Aims Our central hypothesis is that acupuncture break the vicious circle of
      androgen excess and reverse insulin resistance and improve health related quality of life and
      affective symptoms in overweight and obese women with and without PCOS.

      The specific aim are designed to test the hypotheses that

        1. Acupuncture (acute and chronic i.e. 5 weeks treatment, 3 times per week) improves
           insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese women with and without PCOS

        2. Acupuncture (acute and chronic i.e. 5 weeks treatment, 3 times per week) regulate key
           signaling molecules and mitochondrial oxidation/biogenesis in skeletal muscle and
           adipose tissue in overweight and obese women with and without PCOS

        3. Acupuncture (chronic i.e. 5 weeks treatment, 3 times per week) improve health related
           quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression in overweight and obese women
           with and without PCOS

      Time frame of the study is 5-6 weeks. No long term follow up.
