      effect as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglytaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, it has
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The administration of atorvastatin to
      lupus-prone model NZB/W F1 mice results in a significant reduction in serum IgG anti-dsDNA
      Abs and decreased proteinuria. In a pilot study with three patients with SLE, simvastatin
      induced rapid and significant reduction in proteinuria levels. However, further randomized
      double-blinded placebo-controlled study is pending.

      Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and laboratory effect
      of atorvastatin in SLE.

      Methods: Forty patients with SLE will randomize in two groups to receive atorvastatin or not
      as an adjuvant to immunosuppressive agent therapy. Patients who received atorvastatin for 6
      months will stop atorvastatin for 8 weeks as a washout period. We will cross over the placebo
      and experimental groups, then given atorvastatin for another 6 months. Primary outcome is
      improvement of lupus disease status measured by SLEDAI and microcirculation improvement via
      nailfold capillaroscopy.
