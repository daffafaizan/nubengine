      reduces the risk of sarcoidosis. Research studies have shown that the nicotine, a common
      component of cigarette smoke, strongly suppresses the immune system and reduces the type of
      inflammation that is characteristic of sarcoidosis in the lungs. We propose that nicotine
      treatment, administered in the form of a skin patch, will reduce the severity of lung disease
      in patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis patients who volunteer to participate in this study
      will submit standardized questionnaires relating to their quality of life and the severity of
      their shortness of breath before and after treatment. We will also compare objective measures
      of lung function, radiographic parameters, and the severity of lung inflammation. We predict
      that nicotine treatment will reduce the severity of sarcoidosis symptoms, improve lung
      function, and resolve lung inflammation. If our hypothesis is proven to be correct in this
      relatively small group of patients, we will perform additional studies in a larger group of
      patients and will consider the features of sarcoidosis patients that predict a favorable
      response to nicotine and other nicotine-like drugs. If nicotine is ultimately found to be an
      effective treatment for sarcoidosis, it may replace some of the existing treatments which are
      frequently ineffective and have unacceptable side-effects.
