      cysts, 2- popliteal (Baker's) cyst, 3- ganglion cysts, 4- meniscal cysts. Whereas, The
      "cyst-like" lesions can be sub-classified into the following:1- normal knee bursae, 2- normal
      knee recesses, 3- miscellaneous cyst-like lesions as aneurysms, hematomas, seromas and
      abscess.

      Many of these lesions have fairly characteristic locations and imaging features. Knowledge of
      these variants and lesions is essential for accurate diagnosis and to avoid mistaking them
      for aggressive soft tissue lesions, including sarcomas. Ultrasonography and magnetic
      resonance imaging are the most useful imaging modalities in evaluating these Benign cystic
      lesions. Ultrasonography can distinguish cysts from solid lesions and assess the degree of
      vascularity within the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging can help to delineate the location
      of the lesion in relation to anatomic structures and also determine if the lesion is cystic
      or solid when contrast is administered.
