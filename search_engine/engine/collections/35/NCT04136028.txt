      chronic granulomatous disease, which has granulomatous complications on the basis of an
      initial comprehensive survey.

      This examination will include clinical data; laboratory tests - clinical and biochemical
      analysis of blood (with an assessment of inflammatory activity); molecular-genetic methods
      for detecting mutations in the genes CYBB, CYBA, NCF2, NCF1 or NCF4; methods for studying the
      functional activity of neutrophils (chemiluminescence of neutrophils, test with rhodamine);
      methods for assessing pro-inflammatory interleukins; microbiological testing of
      bronchoalveolar lavage; histological stud—É of lung biopsies; as well as the results of
      visualization techniques (ultrasound investigation of the abdominal organs, CT scan of the
      chest and abdominal organs). Negative galactomannan and lack of microorganism growth in
      bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lack of response to complex antibacterial and antifungal
      therapy for two to three weeks confirm the presence of granulomatous complications in
      patients. The next step is therapy with an inhibitor of IL-1 receptor (Anakinra). Evaluation
      of the efficacy and safety therapy is based on the results of control examinations after 3-6
      months from the start of treatment and includes an assessment of the level of C-reactive
      protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the results of CT scan of the chest and
      abdominal organs.
