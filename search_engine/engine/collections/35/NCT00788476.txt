      tobacco-use) of childhood cancer survivors, and the behaviors of identified "primary
      caregivers" (see definition under inclusion criteria). In addition, these surveys will assess
      awareness of longterm health risks, quality of life (QOL), strength of the child-caregiver
      bond, body image, body weight status, functional status, barriers to lifestyle change, and
      interest in various lifestyle interventions and potential channels for delivery. Mailed
      surveys (with telephone follow-up) will be sent to MDACC childhood cancer survivors diagnosed
      from 1998 - 2007 who are survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, sarcomas, lymphoma
      or leukemia.
