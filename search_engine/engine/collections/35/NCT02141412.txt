      during the postoperative period. Shivering has been reported to occur in up to 65% of
      patients recovering from general anesthesia, and has been shown to cause detrimental effects
      to the patient. Previous studies have shown that dexmedetomidine 1Âµg/kg at the end of surgery
      significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative shivering and improves quality of
      emergence from anesthesia. However, this beneficial effect of dexmedetomidine is at the
      expense of prolonged time to extubation and awakening. The aim of this study is to find the
      optimal dose of dexmedetomidine that would be beneficial without delaying recovery from
      general anesthesia.
