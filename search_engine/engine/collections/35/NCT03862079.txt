    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who develop acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
      of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by day 100 post-transplant for patients randomized to the
      standard of care, total gut decontamination (TGD) followed by fecal microbiota transplant
      (fecal microbiota transplantation [FMT]) and FMT alone arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall maximum stage of lower GI tract GVHD by day 100 post-transplant. II. Cumulative
      incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV and maximum grade through 6 months.

      III. Time to onset of acute GVHD and acute GI GVHD. IV. Incidence of adverse events and
      serious adverse events. V. Incidence of bacterial blood stream infections through 6 months.
      VI. Hematologic recovery (neutrophils and platelets). VII. Characterization of the intestinal
      microbiota at enrollment, pre-FMT / time of engraftment, 2 month post-FMT/ engraftment, onset
      of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) GVHD, and at study completion (6 months).

      VIII. Relapse-free survival at 6 months post-randomization. IX. Non-relapse mortality at 6
      months post-randomization. X. Overall survival (OS) at 6 months post-randomization.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A (TGD + FMT): Patients receive piperacillin-tazobactam orally (PO) three times daily
      (TID) and nystatin PO four times daily (QID) until FMT. Patients undergo stem cell
      transplantation on day 0, then undergo FMT via enema over 5-10 minutes within 3 weeks after
      transplantation.

      ARM B (FMT): Patients undergo stem cell transplantation on day 0, then undergo FMT via enema
      over 5-10 minutes within 3 weeks after transplantation.

      ARM C (STANDARD THERAPY): Patients receive standard of care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days and 6 months.
