    
      Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a member of a family of seven
      closely related proteins responsible for transmission of peptide hormone signals from the
      extracellular surface of cells to the nucleus. STAT3 is a master regulator of most key
      hallmarks and enablers of cancer, including cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis,
      metastasis, immune evasion, tumor angiogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT),
      response to DNA damage, and the Warburg effect. STAT3 also is a key mediator of oncogene
      addiction and supports the self-renewal of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells that contribute
      to cancer initiation, cancer maintenance, and relapse in several types of tumors. STAT3
      activity is increased in ~50% of all cancers, due either to naturally occurring STAT3
      mutations, as have been demonstrated in human inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas and large
      granular lymphocytic leukemia, or, more commonly as a result of activation of signaling
      molecules upstream of STAT3, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; e.g. epidermal growth
      factor receptor, EGFR), tyrosine kinase-associated receptors (e.g. the family of IL-6
      cytokine receptors or G-protein coupled receptors, GPCR), and Src kinases (e.g. Src, Lck,
      Hck, Lyn, Fyn, or Fgr). Thus, STAT3 is an attractive target for drug development to treat
      many types of cancer including breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC),
      gastric adenocarcinoma and melanoma.
