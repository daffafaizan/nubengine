      magnitude representation impairment. Previous works suggested that magnitude representation
      impairment could be a result of endogenous visuo-spatial attention dysfunction in 22q11.2DS.
      Nevertheless this relationship is still poor explored. The influence of visuo-spatial
      abilities on arithmetic achievement could also be modulated by developmental age. The study
      ARITH22 will test these hypotheses thanks to magnitude comparisons tasks, in children with
      22q11.2 deletion syndrome and matched children without developmental disease.
