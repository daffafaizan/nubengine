      received transplants, to ensure that the patient's body does not reject the new organ. In
      some cases, while anti-rejection medications protect a newly transplanted liver, they can
      injure the patient's kidneys and cause them not to work as well as they should. The purpose
      of this pilot study is to determine the best way to protect kidney function and to ensure
      that the newly transplanted liver is not rejected. This study will evaluate the use of a drug
      called Thymoglobulin, combined with a delayed start of the anti-rejection drugs (10 days
      after liver transplant), compared to the current approach of starting anti-rejection drugs
      called calcineurin inhibitors or CNI's within 2 days after the liver transplant.
