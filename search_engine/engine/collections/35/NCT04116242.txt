      monocytes/macrophages during disease progression of liver cirrhosis from Child Pugh A to B/C,
      corresponding to early stages of decompensation, and before the receptor expression is
      increased. Factors involved in activation of the MERTK signalling cascade might be microbial
      products such as bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and other toll-like receptor
      (TLR)-ligands, MERTK ligands and cytokines, as shown elevated in cirrhotic patients.

      Given the observation that MERTK levels peak on the day of admission with organ failure and
      decrease in patients surviving the episode of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), MERTK
      Inhibition at a time during progression of cirrhosis but before manifestation of acute
      decompensation with no cirrhosis (AD) or ACLF might prevent infectious complications,
      decompensation and improve survival in patients with cirrhosis.

      This study is to investigate MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) signalling cascade on
      monocytes and tissue macrophages in respect to innate immune function of the cells in
      patients with cirrhosis at different stages of disease (Child A, B, C, acute decompensation,
      acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)) and in comparison to patients with acute liver failure
      and to healthy controls.
