      to measure ketamine induced changes in glutamatergic indices. The investigators will
      randomize 18 subjects at each site. Subjects will be randomized to ketamine or placebo in a
      2:1 ratio and receive two drug challenges separated by at least two weeks. Ketamine challenge
      is used to induce a "glutamate surge" within prefrontal brain regions that can be detected
      using neurochemical and functional imaging techniques. Each subject will receive MRS and BOLD
      fMRI during each challenge day. The goal of the pilot study is to assess the feasibility of
      both the proposed ketamine challenge paradigm and of the proposed imaging-based biomarkers.
      Specific indices to be used in assessing feasibility will include effect size, cross-site and
      cross-subject reliability, safety, and subject tolerability as similar studies will be
      performed independently at Yale and UC Davis. Second this information will be used to select
      and refine final study parameters for a subsequent full proof-of-clinical mechanism (POCM)
      study investigating the effect of Pomaglumetad on ketamine-induced MRS and fMRI effects.
