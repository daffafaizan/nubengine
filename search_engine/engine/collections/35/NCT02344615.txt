      advantages such as improved success rate, faster onset time, fewer needle passes, shorter
      performance time, and reduced procedural pain and vascular puncture. However, there is no
      information about postoperative analgesia.

      Therefore, the investigators tested whether ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block enhanced
      the postoperative analgesia for upper extremity surgery compared with nerve stimulator (NS)
      guidance.
