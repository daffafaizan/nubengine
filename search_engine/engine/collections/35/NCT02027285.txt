      immune system. It could be hypothesized that an inadequate nutritional status may amplify the
      effects of a low-grade chronic inflammation associated with age influencing the functionality
      of the immune systems, the resistance to infections, the cognitive function and contributing
      to an increased morbidity and mortality. Indeed experimental evidence indicate that improving
      the nutritional status attenuates the decline in immune and cognitive functions, in physical
      performance associated with age by helping to improve the level of Quality of Life.

      Therefore, the present study focus on nutrients and micronutrient which have a role in
      fighting oxidative stress, in the regulation of inflammatory responses and the immune system.
