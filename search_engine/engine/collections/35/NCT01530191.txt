      patients scheduled to undergo surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and to determine if
      pre-existing depression and anxiety will affect perioperative outcomes in this patient
      population.

      Methodology: Patients from the University of Oklahoma Urogynecology clinics who have been
      scheduled to undergo surgery for pelvic organ prolapse will be invited to participate in this
      study. Informed consent will be obtained prior to study enrollment. Data obtained from a
      preoperative visit with each participant will include demographic information, medical and
      surgical histories, and a complete physical examination. After enrollment into the study,
      each participant will be started on a standardized dose of analgesics. The visual analog
      scale will be used to assess the level of pain at the surgical site and pain medications will
      be adjusted as necessary. Information regarding their postoperative course will be tracked,
      including any complications, use of pain medications, and length of hospital stay.
