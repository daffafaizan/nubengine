      analgesia. A dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) and caudal epidural block (CEB) are commonly
      used regional anesthesia techniques for postoperative pain control.

      Aims: The primary aim of the current study was to use the duration until the first
      postoperative analgesic requirement after two different block techniques to compare the
      analgesic effect. The secondary aims were to compare the two methods for postoperative
      Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores, complications and parental
      satisfaction scores.
