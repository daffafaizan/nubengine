      benefit for many hours. The body responds as if the levodopa in the plasma filled a reservoir
      and then slowly leaked out to produce benefit. With disease progression, even though the same
      amount of levodopa circulates in the blood, the benefit wears off much faster, as if the
      reservoir had become leakier. This wearing off of benefit can be characterized by a single
      number, the effect site rate constant Ke. On average, patients with more severe disease and
      longer disease duration have a larger ("leakier") Ke when the response to drug is measured
      using clinical features like tapping speed. Unfortunately, clinical measurements are
      influenced by confounding factors such as patient fatigue and comfort. A direct, objective
      brain measure of response to levodopa may improve the reliability of this measurement.
      Fortunately, we can assess the effect of levodopa on the brain directly, using an MRI machine
      to measure blood flow in different parts of the brain. For instance, the midbrain has a
      robust blood flow response to a single, clinically sensible dose of levodopa. This study's
      goal is to validate MRI measurement of Ke in the brain as an objective, quantitative measure
      of disease severity in PD. We will do this by comparing MRI-based Ke values from people with
      PD across a wide range of disease duration and severity. In a subgroup of participants, we
      will do this measurement twice, once before treatment and once after 6 weeks of treatment
      with carbidopa-levodopa (SinemetÂ® and other brand names).
