      clinical examination, biochemical tests (blood and cerebrospinal fluid), electrophysiological
      assessment and if necessary nerve biopsy. The electrophysiological assessment usually
      consists of nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). While
      electrophysiological measurements generally give information about the function of nerves,
      high-resolution ultrasound may provide information about the structure of nerves.

      High-resolution ultrasound examination has shown promising results as a supplementary tool in
      the diagnostic work-up of various peripheral neuropathies. The clinical utility of ultrasound
      in the diagnosis of common fibular neuropathies, however, calls for further elucidation.

      This study establishes reference material of selected lower extremity nerves at pre-defined
      sites with high-resolution ultrasound. Furthermore in this study, high-resolution ultrasound
      of patients with common fibular compression neuropathy and patients with type 2 diabetic
      polyneuropathy involving the common fibular nerve will be examined and compared to healthy
      controls, as well as each other. High-resolution ultrasound measurements will be correlated
      with history, clinical information and electrophysiological data.
