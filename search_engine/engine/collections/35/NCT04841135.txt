      control subjects, including men / women aged between 50 and 85 years. The diagnosis of AD
      patients is based on international criteria. Metagenomics and proteomics will be used to
      determine the composition of the microbiota in whole blood and stools, but also the
      metabolomic profile in plasma, stool and the urines.
