      surgeries performed on adult Americans annually (www.sts.org). The incidence of acute renal
      failure (ARF) after cardiac surgery (depending on criteria used to define ARF) is 1-5%, in
      the absence of preexisting renal dysfunction. The subset of patients with thoracic aortic
      aneurysm surgery have a higher risk for the development of postoperative ARF (25-40% - ARF
      defined as doubling of serum creatinine; 13% - ARF defined as requirement for dialysis). This
      risk is further increased by various peri-operative factors, especially cardiopulmonary
      bypass time.

      The overall postoperative mortality rate for cardiovascular surgery is 2.2%, but is much
      higher for thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery (8-10% for elective repair, 25-50% for ruptured
      thoracic aorta aneurysm repair). The major risk factor for thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery
      related mortality is post-operative ARF requiring dialysis. When thoracic aortic aneurysm
      surgery is complicated by acute renal failure, the mortality rate worsens to 50%. Thus,
      identifying ways to prevent acute renal failure may have a major impact on the outcome of
      cardiovascular surgery. A retrospective study of the use of nesiritide in cardiovascular
      surgery patients by our group has demonstrated a tendency towards a decreased incidence of
      renal failure and mortality, when the medication is used prophylactically.
