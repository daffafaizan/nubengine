      after cardiac surgery has been well established. Anaemia can impede a patient's ability to
      recover fully and participate in postoperative rehabilitation. It has been found that
      patients with a normal haemoglobin level may become anaemic during surgery. An evaluation of
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery, i.e. CABG, valve or combined CABG-valve procedures
      showed that there was a decrease in mean haemoglobin level pre-surgery two and four days
      after surgery. To date, no prospective randomised clinical study in cardiac surgery assessing
      the effect of intravenous iron supplementation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery has
      been reported. This prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study is
      planned to evaluate the effect of intravenous iron isomaltoside 1000 (MonoferÂ®) in comparison
      with placebo in non-anaemic patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
