      induces pathological changes in congenital heart defects. To test the hypothesis, it will be
      determined if the incidence of CVB infection in women with babies that are congenital heart
      defect-(CHD) affected pregnancies are higher than in control subjects.

      After informed consent participants will provide the following samples during one study
      visit: 10 mL (about 2 teaspoons) blood draw, a nose swab, provide a stool specimen (or have a
      rectal swab) and complete a study questionnaire Our 3 study groups are the following-Group 1
      is Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome or HLHS effected pregnancies. Group 2 is OCHD- Other
      Congenital Heart Defects and Group 3 is Unaffected Controls (UC) also known as healthy
      controls.

      After informed consent participants will provide the following samples: 10 mL (about 2
      teaspoons) blood draw, a nose swab, provide a stool specimen (or have a rectal swab).

      A health history review and questionnaire will also be obtained.

      Analysis of these samples(blood, stool and nose secretions), a medical history review and
      questionnaire data will help to determine if there is a link or increased risk of those who
      may be exposed to virus.

      Note- Prior to April 2016- the protocol and the healthy control (HC)subjects group were
      enrolled to come in for three study visits at varying times in their pregnancy. Blood, nose
      and stool samples were obtained at all three visits.
