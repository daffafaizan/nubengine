      syphilis knowledge among participants, while controlling for the influence of the pre-test
      knowledge survey in skewing post-knowledge survey scores. Participants in Group 1 received a
      pre-test survey, the video intervention, and the post-test survey; Group 2 received the
      pre-test and post-test surveys; Group 3 received the video intervention and post-test survey;
      and Group 4 received the post-test survey only. A computer-generated randomization list was
      used to assign participants to one of the four groups.
