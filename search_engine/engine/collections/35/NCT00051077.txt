      has become increasingly important in disease progression in the post-HAART (highly active
      antiretroviral therapy) era. The overall rate of HBV and HCV infection in HIV infected
      persons is 5% to 10%. There is convincing evidence that HIV infection exacerbates the
      severity of viral hepatitis and the progression of liver disease. Hepatitis treatment studies
      have generally excluded HIV patients with both HBV and HCV. As such, the influence of HBV on
      HCV treatment in HIV infected patients is unknown. This study will investigate the safety and
      anti-HBV efficacy of ADV + PEG-INF + RBV triple therapy in patients with HCV, HIV, and
      3TC-resistant HBV. The study will also evaluate the effect of HBV and HBV therapy on HCV and
      HIV disease progression.

      Patients with documented HIV, 3TC-resistant HBV, and HCV will be randomized to one of two
      treatment regimens for 48 weeks. Patients in both groups will receive daily oral RBV and
      weekly subcutaneous injections of PEG-INF. Patients in Group A will receive daily ADV;
      patients in Group B will receive placebo. After 48 weeks of study treatment, all study
      medications will be discontinued and patients will undergo liver biopsy. Patients will then
      be followed for an additional 24 weeks. Throughout the study, investigators will monitor
      numerous lab values and patients will be asked to complete multiple adherence questionnaires.
      Subjects who have a confirmed 2 point increase in Child-Pugh-Turcotte liver disease prognosis
      score at any time during the study will permanently discontinue PEG-INF and RBV and register
      to Step 2 to receive open label ADV.
