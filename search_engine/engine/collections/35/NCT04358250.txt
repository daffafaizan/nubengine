      modified direct superior approach (experimental approach) to the hip articulation which
      entirely spares i.e. avoids the sacrifice of the fascia lata (posterolateral approach) might
      elicit a better outcome in terms of gait, balance,strenghts recovery, clinical performance,
      patient reported outcome measurements and overall recovery time in patients undergoing
      TotalHipArthroplasty with the aid of dedicated, modified instrumentation in order to properly
      access this modified route.Two patients groups will randomly be allocated in one of the two
      group with a computer generated 1:1 randomization table.Total number of subjects
      participating in the study:50.
