      is well-documented. The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration found approximately log-linear
      adjusted associations of cholesterol concentrations with risks of first-time non-fatal
      myocardial infarction; coronary heart disease (CHD) death; ischaemic, haemorrhagic and
      unclassified stroke. They also found that triglycerides concentration was not independently
      related with CHD risk after controlling for HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, and other
      standard risk factors. The Prospective Studies Collaboration found that Higher HDL-C and
      lower non-HDL-C levels were approximately independently associated with lower ischaemic heart
      disease mortality. By focusing on broad outcomes these large meta-analyses conflate the
      association between development of the different cardiovascular disease (CVD) phenotypes,
      disease progression and mortality from cardiovascular causes.

      With linked electronic health records, we have the potential for a cohort with sufficient
      size and clinical detail to investigate the association between lipid concentrations and
      initial presentation of a range of CVD phenotypes across cerebral, coronary, abdominal and
      peripheral arterial circulations.
