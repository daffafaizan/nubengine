      personalized cancer treatments, the implantation of surgical approaches with more precise
      fields of vision and the current prognostic factors based on the quality of resection of the
      surgical specimen (intact margins and complete resection of the mesorectum), the long-term
      results for patients with rectal cancer remain grim.

      Recently, it has been shown that dysfunctional fat tissue is characterized by tissue
      remodeling, grater lipids deposits and high adipokines secretion generates a pro inflammatory
      state, hypoxia and angiogenesis. These products generated by dysfunctional peritumoral
      adipose tissue create an ideal microenvironment for initiation and tumor progression.

      The presence of microbiome in the mesentery of patients with colitis has confirmed the
      translocation of microorganisms from the intestine to adjacent tissues, together with the
      differences found in the bacterial composition in colonic mucosa and fecal samples between
      patients with rectal cancer and healthy individuals, and the prognosis value of the quality
      of mesorectum resection suggests that the microbiome present in lymph-fatty tissue in
      patients with rectal cancer may be a key element in mesorectum dysfunction, progression and
      dissemination of oncological disease.
