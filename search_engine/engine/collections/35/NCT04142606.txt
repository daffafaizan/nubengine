    
      The inclusion will take place from 16WF to 36WG, within the framework of one of the 4
      clinical subgroups of patients envisaged.

      The standardized anatomic and functional MRI examination will in all cases last less than 45
      minutes and will be based on sequences already used in clinical practice.

      Clinical, biological, and ultrasound data will be collected prospectively and used for the
      usual management of the patient. For the purposes of the study, these data will be
      secondarily anonymized and analyzed in connection with the MRI data and the perinatal outcome
      to meet the specific objectives.

      The lost-to-follow-up bias will be limited by the simplicity of the proposed perinatal
      surveillance, which does not differ from the surveillance usually recommended for these
      pregnancies
