      effectiveness, and acceptability of using the Track Health (TH) function of My HealtheVet,
      the VA's patient health record (PHR), as a tool for effecting a more positive physical
      activity (PA) and dietary intake lifestyle in overweight and obese Veterans with prediabetes.
      Baseline and three-month post-intervention outcomes were measured in two main domains:
      objective (PA as measured by an accelerometer, diet, weight, abdominal circumference, BMI,
      and blood pressure) and subjective (self-efficacy, intent to adhere to lifestyle change, and
      patient activation). Assessments, including screening on inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      physiological measurements, administration of questionnaires, and training on use of two
      critical features of the TH function--the use of Journals to enter dietary and PA data and
      the use of Vitals + Readings to enter weight and track physiological measures--took place
      place across four visits to the study site, which was the Veterans Administration Medical
      Center in Miami. The investigators hypothesized that this PHR-based intervention would
      demonstrate improvements and increases, respectively in the objective and subjective domain
      measures. The investigators also hypothesized that engagement by study participants with MHV
      would be demonstrated through meeting target criteria regarding making entries into this
      PHR's TH function, and that participants would be satisfied with the intervention.
