      radiotherapy with anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab in thoracic tumours) will be scanned both
      before and after receiving immunotherapy for NSCLC. Immunotherapy induced changes in tumour
      ADC on DW-MRI (a surrogate of apoptotic tumour cell death) will be compared with changes in
      near contemporaneous, anatomically co-registered 18FDG PET-CT SUV (a non-specific marker for
      GLUT expression and hence metabolic activity in both tumour and tumour infiltrating
      lymphocytes). For treatment response, an increase in ADC (reflecting apoptosis within the
      tumour) is expected, while 18FDG uptake is expected to decrease compared with baseline tumour
      uptake. In the presence of significant inflammatory cell recruitment, the investigators
      hypothesise a similar increase in ADC on DW-MRI but without associated reduction in 18FDG
      PET-CT SUV. Thus the relationship between the ADC change on DW-MRI and the 18FDG change
      should distinguish between response and non-response in the presence of inflammation.
