      acceleration of inflammation processes. Regular exercise has shown great potential for
      improving the health-related parameters of CKD patients. Moreover, muscle strength is
      considered to be an important predictor of protein- and energy- wasting, inflammation,
      quality of life and mortality in CKD patients. The behaviour and individual variability of
      adaptation to regular, controlled, supervised physical activities in CKD patients are not
      well defined and understood. The understanding of molecular adaptation mechanisms,
      represented by the epigenetic impact of exercise on renal specific miRNAÂ´s expression, is
      necessary for future improvements in clinical practice. Monitoring pro- and anti-inflammation
      genes activity, their transcription factors and expression of miRNA molecules (influencing
      the signalling pathways of specific genes) will enable us to draft a new transcription and
      translation model for exercise-induced adaptation in CKD patients. Additionally, our results
      will indicate the clinical value of selected markers for the diagnostics and prognostics of
      disease.
