      autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. Hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic metabolite of
      chloroquine. There is an ongoing increase in the number of patients who are using HCQ for
      prolonged duration because of the expanding indications and the relatively safe systemic
      profile.

      Hydroxychloroquine can cause variable ocular adverse effects including corneal deposits,
      posterior sub-capsular cataract, ciliary body dysfunction and toxic retinopathy. Toxic
      retinopathy caused by HCQ has been recognized for many years. Patients with toxic retinopathy
      usually complain of blurry vision. The classical clinical picture of HCQ toxic retinopathy is
      a bilateral bull's-eye maculopathy, which is caused by a ring of parafoveal RPE
      depigmentation that spares the fovea. The exact mechanism responsible for the development of
      this pattern is not fully understood, however, it is believed that the primary damage is in
      the photoreceptors and outer nuclear layer leading to secondary disruption of the RPE.
