      degree of stenosis and the presence of symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of
      embolization from an atherosclerotic plaque may be associated with plaque density as assessed
      sonographically by determination of the greyscale median. Also, an association of serum
      proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and
      pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), matrix metalloproteinases 2, 8 and 9 with unstable
      plaques has been reported.

      The VUCAP study will include patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic or
      asymptomatic carotid artery disease. Sonographic and serological markers of plaque
      vulnerability will be compared with histological features of the plaque and clinical
      presentation (symptomatic vs. asymptomatic). Preoperatively, the greyscale median of the
      plaque is assessed. Histomorphological investigation of the carotid plaques will be
      performed. Serological investigations will include markers of inflammation,
      thrombo-modulatory factors, lipid fractions and other parameters that have been associated
      with unstable plaques.

      The aim of the present study is to assess the ability of pigment epithelium-derived factor
      (PEDF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF 1-Î±),
      matrix metalloproteinases 2, 8 and 9 to differentiate between vulnerable and stable carotid
      artery plaques. Identification of 'vulnerable plaques' on the basis of a peripheral blood
      draw and a sonographic investigation may enable the treating physician to focus resources on
      patients who will benefit most form therapeutic interventions for primary prevention of
      ischemic stroke.
