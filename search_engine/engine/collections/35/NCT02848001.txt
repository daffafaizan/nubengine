    
      Study CC-90009-AML-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion,
      first-in-human clinical study of CC-90009 in subjects with relapsed or refractory acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) and relapsed or refractory high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

      The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of CC-90009 in relapsed and refractory AML. The expansion part, (Part B),
      will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90009 administered at or below the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in selected expansion cohorts of one or more dosing regimens in
      order to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for subjects with relapsed or
      refractory AML and relapsed or refractory high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.
