      after stem cell transplantation: vaccination against influenza viruses. Patients with
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation may experience serious complications of influenza and
      are at higher risk for inadequate response to the vaccine. The research project will make it
      possible, in a translational-medical orientation, to investigate the exact influence of
      genetic polymorphisms of the Interferon (IFN)-Î» signalling cascade on the immune response
      after vaccination. This knowledge will make it possible to identify high-risk patients for a
      poor vaccination response before vaccination and to personalize the current vaccination
      strategy (intra-muscular injection), e.g. by subcutaneous vaccination, repeated
      administration of the vaccine or vaccine with adjuvants.
