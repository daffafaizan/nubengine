      the 4 planned dose cohorts according to a standard dose escalation study design. A disease
      assessment will be performed at study week 9 (+/- 3 days). The assessment will be based on
      clinical signs and symptoms, changes in radiographic images, and changes in CA-125 levels.
      Subjects without evidence of disease progression may continue to receive AGS-8M4 during the
      extended treatment period at the dose and schedule of their assigned cohort until disease
      progression intolerability of AGS-8M4 or consent withdrawal. For subjects that continue
      dosing, disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during the extended treatment
      period. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last infusion of AGS-8M4.
