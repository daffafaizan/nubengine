    
      The study will investigate the effect of one year of participation in a lifestyle-
      intervention- program on the participants' metabolic risk profile, exercise capacity and
      vascular health. A primary focus is on the endothelium, because poor endothelial health is a
      risk factor and prognostic indicator of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.

      Hypothesis: One year of participation in endurance exercise (twice a week for 90 minutes) may
      positively influence endothelial health (RHI)

      The primary aim:

      change in endothelial function (reactive hyperemia index (RHI)) after one year.

      Secondary aims:

      Changes in other vascular parameters (AI: augmentation index, CAVI: Cardio ankle vascular
      index, ABI: ankle brachial index ), changes in anthropometric, inflammatory and metabolic
      parameters, exercise capacity (Watt/kg), physical activity, and health related quality of
      life (HRQoL).
