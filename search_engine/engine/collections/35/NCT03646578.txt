      This study assessed whether or not specific written information about prematurity delivered
      at admission to the unit combined with an oral explanation from a pediatrician would decrease
      women's anxiety compared to an oral explanation alone. Material and methods.This was a
      prospective, single-center observational study.Women were included in the high-risk
      pregnancies department and distributed into two groups: receiving ''only oral'' information
      for a prenatal clinical consultation with a senior pediatrician or receiving ''combined''
      oral information

      + a booklet about prematurity given to the women at admission.
