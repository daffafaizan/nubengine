      are usually treated with surgical bypass. This condition is known as Critical Limb Ischemia
      or CLI. Over the last decade, advances in techniques and tools have allowed surgeons to more
      aggressively treat complex cases. Studies have shown successful treatment of CLI with
      endovascular techniques (less invasive surgical procedures through a small incision for the
      treatment of vascular disease), including laser atherectomy and angioplasty. Surgical
      guidelines are not clear as to the best procedure to use for CLI. To the best of our
      knowledge, a study comparing laser atherectomy and angioplasty has not been done. Laser
      atherectomy works by releasing ultraviolet light which is absorbed by the plaque in the
      arteries. This will then get rid of the plaque. Angioplasty is a procedure used to open
      blocked or narrowed arteries. Currently, it is not known if laser atherectomy has better
      results than angioplasty.
