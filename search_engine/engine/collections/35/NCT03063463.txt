      clinic visits with the principal investigator as part of their routine care will be
      considered for participation in this study. Blood work, vital signs, and 24-hour dietary
      recall will be collected over a period of one year. These data will lay the foundation for
      future scientific endeavors to : a) assess requirements for dietary and/or nutritional
      supplements; b) formulate an achalasia diet; c) develop clinical practice standards; and d)
      design an intervention study.
