      diabetics. The current first line standard of care continues to be MDI therapy utilizing a
      long acting analog insulin. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGMS) is currently used by
      clinicians to record continuous, retrospective glucose measurements, which aid in
      identification of glycemic excursion patterns. This data is then used to make future therapy
      change recommendations. The MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System transmits real-time glucose
      measurements to the insulin pump every 5 minutes, allowing users to view their current
      glucose values, as well as to review glycemic excursions and trends over a 24-hour period.
      Additionally, data can be downloaded from the monitor to a personal computer, using
      appropriate software, so that the patient and physician can see a complete picture of glucose
      trends over time. The System will also alert users of high and low glucose levels, and allow
      subjects and their clinicians to treat to a therapeutic target HbA1c under carefully
      monitored conditions.

      Subjects wearing the MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System will be compared to subjects that
      continue on their current MDI therapy, that includes a long acting analog insulin, over a 12
      month period to evaluate changes in glycemic control (HbA1c).
