    
      AXAFA is an open-label trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two types of
      anticoagulant therapy, VKA therapy and therapy with the direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban,
      in patients undergoing scheduled catheter ablation for AF. All patients will undergo the
      ablation procedure after pre-treatment with an anticoagulant (either apixaban in the "Xa
      group" or a vitamin K antagonist in the "VKA group").

      Patients can undergo catheter ablation within the trial after at least 30 days of continuous
      effective anticoagulation. Ablation can be performed earlier when or timely after exclusion
      of atrial thrombi have been excluded by a clinically indicated by transthoracic
      echocardioggram (TEE). After TEE continuous effective anticoagulation must be ensured until
      the end of the trial.

      In the MRI-substudy will be explored wether novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have the
      potential to reduce clinically silent brain lesions after catheter ablation of AF.
