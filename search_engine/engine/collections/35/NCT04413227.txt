      metatatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or other solid tumors.There will be five cohorts
      planning as following:

      cohort 1: PEG-ENDO 1 mg/kg+Docetaxel 75 mg/m2,once every 3 weeks at day 1 cohort 2: PEG-ENDO
      2mg/kg+Docetaxel 75 mg/m2,once every 3 weeks at day 1 cohort 3: PEG-ENDO 4 mg/kg+Docetaxel 75
      mg/m2,once every 3 weeks at day 1 cohort 4: PEG-ENDO 6 mg/kg+Docetaxel75 mg/m2,once every 3
      weeks at day 1 cohort 5: PEG-ENDO 8 mg/kg+Docetaxel75 mg/m2, once every 3 weeks at day 1

      * Every 3 weeks as a treatment cycle. Subjects received only PEG-ENDO in the first cycle. For
      second cycle or the higher, they received a combination therapy of PEG-ENDO and docetaxel.
      Docetaxel was limited in 4 or 6 cycles。 The observation period of DLT was the 21 days after
      the first administration of PEG-ENDO. During the observation period of DLT (cycle 1),
      subjects only receive the corresponding dose of PEG-ENDO , for the second cycle and higher
      ,they will treated with the combination of PEG-ENDO and Docetaxel until disease progression
      (PD) or intolerance . Docetaxel was limited in 4 or 6 cycles。
