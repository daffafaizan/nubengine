      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) as second line treatment in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received non-gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in the
      first line setting. All patients will receive both drugs on Days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days. The
      hypothesis is that this combination will have a 4-month progression free survival of 70% or
      higher.
