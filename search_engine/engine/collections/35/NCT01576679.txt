      somewhat subjective and the dosage guidelines vary between institutions. Some studies have
      suggested that it be administered at, or soon after, the time of drainage if the ultrasound
      appearance of the collection is complex and/or septated, or if the initial aspirated contents
      are thick and viscous. Both criteria are difficult to accurately define and implement. In
      many instances, when there is minimal ongoing drainage despite follow-up ultrasound
      appearances suggesting a significant residual collection, tPA is administered several days
      following the initial procedure.

      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of tPA in the initial treatment of all
      pediatric intra-abdominal abcesses and a standardized manner in which it can be used. This
      may eventually lead to a change in practice in the management of this patient population.
