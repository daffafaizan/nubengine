        -  Evaluate the feasibility of sequential therapy with carboplatin, etoposide,
           cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, topotecan and radiotherapy followed by autologous bone
           marrow transplantation in patients with extrachoroidal or metastatic retinoblastoma.

        -  Assess this treatment regimen in terms of response and toxicity before and after
           autologous bone marrow transplantation in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour daily on days
      1-3 of weeks 0, 6, and 12, plus cyclophosphamide IV or orally daily on days 1-7, doxorubicin
      IV on day 8 and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 10 on weeks 3, 9, and 15. Beginning on week
      6, patients receive concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week over 4-6 weeks. Patients with
      meningeal involvement receive topotecan intrathecally twice weekly for 3 weeks and then
      weekly for 3 weeks before starting radiotherapy. Beginning one day after each treatment
      course, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 10 days.

      Patients undergo bone marrow collection before or after week 6. Following hematologic
      recovery, patients receive several days of high dose chemotherapy consisting of
      cyclophosphamide and topotecan followed by bone marrow reinfusion.

      Patients are followed at 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
