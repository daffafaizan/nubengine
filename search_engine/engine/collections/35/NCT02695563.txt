    
      Pregnant women undergoing genetic amniocentesis within the 16th-18th gestational week will be
      enrolled at the Obstetric Unit, University of Ferrara.

      The selected patients will be randomly assigned to receive a vaginal compound containing 300
      mg of lactoferrin 4 hours before amniocentesis or they will be untreated (controls).

      Amniotic fluid samples will be obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis and the sample not
      required for clinical purposes will be centrifuged to remove particulate material and the
      supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C until assay.
