      performance in type 2 diabetes (DM2) patients with diastolic dysfunction, compared to
      placebo. Furthermore, analyzing cardiac MRI indices of fibrosis and the effect on myocardial
      perfusion.

      The investigators find that especially diastolic dysfunction is of interest, because it is
      highly overrepresented in DM2 patients and no treatment exists. Glucagon-like peptide 1
      analogue could be a possible treatment agent, by increasing the energy level in the
      myocardium. No previous study has tested the effect of treatment with a glucagon-like peptide
      1 analogue on diastolic dysfunction.

      Design: A randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sample size: 40
      patients, 20 in each group. The superior inter-study reproducibility results in considerably
      lower calculated sample sizes (reductions of 55% to 93%) required by cardiac MR compared with
      echocardiography to show clinically relevant changes. Power calculations show that only 30
      patients are needed form our primary outcome, to allow for dropouts the investigators have
      chosen to include 40 patients.

      Intervention: After randomization, patients will be treated with placebo or liraglutide (up
      to 1.8 mg s.c. once daily). Total treatment period will be 18 weeks. A cardiac MRI scan and
      an echocardiography will be preformed at baseline and after 18 weeks.
