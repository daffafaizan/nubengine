      and functional limitation. It is a major arm disorder which occurs commonly in adults between
      30 and 50 years, with an estimated prevalence of 1% to 3% in the general population. Lateral
      epicondylitis results from the overuse of the extensor muscles, causing inflammation or
      irritation of the tendon insertion. It is common in workers whose job requires manual and
      repetitive work .

      Although different nonsurgical conservative therapies such as bracing, physical therapy,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections in addition to surgical
      approaches have been used, yet there is no standard treatment for lateral epicondylitis.

      To our knowledge, there are no studies that used nerve-stimulator-guided radial nerve block
      for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.
