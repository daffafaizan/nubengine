           A small amount of electrical current is passed. The cortical evoked responses to the
           anal and rectal electrical stimulation is measured from the scalp using a
           neurophysiology recorder.

        2. Motor evoked potentials: A magnetic coil is placed on the scalp at the anorectal
           cortical site and discharged using magnetic energy. The anal and rectal motor evoked
           potentials are then measured using a probe with 2 ring electrodes.
