      objective measurements to correlate the improvement of the knee mobility with the pain
      reduction of the affected knee in the patients assuming nutraceutical containing HA.

      The secondary objectives of the trial are:

        -  to assess the feasibility of implementing Actigraphy as objective measurements to
           correlate the improvement of the knee mobility with the pain reduction (optional).

        -  to evaluate the enrollment range in one month.

      The explorative objectives of the trial are:

      • Preliminary data on efficacy of the tested product
