      estimated to reduce the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in children by up to 70-80%, but protection
      is incomplete. Efforts to increase TB protection in children include new vaccines for primary
      immunizations as well as combinations of vaccines given as primary and boosting vaccinations.

      AERAS 402 is a live recombinant serotype 35 replication deficient adenovirus vector
      expressing a fusion protein of three Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens (Ag85A, Ag85B
      and TB10.4). It presents Mtb antigens in the setting of a new, live, replication-deficient
      adenovirus vaccine that may increase T cell-mediated immunity and thus protection from
      tuberculosis. AERAS-402 appears safe and immunogenic in adults. Since BCG-vaccinated infants
      are the population for which AERAS-402 might be indicated, AERAS-402 will be administered to
      infants of at least 16 weeks of age who have already been vaccinated with BCG. This is the
      first Phase II study of AERAS-402 in infants.
