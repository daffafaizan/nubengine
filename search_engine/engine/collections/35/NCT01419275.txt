      largely determined by the ability of collateral flow networks to supply blood to ischemic
      tissue via circuitous routes that bypass the proximal clot. Robust collateral flow can
      improve response to thrombolytic therapy and decrease the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
      Despite their central importance, collaterals during acute stroke are poorly understood,
      largely because assessment has required an invasive imaging test, cerebral angiography. This
      proposal assesses whether a noncontrast MRI perfusion technique, called arterial spin
      labeling (ASL), can yield important information about collateral flow.
