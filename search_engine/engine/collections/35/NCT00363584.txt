      Primary

        -  To determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine has any effect on 2-year
           survival compared to expectant treatment alone (observation) in patients who have
           undergone a macroscopically complete surgical resection of a biliary tract cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare capecitabine versus observation in terms of 5-year survival, relapse-free
           survival, toxicity, quality of life, and health economics.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study. Patients are stratified
      according to surgical center, disease site (hilar/extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs gallbladder vs intrapancreatic/common bile duct), type of
      resection (R0 vs R1), and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice a day on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
           every 3 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo expectant treatment (observation). Quality of life is assessed
           at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      All patients are followed for up to 5 years post-randomization.
