      loss-of-function models suggest a physiological role for TGR5 activation on GLP-1 secretion
      in rodents. TGR5 signaling showed improved postprandial glucose tolerance in obese mice,
      associated with marked postprandial GLP-1 release and insulin secretion. In contrast, TGR5-/-
      mice exhibited reduced glucose tolerance. In animals, TGR5 activation has been shown for
      natural bile acids (BAs) and triterpenoid compounds of plant origin, such as oleanolic acid
      (OA), suggesting a role for postprandial BAs in modulating nutrient-induced GLP-1 secretion.
      We therefore hypothesized that intraduodenal (ID) perfusions of TGR5 agonists (BAs and OA)
      stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 with respective changes in the glucose metabolism of healthy
      humans.
