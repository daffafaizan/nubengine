      (HD). HD may lead to increased inflammatory response through a number of mechanisms; some of
      these factors also result in pro-inflammatory cytokine release and consequently cause the
      overlap between anemia, accelerated atherosclerosis and inflammation. HD-related inflammation
      is mainly due to underlying kidney disease, coexisting comorbidities, uremia per se, dialyzer
      membrane biocompatibility and contaminated dialysis fluid. Accordingly, HD patients are
      chronically exposed to microinflammation as a result of blood-membrane interaction and
      dialysis fluid contamination. Among these factors, biofilm formation and contaminated
      dialysis fluid are closely related to enhanced immune activation in HD patients. Furthermore,
      only dialysis fluid quality is controllable and preventable. Therefore, to correct rHuEPO
      poor response and reduce the cardiovascular (CV) events, it prompts us to conduct a
      prospective randomized controlled study to explore as to whether heat disinfection link in HD
      water treatment system can effectively prevent biofilm formation, to ensure the dialysis
      fluid purity, and subsequently to improve the patient outcome, in terms of CV events and
      mortality.
