      immunomodulatory agents for decades, and there is a wealth of information on their
      immunosuppressive effects in animals and in human cells cultured in vitro. However, despite
      their ubiquitous clinical use, there is a paucity of information on the effects of
      corticosteroids administered to humans systemically, and no previous study has examined their
      effects on the human immunome.

      Therefore the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes
      this protocol designed to obtain blood from healthy adult subjects at baseline, and then at
      various time points after administration of 250 mg and 50 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone.
      These samples will be used to perform a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the immune
      system in response to corticosteroid administration. To our knowledge, this protocol will be
      the first study to characterize the human cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or
      immunome, in healthy adult subjects after administration of corticosteroids. This information
      may be useful in understanding the mechanistic effects of this commonly prescribed class of
      medications in humans.

      The primary objective is to perform laboratory studies to characterize the immune response in
      healthy adult volunteers after administration of moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses of
      the glucocorticoid hydrocortisone. Primary endpoint is the results of the research laboratory
      assessments. As samples will be stored indefinitely, the time frame for primary endpoint is
      indefinite.
