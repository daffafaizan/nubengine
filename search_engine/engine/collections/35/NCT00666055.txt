    
      Purpose: To longitudinally quantify systemic and genital tract antiretroviral
      pharmacokinetics and viral responses in HIV-infected post-menopausal women. These parameters
      will be compared to pre-menopausal women to determine if the absence or presence of estrogen
      influences treatment responses and infectiousness of HIV.

      Participants: 30 post-menopausal and 12 pre-menopausal HIV-infected women Procedures
      (methods): First dose, steady state, and longitudinal pharmacokinetics of the most commonly
      prescribed antiretroviral agents will be assessed in the systemic and genital tract
      compartments in a cohort of post- and pre-menopausal HIV-infected women. Concurrent blood
      plasma and genital secretions HIV RNA will be measured. Systemic and genital tract virologic
      responses will be correlated with antiretroviral concentrations and with each other.
