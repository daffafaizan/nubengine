    
      This is a Phase III, prospective, pragmatic, randomized, controlled and open-label trial,
      comparing standard of care vs. standard of care plus COLCHICINE for 14 days, in patients
      hospitalized due to COVID-19 and confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2, within the first 48 hours
      after the hospital admission. Patients meeting severity criteria will be excluded, defined as
      established limitation of therapeutic effort or need for invasive mechanical ventilation at
      the time of inclusion. The Colchicine treatment includes an initial dose of 1.5 mg (1 mg and
      0.5 mg two hours after), followed by 0.5 mg every 12 hours during the next 7 days and 0.5 mg
      every 24 hours until the completion of 14 days of total treatment. In patients receiving
      ritonavir or lopinavir or with reduced renal clearance (<50 ml/min/1.37m2), weight <70 kg or
      age >75 years old, the dose will be adjusted to the half.

      Patiens meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion ones (see below), after
      signing the informed consent, will be centrally randomized to "Colchicine" or "Control"
      group. Patients in both groups will receive the standard therapy for COVID-19 as per the
      hospital protocols. Randomization will be controlled by: age, sex, time from initiation of
      symptoms, cardiovascular disease, the 7 point WHO and levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin,
      D-dimer, IL-6 and lymphocyte levels.
