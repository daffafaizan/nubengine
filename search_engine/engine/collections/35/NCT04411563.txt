      causes different biological behavioral patterns in individuals, 2) To determine the role of
      epigenetic mechanisms here to detect the difference between individuals, 3)To determine the
      effectiveness of this behavior model and mechanisms on clinical treatment and to ensure that
      the results obtained are a step for further treatment studies, 4) To evaluate whether the
      data obtained in MicroRNA analysis is a predictive marker on prognosis. Material and methods
      Study design This is an observational prospective cohort study. In the power analysis
      performed with the G * power 3.1 programs related to our study, the effect size for the
      lymphocyte percentage and C-reactive protein was found to be 0.57 (Effective Treatment of
      Severe COVID-19 Patients with Tocilizumab) (alpha probability of error = 0.05); in the sample
      width analysis, taking the power value 0.80, the total number of patients to be collected was
      105 (105/3 = 35 for each group).

      Patient's criteria This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (2011-
      CREC-40) at Bakırköy Dr.Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital and informed consent will
      be obtained from all patients according to the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval
      of the local ethical committee number is 2020/143 (2011-CREC-40). Patients enrolled in this
      study will be admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Department and
      the Intensive Care Department from May 2020 to September 2020. Diagnosis of COVID 19 will be
      depending upon the presence of specific lesions in lungs confirmed by computed tomography
      (CT), and/or laboratory findings according to the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health
      diagnostic criteria.

      Inclusion criteria All patients between the ages of 18 and 65 included will suffer from COVID
      19, and specific treatment should not yet be initiated. COVID 19 diagnosis of patients will
      be based on full medical history, thorough clinical examination, radiological imaging,
      laboratory assessment, and SARS-CoV-2 analysis by RT-PCR.

      Exclusion criteria

        1. People with chronic lung disease or previous AC surgery

        2. People with immune deficiency or cancer patients

        3. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune disease

        4. People with neurological diseases affecting the respiratory muscles, such as hypotonia.

      On the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria 105 patients subjects will be included
      in this study, divided into three groups; group I (n = 35) patients are mild, group II (n =
      35) patients are moderate, and group III (n = 35) patients are severe and critical. Mild and
      moderate cases are usually defined as those without severe pneumonia or severe acute
      respiratory syndrome. Mild symptoms are low-grade fever (not more than 38 degrees celsius),
      dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, headache, the new loss of taste, and smell. Patients with
      normal or mild pneumonia findings of radiological imaging and blood lymphocyte count ≥800 /
      µl and serum CRP≤40 mg /l, ferritin ≤500ng/ml, D-Dimer ≤1000 ng/ml will be included in group
      I. Moderate symptoms are fever of about 38,5-39 degrees celsius, chills, deep cough, fatigue
      and body aches, muscle pain, the general feeling of being unwell. Patients with bilateral
      diffuse pneumonia findings of radiological imaging or blood lymphocyte count <800 / µl or
      serum CRP> 40 mg / l or ferritin> 500ng / ml or D-Dimer> 1000 ng / ml will be included in
      group II. Severe symptoms are all the common symptoms mentioned above along with shortness of
      breath, chest discomfort, confusion/unresponsiveness, bluish face/lips, possible
      gastrointestinal issues, like diarrhea or nausea. Patients with ICU (intensive care unit)
      admission criteria, such as confusion or tachycardia (> 125 / min) or respiratory distress or
      tachypnea (> 22 / min) or hypotension <90/60 mmHg or SPO2 <93%will be included in group III.
      Also, patients with the central nervous system and heart involvement will be directly
      included in the severe case group.

      Specimen collection and handling About 10 ml of peripheral venous blood will be collected
      under strict aseptic conditions by clean venipuncture using vacuum blood collection tubes and
      will be distributed as 3 ml in EDTA tubes for complete blood count and DNA extraction, 3 ml
      in another sterile special RNA protective tube (stored at -80 °C) for miRNA extraction. In
      addition, 4 ml in a plane tube will be allowed to clot at the room temperature and then will
      be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and the collected serum will be stored at -80°C to
      be used for analyzing cytokine, and other specific tests.On the 7th day of treatment, second
      samples will be taken under the same conditions and finally, on the 21st day, third samples
      will be taken.

      The motivation element behind the choice of miRNAs in the current work is a product of the
      following integrated online databases for miRNA target prediction and functional
      analysis.http://microrna.osumc.edu, https://www.genecards.org. http://www.mirdb.org/miRDB/
      Gene association networks with ACE2, TMPRSS2, PARP, HOX1 genes in COVID 19 cases were
      analyzed using GeneMANIA (Multiple Association Network Integration Algorithm) for prediction
      of possible functional interactions among them (http://www. genemania.org).
