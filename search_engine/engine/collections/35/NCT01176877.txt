      that caused them. Patients with darker pigmented skin are more likely to develop keloids, and
      blacks are especially predisposed to keloid formation. Treatment options for keloids are
      limited in that new keloids often form at the treated location. The limited efficacy of
      professional treatment options and the harmless appearance of small keloid scars may lead a
      patient to try to manage their keloid scars on their own. One source of information that
      patients may turn to for self-treatment advice is the Internet.
