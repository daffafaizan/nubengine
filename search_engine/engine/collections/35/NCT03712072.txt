    
      This is a non-interventional study designed to assess changes in the sensorimotor cortex of
      children with CP as a result of PV-WMI and children with BPBP that combines multiple
      neuroimaging techniques to better visualize the resulting brain reorganization. The study
      design will be a mixed 3 (group: CP, BPBP, TD) x 2 (hemisphere: more affected, less affected)
      analysis of variance (ANOVA), with group being a between-subject factor and hemisphere a
      within-subjects factor.

      The research study plans to recruit and test 30 children with CP due to PV-WMI, 30 children
      with BPBP, and 30 aged-matched and typically developing (TD) children aged from 0 to 18 years
      old.

      Data from the participants will be collected over the course of four visits: (i) the
      recording session for the MEG, (ii) the recording session for the EEG, (iii) the MRI scanning
      session, and (iv) the TMS session. TD, CP, and BPBP subjects will be asked to commit to these
      visits.

      The MEG session will last ~3 hours with the actual measurements lasting ~60 minutes, the EEG
      session will last ~2 hours with the actual measurements lasting ~60 minutes, the MRI visit
      will last ~1 hour with the actual acquisition scan timing lasting ~30 minutes, and the TMS
      visit will last ~1 and a half hours with the actual acquisition time lasting ~45 minutes.
      Depending on the participant, the behavioral tests may be administered during any of the
      visits that the child is most comfortable and able to perform them.
