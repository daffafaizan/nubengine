        -  To determine the feasibility and acute patient tolerance of intraoperative electron
           irradiation (IOERT) and hypofractionated external-beam irradiation (HYPORT) after
           lumpectomy for patients with stage I-IIA breast cancer treated with breast conservation
           therapy.

        -  To determine the local tumor control and distant tumor control rates for patients with
           stage I-IIA breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy using IOERT and
           HYPORT after lumpectomy.

        -  To determine the long-term side effects and cosmetic outcome of IOERT to tumor bed and
           HYPORT after lumpectomy for patients with stage I-IIA breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo lumpectomy per standard procedures. Patients undergo intraoperative
      electron irradiation (IOERT) to the tumor bed right after completion of lumpectomy with
      axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy.

      Beginning 2-6 weeks after lumpectomy with axillary lymph node dissection/sentinel lymph node
      sampling and IOERT, patients receive hypofractionated external-beam irradiation once daily
      for 16 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 5
      years, and then annually thereafter for 8 years.
