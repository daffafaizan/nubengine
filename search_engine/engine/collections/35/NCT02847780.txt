      explaining the procedure and written informed consent, all included patients in the study
      will be assessed for vocal cord mobility by C-Mac video laryngoscope (manufactured by KARL
      STORZ Video Laryngoscopes) followed by airway ultrasonography (USG). Linear transducer (7.5
      MHz) will be used for scanning the airway placed at the level of thyroid cartilage with 10-15
      degree cephalad tilt so to get proper acoustic window and for optimal visualization of
      laryngeal structures. C-Mac video laryngoscope will be required for virtual visualization of
      glottis apertures and vocal cord movement. All patients will be scanned pre-operatively by
      indirect laryngoscopy to see vocal cord mobility as a reference value. Immediately after
      extubation the patient will be scanned for vocal cord mobility by videolaryngoscope by first
      examiner, After oxygenation and stabilization of haemodynamic, ultrasound of airway will be
      performed to study the vocal cord movement by the other examiner (blinded to the laryngoscopy
      finding).Visibility of false vocal cords, true vocal cords and arytenoids will be given one
      point each for one side, maximal score will be 6. According to points the acoustic window
      scoring for glottis aperture will be graded as fair (score1-2), good(score3-4) and very
      good(score5-6) Findings of both the examiners will be collected by the primary investigator
      for data collection and analysis.
