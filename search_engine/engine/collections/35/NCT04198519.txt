      risk factor for chronic diseases. According to the American Heart Association, most
      cardiovascular events can be prevented by adhering to healthy practices, reflecting
      cardiovascular health as poor, intermediate, and ideal. Methods: Both sexes, aged between 40
      and 70 years, with body mass index ≥ 30 and < 40 kg/m² will be included and clinical,
      anthropometric, body composition and laboratory tests will be assessed. In vascular tests,
      the investigators will evaluate the sympathetic tone using a frequency meter (Polar® RS800),
      oscillometric pulse wave analysis by Mobil-O-Grah®, post-occlusive microvascular reactivity
      and carotid ultrasound to measure intimamedia thickness. In the sleep study, the
      investigators will analyze the presence and degree of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) through
      the home polysomnography device (WatchPAT 200®). The first visit will be for screening,
      clinical and anthropometric evaluation. On the second visit, the vascular tests, instructions
      and device delivery for sleep study will be performed. Patients will return the following day
      to return the WatchPAT and to receive the hypocaloric nutritional intervention (800kcal
      reduction of daily total energy value), which should be followed for 16 weeks. Eight weeks
      after the beginning of the nutritional intervention a new visit will be scheduled for
      clinical, nutritional assessment and dietary adjustment. After completing 16 weeks, the
      patients will return for clinical, laboratory, nutritional, vascular and sleep tests.
