      interventions is limited. We will test the effectiveness of a telephone based intervention
      program called Learning through Play plus Interpersonal Psychotherapy (LTP Plus) that can be
      used by non-specialists, including trained graduates, mothers and lay health workers with
      minimal training. This telephone communication will be supplemented by the provision of LTP
      Plus pictorial calendars to the depressed mothers.

      Purpose of this RCT is to determine if telephone delivered intervention of the LTP plus
      programme reduces symptoms of maternal depression and improves infant development compared to
      Treatment as usual. A sample of 354 (177 in each group) will be required. The study will be
      conducted in big cities of Pakistan including Karachi, Lahore, Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Quetta
      and Peshawar.Participants will be screened using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and
      eligibility checklist. Those scoring 10 and above on PHQ-9 will be invited to participate in
      the study. Assessments will be done at baseline and after completion of intervention (3rd
      month and 6th month after randomization). All follow ups will be done by independent Research
      Assistants (RAs), blind to the treatment allocations.
