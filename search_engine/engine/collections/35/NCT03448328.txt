      or apple juice (parallel group design). Study participants will come to the lab at 7:00 am
      Monday through Friday in an overnight fasted state and provide a blood sample (maximum of 30
      ml or two tablespoons). The blood samples will be analyzed for various measures of muscle
      damage and inflammation, and extra samples will be stored for additional measurements
      depending on funding.

      After the blood draw, participants will provide a muscle soreness rating. Next, the two
      protein sources (pea and whey protein), will be consumed at a weight adjusted amount (0.3
      grams of protein per kilogram of body weight), and administered under double blind
      procedures. The amount of apple juice will be adjusted to body weight (1.2 calories per
      kilogram body weight).

      Four muscle function tests will be conducted: vertical jump, bench press, leg-back strength,
      and anaerobic power through the 30-second Wingate test. These performance tests will be
      administered before and after the 90-minute eccentric muscle exercise bout, and each of the
      following four mornings of recovery.

      After taking the four performance tests, participants will engage in 90-minutes of eccentric
      exercise. Immediately following exercise, participants will provide a muscle soreness rating
      and a blood sample, ingest another protein dose (0.3 g/kg) (or apple juice), and then take
      the four muscle function tests. Participants will return at 7 am in an overnight fasted state
      four days in a row after the eccentric exercise bout, and provide muscle soreness ratings and
      blood samples followed by ingestion of the protein supplements or apple juice. Following
      ingestion of the supplements, participants will take the four muscle function tests.
