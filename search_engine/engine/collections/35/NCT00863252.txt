    
      (i) STUDY DESIGN

      This will be a prospective, randomized, open-label, case-controlled study. Patients of either
      gender with biopsy-proven IgAN and clinically significant proteinuria despite being on ACEI
      treatment will be potential candidates (see selection criteria). Eligible patients will be
      randomized into either of the following groups:

      Group I (Intervention arm):

      Patients will be given MMF at a daily dose of 1.5 g orally in 2 divided doses in addition to
      concurrent medications, including ACEI. Duration of therapy is expected to be six months.

      Group II (Control arm):

      Patient will continue to receive all concurrent medications, including ACEI or angiotensin
      receptor blocker, at the discretion of the attending renal physician.

      (ii) PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA Inclusion criteria

        -  Males or females between the ages of 18 and 70 years

        -  Renal biopsy showing a histological diagnosis IgAN, with predominant or codominant
           mesangial deposition of IgA on immunofluorescent studies

        -  Daily urinary protein excretion > 1 g on at least 3 separate occasions

        -  Serum creatinine < 400 umol/L

        -  Patients who are willing to give written informed consent and to participate in and
           comply with the study protocol

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to MMF

        -  Patients receiving treatment with other cytotoxic agents

        -  Serum creatinine > 400 umol/L

        -  Women who are lactating, pregnant or of childbearing potential not using, or who are
           unwilling to use, a reliable contraceptive method during and for 6 weeks following
           conclusion of MMF therapy. A pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy will be performed for
           women of childbearing potential prior to recruitment

        -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to give written informed consent and to participate
           in and comply with the study protocol

        -  Presence of systemic infection or malignancy requiring therapy at the time of entry to
           the study

        -  Patients simultaneously participating in another study or who have participated in
           another study within the last 30 days of entry into this study

      (iii) PATIENT MONITORING

      Patient record

      The record of every recruited patient will contain the following information:

        -  Demographic data

        -  Medical history including concomitant illness

        -  All concomitant medications

        -  Other significant information

      Timing of Assessments

      All study assessments will be calculated from the date of study entry. The study follow-up
      schedule will be as follows:

        -  Baseline, then

        -  Two-weekly for the first month, then

        -  Monthly for the 2nd - 6th month, at the end of which MMF will be withdrawn, then

        -  Three-monthly until at least 5 years of follow up
