      obesity treatment intervention for children 8-11 years of age in gender-specific groups and
      their parents in a clinic setting. The targeted lifestyle components of the intervention are
      less TV viewing, less sweetened beverages, smaller food portions, less fast food/better
      choices away from home and more general physical activity. The psychosocial component was
      based in Resiliency; the Choices model focused on a non-judgmental approach to empowerment in
      relation to personal goals and knowledge of the basics of nutrition and physical activity.

      Our aim was to recruit 35-40 children (approximately equal boys and girls) ages 8-11 and
      their parents for a 12 weekly sessions group office visit program. Participants were
      randomized into 2 groups; one group starting in March 2006 and the lagged intervention
      control group starting in September 2006. Physical measurements and data collection were at
      baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16 months from randomization.

      We evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of the group office visit model and effect
      size (body mass index (BMI) and weight-for-age Z-scores). Feasibility and acceptability
      included ability to recruit within clinics, attendance, completion, follow-up rates, focus
      groups data and interviews of those who drop out. Evaluation of effect size included the
      patterns of growth over 15 months from baseline in relation to expected growth patterns and
      intervention exposure.
