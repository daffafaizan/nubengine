      neurodegenerative diseases or stroke. The literature seems to agree on the relationship
      between hypertension and brain damage, and on the benefit of the management of hypertension
      to prevent certain neurological pathologies. However, to our knowledge, no single study has
      shown signs of subclinical brain damage in patients with hypertension. At present, no brain
      MRI is recommended in these patients. In the present study, hypertensive and normotensive
      patients will undergo a neurological exam, a neuropsychological exam, a biological exam and a
      MRI exam to individually identify signs of cerebral suffering.
