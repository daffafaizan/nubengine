    
      The Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is a surgical procedure which has been used for more than
      half a century in the treatment of hip joint diseases.

      The Physiotherapy is an important component in the care of patients undergoing THA.

      In order to reduce the length of hospitalization after THA, to promote functional
      independence and to monitor clinical events during hospitalization and up to the 30th
      postoperative day, the Hip Surgery Group (HSG) of the Department of Orthopedics and
      Traumatology Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto
      Alegre (HCPA) has developed a global, multidisciplinary Assistance Protocol of the HSG with
      outpatient consultations and scheduled home visits for patients that have undergone THA at
      HCPA.

      The team which developed the Assistance Protocol of the HSG consists of orthopedic doctors
      and anesthesiologists, nurses and social workers.

      The insertion of the Physiotherapist in the THA Assistance Protocol is of great importance
      owing to the professional skills of that professional in the areas of prevention and
      rehabilitation, working with the multidisciplinary team in functional evaluation and in
      physical therapy of patients that underwent THA.

      The monitoring of the physiotherapist is essential to establish a functional diagnosis,
      aiming pain relief, promoting the early functional rehabilitation, the reintegration of the
      patients in their daily activities and offering a better quality of life through
      reintegration into social life.
