        -  Assess the six-month overall survival of patients with unresectable or metastatic
           hepatocellular carcinoma treated with gemcitabine and docetaxel.

        -  Determine tumor response and time to progression in this patient population treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 15-60 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks. Patients achieving complete response after
      2 courses of therapy receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients with stable disease or
      partial response continue therapy until disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
