      changes in visible skin topography in the form of protrusions and depressions, mainly located
      in the lower limbs and abdominal region. It is a non-inflammatory and degenerative condition
      whose etiology has not been fully elucidated until now, although it can be explained by
      varied theories: the hormonal ,that is related to estrogen, the morphological one, based on
      alterations of the adipose tissue that is related to the interlobular septa of connective
      tissue that interconnects the subcutaneous adipose lobes, these septa are thin and have
      perpendicular projections, which favors the deposition of adipose tissue and its expansion to
      the surface of the dermis. The last one is about microcirculation deficits that can lead to
      intracellular edema and reduction of lymphatic drainage.

      Shock wave therapy appears to be a safe and effective therapy to act in this disorder. It
      generates mechanical pressure waves in the tissues, promoting cavitation phenomena that
      produces lipolysis by destroying the cell membrane of adipocytes, increasing blood flow in
      the region, and stimulating lymphatic drainage.

      On the other hand, there are studies that report that improvement in the appearance of GL is
      associated with a decrease in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Physiologically, aerobic physical
      exercise has the capacity to decrease body fat, taking into account that the oxidation
      reactions of fatty acids are enhanced, with moderate intensity exercise.

      In this sense, it may be beneficial to associate Shockwave Therapy and Physical Exercise to
      reduce GL severity, so this study aims to analyze the effect of radial shock wave therapy in
      association with the performance of an aerobic exercise program, in female subjects, in the
      degree of GL severity in the gluteal region and â…“ proximal posterior of the thighs.
