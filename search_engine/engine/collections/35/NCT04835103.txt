      named as "somatoform disorders" in psychiatric field. Because the patients' concerns are
      somatic distress, they often seek help in non-psychiatric clinics. However, the symptoms are
      usually medically unexplained. This group of diagnoses can be managed from the psychiatric
      perspective, including medications and psychotherapies. However, many patients do not receive
      psychiatric management in current medical practice. The goal of this project is to establish
      an association named "psychosomatic center" for providing comprehensive evaluations and
      treatments to the somatoform patients. Besides the psychiatrist, a case manager, a clinical
      psychologist, and a research assistant will be included in this association for the purposes
      of connection, performing psychotherapy and examinations. After entering the psychosomatic
      clinic, the investigators will routinely perform diagnostic interview, measure psychological
      and physiological features, and arrange individualized treatment program. The investigators
      will follow the important psychological and biological indexes every 3-6 months for building
      a cohort. At the same time, the case manager will connect with non-psychiatric clinics for
      ensuring the patients physical problems to be managed. The investigators expect this project
      to enhance the quality of treatment on the patients, to reduce the excessive examinations for
      the frequent attenders, and to improve the emotional burden of medical staffs.
