      Europe and prognosis in individual patients is highly variable. Quantifying a patient's
      survival prospects based on their overall risk profile has the potential to help identify
      those patients in need of more intensive monitoring and help target appropriate populations
      for therapies. In fact, several comprehensive risk scores in patients with heart failure are
      currently available for both reduced and preserved ejection fraction but their applicability
      to contemporary heart failure populations is unknown. Additionally, the impact of knowing a
      patient's prognostic information on treatment decisions in heart failure has never been
      studied. Therefore, guidelines do not recommend using risk assessments to decide on
      therapeutic decision making in heart failure due to a lack of data for this strategy. The
      investigators have proposed a randomized controlled trial be conducted of an electronic alert
      system that informs practitioners about their patients risk of inpatient mortality and 1-year
      predicted mortality using data from the electronic health record (EHR). The primary outcome
      for the trial will be a composite of all-cause mortality and 30-day risk of heart failure
      rehospitalization. The secondary outcomes will be length of stay, discharge doses of heart
      failure therapies, palliative care referral, referral for advanced therapies like transplant
      or mechanical circulatory support, referral to electrophysiology, and change in weight during
      hospitalization (aggressiveness of diuresis). The investigators will enroll into the trial
      across the hospitals that comprise the Yale New Haven Health System.
