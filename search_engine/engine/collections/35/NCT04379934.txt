      fasting or stress.

      Recently, ketone bodies have been shown to improve cardiac function in patients with heart
      failure(1) through a mechanism, which has yet to be elaborated.

      We wish to evaluate the effects of ketone body administration on cardiac tissue subjected to
      ischemia reperfusion injury. We will evaluate contractile force of the and the mitochondrial
      performance. Cardiac atrial tissue will be obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) or valve replacement surgery. Patients will be recruited after signing
      an informed consent and allocated in heart failure / non-heart failure groups based on a
      clinical evaluation.
