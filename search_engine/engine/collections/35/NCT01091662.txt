      gradual conversion to monotherapy in subjects with partial onset seizures who are not well
      controlled by current AEDs. The 18 week double-blind treatment period consists of a 2-week
      titration period, 6-week taper or conversion period, and a 10-week monotherapy period. This
      study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by
