      bruising and pain. Our study will investigate the utility of non-invasive vein imaging
      (specifically near-infrared light reflection) on the incidence of pain/bruising/hematoma and
      patient satisfaction after facial injections.

      The current standard of care for facial injection procedures does not involve any modality of
      facial venous mapping. Vein mapping is a non-invasive, simple task that takes very little
      time to conduct. One risk is patient time, however maximum extra time needed will be 5
      minutes during the clinical visit. This potential extra time in mind, the benefits far
      outweigh the risks.

      Two cohorts of patients will be prospectively compared following randomization, those who did
      have pre-procedure venous mapping prior to injection versus those who did not. Data will be
      analyzed with regard to bruising and swelling following injection, as well as other potential
      complications such as hematoma or infection, along with patient satisfaction survey
      information.
