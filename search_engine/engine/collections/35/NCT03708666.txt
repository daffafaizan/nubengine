    
      Patients that are included in the Nephrocare mHealth project send their blood pressure
      results through an app or online website.

      The clinical decision support system will alert the patient, as well as the general
      practitioner and the hospital when the blood pressure is too high or low. In addition the
      clinical decision support will calculate monthly averages and all the data are connected with
      the electronic patient files.
