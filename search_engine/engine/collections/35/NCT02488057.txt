      β-cell, will amplify the effects of lifestyle management to improve β-cell function.
      Investigators will recruit MA ages 18-40, since above this age the incidence of T2DM in obese
      MA women in our experience approaches 50%. The primary endpoint will be β-cell function
      (AIRg) in response to lifestyle change with and without GLP-1 agonist at 3 months. Secondary
      endpoints will be reversal of metabolic syndrome and changes in plasma biomarkers. By the end
      of 3 months, the prediabetic subject will be in the best possible metabolic control, and
      investigators would predict that the liraglutide group would reveal better β-cell function.
      Thus, data from this time point will be used for pharmacogenetic studies. The program will be
      continued for 3 more months for transition to regular healthy meals with the goal of weight
      maintenance. During this second 3 months, subjects will be off liraglutide to determine the
      sustainability of the improved β-cell function. In the absence of weight re-gain,
      investigators predict that the intensive weight loss alone group would maintain improved
      β-cell function, but the intensive weight loss+liraglutide group would display even better
      function. These results will provide useful information about improving β-cell function in
      the management of young women with pre-diabetes.
