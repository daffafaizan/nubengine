      attendance and wellbeing of a modular trans-diagnostic CBT intervention for youths with
      problematic school absenteeism in a randomized controlled trial. Based on previous studies we
      hypothesize that the B2S intervention will show a significant difference in impact for school
      attendance, in favor of Back2School intervention as compared with TAU

      Trial design The study is a randomized controlled superiority trial (RCT) that compares a
      modular trans-diagnostic CBT intervention (Back2School), treating school absenteeism in
      youths aged 7-17 years with treatment as usual (TAU). The design will follow a two
      (Back2School and TAU) by four (Time: pre, post, 3-month, and 1-year assessment) mixed
      between-within design.

      The study is a collaboration project between Aarhus University and Aarhus Municipality,
      Denmark. The setting for both the B2S and TAU interventions are within Aarhus municipality.
      The Back2School intervention is organized and conducted by the University Clinic, at Aarhus
      University. Treatment as usual interventions are organized and conducted by Aarhus
      Municipality.

      There are considerable negative long-term consequences related to youths with school
      absenteeism. If the B2S intervention proves to be effective in reducing school absenteeism,
      it could be implemented in other municipalities in Denmark, and help to systematically treat
      and help youths with school absenteeism. This could possibly reduce both personal and
      societal costs significantly
