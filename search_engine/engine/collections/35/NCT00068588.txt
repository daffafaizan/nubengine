      I. To evaluate the response rate and response duration to combination therapy with GTI-2040
      and capecitabine in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To safely evaluate the toxicity of this drug combination and schedule in this patient
      population by first using a lower dose followed by escalation.

      III. To determine pharmacokinetic data on plasma levels of GTI-2040 in this patient
      population.

      IV. To investigate potential molecular markers of ribonucleotide reductase inhibition and
      fluoropyrimidine metabolism in this patient population treated with the combination of
      GTI-2040 and capecitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-15 of the first course and days 1-14 of
      all subsequent courses. Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-15.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
