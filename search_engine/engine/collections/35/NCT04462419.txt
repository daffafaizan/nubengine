      I. To determine the static fluciclovine F18 (fluciclovine) PET imaging tumor-to-background
      ratios (TBRmax; TBRmean) which distinguish true tumor recurrence from radionecrosis in
      patients with intracranial metastatic disease previously treated with radiation therapy, and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggesting recurrent disease, using histopathology
      as proof of disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine static fluciclovine PET standardized uptake value (SUV)peak, SUVmean values
      and metabolic tumor volumes (MTV) which distinguish true tumor recurrence from radionecrosis
      in patients with MRI findings suggesting recurrent disease, using serial MRI as a surrogate
      marker of disease.

      II. To determine early dynamic fluciclovine PET time activity curve values which distinguish
      true tumor recurrence from radionecrosis in patients with MRI findings suggesting recurrent
      disease, using histopathology or serial MRI as a marker of disease.

      III. To correlate the determined static fluciclovine PET SUVpeak, SUVmean, TBRmax, TBRmean,
      and MTV values with progression free survival.

      IV. In patients with true tumor progression, SUV values will be correlated with Ki67 staining
      on final pathology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluciclovine intravenously (IV) and undergo brain dynamic PET/MRI imaging
      over 50 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1 year.
