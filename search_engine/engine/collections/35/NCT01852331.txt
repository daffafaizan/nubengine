      Most patients who develop a chronic course with frequent relapses and exacerbation of
      psychosis are required to have long-term treatment. The clinical outcomes of antipsychotic
      pharmacotherapy are limited, largely due to various adverse side effects. Hyperprolactinemia
      (hyperPRL) is the most challenging among them. Dopamine agonists may be used for hyperPRL if
      it does not improve after the reduction of antipsychotic doses. However, this may aggravate
      psychosis and abnormal involuntary movements, which may be a greater risk than hyperPRL
      itself.

      Chinese herbal medicine called Peony-Glycyrrhiza Decoction (PGD) has been widely introduced
      into the treatment of various conditions associated with hyperPRL in China and Japan. In our
      series of in-vitro experience it was found that PGD can significantly suppress PRL
      concentration in the cultured medium in a dose-dependent manner. Our recent open-labelled
      pilot study demonstrated that PGD significantly suppressed risperidone-induced elevation of
      blood PRL levels and produced a greater improvement on hyperPRL-related symptoms compared to
      dopamine agonist bromocriptine. Empirical and experimental evidence also confirmed that PGD
      and its individual herbal preparations possess a high safety profile.

      The encouraging results obtained from our laboratory and clinical pilot studies, together
      with findings of previous studies, have warranted an extensive controlled trial to further
      determine PGD as an effective therapy for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced hyperPRL.
