      I. To determine the safety profile of high-dose optical dye, indocyanine green, in head and
      neck cancer surgical patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of high-dose indocyanine green to identify cancer compared to
      surrounding normal tissue (tumor to background ratio; TBR) in head and neck cancer
      resections.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive indocyanine green intravenously (IV) on day 0 and undergo near-infrared
      image guided surgical resection on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 14-30 days.
