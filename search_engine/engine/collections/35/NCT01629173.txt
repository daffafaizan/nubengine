      fat-pad cushion beneath the MTH, resulting in the metatarsal pain. Foot pain frequently leads
      to limitation of activities of daily life and deterioration of life quality. Foot orthoses
      have been commonly used in clinical practice to reduce plantar pressure and subsequent pain.
      However, the therapeutic efficacies of custom molded insoles with a metatarsal support vary
      widely with their designs and materials. We designed a simple and effective method that a
      dynamic impression insole was made by sequential padding of foams with different
      compressibility under successive dynamic impression in daily walking. A piece of metatarsal
      pad and arch support made of EVA was attached to the bottom of impressed insole just proximal
      to the first, second, and third MTH according to the foot impression. Fifty participants with
      metatarsal pain were recruited from the podiatry outpatient clinic of Taipei Veteran General
      Hospital. The plantar pressure measurements were carried out under a comfortable and stable
      walking speed preferred by the participants one month after the dynamic impression and custom
      molded insoles were well fabricated. All pressure data were processed with the Novel-Win
      Multimask analysis software. The purposes of this study were to investigate the biomechanics
      of dynamic impression insole in plantar pressure and pain reduction.
