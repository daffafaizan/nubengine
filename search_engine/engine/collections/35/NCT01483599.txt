    
      This is a multicenter, dose-ranging study of CNTO 1959 in patients with moderate to severe
      plaque psoriasis. Patients who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assigned
      by chance to one of 7 treatment groups: a placebo group (a placebo is a treatment identical
      in appearance to CNTO 1959 but does not contain active drug), 1 of 5 dose groups for CNTO
      1959, or adalimumab. Patients assigned to adalimumab will be dosed according to the labeled
      dosing for psoriasis. At Week 16, patients initially assigned to placebo will begin receiving
      CNTO 1959. Patients initially assigned to CNTO 1959 will continue to receive the same
      assigned dose level of study agent from Week 16 through Week 40. Patients receiving
      adalimumab will continue the labeled dosing regimen. All patients will be reassessed for
      clinical response every 4 weeks from Week 4 through Week 40. Patients will continue dosing
      through Week 40, with a subsequent efficacy and safety follow-up visit at Week 52. Patient
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
