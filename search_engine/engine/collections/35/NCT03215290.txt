      trans-parenchymal compressing suture to "not good" cutting surface in hope of decreasing
      cutting surface related complication. A majority of studies investigating cutting surface
      management are limited to non-surgical treatments, such as the application of hemostasis
      agents including fibrin sealants, oxidized cellulose, and absorbable gelatin sponge13-15 .
      But there is no consensus regarding the necessity of the hemostatic agent application to the
      liver cutting surface. Up to date, few studies investigate surgical suture management of the
      cutting surface in liver resection.
