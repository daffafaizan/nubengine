      evaluate pain (with visual analog scale), deep neck flexors' endurance (with cranio-cervical
      flexure test using the pressure stabilizing feedback device), cervical range of motion and
      cervical proprioception (wit cervical range of motion device). Besides we will conduct a
      questionnaire (neck disability index) to get further knowledge about their functionality.
      Participants will be randomly allocated 2 groups consisting of 25 participants and these 2
      groups will receive different interventions. Modified Pilates Exercise Group (MPEG) will be
      involved in a modified pilates exercise training for a total of 6 weeks a day, 2 days a week
      in the presence of a physiotherapist. The Control Group (KG) will receive daily routine
      advises to prevent neck pain and they will be asked about to apply these advises and not to
      make other changes in their life. The evaluations will be repeated and analyzed 2 times,
      pre-treatment and 6 weeks after treatment , and the effectiveness of the modified pilates
      exercises will be examined in the chronic neck pain. Our hypothesis is ''Modified pilates
      exercises have a positive effect on neck pain, range of motion, deep neck flexor muscles,
      joint position sense and function in patients with chronic neck pain.''
