      represent a standard of care for older children. The refinements in surgical techniques
      attained in adult cataract surgery have been translated to pediatric cataract surgery to
      produce a technically safe eye. Nevertheless, the use of IOLs in children younger than 2
      years remains controversial. Exaggerated inflammation, capsular opacification and changing
      refractive status of the developing eye should be considered before the use of IOLs in the
      first two years of life. Further more, there is concern about the unknown risks of an IOL
      over the long life span.

      Currently, there are 3 methods of optical rehabilitation following congenital cataract
      surgery :

        1. Primary IOL implantation.

        2. Aphakic glasses.

        3. Contact lenses.

      At present, there is no randomized clinical trial reported to document the safety and
      efficacy of IOL implantation in children less than 2 years.

      Aim : To compare the technical outcome (safety) and functional outcome (benefits) following
      primary IOL implantation and aphakia in children less than 2 years.
