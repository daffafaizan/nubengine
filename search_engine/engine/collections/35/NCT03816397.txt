    
      Background: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis is a chronic paediatric
      ocular inflammatory condition that can result in visual impairment. Adalimumab, a tumour
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor, effectively controls joint and eye inflammation;
      however, its long-term use may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes and place an
      undue financial burden on the patient and healthcare system given its high cost. There is
      great interest for patients to stop adalimumab following remission due to these reasons but
      there is a lack of information on the ability to maintain control after discontinuing
      adalimumab.

      Methods: The Adalimumab in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-associated Uveitis Trial (ADJUST) is
      a multicentred, international trial that will randomise 118 participants aged 2 years and
      older with controlled JIA-associated uveitis to either continue adalimumab or discontinue
      adalimumab and receive a placebo. The trial will compare the time to uveitis recurrence
      between the two groups over 12 months. All participants will receive the standard
      weight-based dose of adalimumab or placebo: 20 mg biweekly (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg biweekly (if
      â‰¥ 30 kg).

      Impact: This is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of discontinuing
      adalimumab after demonstrating control of JIA-associated uveitis for at least 12 months. The
      results of ADJUST will provide information on clinical outcomes to guide clinicians in their
      decision-making regarding discontinuation of adalimumab.
