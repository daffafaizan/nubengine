    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This project involves several clinical protocols that study the regulation
      and role of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion.

      Studies include dynamic and repeated stimulation tests of pulsatile GnRH; plasma luteinizing
      hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone, testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and GnRH
      measurements at cyclic and episodic intervals; and evaluation of adrenal androgen patterns.

      Circadian rhythms of GnRH secretion are monitored during sleep and awake hours. Growth
      hormone secretory patterns and responses to provocative stimuli are studied as clinically
      indicated.

      Selected participants undergo an assessment of pituitary responsiveness following T, E2,
      and/or naloxone infusions. The suppressive effects of E2 are also studied during the early
      follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

      Endocrinologically normal children and normal adult men and women are also studied.
