      lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE II. Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial response)
      in patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the
      toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 6 months for 3 years.
