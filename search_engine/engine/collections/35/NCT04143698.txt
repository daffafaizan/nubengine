      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), caused by contaminated duodenoscopes used at endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a disposable (single-use) duodenoscope (Exalt, Single-Use
      Duodenoscope, Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA) has been developed to circumvent
      this issue. However, there are currently no data on the technical features and outcomes of
      disposable duodenoscopes, in comparison with reusable duodenoscopes.

      The aim of this randomized trial is therefore to evaluate the technical aspects of disposable
      duodenoscopes and to compare the technical outcomes between the two duodenoscope types.
