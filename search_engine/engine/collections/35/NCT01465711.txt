      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) following surgery bear the risk of localized infection, sepsis or
      septic shock. Prevention or early detection of such events is important to intervene with an
      appropriate therapeutic action and avoid risking a potentially life-threatening situation.
      White blood cell counts (WCC) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Interleucin-6 (IL-6) and
      Procalcitonin (PCT) have all been promising parameters, however, they are useful only in
      selective cases and have a limited diagnostic accuracy.
