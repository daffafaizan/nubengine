      approval and written informed consent were obtained, 80 healthy volunteers (40 males and 40
      females) aged between 18 and 45 yr were included. For 1 week before the study, subjects were

      alcohol, products containing aspartame (aspartame may increase formate concentrations), or
      use of paracetamol within 24 h before study drug administration resulted in ineligibility.
      Exclusion criteria included hypersensitivity to any anesthetic; known or suspected serious
      disorders and/or significant dysfunction; an abnormal, clinically significant ECG finding;
      participation in an investigational drug study within the previous month; known or suspected
