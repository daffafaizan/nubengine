      antiretroviral therapy that includes a protease inhibitor and reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors. The children who will be evaluated and followed in this study are those who have
      previously been studied on other protease inhibitor-containing anti-HIV protocols within the
      HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch. This study will provide a mechanism to assess the long-term
      immunologic changes of potent combination therapy in this unique population and to relate
      this to the virologic changes. A total of 50 HIV-1 infected children will be studied. The
      children enrolled in this protocol will either continue their current combination of protease
      inhibitor and reverse transcriptase therapy or, if deemed clinically appropriate, will be
      changed to a new, best available combination of protease inhibitor and reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors. Long-term immunoreconstitution, defined as the repopulation of naive CD4+T
      lymphocytes, will be studied by determining the presence and extent of production of new
      naive (thymic derived) CD4+T cells and by the ability of patients to mount new helper T cell
      responses after immunization with influenza and tetanus toxoid. Expansion of T cell receptor
      will also be explored in subsets of enrolled patients. In addition, unforeseen toxicities
      attributable to the use of combination antiretroviral therapy have been recognized and
      described in adult patients. This study will evaluate abnormalities in lipid and glucose
      metabolism, changes in the distribution of body fat, and surrogate markers of cardiovascular
      disease risk in this cohort of pediatric patients.
