      treatment remain limited. Compared to other abusable substances, there has been little
      investigation of pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence and no effective pharmacotherapy
      for cannabis dependence has yet to been developed. The development of effective cannabis
      dependence pharmacotherapy is an important unmet public health need. Agonist pharmacotherapy
      strategies have been effective for other substance use disorders (e.g., opioid and nicotine
      use disorders) and the endocannabinoid system represents a promising target for agonist
      pharmacotherapy with dronabinol. Lofexidine, a noradrenergic system suppressant, is effective
      in treating opioid withdrawal and shows promise as a cannabis use disorder pharmacotherapy.
      Haney et al. (2008) found that the combination of lofexidine and dronabinol (Lofex-Dro) was
      superior to placebo, lofexidine alone, or dronabinol alone in improving sleep and other
      cannabis withdrawal symptoms. Further, reduction in craving and relapse was greater for this
      combined pharmacotherapy relative to either medication alone or placebo. The proposed
      protocol is a 2 group, double blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study of the safety and
      efficacy of the combination of dronabinol and lofexidine for the treatment of cannabis
      dependence. We plan to enroll 180 subjects in a 12-week trial. The primary hypothesis is that
      dronabinol will act as an agonist treatment while lofexidine will suppress craving- and
      cue-induced related stress such that the combination will act in a complementary manner to
      induce prolonged abstinence from marijuana.
