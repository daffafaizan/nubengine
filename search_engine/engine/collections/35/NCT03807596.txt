      randomized clinical trial. These subjects were randomly allocated into test & control equal
      groups. The test group comprised fifteen patients who received SRP with subgingival
      application of Hyaluronic acid as an adjunct. The control group included fifteen patients who
      received SRP alone. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD) & clinical
      attachment level (CAL) were measured & documented at baseline, 6 weeks & 12 weeks intervals.
