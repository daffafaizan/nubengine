      patients diagnosed with gynecological cancer. The patients will be randomized into three
      groups: control group (will not receive any interventions with therapeutic touch), placebo
      group (will receive simulated therapeutic touch intervention by individual not knowing the
      practice) and treatment group (will receive therapeutic touch intervention by a trained
      therapeutic touch therapist). Two different quality of life questionnaires (World Health
      Organization quality of life questionnaire - WHOQOL-Bref and the quality of life Core-30
      questionnaire - EORTC QLQ-C30) from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer will be applied before and after treatment. Levels of cortisol, salivary IgA,
      hematological indices and telomerase activity before and after the use of therapeutic touch
      will be compared between groups.
