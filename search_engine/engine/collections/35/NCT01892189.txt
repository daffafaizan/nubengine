      changes and treatment of psychotic-like symptoms induced by ketamine, in people who take
      TAK-063.

      The study will enroll approximately 27 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of treatment sequences-which will remain undisclosed to the participants during the
      study (unless there is an urgent medical need). Participants will receive the following study
      medications by the end of the study:

        -  Ketamine intravenous infusion (IV) AND

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient AND

        -  Two doses of TAK-063 at one of three dose levels All participants will be asked to take
           3 tablets and will receive a ketamine IV on the first day of 3 separate study periods.
           Participants will then be assessed for brain activity changes and other symptoms. This
           single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
           participate in this study is up to 7 weeks. Participants will make 6 visits to the
           clinic.
