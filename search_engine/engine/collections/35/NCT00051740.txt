      Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) may improve adaptive functioning, quality of life, and
      rates of relapse in schizophrenia patients. CAT, which involves compensatory strategies or
      environmental supports, is tailored to each individual and is based on executive functioning
      levels and other factors.

      Participants are randomly assigned to CAT, Minimal Environmental Supports (MES), or treatment
      as usual for 2 years. Participants receiving CAT will have a trained therapist make weekly
      visits to their home for 9 months. Over the following 3 months, the frequency of CAT visits
      will be slowly reduced to once a month. For the remaining 12 months of treatment, patients
      receive CAT only once a month.

      Participants assigned to the MES group receive a generic set of supplies and equipment
      (calendar, alarm clock, watch, bus passes, etc.) at the beginning of the 2-year period. Each
      month, the supplies are replenished as necessary during the patient's scheduled clinic visit.

      In all groups, assessments of adaptive function and quality of life occur at study start and
      at 3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 months.
