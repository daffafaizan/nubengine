      treatment failure, and survival) of perillyl alcohol in patients with previously treated
      metastatic breast cancer. II. Define the acute and chronic toxic effects of perillyl alcohol
      in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are given oral perillyl alcohol 4 times per day. Dose escalation of
      perillyl alcohol may occur in individual patients if no unacceptable toxicity is observed.
      Treatment is continued as long as the patient benefits from treatment, does not show
      progressive disease, and does not experience irreversible or life threatening toxicity.
      Patients are evaluated for response monthly while receiving treatment on this study. Patients
      are followed at 2-4 weeks after the last treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued over 2 years.
