      recent years an increasing prevalence of lice infestation in schools, day care centres, and
      summer day camps is believed to be partly due to increasing lice resistance to currently
      available standard treatments for pediculosis (infestation with lice). There is a need for
      new effective backup treatments for this common condition of head lice infestation. This is a
      double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, study in several clinical centres comparing
      ivermectin as tablets to malathion 0.5% lotion in the treatment of head lice. All enrolled
      patients participate in the primary phase of the study up to the Day 15 evaluation. Patients
      who are still infested with lice at Day 15 (treatment failures) will enter an extension phase
      and be treated in a double-blind, fashion with the opposite treatment (ie ivermectin or
      malathion). The study hypothesis is that ivermectin will be more effective than malathion in
      clearing head lice infestation , as measured by the proportion of patients who are lice-free
      at Study Day 15.
