      glucose levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes
      mellitus (T1DM), which is being studied in this trial, is an autoimmune disorder in which the
      body's own immune system attacks and destroys the cells that make insulin. These cells are
      called beta cells. As beta cells are destroyed, less insulin can be made. This causes blood
      sugar levels to increase above normal and can cause life-threatening hypo- and hyper-glycemic
      reactions. For this reason, people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to help control
      their blood sugar levels. Over time, poorly controlled diabetes can lead to a variety of
      serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, blindness, amputations, kidney
      disease, and nerve damage. Insulin is the primary method of controlling diabetes by
      regulating blood glucose levels, but it may not reverse or prevent disease progression. The
      active ingredient in PROCHYMAL® is adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have been
      shown to interact with the immune cells in the body, reducing inflammation and assisting in
      tissue repair. This study will help determine whether MSCs can protect normal pancreatic
      tissue from autoimmune attack and repair damaged pancreatic tissue, leading to an increase in
      insulin production and decrease in circulating blood glucose. The characteristics and
      biologic activity of PROCHYMAL®, along with a good safety profile in human trials to date,
      suggest that PROCHYMAL® may be a good candidate for addressing Type 1 Diabetes.
