      In the study a Decision Support System for aortic and mitral valve replacement/repair will be
      implemented and tested. Not all of the assessments listed will be performed on every patient,
      but sufficient to support the analysis processes.

      The patients are enrolled in two subgroups:

        -  Group 1: patients with aortic valve disease

        -  Group 2: patients with mitral valve disease

      The study has the following visits at all clinical centers:

        1. Visit 1: Patients will be investigated before valve intervention by imaging (MRI,
           Echocardiography, CT), ECG, laboratory tests, anthropometrics (blood pressure, body
           weight, clinical status). A subset of patients will wear a fitness tracker for at least
           one day and perform a 6-minute walk test.

        2. Operation (valve replacement/repair): All patients will be treated according to current
           clinical guidelines.

        3. Virtual treatment: Patients will receive a virtual treatment

        4. Visit 2: After treatment patients will be followed-up undergoing the study protocol
           again. This allows comparing the modeled (predicted) against measured outcome data.
