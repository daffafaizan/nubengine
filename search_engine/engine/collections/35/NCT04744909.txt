      identified. We introduce a new method that increases precision through three-dimensional
      navigation with a new instrument - SafeTrach.

      SafeTrach is a pliers-like instrument. The inner shank acts as a ventilation tube while
      stabilizing the orotracheal tube in the trachea. The outer shank acts as a three-dimensional
      control instrument for the puncture needle.

      We determined the puncture level in 20 patients using SafeTrach. We found that the distance
      from the vocal cords to the puncture site was about 45 mm for men and 42 mm for women. This
      was based on intraoperative measurements. In 13 patients, we studied the distance between the
      vocal cords and the optimal puncture site between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring with CT and
      found that the mean distance for men was 49.8 mm and for women 42.2 mm. We have used internal
      measurements in another 12 patients as follows: The orotracheal tube is positioned so that
      the proximal part of the cuff is just below the vocal cords. 2. The position of the tube is
      measured against the front teeth. 3. The orotracheal tube together with the inner shank is
      pulled up about 15 mm for both men and women. This means that part of the cuff lies between
      the vocal cords and you get an acceptable placement of the puncture needle.

      By using SafeTrach you can use internal landmarks to indicate the puncture level. The
      positioning of the leg is done with high precision because SafeTrach acts as a stable guide.
      The navigation system minimizes the risk of extubation and damage to the posterior tracheal
      wall.
