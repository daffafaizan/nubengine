    
      A prospective, longitudinal, observational study of free-living activity tracking and
      patient-reported outcomes in participants enrolled in the Longitudinal Pulmonary Vascular
      Disease Phenomics Program (L-PVDOMICS). Participants will undergo activity monitoring for 12
      weeks once a year for 4 years. Patient-reported outcomes will be collected including quality
      of life (emphasis-10, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF), and SF-36 surveys),
      medication changes, hospitalization, and death. This study aims to enroll 500 participants.
      The objectives of this study are to establish the clinical utility of daily activity tracking
      in patients with pulmonary hypertension and to identify clinical factors associated with
      reduced daily activity.
