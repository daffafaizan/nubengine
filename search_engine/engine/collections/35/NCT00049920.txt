      Although the clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) typically appear
      acutely, the deleterious effects of CVD on brain structure and function likely begin in a
      presymptomatic fashion at a younger age than clinical strokes. In an effort to characterize
      the prevalence, risk factors, and cognitive correlates of subclinical CVD, the
      Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and
      Blood Institute performed cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive assessments
      on a large, bi-racial sample of middle-aged and young-elderly adults. Results from the ARIC
      MRI baseline study revealed a remarkably high prevalence of subclinical CVD including silent
      cerebral infarctions, white matter hyperintensities, and brain atrophy. Moreover, these
      subclinical abnormalities were found to be associated with reduced cognitive functioning and
      with clinical CVD outcomes such as incident stroke. Surprisingly little is known about risk
      factors related to the incidence or progression of subclinical CVD or how progression of
      these markers may relate to clinical outcomes such as stroke or neurocognitive decline.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a follow-up study of the ARIC MRI cohort, with repeated semiquantitative MR imaging
      and cognitive assessments. The study will also take advantage of recent advances in MR
      imaging and obtain volumetric measurements of selected brain regions and expand upon the
      baseline cognitive assessment to further characterize neurocognitive functioning. The
      longitudinal design of the proposed study will fill salient gaps in current understanding of
      subclinical CVD. Moreover, conducting this study within ARIC takes advantage of ARIC's
      baseline MRI data, unique African American population, and extensive vascular risk factor
      data (including new genetic and biochemical factors as well as subclinical markers of both
      large and small vessel disease), making an efficient study to provide new insights into the
      incidence, progression, and outcomes associated with subclinical CVD.
