      anxiety inventory, but studies have not tested these effects among children who have an
      autism spectrum disorder.

      The essential oils used in this study are administered each morning for a total period of
      four weeks, with an optional second exposure on an as-needed basis during the final two of
      the four weeks of the study. The oils are administered during this time to evaluate both the
      preventive effects and the treatment effects of the essential oils.

      Anxiety is measured on an anxiety inventory, which is completed by the parent of the
      participant at the end of each week during the study. Parents complete this data online,
      allowing them to participate from anywhere in the U.S.
