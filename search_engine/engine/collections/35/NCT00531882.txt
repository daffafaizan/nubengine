      as: Baseline (Day 1,2,3), Treatment (Day 3-10), and Recovery (Day 13-15). Healthy volunteers
      will be screened on Day 1 (and assessed for eligibility); Eligible subjects will be divided
      into 3 drug treatment groups pioglitazone, simvastatin and ibuprofen the positive control.

      criteria. There will be 2 healthy volunteers in the positive control group. Group 1 will
      receive pioglitazone 30 mg once daily, Group 2 will receive simvastatin 40 mg daily and Group
      3 the positive control will receive ibuprofen (15-23 mg/kg twice daily, maximum 3200 mg/day)
