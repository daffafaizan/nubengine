    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, parallel-arm study in 1 group of subjects with normal
      hepatic function and 3 groups of subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (mild,
      moderate, and severe). Subjects will be confined to the clinic from Day -1 to Day 8. Subjects
      will be contacted via telephone 30 days (+ 2 days) after the last dose of study medication to
      assess any new or ongoing AEs and to record concomitant medications. All groups will receive
      a single oral 2-mg OPC-34712 dose on Day 1 with 240 mL room temperature still water. Subjects
      will be administered the OPC-34712 dose in the fasted state (at least 8 hours of fasting) and
      no food will be allowed for 4 hours postdose.
