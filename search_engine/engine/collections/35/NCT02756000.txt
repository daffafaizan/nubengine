      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD)
      defined as >70% stenosis in a non-culprit vessel, initially treated with culprit only primary
      PCI. The patients will be enrolled in four high volume PCI centers after successful culprit
      only primary PCI and then randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms:1. complete
      revascularization of all non-culprit significant lesions in a single session during initial
      hospitalization; 2. same revascularization in a single session after 30 days;
      3.revascularization or it's deferral based on ischemia testing using Dobutamin stress
      echocardiography. The study will explore differences in occurrence of major adverse
      cardio-cerebral events (cardiac death, repeated myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular
      accident and repeated revascularization) and complications of interventions during 12 months
      follow-up.
