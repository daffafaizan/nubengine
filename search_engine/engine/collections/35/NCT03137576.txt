    
      A prospective randomized trial which aims to evaluate a new technique of peripheral nerve
      block for pain management, the Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) in patients undergoing
      minimally invasive lung resection in spontaneous breathing, with intravenous sedation
      ("non-intubated thoracic surgery"). ESPB will be compared with a largely employed procedure
      for loco regional pain management: the Paravertebral block (PB). Both procedures are
      performed under ultrasonographic guidance to allow proper visualization of the target site.
      Surgery is carried out by means of a minimally invasive approach (Video Assisted thoracic
      Surgery) with two keyhole incisions on the affected side.
