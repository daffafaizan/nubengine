      still commonly used to increase keratinized tissue dimensions. This prospective clinical
      trial was conducted aiming to determine whether the addition of an autologous platelet-rich
      fibrin (PRF) after harvesting a FGG would improve soft tissue healing of donor sites and
      subsequently decrease pain scores.

      Methods: Twenty four patients were planned to receive FGG to augment keratinized tissue
      dimensions in the mandibular incisors area. Enrolled patients received periodontal
      examination, oral hygiene instructions and full-mouth debridement followed by standardized
      FGG of similar dimensions. Donor sites were assigned randomly to receive PRF or not by a flip
      of a coin during the screening visit. Patients were instructed to complete a pain study form
      to analyze pain scores including VAS, NRS-101, VRS-4 as well as three anxiety scales at base
      line. The palatal donor area were evaluated for complete wound healing based on the degree of
      color match, tissue texture, and contour of the surgical area compared to preoperative
      records. These data were assessed and recorded before surgery, and 1,2,3,4 and 8 weeks
      postoperatively.
