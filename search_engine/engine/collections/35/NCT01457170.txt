      is abundantly expressed in the pulmonary vasculature. Pre-clinical models and preliminary
      clinical data indicate that Apelin deficiency may mediate or contribute to the pathogenesis
      of pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Apelin causes peripheral vasodilatation and
      increased cardiac contractility. The investigators will determine the effects of Apelin on
      the pulmonary circulation in 3 groups; healthy control, people with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension and people with pulmonary hypertension due to heart failure. Each subject will
      receive both Apelin infusion and saline placebo infusion in a crossover design. The infusions
      will be given in a random order which the subject and the investigator will be blinded to.
      The investigators hypothesise that Apelin will have more marked pulmonary haemodynamic
      effects than that observed in the systemic circulation. Moreover, the investigators propose
      that Apelin will have a marked vasodilatory effect on the human pulmonary vasculature and
      reduce pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension or
      pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease.
