      The centers will utilize pre-screening of existing medical records to identify potentially
      eligible subjects. Once informed consent has been obtained, the subject will undergo baseline
      assessments, which include: Transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography,
      and functional assessments (Six-Minute Walk Test, NYHA, and Quality of Life Questionnaires).
      Following final eligibility determination, eligible subjects will under the index procedure
      to implant the Carillon device (includes coronary sinus venogram). Subject will be discharged
      following one-night in-hospital stay and discharge assessments.

      Subjects who have the Carillon implant procedure attempted but were not successfully
      implanted (Non-Implanted subjects) will be followed through discharge or resolution of safety
      events, whichever is longer, and then discharged from the trial.

      Implanted subjects will have follow-up assessments performed at 1 month, 6 months, and 12
      months post index procedure. Follow-up assessments will include transthoracic
      echocardiography, Six-Minute Walk Test, and Quality of Life Questionnaires.
