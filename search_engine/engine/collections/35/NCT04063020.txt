      tomodensiometry) up to the proposal of the plastic reconstruction surgery at 9/10 years old.

      The surgical technique used and preferred within Necker Hospital for these children is that
      of Saturo Nagata (1994).

      This surgical protocol takes place in two times, spaced by 9 months. This surgery does not
      allow hearing better since it targets is only a reconstruction of the pinna. To date, no
      research has highlighted the subjective experience of a child with an aplasia of ear and of
      what this surgery engages and demands on the side of psychological work.

      The purpose of this research is to interrogate the children's subjective experience with an
      unilateral ear aplasia and who wishes a plastic reconstruction surgery for their aplase ear.
