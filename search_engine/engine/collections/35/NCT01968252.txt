           excursion measurements with transesophageal echocardiography.

        2. This study intends to validate the use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure
           the distance the tricuspid annulus moves during the systolic phase. The guideline
           articles regarding right ventricular function suggest m-mode measurements from the
           transthoracic approach and the same measurements may underestimate the actual distance
           on transesophageal echocardiography. This speckle-tracking technology will allow this
           distance to be measured despite its often non-parallel motion to the ultrasound beam,
           which otherwise limits the reliability of the valve recorded.

        3. All subjects undergoing a planned surgical procedure in which the use of transesophageal
           echocardiography would be used regardless for their management.

        4. No interventions, only evaluation of the measurements obtained with transthoracic
           echocardiography compared to transesophageal echocardiography.

        5. No follow-up, study will be completed at the time of image acquisition.
