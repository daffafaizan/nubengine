      therapy to induce peripheral immune tolerance in participants presenting with non-infectious
      intermediate and posterior uveitis. This will be performed using a Phase I/II pilot study.
      Subjects on daclizumab monotherapy will receive a 6 mg loading dose of oral sirolimus at week
      0, followed by a 2 mg dose every other day for 2 weeks. If tolerated, the subject will be
      increased to a 2 mg daily dose. After one year of combination therapy, the subject will be
      tapered off daclizumab first and then sirolimus. The primary outcome will be the ability of
      the participant to be successfully tapered off daclizumab and sirolimus while their disease
      remains quiet (vitreous haze less than or equal to Trace) for 24 weeks on no systemic
      immunosuppressive medications (approximately week 134).
