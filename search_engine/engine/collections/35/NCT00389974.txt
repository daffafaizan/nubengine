      I. To assess the efficacy (objective response rate) of sunitinib (sunitinib malate) given
      orally daily for 4 out of every 6 weeks in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or
      metastatic carcinoma of the cervix.

      II. To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or
      metastatic carcinoma of the cervix.

      III. To document time to progression, early objective progression rate, and, if objective
      responses are observed, response duration.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6
      weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) may receive 2 courses
      after CR or PR is reached.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
