      advance from 3-minute jogging a day to 10-minute level in daily practice for 1 year as
      instructed. After 1 year, subsequent DEXA scans are recorded. Interested participants are
      also encouraged to have hip and spine X-rays, and bone quality studies on study entry and two
      years later. Actual subject participation, intercurrent illnesses, fractures and changes in
      medication are self-monitored. Results are calculated by change in bone mineral density in
      the lumbar spine, hips and femurs by the DEXA scan in the study. Dose-response relationships
      between the amount of jogging and bone mineral density are sought. Jogging-related fractures
      and other adverse effects are also noted.
