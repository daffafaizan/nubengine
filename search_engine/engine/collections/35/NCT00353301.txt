      Currently available treatment with high-dose interleukin-2 can lead to complete responses in
      a small minority of selected patients but is markedly toxic and not broadly available.
      FDA-approved multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib and sunitinib malate) often cause partial and
      transient tumor regression. There is no standard treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      for patients whose disease progressed on multikinase inhibitors. The kinase mammalian target
      of rapamycin (mTOR) is overstimulated in a subset of renal cell carcinomas and other
      malignancies and can be blocked by sirolimus leading to growth arrest. Erlotinib
      hydrochloride is a drug that blocks the function of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR), often over expressed in kidney cancer. Sirolimus and EGFR inhibitors and been safely
      used in combination. In vitro experiments show that erlotinib enhances the sirolimus induced
      growth impairment in a panel of renal cell carcinoma cells. In the present study patients
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease progressed on multikinase inhibitors will
      be treated with the combination of erlotinib hydrochloride (Tarceva™) and sirolimus
      (Rapamune™). This is a single arm trial with no placebo or drug-based control arm
