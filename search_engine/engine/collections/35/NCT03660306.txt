      free or opioid general anesthesia based on his/her expertise.

      Every patient gets a lung protective ventilation and emergence from anesthesia using the
      principles set forward in the consensus meeting by Young C BJA 2019.

      A lung recruitment followed by high PEEP is given when lung compliance decreases below 40
      ML/cmH20. The lowest oxygen saturation without adding oxygen therapy is noted post extubation
      at moment of admission in PACU, after having given an opioid as analgesic and at moment of
      discharge from PACU..

      If post operative satuation drops below 94% oxygen therapy is given and noted.
