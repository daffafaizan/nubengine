      cells in tissues. In pediatric onset mastocytosis, disease is usually localized to the skin
      and disease is considered to be of limited duration. However, a subset of children appear to
      develop a clinical picture resembling that observed in adults who have adult-onset disease.
      This study will focus on children with more severe mastocytosis in an attempt to define its
      pathogenesis, focusing on mutations and polymorphisms in genes regulating mast cell
      proliferation and survival to determine if they might contribute to this disease pattern. If
      severe pediatric-onset disease does not fit within the existing classification, new criteria
      of diagnosis must be proposed for the pediatric age group.

      This study will examine children and young adults age birth to 21 years with pediatric-onset
      disease previously enrolled on NIAID mastocytosis protocols, or as a result of physician
      referral, which have disease more consistent with adult-onset disease or parameters
      associated with increased morbidity. The evaluation may include serum tryptase, blood count,
      bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, morphology and mutational analysis. Subjects may be asked to
      return in 12-24 months for assessment. If relevant mutation effecting mast cell growth and
      function are identified, such mutations will be sought in the biologic parents as
      appropriate, but only when such mutations are believed to be germ line (not somatic)
      mutations. This study will aid in the understanding of the characteristics of severe
      mastocytosis in the pediatric age group.
