      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) venlafaxine may reduce post-MVC pain. In
      addition, venlafaxine has been shown to be beneficial in reducing posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and in some patients PTSD symptoms may contribute to reinforcing
      pain persistence after trauma.

      This phase IIB pilot trial will screen patients presenting to the ED after MVC for the
      presence of severe axial pain (>4 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale). Sixty of these "high risk"
      patients will be randomized to venlafaxine vs. placebo, and the ability of venlafaxine to
      decrease acute and persistent musculoskeletal axial pain will be assessed.

      Results will be used to design a large-scale RCT assessing the efficacy of venlafaxine
      intervention in decreasing acute and persistent musculoskeletal pain in high-risk patients
      presenting to the ED after minor MVC.
