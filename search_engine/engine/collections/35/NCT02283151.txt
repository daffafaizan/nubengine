      (43 male, 55 female, aged≥18 years, BMI≥24 kg/m2) from the outpatient clinic of endocrinology
      and metabolism department of Southern Medical University Affiliated ZhuJiang Hospital. All
      the subjects were randomly assigned to experiment group and control group. The experimental
      group was given individual instructions on how to follow the VLCD (very low carbohydrate
      diet). Energy intake was restricted to less than 800kcal/day (3349kJ/d) (carbohydrate intake
      < 20g/d). All daily meals were replaced as follows: a cup of soybean milk (200 mL) and a
      boiled egg at breakfast; a diet nutrition bar (106 Kcal: 2.8 g carbohydrate, 11.2 g protein
      and 5.6 g fat; Nutriease Health Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China), nonstarchy vegetables
      (<200 kcal), and 50 g protein from meat (i.e., beef, lean pork, skinned chicken, fish) at
      lunch and dinner. Supplementation of multivitamins and minerals was provided per day. The
      energy-restricted diet (ER diet) was designed in the traditional Chinese style with an
      initial target for a total energy intake of 1200 kcal/d (5021 kJ/d). Subjects were also
      encouraged to drink at least 1.8 litres of water per day, and asked to maintain their
      habitual level of physical activity. Compliance with the diet and physical activity level was
      checked at weekly visits.
