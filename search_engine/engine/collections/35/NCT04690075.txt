      anticipated total of 120 patients with chronic diseases (including overweight, obesity,
      hyperlipemia, hyperglycemia, etc) will be randomized to receive oat beta-glucans (study
      group) or routine nutrition management (control group) respectively. The outcome parameters,
      including weight, blood glucose level, blood fat level, etc, will be measured and compared
      over a 12-week intervention period. Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and per-protocol
      analysis (PP) will be conducted in statistical analysis.
