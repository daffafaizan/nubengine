      disease are diagnosed (INCa 2014). Patients suffering from locally advanced non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), stage IIIa, usually undergo a multimodality treatment including
      chemotherapy with platinum compounds before surgery (called neoadjuvant chemotherapy or
      induction chemotherapy). The reason of this combined modality treatment is the really poor
      prognosis of patients presenting a disease already spread to lymph nodes (classified N2 when
      the lymph node under the carina is affected). Up till now, the five-year survival of patients
      who underwent surgical resection of N2 NSCLC does not exceed 15%.

      NOTCH pathway seems to be implicated in the resistance of tumor to chemotherapy. It is known
      that NOTCH plays a role in the homeostasis of adult stem cells and of cancer stem cells,
      including intestine cancer and NSCLC. In breast cancer, it has been demonstrated that NOTCH 1
      plays a role in the relapse and adding a treatment by an inhibitor of NOTCH decreases the
      recurrence rate. An activation of the NOTCH pathway was proven in human lung cancer cell
      lines (A549 and H460) treated with cisplatin. Furthermore, HES1 (Hairy enhance of split), a
      downstream gene resulting from NOTCH transcription, was upregulated in patient with relapse
      comparing resistant versus non-resistant adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients. It was proved, NOTCH
      pathway is associated with overall survival in NSCLC. Recently, it was showed that an
      inhibitor of NOTCH combined with chemotherapy strongly potentiates the anti-tumor effects of
      the systemic therapy. Therefore, one can hypothesize that platinum compound-induced NOTCH
      activation contributes to the resistance of NSCLC and beyond this point, to tumor
      progression.
