    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I study with an expansion cohort, in patients with
      metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) who are chemotherapy-naive or have
      previously received docetaxel chemotherapy and have progressive disease at the time of study
      entry. The dose escalation phase of this study will establish the optimum daily dose of
      everolimus that can be delivered along with a standard daily dose of enzalutamide to patients
      with metastatic CRPC. Eligible patients must have evaluable (elevated PSA) or measurable
      disease (per RECIST v1.1). Following completion of the dose escalation phase, an additional
      cohort of patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to give preliminary
      information regarding the efficacy of this combination.
