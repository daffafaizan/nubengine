      brain have been investigated in a study, such comparison has not been made between the
      three-dimensional virtual reality and motor imagery.

      Considering these situations, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of
      three-dimensional (immersive) virtual reality and motor imagery on upper extremity functional
      recovery after stroke.
