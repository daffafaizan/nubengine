    
      Overview: Randomized intervention trial to examine the impact of an acute heart failure
      strategy, which incorporates risk stratification and rapid outpatient care after discharge.

      Study Population: Patients presenting to the emergency department with heart failure will be
      eligible for study inclusion.

      Intervention: The study involves 2 components: clinical algorithm for prognostication and
      post-discharge follow-up in the Rapid Ambulatory Program for Investigation and Diagnosis of
      Heart Failure (RAPID-HF) clinic.

      The clinical decision-support algorithm intervention is a composite of the Emergency Heart
      failure Mortality Risk Grade (EHMRG) 7-day and the EHMRG 30-day (EHMRG30-ST) risk score.
      Using the EHMRG/EHMRG30-ST algorithm, patients will be categorized as high, intermediate, or
      low risk. The decision support algorithm will recommend hospital admission or
      discharge/observation based on patient risk to assist clinicians making the final decision to
      admit or discharge.

      Patients referred to RAPID-HF will be assessed ideally within 48 hours of discharge. RAPID-HF
      provides transitional care for up to 30 days after discharge. After 30-days, care is
      transferred to primary care provider or specialist for ongoing care.

      Study Design: Using a stepped-wedge design, participating sites will be randomized to the
      active intervention. At each step, hospitals that have not yet been randomized will serve as
      control sites.
