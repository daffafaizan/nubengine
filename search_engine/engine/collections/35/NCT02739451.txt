    
      After discussion at the investigator meeting and based on comments from the Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board on May 12, 2016, the DSMB has highlighted the need of the interim analysis
      (already planned) as benefits from high flow oxygen may be observed after 400 inclusions.

      Update on June 16, 2017:

      The number of patients enrolled is 488 and the inclusion rate is increasing steadily.

      The interim analysis has been performed as scheduled and the DSMB decided that nothing should
      be changed.
