      as well as other intermediary markers, in normal-appearing colonic epithelium of patients
      with colonic adenomas. II. Determine whether a decrease in global DNA hypomethylation and
      other intermediary markers can be induced safely and whether these effects persist after
      folic acid is discontinued in these patients. III. Confirm pilot data that indicates patients
      with adenomas have widespread DNA hypomethylation of the colorectal mucosa compared to
      controls. IV. Evaluate the effect of folic acid on the clinical course and rate of recurrence
      of adenomatous polyps in these patients. V. Study a control group of patients with no history
      of neoplastic, hyperplastic, or inflammatory colorectal lesions.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center and age (50-70 vs 30-49 and over 70).
      Patients with adenomatous polyps at least 10 mm at colonoscopy are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. Patients found to have no neoplastic, hyperplastic, or inflammatory polyps at
      colonoscopy are assigned to a control (untreated) group and complete laboratory studies and a
      baseline food frequency questionnaire only. Arm I: Patients receive folic acid daily. Arm II:
      Patients receive placebo daily. Treatment continues in both arms for 1 year in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (30 per arm and 20 for the control group) will be
      accrued for this study within 24 months.
