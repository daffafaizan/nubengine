      incidence increases with advancing age. Dizziness represents a diagnostic and treatment
      challenge because it is a subjective sensation, refers to a variety of symptoms
      (unsteadiness, spinning, sense of motion or lightheadedness), and has many potential
      contributory factors. Dizziness is often related to vestibular disease which is treated
      effectively with vestibular exercises. Successful management of dizziness is critical because
      dizziness is a major risk factor for falls in older adults.

      There are parallels between the effects of age-related versus disease-related loss of
      vestibular function - in complaints of dizziness and increased risk for falls. The
      investigators' question, then, is whether the same exercises that are beneficial for patients
      with vestibular pathology are beneficial for older patients with dizziness but normal
      vestibular function.

      Older adults with dizziness who have been referred to Audiology for vestibular evaluation
      will be randomized to receive either standard balance rehabilitation plus placebo eye
      exercises (CON) or standard balance rehabilitation plus vestibular-specific exercises (GS).
      Primary outcomes include symptoms, balance-related confidence, dynamic visual acuity,
      postural stability as measured by sensory organization test, fall risk as measured by dynamic
      gait index, and gait speed. Assessment will occur at baseline, discharge from physical
      therapy (PT), 1 and 6 months post-PT.
