      daunorubicin in induction therapy is reported effective and result in a more rapid response
      and a higher response rate than does the conventional dose, without additional toxic effects
      in elderly AML patients between 60 to 65 years.Higher Overall survival rate and Event-free
      survival rate was obtained in escalated group compared with conventional dose. We are
      wondering if Chinese older AML patients can benefit from this escalated induction regimen.

      High dose cytarabine in AML consolidation is reported improving the survival of elderly AML
      patients than the conventional doseï¼Œbut it is not determined in Chinese older adult AML
      patients.
