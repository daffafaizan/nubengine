      increased risk of developing dementia, both vascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The term
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes a transition state between normal cognitive
      function and dementia. The annual rate of conversion to dementia in MCI patients is around
      15% in the general population, ie regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. At
      present it is not possible to identify which patients with MCI are most likely to progress to
      AD. On this basis, the main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of
      diabetes favors the conversion of MCI to AD. We propose a case-control study comparing a
      group of 110 diabetic patients and a group of 110 non-diabetic patients with MCI matched by
      age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors. The main objective is the conversion to AD between
      the groups and if DM-2 is an independent risk factor. The secondary objective is to
      investigate whether genetic mechanisms related both to AD and DM-2 are associated with the
      increased risk of AD in diabetic patients. We will analyze 10 genes simultaneously associated
      with an increased risk of diabetes and / or its complications and AD.
