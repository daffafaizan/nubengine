      the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES) was initiated in 2002. AGES
      was designed to examine risk factors, including genetic susceptibility and gene/environment
      interaction, in relation to disease and disability in old age. The study is
      multidisciplinary, providing detailed phenotypes related to the cardiovascular,
      neurocognitive (including sensory), and musculoskeletal systems, and to body composition and
      metabolic regulation. Relevant quantitative traits, subclinical indicators of disease, and
      medical diagnoses are identified by using biomarkers, imaging, and other physiologic
      indicators. The AGES sample is drawn from an established population-based cohort, the
      Reykjavik Study. This cohort of men and women born between 1907 and 1935 has been followed in
      Iceland since 1967 by the Icelandic Heart Association. The AGES cohort, with cardiovascular
      risk factor assessments earlier in life and detailed late- life phenotypes of quantitative
      traits, will create a comprehensive study of aging nested in a relatively genetically
      homogeneous older population. This approach should facilitate identification of genetic
      factors that contribute to healthy aging as well as the chronic conditions common in old age.
