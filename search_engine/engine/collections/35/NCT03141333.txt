      difficulties in planning and execution of motor coordination activities like dressing, sports
      and writing. Increasing parents' capacity to manage their children's needs is part of the
      recommended DCD best practices, as soon as children are suspected to have DCD or early
      following diagnosis. Parents' capacity could be increased through simple, community-based
      interventions using a consultative approach. Using the Internet could be an interesting
      avenue to develop public community-based services and build parents' capacity to manage their
      child with DCD. The feasibility of recruiting and using the Internet to build parents'
      capacity is however unknown, since no such study have been conducted.

      This randomized feasibility trail will experiment a teleintervention, characterized by a
      virtual interaction between a health professional and a user by Internet, for children with
      DCD. The principal study goals are to determine if a randomized control trial would be
      feasible, particularly with regards to i) recruitment and retention of parents of children
      having a diagnosis or a suspicion of diagnosis of DCD, and ii) parents' utilization of the
      teleintervention. The study will also examine quantitatively and qualitatively families'
      acceptability of- and satisfaction with the teleintervention. As part of the evaluation of
      acceptability, the impact of the teleintervention on parental competencies will be explored.
      At the end of the 3-months randomized feasibility trial, the influence of the number of
      participants on the utilization of the teleintervention will be explored by providing access
      to the teleintervention to all participants (control and intervention).
