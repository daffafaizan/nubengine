      17%) but available prevalence estimates relie on studies conducted in specific subgroups
      (such as military, pregnant women or blood donors).

      The prevalence of HBV chronic infection remains undocumented in the general population of
      Senegal, and its health-related and socio-economic consequences need to be estimated.

      This research is based on a cross-sectional survey conducted in the general population with
      collection of biological, socio-behavioral and economic data at two levels (at the
      participants' home and in healthcare centers) in the area of Niakhar (located at 135 kms at
      the East of Dakar).

      The research includes three phases as follows:

      (i) Preliminary phase: information and communication about the research within the community,
      training of stakeholders and pilot survey

      (ii) Collection of data in the general population

      (iii) Communication of results on HBV status to participants and collection of additional
      data among HBV chronic individuals
