      XELOX at the interval. All almost-cCRs after neoadjuvant treatment were randomly divided into
      minimal operation group or Mile's group. All cCRs were treated with "watch and wait".
      Patients after local recurrence were randomly divided into minimal operation group or Mile's
      group. If pathological result was pathological staging 3 after neoadjuvant therapy（ypT3） in
      minimal operation group or local postoperative recurrence occurred, patients need supplement
      of abdominoperineal resection (APR). With 3 years follow-up，the main research goals are 3
      years of progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS). Secondary endpoints are
      side effects of chemotherapy, assessment of quality of life, surgical complications, adverse
      prognostic factors and so on.
