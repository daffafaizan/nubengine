    
      Three groups of participants (advanced chronic disease not yet in substitutive treatment,
      end-stage renal disease patients in hemodialysis and end-stage renal disease patients in
      peritoneal dialysis) will enter the study. The intervention will consist of a home-based
      exercise program. They will be provided with a booklet and the researcher will explain
      personally each of the exercises to the participants. Progression will be encouraged so that
      the participants should find the sessions 'somewhat hard' according to the rate of perceived
      exertion. Reinforcement will be high during the first 3 months (weekly phone calls, visits to
      the nephrology department) and none during the last 3 months. Assessment will be undertaken
      at three-time points: baseline, after 3 months of high reinforcement and after 3 more months
      of no reinforcement at all.

      Assessment will include strength, functional capacity, health-related quality of life,
      cognitive state and depressive symptoms.

      The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of home-based exercise to improve
      strength, physical function, health-related quality of life, cognitive state and depressive
      symptoms in advanced chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (hemodialysis and
      peritoneal dialysis). We also aim at describing all these variables in the three different
      groups of patients. Adherence and satisfaction with the exercise program will be recorded at
      the end of the study.

      Additionally, interobserver reliability will be calculated, so as reliability intraobserver
      in different measurement conditions (dialysis vs non-dialysis days).
