    
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a postural garment versus exercises in nurses with
      non-specific cervical pain.

      DESIGN: Randomized cross over clinical trial with a 3 months sequence treatment and a 3
      months washout period..

      PARTICIPANTS: Nurses and allied health professionals with cervical pain aged 21 to 55 years.

      INTERVENTIONS:

      Participants are allocated at random to receive interventions in two groups:

        -  P+ : a postural garment (Posture Plus Force - FGP srl ® - Italy) to be worn from 2 to 4
           hours per day, during 90 days.

        -  Ex: five physiotherapy sessions to learn stretching and strengthening exercises (20
           minutes) with instructions to continue at home on a daily basis for 90 days.

      The subjects in each group will be cross over after three months of wash out period.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcomes are postural control and pain intensity. Pictures on sagittal and
      frontal plane as well as measurements of static posturography with a scan (SpinalMouse ®) are
      conducted at T0 (pre-intervention), T1 immediately after garment fitting for P+ group and
      after the 5th session for Ex group, T30, T60 and T90 at day 30, day 60 and day 90 of
      follow-up. Pain is measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) on the same assessment days.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

      Statistical analysis is conducted following intention-to-treat principles, and the treatment
      effects calculated using linear mixed models.
