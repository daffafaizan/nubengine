      prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully with the conventional chemotherapy
      of CHOP. Apatinib is a new type of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-2. Some
      studies have shown that the combination of low-dose apatinib and camrelizumab shows a
      synergistic effect in the exploration of multiple solid tumors, and the adverse reactions of
      low-dose apatinib are significantly reduced, and the patients are well tolerated.The
      investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with
      apatinib in the patients with relapsed refractory diffuse large B cell lymphomafailed from
      second line chemotherapy.
