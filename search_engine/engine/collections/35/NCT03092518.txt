    
      Background:

        -  An estimated 24,590 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma are diagnosed annually in the U.S.

        -  The peritoneal surface is a site of metastasis found often at time of diagnosis and is a
           common (40%) site of recurrence.

        -  Laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage and cytopathologic analysis is a staging modality
           that can identify a subset of patients with microscopic peritoneal metastasis prior to
           consideration for definitive surgical therapy

        -  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been employed in advanced gastric cancers and as an
           adjuvant with an associated improvement in survival in systematic reviews

      Objectives:

      - Determine the overall survival in patients with cytology-positive gastric cancer treated
      with HIPEC and gastrectomy

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach

        -  Cytopathologic evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis

        -  Medically fit for systemic chemotherapy, HIPEC and gastrectomy

      Design:

      - Single arm, phase II study of HIPEC and gastrectomy
