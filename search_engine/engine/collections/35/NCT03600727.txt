      its use in intensive care units. Possible mechanisms included improved quality of sleep and
      an inhibitory effect on inflammation. A greater number of studies indicated that propofol has
      negative effect on postoperative cognitive function. In this study, patients who will receive
      hip and knee arthroplasty will be divided to two groups: Propofol group and Dexmedetomidine
      group. Spinal anesthesia will be used to meet the requirement of intraoperative analgesia.
      Patients in two groups will be sedated by propofol and dexmedetomidine, respectively. TNF-Î±
      and IL-6 in blood will be detected. And postoperative cognitive function of patients will be
      investigated. The objective of this study is to clarify the influence of these two different
      sedative drugs on peripheral inflammation induced by surgery, and the relationship with the
      change of postoperative cognitive function.
