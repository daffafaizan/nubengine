    
      This is an observational, direct-to-participant, web-based, longitudinal study of adults with
      COVID-19 or COVID-19 like illness to better understand risk factors, symptoms, and treatments
      for COVID-19 illness and vaccine safety and effectiveness. Upon consent and enrollment,
      participants will complete an initial baseline survey reporting their demographics, relevant
      medical history, testing, vaccination, symptoms, use of prescription medications as well as
      use of supplements and other factors. The study follow-up period is 12 months. During the
      first month of follow-up participants will be invited to complete a symptom diary weekly to
      gauge symptom progression and severity and to provide updates on pharmaceutical and
      non-pharmaceutical interventions as well as healthcare encounters. Reporting will then reduce
      to monthly for Month 2 through 12.
