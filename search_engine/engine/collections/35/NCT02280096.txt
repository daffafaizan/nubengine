      services of Social Security Mexican Institute (IMSS) at the National Medical Center (CMN)
      "Siglo XXI" Specialties Hospital over the period of 1 year. Of those meeting inclusion
      criteria, 24 will be selected for the study. After signing an informed consent, they will be
      randomized into 12 for the intervention arm and 12 for the placebo arm. All patients will
      receive capsules for daily consumption according to their assignment, with no visible
      difference between capsules. Dosage will be 6.5-7.5 mg/kg to a limit of 50 mg. These capsules
      will be taken for a period of 22 weeks. A battery of neuropsychological tests will be
      administered at baseline, after 22 weeks, and after an additional 22 weeks of follow-up to
      assess cognitive performance and motor function. Emotional state will be assessed with the
      Beck Depression Inventory at each of the three afore mentioned points.

      After the follow-up period, all test results will be analyzed and compared to determine the
      efficacy and safety of 4-aminopyridine on the cognitive performance and motor function of
      patients. Mann-Whitney U will be used for statistical analysis.
