    
      Givinostat or placebo oral suspension (10 mg/mL) will be administered orally as 2 oral doses
      daily while the subject is in fed state, according to the subject's weight.

      Study drug should be permanently stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  severe drug-related diarrhoea;

        -  any drug-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE);

        -  QTcorrected by Fridericia's formulas (QTcF) >500 msec;

        -  platelets (PLT) count ≤50 x 1.000.000.000/L (10E9/L);

        -  White blood cell (WBC) ≤ 2.0 x 10E9/L;

        -  Hemoglobin (Hb) ≤ 8.0 g/dL.

      Study drug should be temporarily stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  PLT count <75 x 10E9/L but >50 x 10E9/L;

        -  WBC < 3.0 x 10E9/L but > 2.0 x 10E9/L;

        -  Hb < 10.0 g/dL but > 8.0 g/dL;

        -  moderate or severe diarrhoea.

        -  tryglicerides >300 mg/dL In case the study drug was temporarily stopped, the study drug
           can be resumed at a level 20% smaller than the dose at which the Adverse Event leading
           to temporary stop occurred, once platelets and/or WBC and/or Hb and/or tryglicerides are
           normalized or when diarrhoea is mild
