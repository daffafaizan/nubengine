      population in the industrial countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,
      resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The majority of the insomniacs suffer
      chronically from their complaints. It has been reported that in patients with chronic
      insomnia lasting longer than six months, 50% had a past or current mental disorder. This
      raises the possibility that treatment of insomnia may reduce the risk for psychological
      conditions. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial is
      designed to assess the efficacy and safety of esmirtazapine in patients suffering from
      chronic primary insomnia.
