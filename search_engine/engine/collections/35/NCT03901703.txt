      to deficiencies in motor control, balance and functional abilities. All children with
      Cerebral Palsy have shown to present with foot and ankle disorders; the ankle dorsi and
      plantar flexor muscles are both problematic; the plantarflexors are usually spastic and the
      dorsiflexors are usually not active enough and usually these muscle problems lead to problems
      in the childrens' gait abilities. When rehabilitation programs are examined, the results of
      exercises addressing these problems do not have precise answers. Functional strengthening
      exercises have been proven to be effective in patients with spastic cerebral palsy. However,
      which exercise is the most effective is unknown. Which muscle goup has the most effect on
      gait, balance and functional activities is still unclear. Therefore, the investigator's aim
      in planning this study is to examine the effectiveness of three progressive functional
      exercise programs in children with unilateral and bilateral spastic cerebral palsy.
