      hypothesized that HIV-specific immune responses are responsible for the period of relative
      quiescence of viral replication. Recent studies suggest that these immune functions can be
      augmented by vaccination with HIV-derived antigens.

      Patients are randomized to receive rgp120/HIV-1MN vaccine or alum adjuvant placebo by
      intramuscular injection at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, with or without daily oral
      zidovudine (AZT) or their current stable dose of antiretroviral therapy. After completing the
      primary vaccination series, patients are permitted to continue into an extension phase, in
      which they receive a booster vaccination at weeks 28, 36, and 44. Patients will be stratified
      by CD4 count: 350-500, 200-349, and 50-199 cells/mm3. A fourth group with counts of 350-500
      cells/mm3 will serve as a pilot group and receive vaccine only.
