      prepared by the Nuclear Medicine Department and the sulfur colloid kit (equipped with a
      filter of 220 nm in diameter to control the size of colloidal particles) was prepared by
      Beijing Xinkesida company. All patients were injected with 99mTc-Sulfur colloid
      (1.0~1.2ml/29.6~55.5MBq) in periareolar parenchyma gland under the guidance of ultrasound
      using the "new injection technique" 3-18h before surgery. SPECT / CT lymphoscintigraphy was
      performed 30 min before surgery, and the radioactive concentration ("hot spot") near the
      sternum was defined as IMSLN positive.

      IM-SLNB: After modified radical mastectomy / breast-conserving radical surgery,
      intraoperative Î³-detector (Neoprobe 2000, Johnson& Johnson Company) was used to locate
      IM-SLN, and intercostal IM-SLNB was performed: open pectoralis major muscle, expose the
      parasternal intercostal space at the corresponding intercostal level (if the patient
      underwent breast-conserving surgery and the tumor was located in the lateral quadrant, an
      additional 3 cm of skin incision was required), cut the intercostal muscle at radioactive
      concentration site parallel to the rib, search and locate IMSLN with gamma detector, dissect
      precisely to avoid injury of internal mammary arteries and veins, and then sent the removed
      tissue to routine pathological examination.

      Pathologic diagnosis: IMSLN was divided into 2mm tissue fragments according to the long axis
      (short diameter < 2 mm, no division), every tissue fragment required one layer of routine HE
      staining pathological examination. In this study, metastasis > 0.2mm was defined as IMSLN
      positive, while solitary tumor cell was defined as IMSLN negative. Further IHC detection of
      CK-9 was required if the IMSLN was HE staining negative to exclude micrometastasis.
