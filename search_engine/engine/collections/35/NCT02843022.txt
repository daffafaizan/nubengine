    
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial is to determine whether receiving
      standardized messages (text or email) from a postpartum nurse four times/week for 6 months
      after delivery will decrease symptoms of postpartum depression and parenting stress. Enrolled
      women will be randomized to one of three groups. The first group will receive the usual care,
      which is a phone call from a nurse within the first few weeks postpartum. The second group
      will receive four standardized messages each week, the content of which will include infant
      care, maternal self-care and inspirational material. The third group will receive the same
      four standardized messages each week, and in addition, two of these weekly messages will
      offer the option to respond with a request for a nurse to call them. Baseline data will be
      collected during the postpartum hospitalization, and follow-up will occur by email at 3
      weeks, 3 months and 6 months postpartum.
