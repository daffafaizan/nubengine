      Chi Minh City, Vietnam. A sample size of 1,000 infants will be recruited to the study between
      8 to 9 weeks (which is around 2 months) of age. These infants will receive two doses of the
      rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix with an interval of 28-37 days (or 4-5 weeks). The parents will be
      requested to bring the infants 2-3 days following each Rotarix vaccination to receive the
      standard EPI vaccinations. The infants will then be under passive and active surveillance for
      rotavirus-associated diarrhoea until 18 months of age. Blood samplings during pre and post
      vaccination and at 6, 12 and 18 month old visits will be collected.
