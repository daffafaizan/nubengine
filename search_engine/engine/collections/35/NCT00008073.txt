      with doxorubicin in patients with advanced cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of octreotide. Patients receive doxorubicin IV over
      5 minutes on day 1 of course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients receive octreotide SC
      continuously on days 1-7 and doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes on day 5. Treatment continues
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      stable or responsive disease after 3 courses of therapy receive a maximum of 6 additional
      courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of octreotide until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
