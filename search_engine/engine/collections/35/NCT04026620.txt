      effective than printed information alone (Informational pamphlets only) in helping women
      reduce their risk of giving birth to children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) at
      Primary Health Care Facilities, in addition to evaluation individuals for risky health
      behaviors by having them complete brief screening questionnaires that give them information
      of how much risk they might be facing from their alcohol or other drug use. When a pregnant
      mother drinks alcohol, she puts her baby at risk. FASD is a group of growth, mental, and
      physical problems that may occur in a baby when a mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy.
