    
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) designed to
      assess performance and safety and collect patient outcome data on a commercially available
      human split thickness skin allograft (Theraskin™) with SOC dressing compared to SOC dressings
      alone in the treatment of Diabetic Foot Wounds (DFU) . The study will last thirteen weeks,
      with a two week screening period prior to enrollment. Theraskin™ is an allograft tissue and
      will be used in compliance with homologous use by the FDA under section 361 of the PHS Act
      and 21 CFR Part 1271.

      There are two arms in the study:

      Arm 1: The Experimental Arm , that will include SOC Therapy. SOC therapy in this study is
      offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too
      large for a CAM), appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, infection management (systemic
      antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement) and application of human split thickness
      skin allograft (Theraskin™) followed by a moisture retention dressing and a padded 3-layer
      dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compression wrap (DynaflexTM or
      equivalent).

      Arm 2: The Standard of Care Arm. The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM
      boots or total contact casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM),
      appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in
      conjunction with debridement) and wound care covering with calcium alginate Fibracol dressing
      followed by a moisture retentive dressing and a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4
      gauze pads, soft roll and compressive wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).
