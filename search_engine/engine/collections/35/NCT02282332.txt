    
      Single-Center, open-label study of the effect of ticagrelor on the reduction in the lipid
      pool in 30 patients with multi-vessel CAD 2 Treatment periods over 6 months, with 2
      additional follow-up phone calls at 1 and 3 months.

      Non-urgent PCI requiring stent placement and evaluation by NIRS/IVUS at baseline and 6 month
      follow up A second concomitant coronary lesion with diameter stenosis greater than 50% will
      also be imaged using NIRS/IVUS.

      Patients will be discharged on a ticagrelor regiment of 90 mg twice a day for the 6 month
      study.

      Blood samples will be drawn at baseline prior to ticagrelor being administered and again at
      follow up.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Female (post menopausal or surgically sterile) and/or male aged 18 years or older

        -  Multi-vessel coronary artery disease

        -  Statin therapy for minimum of 6 weeks prior to enrollment in the study with no plan for
           further adjustment

        -  Non-emergent PCI for ACS with stent placement requiring dual-antiplatelet therapy

        -  Ability to safely perform NIRS/IVUS for a concomitant non-culprit lesion with diameter
           stenosis â‰¥ 50% that was not treated with PCI

        -  Willing and able to sign informed consent and participate in follow-up

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Thienopyridine or ticagrelor use in the last month

        -  Need for coronary artery bypass surgery or other surgeries during the follow-up period

        -  Documented medication non-compliance

        -  Chronic inflammatory disorder or treatment with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
           drugs

        -  Prior or current malignancy within the last 5 years

        -  Concomitant severe illness or reduced life expectancy that will prevent follow-up
           cardiac catheterization

        -  Active infection

        -  Pregnant or lactating women

        -  End-stage renal disease

        -  History of intracranial hemorrhage

        -  Active pathological bleeding

        -  Known sever hepatic impairment

        -  Known hypersensitivity to ticagrelor

      Study Procedures:

      After consent is obtained non-urgent PCI requiring stent placement and evaluation by
      NIRS/IVUS at baseline is performed and once again at 6 month follow up. A second concomitant
      coronary lesion with diameter stenosis greater than 50% will also be imaged using NIRS/IVUS.
      Patients will be discharged on a ticagrelor regiment of 90 mg twice a day for the 6 month
      study.Blood samples will be drawn at baseline prior to ticagrelor being administered and
      again at follow up. There will be 1 month phone follow up, 3 month phone follow up and a 6
      month clinical follow up that includes collecting blood, repeat catheterization, and repeat
      NIRS/IVUS procedure.
