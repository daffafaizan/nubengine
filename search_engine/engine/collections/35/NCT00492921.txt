        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with
           steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen at 28 days post-treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide once daily for 1-4 days beginning on day 1 and
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood
      counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.
