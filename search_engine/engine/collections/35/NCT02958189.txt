      activity guidelines. Tweet4Wellness is an innovative light physical activity, specifically
      walking, intervention which randomly assigns participants to a 25-person private, online
      support group that will receive daily, theory-based messages as peer-to-peer discussion
      prompts. Many text-based interventions do not base the intervention text messages in behavior
      change theory, but this study will base the daily messages in the behavior change theories
      such as implementation intentions, social support, mindfulness, and social learning theory.

      The trial will be conducted over a 6-month periods. For the first 3 months, there will be 2
      groups: Group 1 will receive the Twitter intervention and a "Fitbit" triaxial pedometer to
      track their steps throughout the day; Group 2 will receive the Fitbit pedometer only.

      For the second 3 months: Group 1 an Group 2 will track their physical activity with Fitbit
      only.
