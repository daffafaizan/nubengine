      undergone radical treatment, surgery or radiotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
      between two and five years previously. Following consent, participants will be asked to
      provide blood samples every six months for up to the next five years. Information from their
      routine clinical care, including information from any imaging, diagnostic tissue samples and
      blood tests will be collected. We will also request access to any original surplus diagnostic
      material, as well as future, excess tissue from diagnostic samples.

      Blood samples will be analysed using various new scientific techniques looking to correlate
      emergence of new primary cancer (or recurrence of original NSCLC) with blood based markers.
