      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, has been increasingly recognized as the
      hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Both inflammation and insulin resistance are
      considered to be pivotal pathogenic mechanisms of NAFLD, as well as metabolic syndrome, type
      2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. There is mounting evidence implicating adipokines secreted
      from adipose tissue in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD, in addition to the
      development of insulin resistance and inflammation. Selenoprotein P (SeP) has recently been
      reported as a novel hepatokine that regulates insulin resistance and systemic energy
      metabolism in rodents and humans. Although previous studies have shown a close relationship
      among insulin resistance, inflammation, and NAFLD, as far as we know, there is no previous
      report evaluating the association between SeP and NAFLD. In the present study, we examined
      serum SeP levels in subjects with increased visceral fat area (VFA) or liver fat accumulation
      measured with computed tomography (CT). We evaluated the relationship between SeP levels and
      cardiometabolic risk factors.
