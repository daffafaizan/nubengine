    
      The anogenital distance of female newborns is shorter than that of male newborns.

      Urogenital disorders, such as hypospadias and micro-penis, are associated with a shorter
      anogenital distance.

      Anogenital distance is a good marker of fetal exposure to androgenic substances.

      Prenatal anogenital distance ultrasound measure can help the diagnosis in case of doubt about
      fetal sexual phenotype or in case of urogenital disorder suspicion (hypospadias or
      micropenis).

      Is the anogenital distance easy to make measure? Can this procedure be reproduced? What are
      the threshold values to determine fetal sex at each term of pregnancy?
