      require treatment for colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has
      not gotten better with other treatment. Subjects will undergo some initial tests to ensure
      that they meet all criteria necessary to participate in the study. Once the subject has
      completed initial testing and meets eligibility criteria, the subject will begin treatment
      with 120 mg of regorafenib (3 tablets) each day for 21 days (3 weeks) in a 28 day cycle (4
      weeks). After the first cycle, the doctor will discuss the possibility of increasing the dose
      to 160 mg (4 tablets) each day for 21 days (3 weeks) in a 28 day cycle (4 weeks) based on the
      subjects health status. During the study, assessments will be performed to monitor the
      subjects tolerance and response to the treatment. Regorafenib will continue as long as the
      subject is tolerating the treatment and the subjects colorectal cancer is either responding
      to treatment or remains stable.
