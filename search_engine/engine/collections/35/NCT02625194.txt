      anticipating difficult airway. This technique takes several minutes without oxygen supply,
      which results in hypoxia when it prolonged. If continuous supply of oxygen during procedure
      improve the oxygenation, we can reduce the risk of hypoxemia and increase the safety margin
      during procedure.
