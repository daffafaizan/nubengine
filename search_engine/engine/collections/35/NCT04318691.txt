      mechanisms involving the immune system, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been
      recently described as an additional way neutrophils are able to use to fight against
      bacteria. NETs are made of DNA and antimicrobial proteins. In the other hand, NETs promote
      coagulation and may contribute to evolution of severe pneumonia into acute respiratory
      distress syndrome.

      The secondary objectives of the study include the research of the relation between blood
      NETosis and alveolar NETosis with:

        -  the documentation of invasive pulmonary infection based on microbiological analysis
           criteria (which would be bacteria or viral) of LBA at admission to ICU;

        -  the diagnosis value of usually used biomarkers: procalcitonin and C-reactive protein;

        -  marbrure score at admission to ICU;

        -  arterial lactatemia;

        -  scores of gravity at admission IGSII and SOFA;

        -  all-cause mortality at day-28;

        -  duration of mechanical ventilation at day-28;

        -  duration of amines at day-28;

        -  developement of hemodynamic failure;

        -  developement of pulmonary circulatory failure.

      The study will include 1) 60 patients under mechanical ventilation admitted to the intensive
      care unit for acute respiratory failure, 2) 10 control patients admitted to the ICU after a
      planned vascular surgery and 3) 10 healthy subjects.
