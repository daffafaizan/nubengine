      pattern of drinking that reach blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 80 mg/dl in a short
      period of time (2 hours), that typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for
      men. Despite its high prevalence and association with morbidity and mortality, there are no
      previous experimental studies evaluating alcohol concentrations after a "binge drinking"
      episode neither its effects on biomarkers of acute damage and exposure/consumption.

      The aims of this study are 1) to determine the pharmacokinetics of alcohol after experimental
      administration of alcohol simulating a "binge-drinking" episode in young adults 2) to
      determine the profile of biomarkers of acute damage and exposure/consumption to alcohol 3) to
      determine the pharmacokinetic parameters and evaluate the acute effects alcohol and its
      relationship with biomarkers.
