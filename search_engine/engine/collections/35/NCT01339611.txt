      orientation, using instructional material (slides and illustrative booklet) during
      hospitalization period. After the discharge 2 phone calls will be done (after: a week and
      four weeks) focusing on the strategies to improve patient's self-efficacy to manage the oral
      anticoagulation. There will be a personal contact among researcher and participants when the
      patients return at the oral anticoagulant ambulatory, two months after the treatment start.
      At this time the following variables of interest will be evaluated: Health-related quality of
      life; adherence to treatment and patients' self-efficacy.
