    
      In this prospective cohort pilot study, eligible critically ill children aged 3 to 17 years
      will receive in addition to their usual care, a passive and/or an active mobility
      intervention, depending on their level of consciousness or cognitive ability. The active
      intervention will consist of an interactive video game (X Box 360 Kinect), while a cycle
      ergometer will be used as the passive intervention. The mobility interventions will be
      applied for a minimum of 10 minutes on day 1, and 20 minutes on day 2. For unconscious
      patients, or eligible patients who cognitively impaired, the passive intervention will be
      applied. As soon as the patient is conscious and cooperative, the active intervention will be
      applied.

      The primary outcomes of interest in this pilot study are feasibility (defined as the ability
      to screen and enroll patients, consent rate and protocol adherence). Secondary outcomes of
      interest include safety outcomes, clinical outcomes and patient and caregiver satisfaction
      with the intervention.
