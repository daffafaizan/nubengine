    
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women. It affects
      10 % of patients who undergo assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Rotterdam criteria
      defined by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Endocrinology (ESHRE) are used for
      the diagnosis of PCOS. According to such criteria, PCOS affects 5-10% of women of
      reproductive age.

      Patients with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria, as well as those with polycystic
      ovaries by ultrasound, have a high risk of an exaggerated response to ovulation induction
      therapy. Complications of the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) include
      hemoconcentration, thromboembolic disorders, electrolyte disorders, ascites, hydrothorax,
      ovarian torsion, respiratory failure, liver failure, kidney failure or even death.

      There is a lack of reliable markers that indicate risk of OHSS. It is also unknown whether
      any specific criteria proposed in the Rotterdam consensus is more important than another or
      independently influence on the results of the ARTs.

      The aim of this study is both to determine the prevalence of PCOS in infertile patients who
      require ART in our Center and to evaluate the usefulness of each specific diagnosis criteria
      of PCOS as predictor of risk of OHSS. It also seeks to establish a cohort of patients
      identified according to specific Rotterdam criteria of PCOS to assess the incidence of long
      term complications.
