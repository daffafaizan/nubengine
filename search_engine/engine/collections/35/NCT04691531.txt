      assessment of the anatomy of the sacrum, including the relationship of the sacral hiatus to
      the dural sac ending. Real-time US allows visualization of the needle during insertion to
      reach the dural sac, and to see the turbulence and distention of the layers during injection
      of the local anesthetic drug.

      This prospective clinical trial study compares between two different sizes of the used
      needles, in terms of success rate, number of punctures, detection of the US signs
      (visualization of the needle, dural displacement, turbulence, and distention), and
      complications in pediatrics aging between 6-36 months requiring elective lower abdominal and
      perineal surgeries.
