      with a history of admission to the ICU with a severe asthma exacerbation are contacted by
      phone and mail and DNA samples are obtained via saliva. In the prospective arm, patients
      admitted to the ICU are contacted prospectively and DNA is obtained either via saliva or
      blood.
