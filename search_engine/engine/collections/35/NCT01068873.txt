      which may reduce the development of long term complications while preserving future HIV
      treatment options. This trial explores an antiretroviral treatment regimen which does not
      include the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class which is thought to have
      long-term toxicity. This is a non-randomized, open label trial in participants meeting entry
      requirements.

      Participants will be evaluated at screening, baseline,and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 to
      include clinical assessments as well as laboratory assessments.

      An interim analysis will be performed when all patients have reached the week 24 visit.
