    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Characterization of the transcriptomic landscape in diagnosis and relapse of T-cell
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the direct comparison with corresponding
           physiological samples (human thymus).

        -  Perform high-throughput transcriptome ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing using matched
           diagnostic T-precursor pediatric ALL samples (peripheral blood or bone marrow).

      OUTLINE: Archived peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are analyzed for long non-coding
      RNA (IncRNA) expression and sequencing.
