      adjunctive SI in the family-based treatment program of children with developmental delay
      (DD). The study subjects are children with DD who attended an early intervention (EI) program
      at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, which is the largest general hospital in the
      Southern Taiwan. Each participating child undergo a joint assessment by a pediatrician, a
      rehabilitation doctor, a child psychiatrist, a speech therapist, a physical therapist, an
      occupational therapist, and a social worker. Once the diagnosis of developmental delay is
      confirmed, the child will be scheduled for prescribed family-based early intervention in the
      same hospital. Children (between 2 to 4 years old) who attend the program will be enrolled in
      this study. Informed consent will be obtained from the children and their primary caregivers
      after they received a complete description of the study. The participants are categorized
      into three different groups based on their intervention method. The choice of intervention
      method will be according to the willingness and expedience of the children's caregivers.
