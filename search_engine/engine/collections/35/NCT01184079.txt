      HPV vaccine among males 18-24 years old, comparing an on-time administration of the third
      dose with delayed administration of the third dose. All participants would receive the first
      and second doses according to schedule. They would be randomized to either Dose 3 at 6 months
      or Dose 3 at 12 months.

      Blood would be drawn for titers at twice from all participants: pre-dose 1 and one month post
      Dose 3.

      No cytology studies or DNA studies will be conducted.

      1.1 Aims:

        1. Determine if delay in the third dose is immunologically non-inferior to the standard
           administration schedule (1 month post-dose 3).

        2. Determine the side effect profile of a delayed third dose, in comparison to the standard
           schedule.

        3. Determine the preference and compliance of the men for the timing of the third dose.

      1.2 Hypothesis for non- inferiority:

      The GMTs in the test group (T) are non-inferior to the usual timing control group (C):

      H0: δ ≤ -δ0 versus H1: δ > -δ0 where δ = log (GMTT )- log (GMTC) and δ0 is the pre-specified
      non-inferiority margin.
