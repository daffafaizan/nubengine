      radiotherapy and chemotherapy is sensitive at first treatment. Topotecan monotherapy is
      recommended in the NCCN guidelines for second-line standard treatment and the CSCO SCLC
      guidelines for diagnosis and treatment 2020 edition, but its effective rate is low, 24% for
      platinum-sensitive relapse, 2-6% for platinum-resistant, overall PFS is about 3-4 months and
      OS is about 6-8 months. Although immunotherapy have been successful at the first-line and
      third-line treatments of SCLC in the extensive stage , the second-line treatment has not
      achieved a breakthrough, and the effective rate of third-line immune single drug is between
      10-20%.It is an important challenge and breakthrough to effectively improve the efficacy and
      survival of second-line treatment of SCLC. Immunocombination therapy is an important strategy
      to improve the efficacy. Some studies have shown that PARP inhibitors and low-dose
      radiotherapy can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. PARP inhibitors are not only
      sensitizers of chemoradiotherapy, but also immunomodulators. High dose radiotherapy has the
      effect of in situ vaccine and increases tumor antigen release presentation. Low dose
      radiotherapy promotes the penetration of immune cells into tumor stroma and tumor bed and
      increases immune response. The combination of high and low dose radiotherapy and immunization
      can improve the immune effect and increase the incidence of distant effect. So the objective
      of this study is to observe the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment of SCLC with
      SBRT and low-dose radiotherapy combined with PARP inhibitor + temozolomide and PD-1 /PD-L1
      inhibitor.
