    
      Three hundred and fifty subjects will be enrolled and injected with the study drug DWP-450
      over the course of the 365 day study.

      Subjects with moderate or severe glabellar lines at maximum frown on the 4 point Glabellar
      Line Scale (GLS, 0=none, 1= mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), as judged by the investigator, will
      be eligible for injection with DWP-450. After each injection, subjects will be followed and
      are eligible for a repeat injection if their GLS is ≥2 at maximum frown, as judged by the
      Investigator. If a subject does not have a GLS≥2 they will be followed monthly until eligible
      for repeat treatment.

      Subjects may receive up to a maximum of 4 treatments and will be followed for 365 days from
      initial treatment.
