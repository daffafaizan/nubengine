      infraglottis is considered to be the narrowest part of the airway. An optimal endotracheal
      tube (ETT) placement with cuffed ETT is to ensure the cuff position below the cricoid ring
      (cuff free glottis): as well have sufficient distance between ETT tip and carina. Various
      modalities including clinical examination, ETCO2, imaging (X-ray and ultrasound) are
      routinely used to verify the position and the tip of the ETT in the airway, however
      verification of the cuff position remains obscure.
