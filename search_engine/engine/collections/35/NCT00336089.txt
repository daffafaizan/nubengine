        -  Determine whether a moderate-intensity exercise program comprising cardiorespiratory and
           resistance training of the legs, back, abdominal, trunk, and arm musculature vs a
           control group attenuates fatigue and pain in breast cancer survivors.

        -  Determine whether this exercise program will significantly improve the quality of life
           of these patients.

        -  Determine whether this exercise program can significantly reduce the number of days of
           absenteeism from work in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this exercise program can significantly attenuate mood disturbances in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (exercise program): Patients participate in an exercise program comprising
           cardiorespiratory (walking on a treadmill) and resistance training for 1 hour, 3 times
           weekly for 12 weeks.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients undergo no intervention. In both arms, patients complete
           questionnaires regarding general health, mood, work attendance, and physical activity
           before the start of study treatment and then every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients also
           complete a 7-day physical activity diary and sleep diary every 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
