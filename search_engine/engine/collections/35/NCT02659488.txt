    
      12-week, open-label LDX trial for BED including fMRI assessments to test the following
      specific predictions:

        1. At baseline, patients with BED will show greater ventral prefrontal, striatal, and
           amygdala brain activation to high-calorie food pictures (reward) than matched healthy
           comparison subjects.

        2. After 12 weeks of LDX treatment, BED will exhibit reduced ventral prefrontal, striatal
           and amygdala brain activation to food cues compared to baseline.

        3. BED patients who display cessation of binge eating and those who demonstrate clinical
           improvement after 12 weeks of LDX treatment will show greater reductions in ventral
           prefrontal, striatal, and amygdala brain activation to food pictures than patients who
           do not stop binge eating and those who do not improve, respectively.
