      and 1.0 mL (given as two 0.5 mL injections in separate arms) of PCV13 in adults 55 through 74
      years of age previously vaccinated with PPSV23. The study will enroll two groups of
      participants. Group I participants will all receive an open-label dose of 0.5 mL PCV13 and
      will include 294 adults 55-74 years of age who have not previously received 23-valent
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Group II will be randomized 1:1 to receive 0.5
      mL PCV13 (Group IIA) or 0.5 mL PCV13 in the right arm and 0.5 mL PCV 13 in the left arm
      (Group IIB). Group II will include 588 adults 55 through 74 years of age who previously
      received a single dose of PPSV23 > /=3 years and < /=7 years prior to enrollment. Enrollment
      in both groups will be stratified by age group (55 through 64 years and 65 through 74
      years).The study duration is approximately 18 months. The primary objectives are: to
      determine if two 0.5 mL doses of PCV13 are statistically significantly more immunogenic than
      a single 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 for at least some of the vaccine serotypes among participants
      55 through 74 years of age previously vaccinated with PPSV23, as measured by
      serotype-specific OPA titers 28 days after study vaccination, and is non-inferior to 12
      vaccine serotypes; and determine if two 0.5 mL doses of PCV13 administered to participants
      previously vaccinated with PPSV23 are non-inferior to a single dose of 0.5 mL of PCV13
      administered to vaccine-naÃ¯ve adults 55 through 74 years of age for the 12 vaccine serotypes,
      as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 28 days after study vaccination. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to: determine if two x 0.5mL doses of PCV13 is statistically
      significantly more immunogenic than a single 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 for at least some of the
      vaccine serotypes among participants 55 through 74 years of age previously vaccinated with
      PPSV23, as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 180 days after study vaccination, and is
      non-inferior to 12 vaccine serotypes; to determine if two x 0.5mL doses of PCV13 administered
      to participants previously vaccinated with PPSV23 is non-inferior to a single dose of 0.5 mL
      of PCV13 administered to vaccine-naÃ¯ve adults 55 through 74 years of age for 12 vaccine
      serotypes, as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 180 days after study vaccination.
