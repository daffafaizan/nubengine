    
      The R-LAST (Right Language screening test) comprises 8 subtests and a total of 15 items.

      Validation will focus on the internal validity (no ceiling or floor effect, no redundancy,
      internal consistency), the external validity (against a "gold standard" in order to evaluate
      its specificity and its sensitivity) and the interclass agreement of R-LAST. The median time
      to administrate de scale will be calculated.

      The investigators will validate the scale by administering it to 300 consecutive patients
      within 24 hours after admission to our 2 stroke units (Centre Hospitalier de Versailles and
      Centre hospitalier du sud francilien) and to 100 stabilized patients with and without
      atypical crossed aphasia using the MEC-P evaluation as a reference.

      Patients must be 100% right-handed (Edinburgh test), be of French mother tongue, have no
      history of neurological disease, have no sensory disturbances (blindness, deafness) and no
      mirror crossed aphasia detected by the LAST (minimum score of 14/15 with a loss point granted
      for the "automatic speech" subtest, potentially stranded in right strokes)
