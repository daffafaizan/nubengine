      split-thickness grafts are harvested per patient, one serving as control and the other as
      experimental. The experimental sites were covered with either autologous PRP gel or ATE
      prepared in the OR, which was selected in an unblinded manner due to surgical theater
      convenience. However, donor sites were randomized through a computer generator. Covered with
      a semiocclusive film, wounds were separated and followed up on days 3,5,7,10,14 for wound
      healing and 30 and 60 for scar evaluation. Digital photography and specto-photocutometry was
      employed to know the hemoglobin and melanin content of the wounds, and custom-made software
      was used to calculate the percentage of wound re-epithelialization.
