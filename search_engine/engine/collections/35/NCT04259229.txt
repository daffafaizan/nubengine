      will lead to greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and systolic and
      diastolic blood pressures. The brain health-related outcomes and other cardiometabolic risk
      outcomes (e.g. lipoprotein particle size) are exploratory due to the paucity of human
      research addressing these important topics. Collectively, this short-term (8-week)
      randomized, controlled feeding trial will provide important pilot data to inform the
      plausibility, focus, and design of longer-term intervention trials, consistent with The
      Mushroom Council's research agenda.
