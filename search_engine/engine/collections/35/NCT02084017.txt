    
      The study is a non-blinded randomized control trial. The study examines the effect on wound
      healing and surgical site infection using negative pressure wound therapy compared to
      standard dressing in high-risk patients (BMI > 30, previous femoral cut-down). The
      investigators expected to find a lower surgical site infection rate in patients using the
      NPWT device.

      Patients after giving informed consent will be randomized to receive either NPWT or standard
      wound therapy following tier lower-limb revascularization operative. Both will be applied
      under sterile conditions immediately post-operatively. The intervention will be left for 4-7
      days depending on the discharge date and the standard dressing will be removed on
      post-operative day two.

      The data will be analyzed with an intention to treat analysis.
