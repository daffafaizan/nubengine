      Covid-19 patients, ICU-admitted patients with septic shock unrelated to Covid-19 and matched
      control subjects.

      Primary hemostasis and coagulation parameters and endothelial biomarkers are measured.
      Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is monitored through measurements of
      plasma renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and serum soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
      Vascular oxidative status is assessed by measuring plasma lipids peroxides. Neutrophilic
      polymorphonuclear activation is assessed by measuring plasma levels of Triggering receptor
      expressed on myeloid cells-1. Vascular nitric oxide bioavailability is measured by
      quantification of the concentration of heme-nitrosylated hemoglobin (HbNO) in venous
      erythrocytes using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Structural abnormalities of
      vascular endothelial cells were analyzed by Transmission Electron- and Scanning Electron
      Microscopy.
