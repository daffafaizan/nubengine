      assigned to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy (investigational
      arm)or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (control arm). Patients in both arms receive radical
      radiotherapy and cisplatin (40mg/m2 on day 1) weekly during radiotherapy. Patients in the
      investigational arm receive cisplatin (80mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (800mg/m2 on Day 1
      to 5) every four weeks for three cycles after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are
      stratified according to the treatment centers. The primary end point was failure-free
      survival (FFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), distant failure-free
      survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), the initial response rates
      after treatments, toxic effects and treatment compliance. All efficacy analyses were
      conducted in the intention-to-treat population; the safety population included only patients
      who received their randomly assigned treatment.
