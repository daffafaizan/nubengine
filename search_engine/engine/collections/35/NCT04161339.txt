      morbidity and mortality. The mechanism by which sleep apnea leads to coronary artery disease
      remains unclear. It is known that intermittent hypoxia, the main characteristic of sleep
      apnea, leads to inflammation and consequently may lead to endothelial dysfunction.
      Endothelial dysfunction precedes the development of atherosclerotic disease and the
      occurrence of cardiovascular events. Agents that potentially act to improve endothelial
      function may assist in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Patients using
      immunomodulators due to rheumatic diseases have a lower prevalence of cardiovascular
      diseases. However, the cardioprotective effect of these drugs in patients without autoimmune
      diseases is not known. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an immunomodulator used in the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition to its
      anti-inflammatory properties, HCQ reduces cholesterol and glycemia levels and has
      antithrombotic effects. The drug is inexpensive and widely available. The adverse effects of
      HCQ are rare and occur more frequently when using high doses.
