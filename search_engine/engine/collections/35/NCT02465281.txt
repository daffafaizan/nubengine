      location of the brain lesion affects arm and hand function. We are hoping to collect data in
      the form of assessments what you feel and how your arm moves, surveys about activities in
      daily life and well-being, and we will perform 1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. MRI
      scans are loud but painless; nothing is injected. With MRI, we collect images from the brain.
