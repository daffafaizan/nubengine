      photopneumatic system for treatment of mild to moderate acne on the face or body - including
      neck, chest, and back - of up to 24 subjects. To support this clinical assessment, the
      affected areas to be treated will be documented at baseline, at each subsequent treatment
      visit (up to 6 treatments), and at one (1) month and three (3) months following final
      treatment.
