    
      a cohort study on greater than 70000 Egyptian patients had been conducted. for all
      patients,1- we detected the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA antigens ( hepatitis C virus)presence
      using BIOLINE HCV kits( qualitative test for diagnosis of hepatitis C virus in the blood),
      For all positive patients, confirmatory rapid screening test was performed and all patients
      who tested positive twice underwent a qPCR test using QIAampMinElute Virus Spin kit (Thermo
      Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) performed according to the manufacturer's recommended
      protocol.

      2- Investigators measured blood sugar levels for each patient using ACCU-CHEK kits(finger
      stick sugar level measurement) 3- Measured systolic blood pressure for each patient was
      measured using mercury meters.

      4-for all patients investigators obtained full medical history regarding the presence or
      absence of chronic diabetes, chronic hypertension, coronary artery disease, kidney impairment
      with dialysis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

      5- for all patients investigators listed age, gender, and body mass index. 66121 patients
      were negative for HCV and 4852 were positive for HCV. Investigators measured the association
      between HCV presence, high blood sugar levels and high systolic blood pressure.

      It is supposed that this is the largest study in the world that examined both associations.

      In a word, this study was responding to a specific question: is hepatitis c virus presence is
      associated with high blood pressure or high sugar level or both or not associated???
