    
      The study is a prospective, multi-national study that compares INFUSE® Bone Graft
      (investigational group) to autogenous bone graft (control group). Control group subjects will
      receive the same surgical treatment except for the use of autogenous bone graft (from the
      iliac crest) instead of INFUSE® Bone Graft. All sites will follow a common Clinical
      Investigational Plan (CIP) that consists of the protocol and accompanying case report forms,
      risk analysis, investigator's agreement, subject informed consent, institutional review board
      (IRB) certification, labeling, and monitoring information.
