      published his report of transferring multiple small particles of fat to fill a soft tissue
      depression. Over the past three decades, autologous fat grafting has become a common
      procedure in clinical plastic surgery, and is also employed by clinicians in other
      specialties. The refinement of liposuction techniques in the 1980's made it possible to
      harvest the adipose grafts with low risk and without the need for a significant incision. The
      liposuction aspirate could simply be reinjected at a different site. Specialized equipment
      has been developed for fat grafting and is commercially available from a number of sources.
      The American Society of Plastic Surgeons 2007 procedural statistics show that over 65,000 fat
      grafting procedures were performed in the United States (www.plasticsurgery.org) during the
      previous year.

      Fat grafting may represent a superior method of facial reconstruction after severe trauma,
      but the results can be impacted by resorption of fat volume over time. The specific aims of
      the study are:

        1. Assess facial appearance and soft tissue volume before and after autologous fat grafting
           using CT scans and 3D photography.

        2. Assess cellular properties of the cells within the fat graft

        3. Comparison of cotton rolling to centrifugation method of autologous fat grafting

        4. Measure of quality of life in patients before and after autologous fat grafting using
           validated psychosocial measures.

      Ten (10) subjects 18 years of age and older will be enrolled to this trial.
