    
      Approximately 700 participants will be enrolled in an run-in period to receive crisaborole,
      BID for up to a maximum of 8 weeks to identify crisaborole responders. A responder is defined
      as a participant who achieves both ISGA and EASI50 success. ISGA success is defined as
      achieving a score of 0 or 1 with at least 2 grade improvement from baseline; and the EASI50
      success is defined as at least 50% improvement from baseline. Non responders at the end of
      the 8-week run-in period will be discontinued from the study.

      Approximately 250 responders will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to enter the double-blind
      maintenance treatment period to receive crisaborole or vehicle QD for 52 weeks, with
      follow-up assessments every 4 weeks. If a flare occurs and if the participant meets the
      criteria for having a flare (ISGA ≥2), the participant will switch to enter a flare treatment
      period to receive open-label crisaborole BID for up to 12 weeks with follow-up assessments
      every 4 weeks. If the flare has resolved (ISGA ≤1) the participant will resume maintenance
      treatment and respective visit schedule. If a flare does not resolve after 3 consecutive
      treatment courses the participant will discontinue the study. A flare treatment period may
      comprise up to 3 consecutive treatment courses with crisaborole BID (each course is 4 weeks).

      An end of study (EOS) safety follow-up is required 4 weeks after the last study treatment of
      any treatment period.
