      vomiting. In our Toronto experience dexamethasone in low doses (1 mg/m2/day) is sufficient in
      treating these symptoms. However this experience is not shared from many neuro-oncology
      centers of excellence that more commonly use 5 mg/m2/day according to the results of the
      trans-Canadian survey. A prospective multicenter trial evaluating the effectiveness of
      dexamethasone in different dose regimens in symptomatic children while undergoing CNS
      radiation will elucidate the appropriate dose.
