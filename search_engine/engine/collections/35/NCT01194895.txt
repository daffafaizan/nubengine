      tidal volume has been shown to attenuate lung injuries in critically ill
      patients.Esophagectomy surgery need a relatively long time of one-lung ventilation. A normal
      tidal volume of two-lung ventilation should be a large one when exerted to one lung. We
      hypothesized that low tidal volume ventilation during one-lung ventilation could decrease
      incidence rate of postoperative acute lung injury and mortality.
