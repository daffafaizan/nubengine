      blood lipid profile and reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Flax lignan, a phytoestrogen
      found in flaxseed is thought to be the active compound responsible for the
      cholesterol-lowering effect of flaxseed. Our purpose is to combine an exercise training
      program (walking) with flax lignan supplementation for improving blood lipid profile.

      Comparisons: Walking (6 days per week) plus flax lignan (500 mg per day) compared to walking
      plus placebo.
