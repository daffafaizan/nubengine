    
      This will be a phase 3, randomized, open-label, active controlled, multicenter study to
      evaluate maintenance of response, safety and patient reported outcomes (PROs) in acromegaly
      patients treated with octreotide capsules and in patients treated with SOC parenteral SRLs,
      who previously tolerated and demonstrated biochemical control on both treatments.

      The core study will consist of three phases: a Screening phase, Run-in phase and a Randomized
      Controlled Treatment Phase (RCT).

      Eligible patients who are biochemically controlled on parenteral SRLs will be switched to
      octreotide capsules for a 26-week Run-in phase. During this phase the effective dose for each
      patient will be determined through dose titration.

      Patients whose acromegaly is been controlled biochemically on octreotide capsules at the end
      of the Run-in Phase will enter a 36-week open-label Randomized Controlled Treatment Phase,
      where they will be randomized to continue on octreotide capsules or switch back to their
      injectable SRL treatment (as received prior to Screening).

      Following the completion of the core study (Screening, Run-in and RCT phases), eligible
      patients will be offered to enter the Study Extension phase and receive octreotide capsules
      until product marketing or study termination.

      A Sub-study, in selected sites, would allow patients with in-adequate biochemical control on
      octreotide capsules during the Run-in Phase to enter a Combination phase and receive
      co-administration of octreotide capsules with cabergoline tablets for a total of 36 weeks.
