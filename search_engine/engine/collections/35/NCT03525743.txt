    
      A Non-invasive physiologic monitor, Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM), will be
      utilized for this study. This is the first completely non-invasive hemodynamic device
      approved by the FDA and available for clinical use produced by Cheetah Medical and utilizes
      Bioreactance (Tel Aviv, Israel). It performs accurately and with precision in all patient's
      studied and requires only 4 adhesive gel pads on the skin to measure continuous cardiac
      output and to calculate Stroke Volume Variation (SVV). Other physiologic data (blood
      pressure, total peripheral resistance (TPR), stroke volume (SV), and heart rate) will be
      analyzed in real time and recorded on the device and downloaded into an excel database. The
      data on the device will be downloaded weekly onto the excel database and deleted on the
      device. The Study personnel will be trained in its use prior to study initiation.
