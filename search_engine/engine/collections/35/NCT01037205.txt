    
      This protocol will seek to enroll adult otherwise healthy subjects presenting with
      influenza-like illness (ILI). Subjects will enter the study based on listed
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, including a positive diagnostic test for influenza virus (IFV).

      Based upon a Rapid Diagnostic Test of IFV, subjects will be randomized into one of three
      groups: a single dose DAS181 10 mg group, a multiple dose DAS181 10 mg, 10 mg, 10 mg dose
      group or a placebo group.

      The full analysis set will include subjects with confirmed influenza as documented with Rapid
      Diagnostic Testing. The set will be used for activity analysis and will include all
      randomized subjects with baseline and treatment data. Study staff may visit subjects outside
      the clinic. Per protocol, the safety analysis sets are described below in Statistical
      Methods.

      Peripheral venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenic analysis of DAS181
      will be obtained on 10 subjects enrolled in each study arm.
