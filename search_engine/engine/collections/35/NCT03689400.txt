    
      To assess pain and functional parameters physicians, medical staff and physiotherapist often
      use subjective clinical testings which impede the comparability of testings over time,
      between testers and between subjects.

      Therefore, a second aim of this study is to evaluate each subjective clinical test with a
      standardized objective measurement tool.
