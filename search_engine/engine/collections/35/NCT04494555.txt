      sockets during "Readiness Assessments" of Military tasks performed by Service members with
      transtibial amputation.

      Participants will come to the Center For the Intrepid (CFI) for up to 10 visits to complete a
      pre-monitoring session (assess residual limb health and gather information regarding limb
      fluid volume); socket fitting session(s) (fitting of three sockets- static socket, a
      user-adjusted socket, and microprocessor-adjusting socket); and for military readiness
      assessments for each of the three socket conditions.

      Data across the three socket conditions (static socket, user adjusted socket, and
      Microprocessor-adjusting sockets) will be tested for normality. When it normality can be
      assumed, a single factor repeated measures ANOVA will test between socket conditions.
      Mauchly's Test of Sphericity was be used to test if the variance is significantly different
      across all of the conditions. If the sphericity condition is violated, a Greenhouse-Geisser
      adjustment will be applied. When a significance effect is detected, pairwise comparisons
      using a Tukey post-hoc will be performed to determine which conditions are significantly
      different. When normality cannot be assumed, a Kruskal-Wallis H test will be used. When a
      significance effect is detected, pairwise comparisons using a Mann-Whitney post-hoc while
      adjusting the p-value for multiple comparisons will be performed to determine which
      conditions are significantly different. Statistical significance will be set to p<0.05
