      criteria will be enrolled into the trial. At the end of the comparative trial, subjects on
      either arm of the study may opt to enter a longer term cohort study designed to establish the
      longer-term safety profile of GerEpo, with special regards for the occurrence of Pure Red
      Cell Aplasia (PRCA) and other immunogenicity related adverse event.

      This second part of the study is also opened to all subjects who have given written informed
      consent, and have ESRF with CRF related anemia who according to current guideline should be
      treated with Epoetin. Subjects need not be included in the first part of the study.

      All patients shall be treated with GerEpo and thereafter observed for at least 1 year to
      actively monitor for the occurrence of PRCA and other immunogenicity related adverse events.
      The cohort study shall continue until at least 10,000 patient-years of observation have
      accrued on the study database.
