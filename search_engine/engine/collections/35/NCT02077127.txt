      Korea, but their opinion were inconsistent. However there is no report in China so far. This
      study was designed to clarify the relationship of polymorphism of MCP-1 c.2518A/G with type 2
      diabetes with or without DR. The relationship between MCP-1 c.2518A/G and different stage of
      DR has also been studied.This article proved that the MCP-1 c.2518G/G genotype is a
      susceptibility gene for DR in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, especially the High-risk PDR.
      There is no association with DME and c.2518G/G.
