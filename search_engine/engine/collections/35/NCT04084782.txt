      greater impact on quality of life than the severity of the disease. It is believed that a
      visual improvement in the appearance of the infected toenail at an earlier stage could have a
      positive impact on quality of life and encourage compliance with treatment. The aim of this
      consumer study is to evaluate the quality of life of consumers with onychomycosis and
      investigate its relation to the appearance of the infected toenail within the initial 4 weeks
      of treatment with Scholl Fungal Nail following its purchase from an eCommerce platform.
