      rectal cancer can offer meaningful reductions in acute gastrointestinal toxicity compared to
      standard treatment with photons which may improve patient's tolerability of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      There are currently no published clinical reports evaluating the use of proton therapy in the
      upfront treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. There are further no published
      randomized trials comparing radiotherapy with photon vs proton in locally advanced rectal
      cancer.

      This is a prospective randomized trial, initially run at the limited number of centres but
      later expanded to other centres participating in the Skandion network. Patients will be
      treated with short course 5 x 5 Gy radiation scheme with either photons (standard arm) or
      protons (Skandion clinic) followed by four to six cycles of combination chemotherapy
      (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) and surgery. The rectal tumour will be removed by TME/PME
      surgery or more extensive surgery if required because of tumour extent.

      All patients will receive at least 4 courses of CAPOX (Capecitabine b.i.d.1000 mg/m2 day 1-14
      every 3 weeks, Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks) week 3-14, followed by surgery at
      week 17-20.
