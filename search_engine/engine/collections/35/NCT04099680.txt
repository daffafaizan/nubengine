      procedure to increase the size is technically difficult. In the traditional way, preparation
      of the gum bed for a graft tissue is done with partial-thickness flap elevation, in which
      part of the mucosa and submucosa, but not the periosteum (dense fibrous membrane covering the
      surface of bones), are separated from underneath bone. In the traditional method of gum bed
      preparation, separation of the mucosa and submucosa from underneath periosteum and bone
      should be done with extremely caution to avoid damaging the periosteum. Therefore, the
      traditional method of gum bed preparation is not only time consuming but also problematic
      because of more bleeding when compared to full thickness flap elevation, in which the mucosa
      and submucosa together with the periosteum are separated from underneath bone. In order to
      stabilize gum graft on bone surface, a new technique is applied in this study by using two
      bone screws as anchorage to fastened the graft on the exposed bone through suturing. In the
      present study, we will compare patient quality of life, operator satisfaction, and
      differences in surgical wound healing between these two different bed preparations. The
      results of this study could help establish a more patient- and operator-friendly surgical
      protocol for the use of gum graft to increase the width of keratinized oral mucosa.
