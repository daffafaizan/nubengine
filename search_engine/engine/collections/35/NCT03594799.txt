      the last 50 years, results showed that the space environment and microgravity in particular,
      cause changes that may affect the performance of astronauts. These physiological changes
      particularly challenge the cardiovascular, metabolic, muscle and bone functions. Space
      agencies regularly conduct simulations on the ground on healthy volunteers to mimic the
      effects of weightlessness (head down bed rest model) to better understand the mechanisms of
      adaptations of the organism to space, and develop ways to prevent and / or reduce the
      negative biological effects of microgravity on astronauts. These protocols are called
      countermeasures. Since the beginning of space missions, various countermeasures have been
      tested on the ground and in-flight, including different exercise protocols. To date, however,
      none has been entirely satisfactory and space agencies continue to conduct simulation studies
      to evaluate new countermeasures. Nowadays, the human spaceflight program has entered the next
      phase of space exploration towards the Moon and Mars and there are clearly inherent medical
      challenges with such a goal, among which, countermeasure developments are a clear priority.

      Based on recent evidences, the next countermeasure to be tested during a 60-day bed rest
      includes a nutritional countermeasure composed of an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory
      dietary mix.
