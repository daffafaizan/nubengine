      per million. ACC arises in the major salivary glands and more often in the minor salivary
      glands of the oropharynx, lip, nasopharynx, oral cavity, nasal cavity, paranasal sinus,
      larynx and tracheobronchial tree. ACC is characterized by frequent local recurrences and
      distant metastasis, mainly to lungs. 18F-FDG PET/CT is considered to be a viable tool to
      assess ACC at initial presentation. However, FDG uptake in ACC is lower than in squamous cell
      carcinoma (SCC) and not all ACC lesions show detectable FDG uptake. So, it is necessary to
      find another effective way to detect ACC and its metastases. As in known, PSMA is highly
      expressed in salivary glands, and Wim van Boxtel et al had demonstrated high PSMA-ligand
      uptake in a patient with recurrent and metastatic ACC using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. 68Ga-PSMA has
      been developed as a targeting imaging agent widely used in prostate cancer in prostate
      cancer. Thus, this prospective study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may be
      superior for diagnosis, therapy response assessment and follow-up of ACC than 18F-FDG PET/CT.
      Furthermore, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy has been widely used in the treatment of
      prostate cancer lesions that showed high PSMA uptake on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, we'll try to assess
      the safety and therapeutic response to 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with ACC.
