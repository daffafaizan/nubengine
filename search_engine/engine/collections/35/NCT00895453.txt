      Antimycotics effectively treat sporadic and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC).
      Classic homeopathy (CH) is also used to treat this condition. We compared the efficacy of CH
      and itraconazole in reducing the frequency of RVVC episodes.

      Design:

      Single-centre, prospective, randomized.

      Sample:

      One-hundred-and-fifty patients with a history of RVVC and an acute episode of VVC.

      Methods:

      Women were randomised into 3 groups: itraconazole with lactobacilli (group 1), itraconazole
      without lactobacilli (group 2) and CH (group 3). Itraconazole treatment of acute infection
      was followed by a 6-months maintenance regimen with monthly single-day itraconazole (200 mg
      bid). Thereafter, patients were followed without treatment for 6 months. Women in group 1
      were given additional vaginal lactobacilli for six days per month. CH treatment was performed
      for 12 months.
