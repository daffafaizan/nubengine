    
      1. We will evaluate, over 12 weeks, the safety and efficacy of two high-dose vitamin D3
           regimens in severely ill ICU patients. Vitamin D or placebo ( depending on study arm)
           will be given sequentially in divided doses for 5 days

        2. We will explore whether these vitamin D regimens are capable of increasing the
           production of key antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and hBD-2 ( substances produced by our
           bodies to fight infections), in both the blood and in lung.

        3. We will determine whether a higher vitamin D level in the blood is associated with a
           decrease in hospital infection rates and other complications in high-risk ICU patients
           with respiratory failure.

      Study Design:

      Enrollment goal is 36 patients. Once consent is obtained subjects will be randomly assigned
      to one of three study groups. Each group consists of 12 patients with enteral access ; a
      placebo arm, an arm where subjects receive 50,000 IU of Vitamin D for 5 days, and a third arm
      where subjects receive 100,000 IU of Vitamin D for 5 days.

      Methods: Baseline blood samples (25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D binding protein, ionized
      calcium, LL-37,and hBD-2) will be taken on study day 7,14,21,28,84 days. On study day 1 and
      8, LL-37, hBD-2, cathelicidin from BAL fluid will also be analyzed. Patients will be given
      either placebo, Vitamin D3 50,000 IU x 5 days (total 250,000 IU) or Vitamin D3 100,000 IU x 5
      days (total 500,000 IU) with an intention to treat model. Baseline data on the patients
      including demographic, laboratory, documented infections, severity illness score (APACHE II)
      and organ dysfunction score (SOFA) will be collected. ELISA assay on the serum and BAL will
      be performed.
