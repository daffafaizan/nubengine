    
      Rifapentine (RPT) is a long-acting rifamycin that can be used weekly with isoniazid (INH) as
      a first-line regimen in the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Although this
      regimen offers several potential benefits, the use of weekly RPT plus INH is not currently
      recommended in adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) due to limited evidence on drug interactions with antiretrovirals (ARVs).
      Dolutegravir (DTG) and darunavir boosted with cobicistat (DRV/c) comprise parts of first-line
      and alternative treatment regimens, respectively, recommended for the treatment of HIV.
      However, drug interactions between these ARV agents and RPT are of concern. Thus, the purpose
      of this study is to determine the effects of concomitant RPT and INH administration on the
      steady state PK of DTG and DRV/c.

      This is an open-label, fixed sequence, intrasubject drug-drug interaction study designed to
      evaluate the steady state PK of DRV/c with coadministration of once weekly RPT and INH given
      at doses used to treat LTBI. Arm B will be comprised of two phases: (1) DRV/c once daily
      alone (days 1-4) and (2) DRV/c once daily + (RPT and INH) once weekly (days 5-19).
      Participants in Arm B will undergo periodic serial ARV PK blood draws on days 4, 14, and 19.

      DRV/c PK parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods. Cobicistat levels
      will only be assessed if DRV concentrations are significantly decreased in Arm B. The
      following PK parameters will be compared between phases: area under the curve over the dosing
      interval, maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, terminal
      half-life, apparent oral clearance, and minimum plasma concentration. Adverse events will be
      graded and recorded.
