        2. Increase their PEDICAT scores across the study period, while the home fitness group will
           decrease performance on the PEDICAT.

        3. Complete the Timed Up and Go (TUG) more quickly at +12 weeks post intervention

           Secondary Hypothesis (study not powered for these variables):
