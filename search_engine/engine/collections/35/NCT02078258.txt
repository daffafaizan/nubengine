      theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of depression, suggesting that
      reduction of such biases may treat symptoms of depression. Recent studies have shown that
      attention bias modification(ABM) training could reduce depressive symptoms in both dysphoria
      and previously depressed adult patients.To test the effectiveness of ABM training on the
      treatment of depressive symptoms in depressed adolescents, we designed a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial in adolescents with major depressive disorder(MDD).
