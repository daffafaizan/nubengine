      multicenter study (conducted at multiple sites). The study consists of 3 periods: a Screening
      period (up to 4 weeks), Treatment period (12 Weeks) and Post treatment follow-up period
      (until 24 weeks after end of treatment). The duration of the subjects' participation will be
      approximately 40 weeks. In the treatment period subjects will receive oral capsule simeprevir
      along with oral tablet sofosbuvir once daily for 12 weeks. Primarily efficacy will be
      evaluated as percentage of subjects with sustained virologic response at Week 12 after the
      end of treatment. Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
