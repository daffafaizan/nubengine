      Center. At baseline the investigators will collect demographic information such as, their
      age, weight, education. When participants complete their respective program at the DFC they
      will receive a daily weight loss sustaining text message at 8:00 A.M. for 60 days.
      Participants will also receive weekly messages for 6 months asking them to self-report their
      weight. Thereafter, they will receive an automated message monthly for 18 months asking them
      to self-report their weight.
