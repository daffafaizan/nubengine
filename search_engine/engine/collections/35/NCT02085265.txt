      repurposing effort that could recast an antihypertensive medication as a cognitive
      enhancer/neuroprotective agent and possibly as a drug of choice for Alzheimer patients and
      patients at risk for AD. If the proof of concept result is positive, a larger study would be
      warranted with potential practice-changing impact.
