      which influences quality of life and freedom of movement. The episodes can be painful, and
      lead to extensive use of antibiotics, which in itself promotes development of bacterial
      strains increasingly resistant to antibiotics, but do not prevent relapses. Almost all
      cystitis' in women are ascending infections from bacteria in the vagina, following
      colonization from the rectum. There have, however, been reported indications that there may
      be bacteria colonies within the urothelium that might give rise to relapses of the
      infections, rather than pure reinfection from ascending pathogens.

      Probiotics are cultures of viable microorganisms, which show a positive effect on the general
      condition of the host when administered. Among the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), lactobacilli
      are the most commonly used for probiotics, and they have an excellent safety record. In terms
      of UTI, weekly or twice weekly intravaginal instillation of Lactobacillus strains GR-1 and
      B-54 have led to reduced recurrences. This concept has been supported by a 2006 pilot study
      showing that intravaginal administration of Lactobacillus crispatus GAI 98322 every two days
      for one year, had the potential to reduce the UTI recurrences. Another approach has been
      taken whereby lactobacilli are administered orally with a view of simulating how the
      pathogens reach the vagina. The studies have shown that L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri
      (formerly fermentum) RC-14 can reach the vagina after daily oral ingestion, and they can
      lower the bacterial and yeast pathogen numbers.

      The aim of the study is to try to normalize the vaginal bacteriological milieu so that the
      more pathogenic subpopulation of bacteria strains are displaced and are less likely to cause
      UTI.
