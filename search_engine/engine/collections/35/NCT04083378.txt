      I. To evaluate if the intra-procedure feedback of a biomechanical deformable registration
      volumetric image method during percutaneous ablation will increase the minimal ablation
      margins on a three-dimensional computed tomography-generated analysis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether applying the proposed method during percutaneous ablation improves local
      tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS) rates.

      II. Evaluate impact of software use on procedure workflow. III. Impact of software use on
      complication rates, quality of life, liver function.

      IV. Evaluate oncological outcomes (intra-hepatic and overall progression-free survivals, and
      overall survival).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care ablation.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care ablation with software-aided imaging (Morfeus).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then at 1 and
      2 years.
