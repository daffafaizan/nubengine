        -  Compare local recurrence rates, acute and late morbidity, overall survival, disease-free
           survival, and cancer-related survival of patients with pT3 pN0 adenocarcinoma of the
           prostate randomized following radical prostatectomy to postoperative conventional pelvic
           irradiation (60 Gy) vs no further treatment until relapse.

        -  Better define the selective pathologic indications for radiotherapy in patients with pT3
           pN0 disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks, followed by
           boost radiotherapy for 1-1.4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients are observed. Local relapse is treated with conventional pelvic
           radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months during the first postoperative year, every 6 months
      until the fifth year, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1000 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5 years.
