    
      We will evaluate all adult patients consecutively referred from March 2005 to the Instituto
      Nacional del TÃ³rax (Thorax National Institute), Santiago, Chile for diagnostic evaluation of
      Pulmonary Fibrosis. The routine evaluation will include, when indicated, the following steps:

        -  History:

        -  Age

        -  Genre

        -  Duration of symptoms before first consultation

        -  Smoking status

        -  Search for collagen vascular disease

        -  Family history of pulmonary fibrosis

        -  Occupational exposures

        -  Drug ot toxic exposures

        -  Physical examination: search of crackles and finger clubbing.

        -  Laboratory data:

        -  Complete blood bell count

        -  BUN

        -  Creatinine

        -  Liver enzymes

        -  Antinuclear antigens

        -  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate

        -  Rheumatoid factor

        -  HIV

        -  Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (in appropiate clinical setting)

        -  Antiglomerular basement antibody (in appropiate clinical setting)

        -  Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MMRC) (10)

        -  Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) (11)

        -  Pulmonary function tests:

        -  Spirometry

        -  Plethismographic lung volumes

        -  DLco

        -  Composite physiologic index (12)

        -  Exercise testing:

        -  Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)

        -  Resting and 6 minute SpO2

        -  Presence or absence of desaturation to 88% or lower at the end of the six minute walk
           (13)

        -  Walked distance

        -  Pre and post modified Borg dyspnea scores

        -  Timed walk test (14)

        -  Arterial blood gas analysis in rest and exercise, calculating the difference between
           alveolar and arterial oxygen tension (P(A-a)O2) at rest and after exercise.

        -  Radiologic studies:

        -  Chest radiography

        -  HRCT:

        -  Definite or probable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (15):

             -  Definitive criteria: presence of lung volume reduction, reticular abnormalities,
                traction bronchiectasis, or both, with a basal and peripheral predominance; the
                presence of honeycombing with a basal and peripheral predominance; and the absence
                of atypical features of usual interstitial pneumonia - micronodules,
                peribronchovascular nodules, consolidation, isolated (nonhoneycombing) cysts,
                ground-glass attenuation (or if present, less extensive than the reticular
                opacity), and mediastinal adenopathies (or if present, too limited to be visible on
                a chest radiography).

             -  Probable criteria: presence of a bilateral, predominantly basal and subpleural
                reticular pattern with subpleural cysts (honeycombing), traction bronchiectasis, or
                both in the absence of atypical features of UIP.

        -  Scoring of the extent of lung fibrosis (16).

        -  Bronchoscopy:

        -  Bronchoalveolar lavage: cellular analysis and CD4/CD8 ratio.

        -  Transbronchial biopsy.

        -  Surgical lung biopsy:

        -  Number

        -  Site/Side

        -  Type of surgery: open vs thoracoscopic

        -  Histologic features (3)

      Those patients with IPF diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiographic criteria alone
      according to the ATS/ERS consensus committee (3), and/or with a biopsy proven histological
      pattern of UIP, will be selected to the randomization process, after they have signed the
      written informed consent.
