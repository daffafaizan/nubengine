      compliance to CirvoTM therapy use with and without digital engagement. Historical
      questionnaire data with a different compression device will be compared to the same
      questionnaire used for the prospective cohort of up to 200 subjects. All patients prescribed
      compression therapy following total joint arthroscopy will be offered participation.

      Subjects will receive CirvoTM compression therapy according to the standard of care protocol
      at NYU during or after surgery and 18 hours per day for 14 days.

        1. Baseline: Following consent, participants will provide demographic, medical history and
           information with respect to their elective orthopedic procedure and receive training on
           the CirvoTM device. Participants will be randomized to either digital engagement or no
           digital engagement groups.

        2. Post procedure: After the procedure, CirvoTM device operation will be reviewed with the
           participant.

        3. Discharge: Any adverse events occurring during hospitalization will be reviewed, data
           capture on the CirvoTM app will be confirmed.

        4. 14- day visit: Participants will complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire, provide
           information with respect to any adverse events including specific details about DVT and
           readmission and return the devices.

        5. 30-day phone call/visit: Participants will be contacted at 30 days to answer questions
           about DVT's and readmissions.
