    
      This PAS is a long-term follow-up of the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System (DOD) hips
      enrolled in the study that was analyzed for the Premarket Approval Application (PMA) Study.
      The PMA Study analyzed 3 Year postoperative follow-up data on Biolox delta ceramic-on-Biolox
      delta ceramic (DOD) and Oxidized zirconium-on-Crosslinked Polyethylene (OxZr/XLPE) hips,
      enrolled and followed in a European Post-market Study ("A prospective, multicenter,
      non-randomized, clinical outcome study of the R3 Acetabular System in patients with
      degenerative hip disease").

      The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single arm study is to confirm the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System PMA (P150030) by
      evaluating long-term (10 years after surgery) follow-up results. Hips are evaluated at the
      following intervals: 5, 7, 10 years postoperative. The primary study endpoint is implant
      survivorship at 10 years post surgery.
