    
      72 subjects will be included. Each subject will attend 3 visits at the clinic/hospital or at
      the subjects home depending on the final site set-up. Each subject will be enrolled for 14
      weeks in total for the entire investigation.

      Coloplast will provide SenSura Mio Convex Soft for all subjects via the investigator. Based
      on the subjects' usual changing pattern, the investigator will provide the subjects with
      enough products for the whole test period.

      The subject will answer questions regarding the tested products by filling out the subject
      part in the eCRF daily. The subject will answer questions using an electronic device and use
      the device to take pictures of the peristomal skin and used products at each product change.
      The Investigator fills out the investigator part of the eCRF at each visit. The subjects must
      complete the general questions at the end of each test period before their second and third
      visit at the Clinic/hospital or at home to avoid influence by the investigator.

      The use of accessories will be noted in the eCRF. Samples of biological material will not be
      taken or used in this investigation. Patient files from own physician will not be used for
      subjects recruited via a Coloplast's database. The investigators may use patient files for
      subjects recruited via hospital sites/ostomy clinics to identifying relevant subjects and/or
      to verify baseline information, concomitant medication or adverse events. To be able to
      fulfil the objectives, the investigation must include both ileostomists and colostomists.
