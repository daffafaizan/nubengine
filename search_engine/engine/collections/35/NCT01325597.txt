    
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of the functional electrical stimulation (FES)
      associated with inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on functional capacity and quality of life
      in patients with heart failure (HF). A randomized clinical trial with 60 HF patients
      (functional class II-IV) will be randomly assigned to the FES, IMT, IMT associated with FES
      or control group. FES will be applied at 15 Hz, 0.4 ms pulse width, 10-s contraction time,
      50-s resting time and maximum tolerable intensity, 3 sessions per week, for 12 weeks. The IMT
      will also be performed for 12 weeks, 5 sessions per week, with an intensity of 30% of maximal
      inspiratory pressure. Acute and chronic effects of interventions on functional capacity,
      quality of life, peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength
      and endurance, endothelial function, autonomic control and oxidative stress will be analyzed
      in these patients.
