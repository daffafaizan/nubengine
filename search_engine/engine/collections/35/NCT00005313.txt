      Premature vascular disease in young hyperlipidemic subjects remains a major unsolved health
      problem in terms of pathogenesis and treatment. Research advances have led to new markers for
      genetic analysis, new methods for studying lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerotic disease
      progression and regression, and reference values for diagnosing hyperlipidemia.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Attention is focused on the molecular, genetic and pathophysiological basis of the inherited
      dyslipoproteinemias associated with premature coronary artery disease with particular
      reference to familial combined hyperlipidemia, familial moderate hypercholesterolemia,
      familial elevation of Lp(a) and the carrier state for homocysteinemia. Coordinated studies of
      characterization of the pathophysiological state, the identification of possible molecular
      biological defects and the evaluation of these results in families by statistical genetic
      techniques are performed in each disorder. The role of protein mediated intravascular
      modification of lipoproteins and the role of oxidation of lipoproteins in each disorder will
      lead to characterization of these genetic lipoprotein abnormalities. The study is a
      subproject within a program project grant.

      The subproject on the genetics of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) was renewed in 1999
      through 2010 to continue mapping the apoB elevating gene l(BEL) level using a genomic search
      in pedigrees with familial combined hyperlipidemia. The major focus of the genetic analyses
      are the 15 FCHL families under the BEL segregation analysis model in a power analysis. These
      families also show the most evidence for segregation at an apoB elevating gene locus.
      Genotyping for a 10 centimorgan genomic scan has been completed for these families.
