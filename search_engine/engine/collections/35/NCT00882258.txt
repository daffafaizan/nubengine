      Following screening and a pre-treatment endometrial biopsy, subjects will be followed monthly
      for the three month treatment phase. At the three-month treatment visit, subjects will be
      entered into an open-label extension treatment protocol, if deemed eligible. At four months
      after their first treatment visit, subjects not electing to enter the open-label study will
      be assessed at a final follow-up visit.
