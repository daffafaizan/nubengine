      isradipine CR as a potential disease modifying agent in early PD. Human pharmacokinetic data
      demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve the serum concentrations in humans that were
      neuroprotective in preclinical models with the FDA approved dosage range. Pilot data
      demonstrate acceptable tolerability of isradipine CR in the PD population. Tolerability is
      inversely proportional to the dosage dependent. Considering that tolerability of isradipine
      CR is inversely proportional to the dosage exposure, it is essential to proceed with the dose
      selection tolerability study in preparation for the future efficacy trials.

      The tolerability, defined as the ability to complete the study, of three dosages of
      isradipine CR relative to placebo in subjects with early Parkinson's disease will be examined
      first. The dosage that is tolerable and demonstrates preliminary efficacy will be evaluated
      further in the future pivotal efficacy studies.
