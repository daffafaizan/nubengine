      pressure and, therefore, relative hypotension is a common occurrence. This hypotension may be
      more pronounced with postural stress. Loss in mental acuity and sometimes even consciousness
      is an associated symptom of postural hypotension in individuals with tetraplegia.

      There is some evidence to suggest that although mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) is
      relatively low in these individuals, middle cerebral arterial blood flow (CBF) may be
      maintained. Consequently, individuals with chronic tetraplegia often compensate and are
      stable in the seated upright position.

      Autoregulation of CBF has been defined as the stability of cerebral blood flow throughout a
      range of systemic blood pressures (MAP). This proposal will examine systemic hemodynamics and
      middle cerebral artery blood flow during HUT with and without Vasotec, an angiotensin II
      inhibitor. By partially or completely ablating the renin-angiotensin system, which is
      postulated to play a major role in blood pressure regulation, the potential dissociation
      between systemic blood pressure and middle cerebral artery blood flow, in individuals with
      tetraplegia, may be demonstrated. The aim is to determine whether persons with chronic
      tetraplegia are able to maintain similar CBF, or similar CBF changes, as able-bodied controls
      despite a greater decrease in MAP to the same hypotensive challenge. The relationship between
      MAP and CBF has not been defined in this population. Understanding this relationship may lead
      to improved screening and treatment for prevention of postural hypotension in persons with
      tetraplegia.
