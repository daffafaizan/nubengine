      However, for those who have suffered a heart attack, there is a lack of high quality evidence
      to guide transfusions. This 3500 subject multi-center randomized trial will fill that void.

      Hospital inpatients diagnosed with myocardial infarction who have blood counts less than 10
      g/dL are randomized to receive either a liberal or a restrictive transfusion strategy.

      Patients randomized to the liberal transfusion strategy will receive a red blood cell
      transfusion anytime there is a blood count of less than 10 g/dL.

      Patients randomized to the restrictive transfusion strategy are permitted to receive a blood
      transfusion if the blood count is below 8 g/dL and the physician believes it is in the
      patient's best interest. A transfusion will be strongly recommended if the blood count drops
      to less than 7 g/dL. If the patient has symptoms of angina (e.g., chest discomfort described
      as pressure or heaviness) that do not go away with medication, a blood transfusion is ordered
      regardless of the blood count.

      The transfusions strategies will be maintained until hospital discharge for a maximum of 30
      days.

      Patients will be followed for 30 days for clinically relevant outcomes. Vital status will be
      confirmed at 180 days.
