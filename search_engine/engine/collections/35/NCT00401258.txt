    
      IBS is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel
      habits, and abdominal bloating for which no organic cause can be determined. Duloxetine has
      demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression as well as in several pain syndromes
      including diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. We hypothesize that it will be a
      safe and efficacious treatment for the symptoms of IBS, in particular abdominal pain.

      We plan to study 15 male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years who have had
      gastrointestinal symptoms at least 2 days/week for greater than six months and who have been
      diagnosed with IBS by a physician. During the 12-week study, subjects will receive open-label
      duloxetine titrated up to 60mg/day. Subjects will be asked to complete a total of ten study
      visits during the 12-week study period. All study visits will be conducted at McLean
      Hospital.
