      induction with daclizumab and maintenance therapy with sirolimus and tacrolimus, has been
      combined with the infusion of CD34+ enriched donor bone marrow stem cells in an attempt to
      create a chimeric state and hence induce donor tolerance. This strategy was tested by
      evaluating graft survival following the removal of all immunosuppressive medication after one
      year.
