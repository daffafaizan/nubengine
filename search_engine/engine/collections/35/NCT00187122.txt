    
      The overall objective of this research study is to determine the toxicity and feasibility of
      administration of an intensified, multi-agent chemotherapy regimen for children with stages
      III and IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), lymphoblastic histiotype. The planned pilot therapy
      includes major modifications of our best previous treatments for patients with T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that may improve the disease-free survival of these children and
      adolescents. Ultimately, it is intended to propose this therapy for further evaluation in the
      setting of a patient population large enough to evaluate its efficacy.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To determine the toxicity of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) given prior to the
           induction/consolidation phase of therapy and of repeated induction treatment (weeks
           16-21) in patients with advanced stage NHL, lymphoblastic histiotype.

        -  To determine the toxicity and feasibility of administration of continuation therapy
           which include additional drug pairs not used in the St. Jude Total XI-ALL study.

        -  To estimate the complete response (CR) rate and event-free survival (EFS) in children
           with stage III/IV lymphoblastic NHL after treatment with this intensified multiagent
           chemotherapy. Pooling of data from this study with that gained from treatment of
           patients with T-ALL on the Total XIII and XIII B studies, with appropriate
           stratification, will facilitate this aim.

        -  To compare plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of VP-16 after 1 hour of
           administration. The data obtained here will be pooled for analysis with that from Total
           XIII and Total XIII B studies

        -  To assess serially whether the frequency of specific HPRT mutations in are related to
           cumulative dose of etoposide, or plasma AUC of etoposide, etoposide catechol, or both

        -  To assess the degree of bone marrow infiltration at the time of diagnosis and serially
           during remission using and comparing morphologic, immunologic and molecular methods. In
           the absence of morphologically detected tumor cells, we will estimate the frequency of
           minimal residual disease (MRD) during remission using immunologic and molecular methods.
           The data obtained here will be pooled for analysis with that obtained from T-cell ALL
           cases treated on Total XIII and Total XIII B ALL studies.

        -  Because similar studies are being conducted for patients with T-ALL on the Total XIII
           and Total XIII B ALL studies, we will pool data from the present study with that from
           T-cell ALL cases treated on Total XIII and Total XIII B ALL studies and correlate
           detection of lymphoblasts in bone marrow or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with subsequent
           clinical course (complete remission duration).

        -  To evaluate the sensitivity of neoplastic cells at diagnosis to anticancer drugs. This
           evaluation will be limited to patients with bone marrow involvement or viable tumor
           samples at diagnosis. Information obtained from this aim will complement that obtained
           from patients with T-ALL in the Total XIII and Total XIII B ALL studies.

      Pre-Induction Chemotherapy

      Methotrexate 200 mg/m2/hr IV push, then 800 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours

      Induction

      Induction Chemotherapy uses several chemotherapy drugs to kill cancer cells in the body and
      lasts 6 to 8 weeks.

      less than 12 months of age, Vincristine dosage is 0.05 mg/kg/dose. CNS Therapy

      All patients will receive triple IT therapy on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients with known CNS

      Children with cranial nerve palsies will receive local irradiation to the base of the skull.

      Continuation: Continuation therapy lasts 120 weeks. The following drugs will be given in
