    
      This is a retrospective observational database study of patients receiving parenteral
      nutrition (PN) for at least 3 consecutive days with hospital admission date between January
      1, 2013, and December 31, 2015 (study period).

      The study will use an as treated approach, where patients will be followed from the index
      date (hospital admission day of the hospitalization during which PN is administered) up to
      patient discharge or death (observation period).

      The study will be conducted using an initial EMR (Electronic Medical Record) data retrieval
      process, followed by manual data retrieval (chart review) that will complement data obtained
      from EMR. Data collection for manual data retrieval will be conducted through an eCRF.

      The documentation of patient data will comprise two sequential steps. The initial step will
      include data of 30% of patients and then an interim analysis (IA) will be conducted. If IA
      shows positive results, data for the remaining 70% of patients (step II) will be gathered.

      The study will be conducted in 10-14 sites in Spain.

      Data analysis: Baseline demographics, co-morbidities, and hospitalization characteristics
      will be reported descriptively by means of mean with standard deviations and medians with
      ranges for continuous variables and by counts and percentages for categorical variables.
      Incidence rates for BSI will be reported by treatment group.
