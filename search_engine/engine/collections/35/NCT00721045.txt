      York Heart Association) class II to IV and a depressed ejection fraction (EF < 40%). Baseline
      eligibility testing assessments will be completed within 28 days prior to cell delivery.
      Efficacy will be explored at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      This will be a single-blinded, dose-escalation, cohort study in 60 subjects allocated
      sequentially to 1 of 3 cohorts A, B, or C. Forty-five subjects will be randomized to receive
      transendocardial delivery of MPC treatment, and 15 subjects will be randomized to receive
      standard-of-care treatment without MPC administration. The fifteen subjects randomized to
      receive standard of care without needle injection will serve as the study's control
      population and will undergo mock mapping and verbal injection scripts.
