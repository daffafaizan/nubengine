        -  Determine the relationship of peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotype pattern in patients
           with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma to response to high-dose
           aldesleukin (IL-2).

        -  Determine the relationship of peripheral blood mononuclear cells gene microarray
           patterns in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma to
           response to high-dose IL-2.

        -  Determine the frequency of mutations on genes encoding for IL-2 receptor A and B.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) as part of standard treatment on days
      1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline, prior to beginning course 2, and 4 weeks after
      the completion of course 2. Samples are analyzed using peripheral blood cytometry, gene
      microarray analysis, and IL-2 receptor single-nucleotide polymorphism techniques.
