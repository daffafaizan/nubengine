      chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells overexpress Lyn kinase compared to normal B lymphocytes as
      well as acute leukemias (ALL and AML), and inhibition of Lyn kinase induces apoptosis in
      cultures of B-CLL cells. Thus, bafetinib may stop the growth of B-CLL cells by inhibiting Lyn
      kinase, the molecule that couples the B cell receptor to downstream signaling.
