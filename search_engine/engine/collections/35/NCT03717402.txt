      Malignant Pain). This app will be used by patients with advanced cancer to track symptoms and
      receive tailored symptom management advice. This project will involve 5 specific activities:

        1. Activity 1 - Content Development (working groups)

        2. Activity 2 - Programming and testing of app algorithms

        3. Activity 3 - User acceptability testing

        4. Activity 4 - Pilot testing

        5. Activity 5 - Patient Qualitative Interviews

      Activities 1 and 2 will involve the development of the content and functionalities for the
      STAMP app. Activity 3 (the user acceptability testing phase of the project) will be conducted
      to identify and address any problems with the developed tool. User acceptability testing will
      involve interviews and focus groups with patients and providers who have been shown the app.
      The information gathered from these interviews and groups will be used to improve the
      application before it undergoes pilot testing. Activity 4 (pilot testing) will be conducted
      to demonstrate the utilization and efficacy of the STAMP app among patients with chronic
      cancer pain and their cancer care providers. Activity 5 (patient qualitative interviews) will
      be conducted with patients to learn more about their experiences with a cancer diagnosis and
      chronic pain management.
