      assigned to one of two groups: +EED or -EED. All participants will be given standard,
      physiological dose of 3 mg zinc sulfate with a zinc stable isotope tracer on study day 8.

      On study day 11, 0.5 mg of 13C10-retinyl-acetate will be administered orally to all
      participants.

      Spot urine samples will be collected twice daily from study days 11-14. Complete fecal
      collections will be obtained for days 11-14. Duplicate diets of all foods consumed will be
      collected on days 11-14. On study day 14, a blood sample will be taken for analysis of
      vitamin A isotope status.
