    
      This study was originally planned as a 48-week, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter
      study comparing EFV+FTC+TDF (administered as the individual component drugs) versus CBV
      (lamivudine/zidovudine) + EFV to assess the efficacy and safety of both treatments in
      ART-Naive, HIV-1 infected participants. The regimen of CBV (administered twice daily) + EFV
      (administered once daily) served as the active control treatment and was compared with the
      regimen of EFV+FTC+TDF; each component drug in the EFV+FTC+TDF regimen was administered once
      daily.

      Week 48 to Week 96:

      The study was extended and continued to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two regimens
      up to a total treatment duration of 96 weeks. The regimen of EFV+FTC+TDF continued to be
      dosed as the component drugs (EFV + FTC + TDF), once daily, without regard to meals. The
      regimen of CBV+EFV was dosed as 2 pills (CBV, twice daily in the morning without regard to
      meals) + EFV (once daily, without regard to meals).

      Week 96 to Week 144:

      A further study extension changed the 3-pill EFV+FTC+TDF regimen to a 2-pill regimen of EFV +
      Truvada ([TVD]: a fixed-dose combination pill containing FTC/TDF), once daily without regard
      to meals, and continued to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two regimens for a further
      48 weeks up to a total study treatment duration of 144 weeks. The regimen of CBV+EFV
      continued to be dosed as 2 pills (CBV, twice daily in the morning without regard to meals) +
      EFV (once daily, without regard to meals).

      Week 144 to end of study (Week 240):

      A final study extension provided all study participants from both treatment regimens the
      option to switch their respective treatments to the 1-pill regimen of for a further 96 weeks
      up to a total study duration of 240 weeks (5 years) to further assess the efficacy and safety
      of ART regimen simplification. At sites in France, the study was extended by a further 48
      weeks (Year 6) or until ATR became commercially available (whichever happened first); once
      ATR became commercially available in France participants were not required to complete the
      full 288 weeks of the study.
