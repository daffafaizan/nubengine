    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of MDX-CTLA-4 in patients previously and not previously vaccinated
      with GM-CSF-based vaccines using lethally irradiated, autologous melanoma, ovarian cancer,
      acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplasia or lung cancer cells.

      II. To identify preliminary evidence of biologic activity and efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody IV over
      90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (12 per disease type; 36 previously treated with a
      sargramostim (GM-CSF)-expressing autologous tumor cell vaccine and 12 not previously treated
      with this vaccine) will be accrued for this study.
