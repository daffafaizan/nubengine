      participants will be administered with phenylephrine (day 1) and clonidine (day 2). The
      control participants will not receive any intervention.

      The aim of this study is to determine if expression of α1-adrenoceptors (α1-AR) altered in
      the skin of a subgroup of patients whose pain is associated with increased adrenergic
      sensitivity after nerve trauma. Increased adrenergic sensitivity will be determined by
      assessing pain in patients after administration of phenylephrine on day 1. Expression of
      α1-AR will be determined by taking skin biopsies on day 2 after administration of clonidine.
      Then, we will compare the expression of α1-AR in patients who were classified as having
      increased adrenergic sensitivity versus those who were not.
