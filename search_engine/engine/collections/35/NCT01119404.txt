      with risk factors known to enhance atherosclerosis, damage the endothelium of the arterial
      wall. Dysfunction of the endothelium leads into loss of elasticity of the artery. Surrogate
      indicators of atherosclerosis might be seen already in the early phase of otherwise
      subclinical arterial disease.

      In this study, we investigate calculated risk of the subjects (SCORE, FINRISK, Framingham
      score), platelet function and surrogate indicators for atherosclerosis like erectile
      dysfunction, plasma levels of oxidized LDL, arterial elasticity and biochemical markers for
      endothelial damage and dysfunction in different settings (case-only and case-control).
