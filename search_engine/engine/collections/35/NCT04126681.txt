      of HQP1351 in CML CP patients who are resistant and/or intolerant to first- and
      second-generation TKIs in China. A total of 141 CML CP patients will be included in this
      study. After screening, eligible subjects will be randomized by 2:1 ratio to enter HQP1351
      therapy cohort and best available therapy (BAT) cohort. When the subjects in the two cohorts
      reach EFS assessment, they can crossover to contralateral cohort if the investigator and
      Sponsor think they could be clinically benefited. During treatment, each subject will be
      assessed regularly for hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses. At the same time,
      safety information also will be evaluated.
