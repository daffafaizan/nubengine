      occlusions in the pulmonary artery due to an organized thrombus. And this is a disease that
      results in right heart failure and death unless early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are
      performed. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), which surgically removes the intimal thrombus, has
      been established as the treatment of choice for CTEPH. In the AHA/ACC guideline and ESC
      guideline, PEA for CTEPH is class IC (1). In 2014, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulant
      (generic name: riociguat), which is one of the therapeutic agents for pulmonary hypertension,
      was approved for patients with CTEPH who are ineligible for PEA, and residual pulmonary
      hypertension after PEA (2). In addition, it has been reported that BPA, which is a catheter
      interventional treatment, is also effective to improve hemodynamics in inoperable patients
      with CTEPH (3, 4). However, some patients have residual symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion
      even after normalization in hemodynamics by BPA. A randomized control study should be done to
      confirm the necessary of continuation of riociguat for such patients.
