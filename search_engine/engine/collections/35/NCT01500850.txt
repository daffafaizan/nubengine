    
      -  Phase IV

        -  Indication: Diabetes mellitus Type 2

        -  Primary objective:

      To compare fasting intact proinsulin secretion at the beginning and after a 24 week treatment
      period.

      - Secondary objectives: To evaluate changes in the parameters

        -  insulin,

        -  glucose,

        -  intact proinsulin (after a glucose challenge),

        -  hsCRP,

        -  adiponectin,

        -  MMP-9,

        -  HbA1c,

        -  weight

      after 24 weeks of treatment.

      To investigate the changes of

        -  glucose,

        -  intact proinsulin,

        -  hsCRP,

        -  adiponectin,

        -  HbA1c

        -  weight

      between visit 2 (baseline), visit 6 (12 weeks) and visit 8 (final visit after 24 weeks).

      To investigate the number of patients with normal values for parameters hsCRP, adiponectin,
      and intact proinsulin after 24 weeks of treatment (responder rates).

      -Primary efficacy variable: Fasting intact proinsulin concentration at timepoint Visit 2
      (Baseline) and Visit 8 (after 24 week treatment)

      -Secondary efficacy variables: All secondary parameters will be assessed after 24 weeks of
      treatment and compared versus baseline assessment.

        -  Weight

        -  hsCRP

        -  Adiponectin

        -  MMP-9

        -  OGTT parameters (insulin, intact proinsulin, glucose at time point 0, 60 and 120 minutes
           after 24 weeks

        -  HOMA-IR score

        -  HbA1c

      Additionally the following parameters will be assessed at visit 6 and will be compared with
      visit 2 and visit 8:

        -  Weight

        -  hsCRP

        -  Adiponectin

        -  Fasting intact Proinsulin

        -  Glucose

        -  HbA1c

        -  Safety Variables:

        -  Adverse Events

        -  Hypoglycaemic events

      Medication/Dosage:

      Insulin glargine, dose individually adapted to reach treatment goal (FBG ≤ 100 mg/dL)NPH
      Insulin, dose individually adapted to reach treatment goal (FBG ≤ 100 mg/dL)Insulin
      glulisine, dose individually adapted to reach treatment goal (FBG ≤ 100 mg/dL)Human Insulin,
      dose individually adapted to reach treatment goal (FBG ≤ 100 mg/dL)

      -Study Duration: Duration of study participation for one patient is approximately 26 weeks.
      Overall total duration of the study is approximately 10 months.

      Design:

      This is a randomized in four arms, open-label, multi-center study. Population Patients with
      Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, Sample Size n = 60 (15 per arm)
