      supplement 10 μg daily until 6 month. we also enroll 6 month-old infant as control group.

      All infants collected 5 ml artery blood and measured vitD nutritional status and immune
      function. Blood analysis contain complete blood count (CBC), differential count (DC), serum
      calcium, serum Parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum 25(OH)D3, serum total immunoglobulinE (IgE)
      and cell phagocytosis.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) in blood was separated and cultured with complete
      medium contain 10% fetal bovine serum (CM10), or with different mitogens, include
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (PI) and house dust
      mite extract (HDM). PBMC are incubated at 37 ℃, 5% CO2 for 48 hours, and determined the
      expression of B cell with IgE receptor CD21 and CD23 and T regulatory cell with transcription
      factor Foxp3 by flow cytometry. All data were analyzed with SPSS 20.0. Infant sex and feeding
      type were analyzed by chi-square analysis. Difference between vitD supplement group and
      control group were analyzed by student's t test. Relationship between 25(OH)D3 and Calcium or
      PTH were analyzed by pearson correlation analysis. There was a significant difference when
      p-value was less than 0.05.
