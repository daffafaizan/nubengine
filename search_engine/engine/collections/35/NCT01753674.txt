      provided by TA Science, Inc. and prepared as described below. Subjects will be randomly
      allocated to consume either a daily serving of TA-65 (two capsules per day of 8 mg each)
      (please see attached label) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Randomization will be done in a
      sequential manner; the first subject will be allocated to supplement A and the next one to
      supplement B and so on. After a 3-week washout, they will be allocated to the alternate
      treatment for additional 12 weeks. Supplements (TA-65 or placebo) will be taken twice daily
      with a meal.

      Participants will be advised not to change their diet or exercise protocols during the 27
      week intervention. Volunteers will be required to provide a 5-day dietary record before
      starting the study, at the end of each supplement period (TA-65 or placebo) and at the end of
      the washout period. Subjects will have to fill an exercise questionnaire during the same
      times to ensure that there are no changes in physical activity. Participants will be asked to
      report to the department every 4 weeks for checking compliance on supplement intake and to
      assess weight and blood pressure.
