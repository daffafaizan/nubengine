      receptivity. In ovarian stimulation cycles with exogenous gonadotrophins there is an ongoing
      debate regarding the effect of a late follicular phase progesterone level on reproductive
      outcomes. It is not yet clarified if an elevated serum progesterone level in the late
      follicular phase is a symptom or cause of an adverse effect on reproductive outcomes. A new
      hypothesis is evolving and gaining momentum providing a novel explanation for the association
      between late follicular phase progesterone rise and reproductive outcome. It is proposed that
      exogenous FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone) administration results in supraphysiological
      levels of FSH, which induce an abundance of LH (luteinizing hormone) receptors on granulosa
      cells causing the follicles to become hypersensitive to LH-like activity (ie hCG trigger).
      Based on this hypothesis, the focus should be placed on the hCG trigger rather than on the
      late follicular phase progesterone rise.
