      tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health
      Canada.

      After providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history
      questionnaire.

      Monitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by
      comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 18F-AmBF3-TATE . Eighteen to
      seventy-two hours after 18F-AmBF3-TATE administration the participant will return to the
      imaging department to perform a follow up safety assessment and routine blood draw. The study
      coordinator will ask the participant if they have experienced any adverse events during that
      time period and complete the adverse event questionnaire.

      Follow-up Assessments

      The following information will be collected up to 12 months following the PET/CT scans:

      Initiation of a new treatment, Laboratory results and pathology reports, Results of imaging
      studies, Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes. The study is
      expected to take up to 1 year for accrual.
