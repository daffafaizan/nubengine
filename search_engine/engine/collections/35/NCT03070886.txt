      I. To assess the benefit of docetaxel as measured by improvement in freedom from progression
      (phase II) and subsequently metastasis free survival (phase III) when given in combination
      with radiation and androgen deprivation in treatment of high risk prostate cancer
      post-radical prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival. II. To assess local time to progression. III. To assess
      undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with a non-castrate testosterone at 2.5 years
      post treatment.

      IV. To assess the utility of genomic profiling in making adjuvant therapy decisions
      post-prostatectomy.

      V. To assess toxicity of docetaxel in the post-operative setting when combined with radiation
      and androgen deprivation therapy.

      VI. To assess treatment response by genomically defined sub-groups of prostate cancer
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprising leuprolide acetate, goserelin
      acetate, bicalutamide, flutamide, or nilutamide for 6 months. Beginning 8 weeks after the
      start of androgen deprivation therapy, patients receive external beam radiation therapy
      (EBRT) for 7.5 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy and EBRT as in Arm I. Within 4-6 weeks
      after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) on day 1
      of every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly.
