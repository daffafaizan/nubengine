      two groups: continous intravenous Lidocaine intraoperative and Placebo. Patient, the
      Anesthesist as data collector, and the Neurosurgeon as the outcome assessor are blinded to
      the randomization and the intervention given. Non invasive blood pressure, ECG, and pulse
      oxymetry monitor were set on the subject in the operating room. General anesthesia induction
      was done by Fentanyl 3 mcg/kg, Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg or Placebo (according to allocation
      group), Propofol 1-2 mg/kg and Rocuronium 1 mg/kg. After the intubation, maintenance
      continous intravenous Lidocain dose 2 mg/kg/hours or Placebo were set until the completion of
      surgery. Other than intervention (Lidocain or Placebo), maintenance was done by volatile
      Sevoflurane 0.8 -1.0 MAC, intermittent Fentanyl, continous Atracurium dose 5 mcg/kg/minutes
      and Manitol 20% dose 0.5 g/kg 30 minutes before Neurosurgeon reach the duramater. At the time
      Neurosurgeon reach the duramater, before and after they open the duramater, Neurosurgeon will
      assess brain relaxation by direct inspection and palpation. Total Fentanyl intraoperative
      will record and Cognitive status pre and postoperative will assess using MMSE.
      Postoperatively patient will transport to the ICU for monitoring.
