    
      This longitudinal observational study examines patients with cardiac arrhythmia (such as
      atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) who are undergoing a conventional standard therapy in
      the Department of Cardiology of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin
      Franklin. To examine the impact of psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression,
      resilience and risk factors (e.g. neuroticism) on cardiac treatment outcomes, patients are
      evaluated with a standardized psychological assessment including established questionnaires.
      The baseline observation is performed before the standard treatment of the arrhythmia (e.g.
      pharmacological treatment or electrophysiological methods). Follow-up observations are made 3
      and 6 month after the cardiological intervention.
