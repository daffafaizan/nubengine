    
      Thirty patients with chronic periodontitis and a minimum of seven pockets (>5

      mm) in non-molars teeth that bled on probing will be selected. Patients will be randomly

      assigned to ultrasonic periodontal debridement followed by local application of doxycycline

      by PLGA microspheres (DB+DOX) and periodontal debridement followed by administration

      of void PLGA microspheres (DB). Plaque, bleeding on probe, clinical attachment level

      (CAL), and probing depth (PD) will be recorded at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Subgingival

      biofilm samples will be collected from initially moderate (5 to 6 mm) and deep (â‰¥7 mm)

      pockets at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Polimerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis will be

      used to detect the frequency of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf),

      Treponema denticola (Td), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Prevotella

      intermedia (Pi).
