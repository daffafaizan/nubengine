    
      This is a single center, randomized, prospective cohort study to comparatively evaluate the
      implementation of the MvIGS spine navigation system to conventional 2D fluoroscopy for
      pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of spinal stenosis with degenerative
      spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine. Fluoroscopy and the MvIGS navigation system are both
      intraoperative imaging options available to aid spine surgeons.

      Fluoroscopy uses X-rays to obtain images of patient anatomy. The MvIGS spine navigation
      system provides patient specific, high quality intraoperative imaging with no radiation
      exposure. After the spine is exposed, intraoperative images are obtained using visible light
      then registered to the patient's preoperative computed tomography scan. Use of the
      proprietary integrated surgical light with embedded tracking technology and Instant Flashâ„¢
      registration allows for continuous and direct visualization of the surgical field without
      disturbing surgeon workflow.
