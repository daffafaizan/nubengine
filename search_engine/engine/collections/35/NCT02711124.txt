      Zagreb. It will be conducted in prospective observational fashion. Diabetic patients
      undergoing isolated, primary on-pump CABG will be consecutively recruited. Patients requiring
      urgent procedure will be excluded. Blood samples, both for conventional lab. findings
      (including HbA1c) and impedance aggregometry will be drawn prior to surgery and
      postoperatively on daily basis.

      Cohort sample will be divided into two subgroups according to HbA1c level (Group 1 with HbA1c
      < 7% and Group 2 with HbA1c â‰¥ 7%, respectively). Respective subgroups will be compared for
      basic demographic data, laboratory findings including those obtained using platelet function
      testing, and for clinical outcomes, respectively.

      Multiple-electrode aggregometry:

      Whole blood aggregation will be determined using a new-generation impedance aggregometer
      (Multiplate analyzer; Roche Diagnostics). In brief, when platelets expose receptors on their
      surface they get activated and stick on the Multiplate sensor wires enhancing the electrical
      resistance between them. An increase in impedance is expressed in arbitrary area under the
      curve (AUC) units. Platelet aggregation is determined in response to stimulation with
      arachidonic acid (ASPI (aspirin-sensitive patients identification) test designed to evaluate
      the effect to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (ADP test designed
      to evaluate the effect of thienopyridines, such as clopidogrel).
