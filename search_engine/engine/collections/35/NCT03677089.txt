      12-session training program using a common curriculum and core lecture, with each site
      expected to recruit 15 PCPs. Sites were randomized in a stepped-wedge design with 5 clusters
      (2 sites per cluster) and a staggered start over a 1-year period. Staggering the start
      allowed for some control for potential temporal trends, as well as allowing the core team to
      focus on working with each site to ensure smooth startup of the training program at each
      site.

      Outcomes are measured at baseline (Month 0), during the intervention (approximately 3 months
      after the start of the intervention) and after the end of the intervention (approximately 6
      months after the start of the intervention). An additional measurement was made 3 months
      after the end of the intervention to assess whether deterioration occurs after clinic
      participation ends.

      All participants received the intervention.
