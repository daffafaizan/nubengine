      of hypertension through an integrated approach. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to develop
      a health delivery system that effectively manages hypertension at primary care level.

      Hypothesis: The development of an integrated management approach will be effective in
      managing hypertension at all levels among hypertensive patients.
