      other healthcare providers to wear EnChroma products in the clinical setting. It is known
      that color vision is important to the practice of medicine. Identifying red skin or red ear
      drums, noticing whether lips have turned blue or a patient is pale, and identifying colors
      under a microscope all are aided by or dependent upon color vision. While color vision
      deficiency does not preclude a person from becoming and succeeding as a physician, it may be
      appropriate and desired to utilize devices to improve color vision during patient care.
