      spinal cord and called Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls. In humans such experimental
      settings are impossible. That is why we need two noxious stimuli for provoking such an
      endogenous pain inhibition.

      Before the CPM setting begins, we will investigate our 32 healthy probands by basic QST
      following the protocol of DFNS (German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain). This assessment
      helps us to create a sensory profile for every proband and to look for correlations between
      QST parameters and CPM efficacy. Then the CPM setting follows. In our experimental design we
      use a test stimulus (TS) on the dominant forearm by thermode (normally 45-47°C, depending on
      the pain rating, we need scores >NRS 60) and a conditioned stimulus (CS) on the other hand by
      cold water bath (10°C). Both stimuli must be rated on the numerical rating scale (NRS) 0-100
      alone and in combination. A positive effect can be seen, if the difference between TS alone
      and TS in combination with CS is >0. To learn more about the duration of CPM effects we
      decided to repeat four QST parameters (cold detection threshold, warm detection threshold,
      mechanical detection threshold and mechanical pain threshold) within 30 minutes after
      finishing the CPM part to detect changes of time.

      The whole study design will be repeated 24-72h hours later to increase the
      test-retest-reliability.
