    
      Briefly, at the beginning of an approximate three hour study visit, the qualified
      investigator (QI) / delegate will explain the study procedure to the participants and the
      participants will have an opportunity to ask questions regarding the study procedure.
      Following the explanation of the study, written informed consent will be collected at the
      beginning of visit 1. Participants who are deemed unable to provide consent will be provided
      an assent form and consent will be acquired from their parents/ legal guardians. During the
      study visit, participants will undergo: 1) brief medical history and clinical examination
      including questionnaires, 2) full pulmonary function tests, lung clearance testing (LCI),
      forced oscillation technique (FoT) and exercise testing, 3) proton MRI, 4) spin-density
      and/or diffusion-weighted 129Xe MRI, 5) Multiple-breath washout imaging. Qualified research
      team members will perform a clinical examination on the participant to record their vital
      statistics like age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature
      and blood pressure. The QI/delegate, during a brief conversation with the participant, will
      collect relevant medical history from the participant to make sure the participant meets all
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. The QI will also make sure that the
      participant understands the study procedure and is willing to participate in the study. Based
      on the clinical examination results, medical history and the pulmonary function test results,
      the QI/delegate will determine if all the inclusion/exclusion criteria are met to proceed
      with the MRI part of the study visit.
