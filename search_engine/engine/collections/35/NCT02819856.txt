    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of
      SPI-1005 in Cystic Fibrosis patients with Acute Pulmonary Exacerbation receiving intravenous
      tobramycin at risk for ototoxicity. All patients will undergo baseline testing and have their
      severity of lung function, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo determined before
      the start of SPI-1005 treatment. SPI-1005 treatment will start within first two days of IV
      tobramycin treatment and be administered concomitantly. At the end of the 21-day course of
      SPI-1005 and 28 days following the cessation of SPI-1005, patients will have their hearing
      loss, tinnitus and vertigo reassessed. Assessments may also include additional audiometric
      and pulmonary testing, and additional follow-up testing.
