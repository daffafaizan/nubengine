      I. Compare confirmed-progression free survival at 6 months for grade IV MGMT unmethylated
      glioma patients after radiation therapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and
      conventional magnetic resonance (MR) image information with historical controls from Mayo
      Clinic Rochester patients, including those treated on North Central Cancer Treatment Group
      (NCCTG) clinical trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare progression free survival at 12 months for grade III patients after radiation
      therapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional MR image
      information with historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester patients, including those on
      NCCTG clinical trials.

      II. Compare patient overall survival after radiation therapy targeting volumes designed with
      both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional MR image information with historical controls from Mayo
      Clinic Rochester patients, including those on NCCTG clinical trials.

      III. Evaluate quality of life after radiotherapy treatment targeting dose escalated volumes
      defined to include high 18F-DOPA PET uptake.

      IV. Determine acute and late effect toxicity after radiotherapy treatment targeting dose
      escalated volumes defined to include high 18F-DOPA PET uptake.

      V. Compare confirmed-progression free survival at 12 months for grade IV MGMT methylated
      patients after radiation therapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and
      conventional MR image information with historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester
      patients, including those on NCCTG clinical trials.

      VI. Compare confirmed-progression free survival in grade IV MGMT un-methylated patients with
      similar historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester patients, including those on NCCTG
      clinical trials.

      VII. Compare confirmed-progression free survival in grade IV MGMT methylated patients with
      similar historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester patients, including those on NCCTG
      clinical trials.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare radiation therapy (RT) treatment volumes defined by MR only with RT treatment
      volumes defined with both PET and MR information for grade IV glioma patients.

      II. Compare timing of accurate identification of progression defined by 18F-DOPA PET,
      perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) and conventional MRI for grade IV glioma
      patients.

      III. Compare patterns of failure after radiation therapy targeting volumes defined with
      target volumes designed to with both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional MR image information with
      patterns of failure for historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester patients, including
      those on NCCTG clinical trials.

      IV. Compare RT treatment volumes defined by MR only with RT treatment volumes defined with
      both PET and MR information for grade III glioma patients.

      V. Evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability with vs. without the addition of 18F-DOPA
      PET uptake for radiotherapy target volume delineation.

      VI. Compare timing of accurate identification of progression defined by 18F-DOPA PET, pMRI
      and conventional MRI for grade III glioma patients.

      VII. Compare predictive capabilities of 18F-DOPA PET, pMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      for localization of recurrences for patients treated with 18F-DOPA PET-guided RT dose
      escalation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F DOPA-PET, pMRI, and DTI within 14 days before radiation therapy, 3-6
      weeks after radiation therapy, and during follow-up. Patients also undergo
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) over 30 fractions and receive temozolomide.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
