    
      LeptiCore is a proprietary combination of various ingredients which have been shown to have
      properties which could be beneficial to weight loss in obese and overweight human subjects.
      This study evaluates the effect of Lepticore on bodyweight as well as parameters associated
      with obesity and metabolic syndrome.

      The study was an 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design involving 92
      obese (mean BMI>30kg/m2) participants (37 males; 55 females; ages 19-52; mean age = 30.7).
      The participants were randomly divided into three groups: placebo (n=30), LeptiCore formula A
      (low dose) (n=31) and LeptiCore formula B (high dose) (n=31). Capsules containing the placebo
      or active formulations were administered twice daily before meals with 300 ml of water. None
      of the participants followed any specific diet nor took any weight-reducing medications for
      the duration of the study. A total of 12 anthropomorphic and serological measurements were
      taken at the beginning of the study and after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment.
