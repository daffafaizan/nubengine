      is most important in life, how to communicate their preferences to clinicians and loved ones,
      and how to make informed decisions. It is written at a 5th grade level and includes
      voice-overs of text and closed captioning of videos that model advance care planning
      behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read
      advance directive, versus an advance directive alone, to improve patient engagement in
      multiple advance care planning behaviors including discussions with surrogate decision makers
      and clinicians in addition to advance directive completion. The investigators will also
      determine whether PREPARE can empower and activate patients within clinical encounters with
      their clinicians and help to decrease health disparities in advance care planning.
