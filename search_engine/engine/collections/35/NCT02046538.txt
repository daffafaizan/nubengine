      FOLFIRI (in the case of liver limited CRC) or FOLFOX (in the case of rectal cancer). The
      FOLFOX regimen consists of Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin, and 5-FU. The FOLFIRI regimen consists of
      Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-FU. Zaltrap will be administered with chemotherapy every 2
      weeks for the first 5 out of 6 planned treatment cycles. After a standard 3-4 week recovery
      period (i.e. 5-6 week's from the last Zaltrap dose), patients will undergo standard
      resection. At the time of resection, the tumor will be collected for biomarker discovery.

      Following resection, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy with or
      without zaltrap for 3 additional months. Patients assigned to Zaltrap may continue zaltrap
      (without chemotherapy) until disease recurrence or up to an additional 15 months. Patients
      will have research blood draws periodically both in the preoperative and postoperative
      period.

      The investigators plan to demonstrate that pre-operative chemotherapy with Zaltrap is not
      associated with any safety signals that would preclude further drug development in this
      patient population. The investigators also plan to perform correlative studies to identify
      potential biomarkers for Zaltrap activity.

      The investigators hypothesize that antiangiogenic therapy may specifically target the
      micrometastatis niche of patients with liver limited metastatic colorectal cancer to
      significantly increase the chance of cure for these patients.
