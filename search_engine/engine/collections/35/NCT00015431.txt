      by decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA levels. In addition to chronic or recurrent
      sinopulmonary infections, many patients develop gastrointestinal manifestations that can be
      disabling or fatal. Data suggest that these gut abnormalities have a primary immune basis,
      implicating T cells primarily, and are not related to the infectious complications of CVID.
      Currently there is no standard therapy for the associated gastrointestinal disease outside of
      empiric nutritional intervention for weight loss and non-specific anti-diarrheal agents. In
      addition there is no data about the prevalence of gastrointestinal abnormalities in CVID
      patients who have no overt gastrointestinal symptoms.

      The objectives of this study are to characterize the gastrointestinal abnormalities that
      occur in CVID patients and correlate this with the immunophenotype and cytokine secretion of
      peripheral blood and lamina propria lymphocytes and monocytes. CVID patients with
      gastrointestinal symptoms of malabsorption/maldigestion and chronic diarrhea will be targeted
      for study. We will also include a group of patients without gastrointestinal symptoms to
      provide an estimate of background prevalence and severity of gut abnormalities. Subjects will
      undergo a standard immunologic workup including peripheral blood lymphocyte marker
      phenotyping and cytokine responses as well as tests of gastrointestinal absorption,
      examination of gut histology by endoscopic biopsy, and measurement of gut mucosal cytokine
      expression. Analysis variables will include clinical (weight, stool frequency, results of gut
      absorption tests), laboratory (lymphocyte and cytokine assays), and gut abnormalities
      (histology scores and specific lesions).
