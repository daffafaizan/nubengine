      been published.This study is designed to evaluate the evolution of primary snoring and OSAS
      in children who had been submitted to watchful waiting 、drug or adenotonsillectomy.The
      participated children will be evaluated by full physical examination and nocturnal
      polysomnography（PSG）, after which they were divided into 2 groups: apnea and snoring. After 6
      months following the initial evaluation, patients were submitted to a new nocturnal
      polysomnography, and all data were compared to those of the first examination.And after 3
      months and 12 months following the initial evaluation, patients will be called to complete
      the sleep questionnaire.Then analyse the change of parameters of polysomnography after 6
      months of follow-up,and describe the changes of items of sleep questionnaire.
