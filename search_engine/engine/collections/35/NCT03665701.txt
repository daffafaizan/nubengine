      experiments eosinophil granulocytes and ILC2 cells will be isolated from the collected blood
      samples and used in specific assays in respect to their functional reactivity against the DP2
      receptor antagonist Fevipiprant after respective stimulation using Prostaglandin D2
      metabolites or Prostaglandin D2. Major rationale is to show and determine the EC70 of the
      effectivity of Fevipiprant against Prostaglandin D2 metabolite triggered activation of
      eosinophil granulocytes and ILC2 innate lymphoid cells.
