      framework of the research project INTROMAT, an ICT Lighthouse research project funded by the
      Norwegian Research Council. The content of the digital covid-19 intervention was based on
      four previously developed digital interventions, all based on systematic user-involvement and
      user-testing, from our group. The person-based approach inspired the development of the
      intervention. Based on the research literature and experience from our existing digital
      interventions we started the development with establishing guiding principles. The
      intervention consists of 8 modules.
