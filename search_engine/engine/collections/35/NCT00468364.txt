      defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness, the components of
      hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure and the resultant vicious cycle of recurrent
      iatrogenic hypoglycemia. This may explain why iatrogenic hypoglycemia becomes limiting to
      glycemic control as patients approach the insulin-deficient end of the spectrum of type 2
      diabetes. Compared to Neutral Protamin Hagedorn (NPH) insulin glargine is a new long-acting
      peakless analogue with lower incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia having the potential to
      decrease the frequency of hypoglycemia of insulin therapy. Modern type 2 diabetes therapy
      guidelines recommend insulin for an increasing population of patients. There is no doubt that
      type 2 diabetic patients suffer from hypoglycemia under insulin therapy, however it is not
      clear whether the extensive studies on hypoglycemia in type 1 patients apply also for type 2
      diabetes. Recent reports indicate that type 2 diabetic patients of long duration react
      similarly to a hypoglycemic clamp as type 1 diabetic patients while well controlled type 2
      diabetics had even more favorable thresholds for counter-regulatory hormone secretion. On the
      basis of these considerations the aims of this study are to 1) more precisely define the
      mechanisms of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2) to investigate differences on glucose and
      lactate metabolism of bedtime NPH insulin versus glargine. To address these objectives we
      will use the hypoglycemic clamping technique combined with infusion of stable isotopes of
      glucose and lactate and non-invasive measurement of muscle flow characteristics at
      hypoglycemia.
