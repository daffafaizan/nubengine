      developed. For a given individual, there are both biologic (e.g., genetic) and environmental
      (e.g., lifestyle) factors that comprise her individual risk of diabetes. Researchers can take
      advantage the accumulating knowledge of these individual factors to design individualized
      strategies for diabetes risk assessment and prevention. For example, a mutation in a
      particular gene, SLC30A8, which encodes a zinc transporter, has been shown to increase the
      risk of diabetes probably through impairment of insulin secretion. In the proposed research
      project, the investigators aim to conduct a pilot study to see the effect of zinc
      supplementation on insulin secretion in people with and without this genetic mutation to see
      if zinc can improve insulin secretion in those with the mutation. The results from this study
      will help the investigators to plan a larger, more definitive study to determine if zinc
      supplementation can be used to prevent or treat diabetes in those with this mutation in
      SLC30A8.
