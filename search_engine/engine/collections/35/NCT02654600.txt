      compliance calculated when thorax is opened After operation chest X-ray are daily done and
      blood samples as needed. Were recorded death, time of extubation,duration of non invasive
      ventilation,of Intensive Care Unit stay and of total hospital stay, troponin peak, lactates,
      blood gases, ionogram and count.Variations of compliance is analyzed through one factor
      paired Anova or Wilcoxon paired test. Decrease of compliance and respiratory complications
      are analyzed through binomial logistic regression.
