    
      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a currently untreatable, autosomal recessive motor neuron
      disease that is caused by deficiency of full-length survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. One
      promising therapeutic approach to SMA is to pharmacologically increase full-length SMN
      protein levels. Several compounds have been shown to increase SMN levels in immortalized cell
      lines derived from SMA patients. The objective of this study is to determine baseline SMN
      levels in primary peripheral blood cells of SMA patients and heterozygous carriers compared
      to unaffected controls and to investigate the effects in vitro of pharmacological compounds
      that are expected to increase SMN levels. It is anticipated that these studies will provide
      further evidence to support the use of one or more of these compounds in a clinical trial for
      SMA patients. The study population will include patients with genetically proven type I, II,
      or III SMA and their family members. Blood samples from anonymous, unaffected control
      patients will be obtained through the department of transfusion medicine (99-CC-0168). This
      is an investigative study that involves blood drawing only. No new therapy will be provided
      except the standard of care.
