      Primary

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of azacitidine in patients with chronic
           myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).

        -  To assess the overall response rate in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the incidence of clinical remission/complete remission or partial response in
           these patients.

        -  To assess hematological improvement in patients treated with this drug.

        -  To assess the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To assess the time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation of CMML.

        -  To assess the time to death or AML transformation of CMML.

        -  To assess the biological correlates.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-5 and 8-9. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of loss of response/disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo response evaluation after 6 courses or the last
      course of treatment. Responders may continue azacitidine until loss of response/disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients undergo blood, bone marrow, and buccal swab sample collection periodically for
      correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
