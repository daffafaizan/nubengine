      a 12-week supervised exercise class featuring biomechanically sound exercises for people with
      knee osteoarthritis. Measures of strength of the knee muscles, pain, biomechanics during
      walking and yoga, mobility and cardiovascular health will be included. Strength will be
      measured on a dynamometer. Pain will be assessed with questionnaires. Walking and three yoga
      postures will be observed using motion capture system integrated with force measurements from
      the floor. Mobility will be assessed during walking, stair-climbing and chair standing tasks.
      Cardiovascular health will be measured during a submaximal bicycle task.
