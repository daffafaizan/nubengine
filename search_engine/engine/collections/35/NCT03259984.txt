      function in the muscle, liver and fat. Genetic and environmental factors are known to
      influence insulin sensitivity. It is not known how this is mediated. This study looks at the
      role of epigenetics (modifications of proteins associated with DNA and methylation of DNA) in
      alterations in insulin resistance. The investigators will study lean healthy people, obese
      non-diabetic people and people with type 2 diabetes to characterize the DNA methylation
      patterns in muscle in each group. The second aim of the study is to see how a single bout of
      exercise affects the DNA methylation in the muscle. The third aim looks at the effect of 8
      weeks of supervised exercise on the DNA methylation.
