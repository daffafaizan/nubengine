      Prevention of blood exposure, through safer practices, barrier precautions, safer needle
      devices, and other innovations, is the best way to prevent infection with HIV and other
      bloodborne pathogens.

      Though these strategies have been successful in reducing the frequency of blood exposure and
      needlestick injuries in the past decade, the hazard has not been eliminated. As of December
      2001, the CDC had received voluntary reports of 57 documented cases of HIV seroconversion
      temporally associated with occupational exposure to HIV among U.S. health care personnel. An
      additional 138 infections among health care personnel were considered possible cases of
      occupational transmission. Because there is no cure or effective vaccine for HIV, optimal
      post exposure care, including the administration of antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV
      infection, remains a high priority in protecting health care workers.
