    
      Urinary incontinence (UI), or the complaint of any involuntary loss of urine, ranges in
      severity from the occasional leaking urine during actions resulting in increased abdominal
      pressure (coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercise, etc.) to sudden, unpredictable strong urges
      to void. Female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is attributed to a weakening of the pelvic
      floor muscles.

      A recent review of literature describing the prevalence of UI calculated the median
      prevalence of female UI to be 27.6% (4.8-58.4%), with the prevalence of significant
      incontinence increasing with age. The prevalent cause of UI was further categorized into
      stress (50%), mixed (32%) and urge (14%).

      Nonsurgical treatment of female SUI has traditionally been limited to alpha-adrenergic
      agonists and estrogens, pelvic floor exercises, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and
      behavior modification1. Options for surgical treatment consists of periurethral injections of
      bulking agents, transvaginal suspensions, retropubic suspensions, slings and sphincter
      prostheses.

      The Ajustâ„¢ Adjustable Single-Incision Sling is a fully adjustable single-incision sling that
      anchors in the transobturator membranes, anatomically sufficient spaces for support of the
      urethra.
