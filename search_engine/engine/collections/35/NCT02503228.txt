      that has been stored in the MOPS instead of the currently standard preservation system
      (culture media at 4 degrees Celsius). This will be the only difference in the surgical
      procedure between enrolled patients and non-study patients. Enrolled patients will undergo
      their grafting procedure as they normally would if they were not enrolled in this study. They
      will also receive the same care as non-study patients.

      Enrolled patients will, however, be asked to fill out surveys about their health, activity
      level, level of pain, and general quality of life (IKDC, Tegner, PROMIS surveys) at a
      pre-operative visit and at post-operative visits at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24
      months after surgery. They will also be asked to provide blood and urine samples at a
      pre-operative visit, the day of surgery, and at post-operative visits at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months, and 24 month after their surgery. Also, there will be a non-standard of
      care MRI taken at 12 months after surgery. Finally, any diagnostic imaging that is done as
      part of the standard of care will also be reviewed by the investigators. No additional
      diagnostic imaging will take place outside of the non-standard of care MRI at 12 months after
      surgery; this imaging review will simply be taking advantage of diagnostic imaging that would
      be available even for a non-study patient.

      The surveys assess the progress of patient function and general well-being. The blood and
      urine samples, as well as the MRI will assess the healing and integration of the
      osteochondral allograft.
