      complex treatment of breast cancer. Many patients are immunosuppressed after surgical,
      radiation and chemotherapeutic treatment, which leads to dysfunction of T cells, resulting in
      tumor cells avoiding immune surveillance. Restoration of antitumor immunity during
      immunotherapy is one of the modern approaches in the treatment of breast cancer, which
      contributes to the formation of an effective specific immune response, the destruction of
      tumor cells while minimizing toxicity. Dendritic cells (DC) and the lymphocytes induced by
      them are one of the most effective methods for the destruction of residual cancer cells,
      which are the leading cause of relapse and metastasis.
