      untreated patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors(ESFT),
      rhabdomyosarcoma and intermediate and high-risk non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas
      whose planned treatment includes a cumulative doxorubicin dose ≥ 375 mg/m2 to determine if
      serial levels of one or more of these potential markers of cardiac muscle injury obtained
      prior to each infusion of doxorubicin and at the completion of chemotherapy correlate with
      increasing cumulative anthracycline exposure.

      The secondary aim of the study is to estimate the proportion of patients with decreased
      (evaluation j - evaluation j+1) peak longitudinal systolic strain (ε) or strain rate (SR),
      peak radial systolic ε or SR, peak radial systolic myocardial velocity or peak longitudinal
      systolic myocardial velocity among those who have a shortening fraction (SF) ≥ 29% prior to
      each infusion of anthracycline. This study will evaluate whether the serum levels of cTn-T
      and/or NT-BNP will increase following doxorubicin administration. The study will evaluate
      whether the serum levels of cTn-T and/or NT-BNP will increase with increasing cumulative
      doxorubicin dose.
