      prostate cancer and determined to have prostate cancer by having a Gleason score â‰¤ 7 (low to
      moderate risk 2-7). Of these men, one arm of a two arm randomized group will be administered
      a treatment regime of Dutasteride versus the control group who receive standard of care,
      prior to mapping biopsy. This proposal aims at studying the apparent effect of the use of
      Dutasteride (3 months) on initial tumor volume (at diagnosis) in men with low volume cancer
      before undergoing 3D mapping biopsy.
