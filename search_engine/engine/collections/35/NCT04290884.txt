      next twenty-five years as the world population ages. Hip fracture in elderly patients are
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One of the significant morbidity is
      blood loss, which has been reported as high as 1500ml. Blood loss may lead subsequent blood
      transfusion. The rate of blood transfusion has been reported between 20 to 60%. Blood loss
      and subsequent blood transfusion could lengthen the overall hospital length of stay and delay
      the rehabilitation.

      Tranexamic acid, one of antifibrinolytic agents, is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid
      lysine and acts as a competitive inhibitor in the activation of plasminogen to plasmin,
      therefore preventing the degradation of fibrin. Shakur et al. reported that the use could
      reduce mortality in trauma patients. Tranexamic acid has been widely used in elective
      orthopaedic surgery such as total joint replacement and spine surgery. Several authors
      reported that tranexamic acid could decreases the blood loss, transfusion rate and cost.
