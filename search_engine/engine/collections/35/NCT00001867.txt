      of other conditions. Anecdotal case reports suggest that uveitis may remit or improve during
      pregnancy and recur in the postpartum period. This observation is supported by findings in an
      experimental autoimmune uveitis model in mice. We propose to study the natural history of
      ocular inflammation in a series of pregnant women who have had ocular inflammation (uveitis)
      in the two year period prior to becoming pregnant. Women will be enrolled between 2 and 20
      completed weeks of gestation at which time they will receive a complete ophthalmologic
      examination and will have blood drawn for cytokine and hormone evaluation. These procedures
      will be repeated at monthly intervals until 6 months postpartum. Treatment of uveitis will
      ensue as medically indicated and in consultation with the woman's obstetric care provider.
      The goal of this investigation is to determine whether cytokine levels are correlated with
      disease expression. Such information may be useful to inform decisions about how to best
      manage pregnant and postpartum uveitis patients in the future.
