    
      From April 2011 to May 2013, all patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy were informed
      of the study and prospectively included. The study was approved by our institutional ethical
      Review Board (CEPAR, Institut Mutualiste Montsouris Paris France). Oral consent was obtained
      from patients. Written informed consent of the patients to participate was not necessary
      according to the French law regarding observational study.

      The anesthesiologist in charge of the patient recorded all the parameters of the
      ultrasound-guided intermediate cervical plexus block: facility and duration of block
      performance, local anesthetic volume, quality of anesthesia and surgical dissection, and
      adverse effects of the intermediate CPB. . Neurological status was assessed intraoperatively,
      in the postoperative setting and at one month after the procedure. Perioperative hemodynamic
      stability (intraoperative non invasive blood pressure variations) and pulse oxymetry were
      recorded. As well as ECG and cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) measurments performed the day before
      surgery and each morning during the 3 first postoperative days. Any clinical coronary or
      neurological event was recorded at one month.

      Statistical analysis was performed on Prism 6 for Mac OS X (Version 6.0c, www.graphpad.com).
      Data are presented as mean Â± standard deviation (SD) for continuous data and number
      (percentage) for categorical data.
