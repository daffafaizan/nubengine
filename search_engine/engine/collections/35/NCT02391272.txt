      in pregnancy from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other well-known hospitals in
      China. ITP patients in pregnancy who failed to respond to prednisone, IVIG and developed
      refractoriness to platelet transfusion will be given rhTPO intravenously at a dose of 300U/kg
      every day. Dose will be tapered to 300U/kg every other day when platelet count rise over
      50Ã—10^9/L. Maintenance will be continued after delivery and the dose will be further reduced
      to 300U/kg per week. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms will be evaluated before and
      after treatment. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.
