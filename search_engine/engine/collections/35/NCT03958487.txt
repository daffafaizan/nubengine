      executive/monitoring deficits. Baseline evaluation will take take around 5 sessions, The
      training phase will be done on 6 sessions and post-training evaluation will be completed on
      around 3 sessions. Each patient will be invited to be retested 8/10 weeks after completing
      the training, to evaluate long term effects (secondary outcome). The final number of
      participants enrolled in the study will depend on availability.

      The authors will use a single case A-B changing criterium design: Phase A constitutes the
      base line. Three ADL tasks will be performed by the participant without help, two of them
      will be treated on phase B and the other will not be trained. Each task will be evaluated 3/4
      times to obtain a robust baseline. Apart from ADL, other executive/monitoring measures will
      be obtained pre and post-training through neuropsychological screening.

      The level of monitoring difficulty will be increasing from one training session to the next,
      from level 1 (2 distractors/1 conflicting situation) to level 3 (8 distractors/4 conflicting
      situations). Baseline and post-training performance will be evaluated at level 3.The
      criterion to increase the level of monitoring requirements will be adjusted to each
      individual depending on his/her performance on the previous level. Therefore, only if a given
      participant reduces on at least 75% the amount of errors from initial evaluation on the
      present training session he/she will be confronted with the next level of difficulty on the
      next session. However, if the patient doesn't reach the criterium, the same level of
      monitoring will be repeated and trained on the following session.

      Outcomes measures (post-training phase) will be taken after completing 6 training sessions.
