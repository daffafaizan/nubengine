      ovulation rate of women with PCOS either spontaneously or with oral ovulation induction
      agent.

      Anovulatory women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria will be recruited.

      Participants will be randomized to the (1) vitamin D group or (2) placebo group. Those in the
      vitamin D group will take vitamin D 50,000 IU/ week for 4 weeks, followed by 50,000IU once
      every 2 weeks for 52 weeks, whereas those in the placebo group will take placebo tablets with
      the same external appearance. Those who remain anovulatory after 6 months will be treated
      with a 6-month course of letrozole (2.5mg to 7.5mg for 5 days per cycle titrated according to
      response) for ovulation induction.

      The primary outcome is the ovulation rate and will be compared between the 2 groups.
