    
      Intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal precursor cells (MPC) in patients with advanced
      heart failure who are treated with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation may
      result in a renewable source of proliferating functional cardiomyocytes; induce development
      of capillaries and larger-size blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to endogenous
      myocardium and newly-implanted cardiomyocytes; and release factors capable of paracrine
      signaling.
