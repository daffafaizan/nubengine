      sequentially on escalating doses of MK-2206 in combination with a fixed dose of trastuzumab.
      Barring dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), additional participants were to be enrolled and
      dose-finding would proceed until an MTD was identified for MK-2206 when dosed either every
      other day (QOD) or once weekly (QW) in combination with trastuzumab. In Part 2, cohorts of 3
      participants were to be enrolled sequentially on rising doses of lapatinib administered in
      combination with the MTD dose of MK-2206/trastuzumab established in Part 1. Barring DLTs,
      dose finding would proceed until an MTD of the 3-drug combination was identified.
