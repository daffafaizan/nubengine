      acceptable side effects. II. Describe the side effects and toxicity of DAC at the doses
      studied. III. Determine the steady state DAC serum levels at the doses studied. IV. Document
      any clinical responses to DAC.

      OUTLINE: A dose escalation schedule for the administration of decitabine (DAC) is being used
      to determine the MTD and biologically active dose. Patients are given two 12 hour continuous
      infusions per day, for 3 days at each dose level. A minimum of 3 patients are enrolled at
      each dose level until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or biologic activity is observed. If DLT
      or biologic activity is observed at a particular dose level, an additional 3 patients are
      enrolled, for a total of 6. If 2 or more patients experience DLT, dose escalation is ceased.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
