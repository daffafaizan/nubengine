      results in a significant burden on the affected individual, his or her family, and society in
      general. Psychopharmacological therapy has been shown to be effective, but may be accompanied
      by significant side effects. The investigators propose an alternative model, based on the
      relationship between symptoms, brain metabolism, and neural activity as recorded with
      electroencephalography (EEG). Subjects with MDD often have decreased brain metabolism,
      accompanied by increased EEG activity in the alpha band. The investigators hypothesis is that
      a gentle, non-significant risk, sinusoidal magnetic field above the subject's scalp, which
      oscillates at precisely his or her Intrinsic Alpha Frequency (IAF) can take advantage of this
      relationship to reduce symptoms without the significant side effects associated with
      pharmaceuticals. The investigators propose a 4-week, sham controlled, randomized,
      double-blind multi-center feasibility study to determine the efficacy of synchronized low
      energy magnetic fields delivered at the subject's IAF to treat MDD. Treatment will be given
      concomitant to the subject's existing medication, and will occur 5 days per week at the
      clinical site. Target enrollment is 45 adult subjects diagnosed with MDD.
