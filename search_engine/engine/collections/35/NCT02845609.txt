    
      The investigators identified 5 affected individuals (3 males and 2 females from three
      families, age 19-40 years) with GNE-related thrombocytopenia . All subjects will receive 2
      gram SA-ER, three times per day for a total daily dose of 6 grams (6,000 mg). The dose should
      be administered with food (i.e. within 30 minutes of a meal or snack).

      Efficacy will be evaluated by improvement in clinical and laboratory assessments. Results
      from Baseline assessments will be compared with those of post-treatment assessments with
      efficacy conclusions based on improvement between Baseline and the last scheduled assessment.
      Safety will be evaluated by the incidence and frequency of adverse events, including
      clinically significant changes from Baseline to scheduled time points in:

        -  Vital signs.

        -  History and physical examination findings.

        -  Laboratory evaluations.

        -  Serum uric acid levels and urinary excretion of uric acid.
