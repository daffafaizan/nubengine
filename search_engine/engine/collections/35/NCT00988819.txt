      ethnicity on metabolic traits, particularly those related to insulin resistance (detailed in
      the preliminary data of this proposal. We have observed that, for the same BMI, Asian Indians
      appear to have greater insulin resistance than Chinese. In line with the greater insulin
      resistance observed in Asian Indians, it has also been noted that Asian Indians exhibit
      greater central obesity (manifest as a larger waist circumference). In some ways, this
      resembles the phenotype that might be expected if the mismatch pathway described in this
      proposal, were involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in this ethnic group.
      Interestingly, Asian Indians have also been noted to have lower birth weight than Chinese in
      our population. In contrast, although Malays are more insulin resistant than Chinese, this is
      largely due to greater adiposity and, after adjustment for body mass index, Malays are
      actually less insulin resistant than their Chinese and Asian Indian counterparts. They also
      have smaller waist circumferences. It is also recognized that pregnant Malay women tend to be
      generally more obese than their Chinese and Asian Indian counterparts, which may put their
      children at great risk of fetal hyperinsulinemia. As such, the potential exists that this
      latter pathway is more active in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in this ethnic group.
