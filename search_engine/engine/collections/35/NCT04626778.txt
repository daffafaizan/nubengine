      balanced on the basis of their initial gingival index scores. Saliva samples will be
      collected from participants prior to rinsing with their assigned mouthwash (1.5% hydrogen
      peroxide or 0.0% hydrogen peroxide) for one minute and then expectorate. Saliva samples will
      again be collected immediately after, at 30 min, and 60 min after rinsing. All collected
      saliva samples will be placed in sterile vials, labeled with subject information and
      transferred to the microbiology laboratory for analysis.
