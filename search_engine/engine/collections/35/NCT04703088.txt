    
      Vital signs are measured in the preparation area before entrance in the operation theater.
      The following measures are taken in the supine position every three minutes for three
      measures: blood pressure and cardiac frequency. The mean blood pressure and cardiac frequency
      become the reference measure for each patient.

      Upon entrance in the operation theater, anesthesia care is given in a standardized manner:

        -  Supine positioning of the parturient on the operating table

        -  Standard monitoring of vitals signs every minute for the time of the study, including
           systolic, diastolic an mean blood pressures, cardiac frequency and SpO2

        -  18G intravenous catheter insertion on the forearm

        -  Randomization of the patient in one of the two groups followed by blind administration
           of ondansetron or saline

        -  5 minute wait period before sitting the patient for spinal anesthesia

        -  Standardized spinal anesthesia: Whitacre 25G spinal needle, L4-L5 intervertebral space,
           hyperbaric bupivacaine 12mg + fentanyl 10 mcg + morphine 100 mcg

        -  Upon injection of the spinal medication: 1000 ml Ringer lactate coloading and start of
           the iv norepinephrine infusion upon study protocol.

        -  Evaluation of the sensitive block level at 5 and 10 minutes, a level of T6 is needed to
           start surgery

        -  Nausea and vomiting prophylaxis in both groups with metoclopramide 10 mg and
           dexamethasone 4 mg if no contraindication. Nausea and vomiting per cesarean section will
           be treated with dimenhydrinate 25 mg

        -  Bradycardia (HR below 60) will be treated with atropine 0,4 mg

        -  Multimodal post-operative analgesia with intra rectal acetaminophen 1000 mg and
           indomethacin 100 mg

      Norepinephrine infusion protocol:

        -  The rate of the infusion pump is blindly set in mcg/kg/min by one of the investigators
           before the entrance of the patient and the anesthesia team in the operating room. The
           setting is hidden from the main physician at all times and the perfusion is started when
           the spinal medication is injected.

        -  For the first patient of each group (saline and ondansetron) the norepinephrine infusion
           is started at 0,05 mcg/kg/min until the end of the study

        -  Hypotension (as defined as a value inferior or equal to 80% of the systolic blood
           pressure reference value) is treated by the anesthesiologist with a 4 mcg bolus of
           norepinephrine from a prepared syringe of norepinephrine 4 mcg/ml

        -  Hypertension (as defined as a value superior or equal to 120% of the systolic blood
           pressure reference value) is treated by stopping the norephineprine infusion and
           restarting it when the value is inferior to 120% of the reference value.

        -  For the following patients, the norepinephrine infusion rate will be adjusted by up and
           down allocation following the results of the previous patient: if no hypotension
           occurred (no bolus needed): the infusion rate is decreased by 0,005 mcg/kg/min (for
           example from 0,05 mcg/kg/min to 0,045 mcg/kg/min) / if at least one hypotension occurred
           (at least one bolus needed): the infusion rate is increased by 0,005 mcg/kg/min (for
           example from 0,05 mcg/kg/min to 0,055 mcg/kg/min)

      The study is stopped at the fetal delivery.
