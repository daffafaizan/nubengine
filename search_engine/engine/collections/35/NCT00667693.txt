      be randomly allocated to intubation with either a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope or with
      the Pentax AWS. Our study hypothesis is that use of Pentax AWS will make tracheal intubation
      easier to perform in the obese surgical patient (BMI 30 to 50), as evidenced by the time to
      complete the intubation process as well as an "Ease of Use" visual analog score (VAS)
      measure.
