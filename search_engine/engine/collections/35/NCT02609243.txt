    
      Prediabetes, defined by either impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance, is
      a known high-risk condition predisposing to future diabetes mellitus type 2. Strategies to
      prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes have been widely studied, however, without
      striking long-term effects of any kind of intervention (pharmacological, behavioral...). The
      investigators therefore investigate certain nutritional approaches concerning nutrient
      content and favorable food components, targeting metabolic improvement.

      The main comparison will assess differences in metabolic outcome due to low-carb or low-fat
      dietary intervention in short- and long-term design.

      Additionally, the role of PUFA will be assessed during long-term intervention to achieve
      better maintenance of metabolic improvements from the first study phase.
