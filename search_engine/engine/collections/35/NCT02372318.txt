    
      All subjects will undergo a battery of minimal risk procedures during each study visit;
      filling out questionnaires, performing agreed behavioral tasks, scanning procedures including
      two functional MRI (fMRI) scans as well as structural MRI.

      The fMRI will be obtained in non-abstinent participants with breath alcohol concentrations
      not larger than > 0.3 ‰ and withdrawal severity not more than 4 on the clinical institute
      withdrawal assessment for alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale.

      Alcohol consumption will be assessed with the Form90 interview. Severity of alcohol
      dependence will be examined with the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS). Drinking situations will
      be assessed with the Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS). Trait aspects of craving for
      alcohol will be measured with the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). To examine
      state and trait anxiety the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) will be used. Depressive
      symptoms will be measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait
      Depression Scales (STDS). Nicotine consumption will be assessed with the Fagerström Test for
      Nicotine Dependence.

      The following scales will be administered before and after each fMRI scanning: The Alcohol
      Craving Questionnaire (ACQ), the Alcohol Urge Questionaire (AUQ) and visual analogue scales
      for craving assessment.

      Participants will undergo two fMRI scanning sessions at intervals of one week: one 2 h after
      administration of nalmefene and one 2 h after administration of placebo, carried out in a
      randomized order.

      MRI examinations include

        -  a cue-reactivity task;

        -  an emotional faces task;

        -  resting-state fMRI;

        -  structural MRI;

        -  including preparation, instructions and breaks
