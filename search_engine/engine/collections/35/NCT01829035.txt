      will be verified in the ITT set and FAS using a stratified log-rank test. Stratification
      factors consist of mUICC stage (III vs. IV), Vascular invasion (none and Vp1-2 vs. Vp3-4 and
      any other presence), Child-Pugh score (5 vs. 6-7), serum AFP level (â‰¥200 ng/mL vs. <200
      ng/mL). The significance level is 5% (one-sided).
