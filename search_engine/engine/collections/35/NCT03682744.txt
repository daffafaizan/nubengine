      cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
      specific for CEA. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by
      intraperitoneal infusion at specific cell doses. One anti-CEA CAR-T dose per patient is
      planned. Additional cycles may be administered at the discretion of the principal
      investigator. Normal peritoneal and tumor biopsies will be obtained at the time of the CAR-T
      infusion, on the final day of the treatment period, and during reporting interval #3.
