      two to address the study's objective of identifying South African men in KwaZulu Natal with
      HIV and maintaining those diagnosed with HIV in care to the point of viral suppression.

      The cluster-randomized design will randomize 8 communities to intervention or control to test
      the hypothesis whether male-centered mobilization and testing increases the population-level
      percentage of men who have been tested within the past 12 months by more than 10 absolute
      percentage points.

      The individually randomized design will test whether individualized case management will
      effectively link HIV-positive men to treatment to the point of viral suppression.

      The study will also examine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the interventions.
