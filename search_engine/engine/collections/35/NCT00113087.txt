      Growth impairment is common in infants and children with congenital heart disease, most often
      in the presence of congestive heart failure and/or cyanosis. Growth failure is noted in many
      infants with a single ventricle who manifest both cyanosis and heart failure that commonly
      persist after palliative surgery. Whether this impairment is related to persistent or
      progressive abnormalities in cardiac structure and function is not known. ACE-Is are widely
      used in the treatment of infants with severe congestive heart failure to improve cardiac
      function and somatic growth. The ability of an ACE-I to improve somatic growth in infants
      with a single ventricle has not been previously studied.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ACE-I in infants
      with a single ventricle. After stratification by ventricular anatomy, neonates will be
      randomly assigned to receive enalapril or placebo and then followed for 14 months.
