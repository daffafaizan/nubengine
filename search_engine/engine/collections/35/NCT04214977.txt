      procedures are commonly performed in prone position as it offers sufficient exposure and
      provides enough surgical space. Choosing the suitable anesthetic technique will help in
      reducing perioperative complications in patients undergoing surgical procedures in prone
      position, by taking into consideration changes in cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology,
      airway management, and proper positioning for the prevention of direct and indirect pressure
      injuries. The aim of this prospective interventional controlled study was to compare the use
      of general anesthesia (GA) using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with spinal anesthesia (SA) in
      anorectal surgeries.
