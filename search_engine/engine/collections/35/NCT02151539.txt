      I. To determine 6-month freedom from treatment failure for second-line therapy for acute
      graft versus host disease (aGVHD).

      II. To show that extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is associated with a superior 6 month (m)
      freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) as compared to other treatment modalities for second
      line therapy for aGVHD.

      III. To describe health care burden in patients receiving second line therapy for acute GVHD.

      IV. Quality of life measurement using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow
      Transplant (FACT-BMT) in patients receiving second line therapy for aGVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      Study data are collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools at
      baseline and on days 5, 28, and 56.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.
