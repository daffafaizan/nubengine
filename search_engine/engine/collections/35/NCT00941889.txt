      study) been developed and approved by the FDA for the prevention of cervical HPV infection
      and cervical cancer, which is associated with infection from this virus. It is unknown
      whether the same vaccine could also be of benefit in treating anogenital warts, which are
      caused by the same virus. This is an important and clinically relevant question which needs
      to be answered. Anal warts have a high prevalence and recurrence and usually require extended
      lengths of treatment and follow-up, especially in the HIV population. At times, treatment of
      anal warts requires multiple surgeries to excise them if the burden of disease is high.
      Therefore, this disease represents a significant expense to patients and the health care
      system.

      Further, the HPV virus that causes anal warts has been associated with anal cancer and with
      its preliminary lesion known as anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). This study touches on
      two important, relevant and costly healthcare issues: finding a better treatment for the most
      common sexually transmitted disease in our country, and helping to prevent anal cancer, which
      is often a fatal disease.
