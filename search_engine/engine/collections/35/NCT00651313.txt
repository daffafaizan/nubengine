      compared with placebo in reducing the severity and onset of primary dysmenorrhea in women
      with recurrent dysmenorrhea.

      The secondary objectives of this study are the following:

        -  to assess the safety of 10% (150 mg) lidocaine gel compared with placebo

        -  to evaluate electrocardiograms (ECGs) for potentially significant QT changes at
           approximate peak lidocaine plasma concentration after 4 days of dosing with 10% (150 mg)
           lidocaine gel.
