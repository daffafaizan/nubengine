    
      Acquire CT data and US and transducer position data (magnetic sensor system) of focal hepatic
      or renal lesions to serve as sample data sets for fusion algorithm development and subsequent
      optimization.

      Optimize image fusion algorithms for use in goal. Develop registration algorithms that result
      in maximal lesional overlap with a clinically relevant difference in an epicenter location of
      ≤ 2 cm for lesional identification and, ultimately ≤ 0.3 cm for interventional procedures.
