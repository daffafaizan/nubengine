      Managing Cancer Online" Internet intervention that will help AWC to better cope with their
      disease, improve their HRQL, and enhance readiness to transition to adult health care using a
      sequential phased approach. The first phase of this project has determined the
      self-management and transitional care needs of adolescents with cancer. The second phase
      consisted of website development and usability testing to ensure the website is easy to use
      and understand, and is efficient and satisfying to complete. Subsequently, we will assess the
      feasibility of the program and the outcomes from the use of the site in a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) pilot study (Phase 3). This will inform the design and methods of the
      main trial, and will permit us to obtain estimates of treatment effects on AWC health
      outcomes to inform the calculation of an appropriate sample size for the future definitive
      RCT (Phase 4). The focus of this study is Phase 3. Phase 4 will be a multicentre randomized
      controlled trial to assess outcomes for teens that complete the intervention as compared to
      those of an attention control group.
