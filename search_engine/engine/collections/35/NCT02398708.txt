      Transplant Program at University of Florida Health Shands Cancer Hospital. After signing
      informed consent, participants will fill out questionnaires and have a blood sample collected
      from a vein in the arm. Participants will be given a stool collection kit with instruction
      and will return the sample via the mail. Data will be collected and securely stored in a
      system used by the cancer center for research. Descriptive statistics will be used to report
      individual, clinical factors, and symptoms.

      Knowledge gained from this study will provide preliminary data for future longitudinal
      studies to examine biological pathways for the development, severity and/or duration of cGVHD
      and symptom outcomes in individuals following allo-HSCT impacting quality of life.
