    
      This is a prospective, open label, randomized, two-arm, multi-center Phase 3 trial.

      Patients with newly diagnosed ITP are randomized 2:1 to receive the experimental treatment,
      eltrombopag, or investigator's choice of 3 standard therapies. The primary objective is to
      determine if the proportion of patients with platelet response is significantly greater in
      patients treated with eltrombopag compared to those treated with standard therapies.
