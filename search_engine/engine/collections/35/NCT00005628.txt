      peptide vaccine in terms of the rate of complete and partial response and time to progression
      in patients with recurrent soft tissue sarcoma. II. Determine the safety and tolerability of
      this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the anti-tumor response to
      this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: At approximately 5 weeks after surgery, patients receive autologous tumor
      cell-derived heat shock protein peptide vaccine intradermally weekly for 4 weeks. Patients
      receive subsequent vaccinations once every 2 weeks for at least 12 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with improving or stable disease or
      without recurrence continue on therapy for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
