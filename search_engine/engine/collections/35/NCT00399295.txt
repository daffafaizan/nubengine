      open-label, three-way crossover study, performed in normal, healthy adults. Each patient
      received orally administered treatments (a different treatment during each dosing phase):
      Treatment A: single dose of Dilaudid SR 16 mg administered under fasting conditions without
      the naltrexone block;Treatment B: single dose of Dilaudid SR 16 mg administered under fed
      conditions without the naltrexone block, Treatment C: single dose of Dilaudid SR 16 mg
      administered under fasting conditions with naltrexone HCL 50mg block (3 oral doses of 50mg
      each administered 12 hours prior to , at the time of, and 12 hours after Dilaudid SR 16mg
      administration). There was a 7-day washout period between dosing phases.

      Venous blood sampling times were 0 (prior to dosing),2,4,6,8,10,12,16,20,24,30,36,42,and 48
      hours after each Dilaudid SR administration. LC/MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography/Mass
      Spectroscopy/Mass Spectroscopy)techniques were employed for the analysis of plasma for
      hydromorphone concentration. Each patient randomly received orally-administered treatments of
      single dose of Dilaudid SR 16mg; under fasting conditions without the naltrexone block; under
      fed conditions without naltrexone block; under fasting conditions with naltrexone 50mg block
      (3 oral doses of 50mg naltrexone HCL each administered 12 hours prior to, at the time of, and
      12 hours after hydromorphone administration); 7-day washout period between dosing phases.
