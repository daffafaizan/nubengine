      divided into two sub-groups. One sub-group weared the particulate filtering respirators for 2
      continuous days during which the respirator was required to wear as much as possible both
      indoor and outdoor. The other group acted as normal at the same time. The measurements on
      health effects including heart rate varibility, blood pressure, circulating biomarkers as
      well as the ambient air pollution were performed in both groups during the intervention
      period. After a 3-week rest period,the two groups interchanged their roles of wearing the
      respirator or not. The same measurements of both health effects indicators and ambient air
      pollution were repeated.
