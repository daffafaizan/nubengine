      treatment with fractional CO2 laser. In addition to the standard of care treatment,
      participants will undergo skin biopsies and be asked to complete Patient Reported Outcome
      Measure questionnaires related to their HTBS. Burn scars will also undergo standard and 3
      dimensional photography at the different stages of treatment. Biopsy samples will undergo
      various staining techniques to establish the changes in tissue that occur with the laser
      treatment. This information will also be correlated with the symptomatic changes.
