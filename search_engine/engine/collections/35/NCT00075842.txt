      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) for improving the quality of
           sleep in patients with cancer receiving adjuvant therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this therapy, in terms of frequency and severity of adverse
           events, in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this therapy on the degree of anxiety, fatigue, and activities
           of daily living in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to type of adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy vs parenteral
      chemotherapy vs oral therapy vs combined modality), age (40 and under vs 41 to 55 vs 56 to 70
      vs over 70), and numerical analogue scale for sleep difficulty (mildly impaired sleep quality
      [4-7] vs moderate or severely impaired sleep quality [8-10]). Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) once daily for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo once daily for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of
           treatment, patients in arm I may receive Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) for an
           additional 8 weeks and patients in arm II may cross over to arm I.

      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, functional outcomes of sleep, brief fatigue inventory, and
      profile of mood states questionnaires are completed at baseline and then at weeks 4, 8, 12,
      and 16.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within approximately 11-22 months.
