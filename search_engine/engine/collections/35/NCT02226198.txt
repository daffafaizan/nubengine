    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, cross-over study of the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability rosuvastatin in children and adolescents (aged 6 to <18
      years) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The study is designed to assess
      the efficacy of rosuvastatin 20 mg compared to placebo on lipids, lipoproteins and
      apolipoproteins in pediatric patients with HoFH. The outcome measures to be assessed include
      low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
      total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, non-HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C,
      apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein A 1 (ApoA-1) and ApoB/ApoA-1 following 6 weeks of
      treatment with rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo. Pharmacokinetic data of the trough plasma
      exposure of rosuvastatin will also be assessed in these pediatric patients with HoFH.
