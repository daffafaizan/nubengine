    
      This is a prospective multicenter phase I followed by a phase II trial designed to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the combination of Pomalidomide with Cyclophosphamide and
      Prednisone in patients with multiple myeloma relapsed and/or refractory to lenalidomide.

      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3 study periods: pre-treatment,
      treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).

      The pre-treatment period includes: screening visits, performed at study entry. After
      providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated
      for study eligibility. The screening period includes the evaluation of inclusion criteria
      described above. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      The treatment period includes: administration of the salvage treatment PCP for 6 cycles and
      maintenance treatment. In order to assess the toxicity of treatment, patients will attend
      study centre visits at least every 2 weeks, unless clinically indicated. The response will be
      assessed after each cycle.

      During the LTFU period, after development of confirmed PD, all patients are to be followed
      for survival every 1-3 months via telephone or office visit.
