      and estrogen levels in postmenopausal women, having a considerable impact on women's life
      quality. Topical hormonal therapy and hormonal replacement are widely used to alleviate VVA
      symptoms. In this context, minimal invasive fractional CO2 laser emerges as an alternative
      non-hormonal therapy, especially in patients that present contraindications to hormonal
      therapy. Objective: Compare fractional CO2 laser treatment, local estrogen therapy and the
      combination of both treatments for VVA and determine the efficacy and possible adverse
      effects CO2 laser treatment. Materials and Methods: Forty-five postmenopausal women will be
      randomized in three double-blinded groups of treatment consisting of CO2 laser and placebo of
      estrogen vaginal cream, placebo of CO2 laser and estrogen vaginal cream and CO2 laser and
      estrogen vaginal cream. Assessment of baseline characteristics and follow-up will be obtained
      through self-completion questionnaires (Female Sex Function Index, International Consultation
      on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF), Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire and
      The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL)). Frost Index and Vaginal Health Index (VHI)
      are part of objective clinical and histologic analyses. Colposcopy, vaginal cytology and
      middle third lateral vaginal wall biopsy will also be performed at baseline and at week 17.
