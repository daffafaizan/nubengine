      that include reduced oxygen and bioreactors. Under these conditions, the cells secrete
      soluble proteins that include both growth factors and soluble precursors to the deposited
      extracellular matrix. Several of these proteins are known to be important in the control of
      the hair cycle and will stimulate resting hair follicles to resume hair formation.
