      senescence-basal modulation of the GnRH-LH unit in any model and particularly in advance age
      men. The present study was therefore designed to assess the response of hypothalamic
      pituitary gonadal axis to kisspeptin administration with increasing age in healthy men.
      Sequential blood samples (2 ml) were obtained for 30 minutes pre and 120 minutes
      post-kisspeptin injection periods at 30 min intervals (-30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120).
      Kisspeptin-10 was administered (1 Âµg/kg BW) as an intravenous bolus, immediately after
      collecting 0 min sample to assess the response of GnRH neurons to kisspeptin-10 with
      increasing age in men by determining plasma levels of LH and testosterone.
