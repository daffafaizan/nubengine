      will be treated with RAD001 for 3-4 weeks to study the effects of the novel agent in relevant
      molecular pathways. The study will also assess the FDG uptake of the tumor at baseline and
      upon completion of therapy (before surgery) with a PET scan. The safety profile of RAD001
      will also be evaluated.

      New agents and regimens are urgently needed for lung cancer treatment. With the development
      of novel agents and small molecules designed to curtail the aggressive aspects of this
      disease, some progress has been realized. However, much more effort and insight will be
      required for further real gains to be made. We propose that studying the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) axis, known to be abnormal in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
      translating that knowledge into therapeutic adjustments can lead to meaningful advances in
      lung cancer treatment.

      Approximately 35 patients will participate at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in
      Atlanta, Georgia.
