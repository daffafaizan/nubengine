      loss that result in impaired mobility, which affects an estimated 75% of people with MS and
      is reported as the most difficult aspect of living with MS. An estimated 900,000 people in
      the U.S. suffer from MS, which has no known cure. In 2012 alone, drug costs to patients with
      MS in the U.S. were $9 billion. Despite the high costs, pharmacological interventions do not
      induce myelination so motor impairments persist. The PI designed a ballet-based program for
      complex motor learning delivered in a group setting. Our previous work provides evidence that
      the targeted ballet program increased balance and walking scores by 42% and decreased
      clinical ataxia scores by 58% over a period of 16 weeks and 32 hours of instruction. However,
      understanding these changes requires determining whether there are underlying changes in the
      brain after participation in the targeted ballet program.

      The goal of this proposal is to provide evidence of improvements in brain connectivity
      measures after participation in the targeted ballet program in persons with MS. As secondary
      outcomes, we will assess motor function and wellness after participation in the targeted
      ballet program in persons with MS.
