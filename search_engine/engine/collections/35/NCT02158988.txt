      metastasized gastric cancer including carcinoma of the AEG (Adenocarcinoma of the
      oesophago-gastric-junction) without evidence of other distant metastases treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cytoreduction with intraperitoneal chemoperfusion
      (HIPEC) and postoperative chemotherapy (Group B) and patients treated with cytoreduction
      alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy (Group A).

      Hypothesis of the trial is that surgical cytoreduction with intraperitoneal chemoperfusion
      (Group B) is superior to cytoreduction alone (Group A) in terms of overall survival.

      The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, open, multicenter and parallel group
      study.
