    
      The study is a registry study based on data from the Swedish Perioperative Registry (SPOR)
      during the years 2016-2022 with the aim to explore the risk for postoperative nausea and
      vomiting at the recovery unit (early PONV).

      Almost all hospitals in Sweden report surgical procedures to SPOR and for the years 2016-2019
      there are almost 1.7 million procedures in the registry for patients >18years. Data will be
      extracted from SPOR on a yearly basis and results will be reported on selected cohorts (time
      periods and/or type of surgical procedure) during the study period.

      There is an option for hospitals to register nausea and vomiting occurring at the recovery
      unit and submit the data to SPOR. If a hospital choose to use the variable in their dataset,
      all patients at their unit needs to be registered either with [No_Nausea or Vomiting],
      [Nausea] or [Nausea or Vomiting]. In the year 2019, more than 50% of procedures under
      anesthesia in the registry had registration of PONV. The strength with this system is that if
      a unit uses the variable, all cases will be classified either as "noPONV" or "PONV".

      The investigators aim to use the variable PONV at the recovery unit to describe the risk for
      early PONV and explore associated factors in several cohorts of surgical procedures in
      Sweden.

      The first dataset (2016-2018) was sent to the investigators from the SPOR registry in May
      2019 and during the period June 2019- May 2020, the dataset was used to build up a model for
      the analysis of data with a preliminary report of elective surgeries in Sweden the year 2017.

      An updated dataset (all cases 2016-2019) was retrieved from SPOR on June 3 2020 and further
      analysis and reporting is based on the most updated dataset (yearly basis).
