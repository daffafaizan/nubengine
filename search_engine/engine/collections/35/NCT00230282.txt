      mg/m2/d IV and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/d SC in previously untreated CLL patients.
      Participants received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days 1, 2, and 3 of six 28-day
      cycles, followed by a no-treatment rest period (observation) for 3 to 12 weeks.

      Responders entered a no-treatment rest period (observation) for 3 to 8 weeks, then depending
      on status, continued on follow-up or on-study to receive Campath stating at 3 mg/day with the
      dose adjusted to the maximum tolerated dose.
