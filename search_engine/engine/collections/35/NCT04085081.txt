      I. Administer and determine the feasibility of the perioperative physical activity
      intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe patient and family caregiver outcome patterns and trajectory pre- and
      post-intervention.

      II. Using qualitative methods, evaluate the acceptability of the intervention through brief,
      semi-structured interviews with patients and family caregivers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and family caregivers complete comprehensive geriatric and functional assessments
      before surgery. This information is used to develop a personalized walking program plus
      simple lower extremity strength exercises. The intervention is administered by trained
      coaches with physical and occupational therapy background. The sessions are delivered by
      telephone before surgery (30-60 minutes), and on days 2, 7, 14, and 21 after hospital
      discharge (20-50 minutes). Participants will also receive brief motivational text or email
      messages (4 times per week between telephone sessions) to provide support, promote physical
      activity behavior change, and to sustain participant engagement.

      Patients and family caregivers are followed up to day 30 after hospital discharge.
