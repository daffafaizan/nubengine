      conducted at multiple sites. The composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine to be
      used in this study includes a mix of recombinant H1, H3, and two B hemagglutinin proteins
      expressed as VLPs for the 2018-2019 influenza virus strains.

      Approximately 12,120 healthy male and female subjects aged 65 years and older will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two parallel treatment groups, such that approximately
      6,060 subjects will receive the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine at a dose of 30 Î¼g/strain
      and approximately 6,060 subjects will receive the comparator. Within the two treatment
      groups, subjects will be stratified by site and two age groups (65-74 years of age and 75
      years of age and older in a 2:1 ratio).

      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately eight to ten months, during which a
      first visit will be scheduled on Day 0 for screening and vaccine administration.
