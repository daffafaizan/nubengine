      concentration following oral administration of 34 minutes and a half-life of 20-40 minutes.
      Peak serum concentration for vaginal administration is 60-80 minutes, this level being
      sustained for up to four hours. Although the direct local effect of vaginal administration on
      cervical ripening may be advantageous, the shorter half-life of oral delivery may be
      beneficial in the event of uterine hyperstimulation.In order to avoid uterine
      hyperstimulation, it appears reasonable to suggest that oral misoprostol should be
      administered in small, frequent doses, titrated against the uterine response.
