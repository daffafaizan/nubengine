      to study melanoma in families lacking mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2
      (CDKN2A), or the cyclin-dependant kinase 4 (CDK4) genes. CDKN2 and CDK4 are both genes that
      encode presumed tumor suppressor genes, mutant forms of which are known to cause increased
      susceptibility to melanoma. The purpose of the present study then is to confirm the existence
      of and to identify additional gene(s) involved in heritable melanoma (cutaneous and ocular)
      and their precursor lesions (atypical nevi) by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies.
      It is clear that the risk to develop atypical nevi and/or melanoma is strongly influenced by
      genetic and environmental factors (e.g. sun exposure). Characterization of such genes could
      provide important insights into the inheritance, pathogenesis, and treatment of this
      increasingly important disease.
