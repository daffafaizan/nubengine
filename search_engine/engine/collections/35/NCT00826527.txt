      obstructive and irritative urinary symptoms. In the last few years, photovaporization of the
      prostate has emerged as a popular teatment for this problem. This outpatient procedure uses a
      GeenLight KTP laser manufactured by Laserscope to vaporize the obstructing aspects of the
      prostatic urethral tissue to create a central cavity. After obstruction is relieved , it is
      not uncommon for a patient to be left with the irritative symptoms of frequency, urgency and
      nocturia, either from the procedure itself in the short-term or due to changes that develop
      in the bladder due to the long-standing obstruction. Clinical experience with this procedure
      indicates that after the mechanical obstruction of the prostate is relieved, medical therapy
      with an antimuscarinic agent should be able to alleviate these irritative urinary symptoms
      without the risk of urinary retention. By adding solifenacin in the early post operative
      period ( 2-12 weeks)for the subset of patients still experiencing irritative symptoms,
      further improvements in bladder symptoms my be achieved.
