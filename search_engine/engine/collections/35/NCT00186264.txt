      begin at 37.5 mg/day and be gradually increased to a maximum of 225 mg/day. The dose may be
      kept as low as 75 mg/day if necessary. Study doctor will be assessing mood to determine if
      some patients respond more quickly than the several weeks often required for an
      antidepressant to begin working. On the first day of treatment with Venlafaxine XR,
      participant will be randomly assigned (similar to a flip of a coin) to receive hydrocortisone
      15 mg /day or placebo for two days. Placebo is an inactive substance, like a sugar pill. This
      dose of hydrocortisone is less than a typical replacement dose for patients who are not
      producing cortisol (hydrocortisone) naturally. The hydrocortisone is administered
      intravenously (in a vein) over the course of 2 hours for two consecutive days. Neither
      participant nor study doctor will know which treatment participant is receiving. However,
      this information is available to study doctor if it is needed.
