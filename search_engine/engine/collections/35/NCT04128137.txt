      depression in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The study is randomised
      versus placebo.Each patient will be followed for a maximum of 5 months, with no more than 8
      visits to the investigator (V0 at Day-7, V1 at D0, V2 at D7, V3 at D+14, V4 at D+21, V5 at D+
      28, V6 at D+56 and V7 only for patients on the FLU arm at D+140.

      The presence of a comparator control group with placebo permits to evaluate the efficacy and
      the tolerance of FLU independently of the natural evolution of the pathology, in patients
      benefiting from a non-drug or possibly medicated treatment (midodrine) but insufficient.
