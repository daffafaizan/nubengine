      hepatocellular carcinoma despite the tumour's inherent radiosensitivity. The major challenge
      has been improving radiation delivery without exceeding dose limits of the surrounding normal
      liver. Recent technological advances with tumour localization and targeting, imaging,
      treatment planning and delivery have allowed for safe delivery of radiation with tumorcidal
      effect and minimal treatment-related toxicity.

      This study has three specific aims:

      1. To develop, validate, and quality test HDR Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) Gated
      RapidArc technique for application in human liver tumours. And furthermore, to test whether
      HDR SBRT Gated RapidArc can be efficiently and safely delivered to a very large patient
      population previously ineligible for any therapy (HCC patients with tumours >5cm).

      3. To determine if 11C-choline/18F-FDG CT-PET or perfusion CT imaging (that characterize
      changes in tumour proliferation, glycolysis, and vasculature, respectively) can provide
      practical non-invasive biomarkers of tumour response, local tumour control, or normal tissue
      toxicity.

      4. To determine if immunologic studies of pre- and post-treatment blood samples can provide
      biomarkers of tumour response, local and systemic tumour control, or triggers for normal
      tissue toxicity.
