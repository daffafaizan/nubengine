    
      This is a two-part Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label study of MM-151 plus MM-121, MM-141,
      or trametinib in patients with advanced, heregulin-positive lung, head and neck, and
      colorectal cancers. In part 1 of the study, cohorts of 3 or more patients will be treated at
      escalating doses of MM-151 in combination with MM-121, MM-141, and trametinib until a maximum
      tolerated combination dose for each combination is identified. In part 2 of the study,
      patients will be treated with the combination dose identified in part 1 of the study.
