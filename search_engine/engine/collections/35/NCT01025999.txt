      in 84% of cases, typically within a few days to weeks after surgery. Mounting evidence
      indicates that this dramatic phenomenon results from effects beyond those related to weight
      loss and reduced caloric intake alone. The mechanisms mediating the weight-independent
      anti-diabetes impact of RYGB are unknown, and elucidating them could lead to new diabetes
      medicines. Human subjects will undergo frequently sampled I.V. glucose tolerance tests
      (FS-IVGTT) and tracer-enhanced hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamps (to measure insulin
      secretion and sensitivity) before RYBG and 3 times in the first six weeks afterward, during
      which the proximal small bowel will either be excluded from nutrient contact or exposed to
      nutrients delivered through an indwelling gastric cannula. We hypothesize that nutrient
      delivery to the proximal GI tract will reverse RYGB-mediated improvements in glucose
      homeostasis, possibly in association with changes in nutrient-regulated gut peptides involved
      in glucose control. Our study will allow us to test the upper intestinal hypothesis
      rigorously in man, and whether the hypothesis is confirmed or refuted, we will gain valuable
      new insights into the mechanisms of improved glucose control early after RYGB.
