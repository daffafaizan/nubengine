      will not see the blood volume measurement results. In the experimental group, the physician
      will be given the blood volume measurement results. Ultrafiltration is performed based on the
      results of blood volume measurement in the experimental group followed by repeat blood volume
      analysis after 30 minutes of the completion of ultrafiltration. Clinical and laboratory
      assessment as per the standard of care will be used to assess overall fluid status, and blood
      volume measurement results will be used as the assessment of intravascular fluid. These
      assessments will be used to determine a goal quantity of fluid to be removed. All subjects
      will return for a clinical assessment at 30 and 90 days and laboratory data will be drawn at
      that time to evaluate renal functional indices, electrolytes and blood volume measurements.
