    
      This is a prospective, interventional pilot study that plans to enroll 15 patients who are
      receiving salvage high dose chemo and bone marrow transplant for relapsed Germ cell Cancer
      (rGCC). Patients will be asked to go through a series of surveys and screening procedures to
      determine eligibility. Once enrolled, patients will receive music therapy while they are
      being treated either inpatient or outpatient for their standard of care treatments.

      Primary Objective To evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and compliance to a
      mHNMT in patients with CIT and rGCC admitted to BMT service to undergo salvage high-dose
      chemotherapy with tandem bone marrow rescue.

      Secondary Objectives To estimate the effects of mHNMT on severity of CIT, associated
      distress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, benefit findings, sleep, and audiometry measures and
      assess number of times homework completed.
