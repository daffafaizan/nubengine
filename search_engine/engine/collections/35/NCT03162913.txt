      parameters of brain aging, as well as age-related motor and cognitive deficits when fed to
      aged rats. They have shown that strawberry, in particular, can reduce oxidative stress and
      pro-inflammatory signaling in the brain and improve both mobility and cognition. A recent
      study also found that the addition of two servings of strawberry per day for 3 months could
      significantly improve verbal and spatial memory among healthy older adults, particularly on
      tests with high cognitive demand. These effects may reflect the direct effects of
      strawberries' bioactive and neuroavailable polyphenols on brain signaling or their indirect
      effects through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways. However, participants in that
      study were selected from a healthy aging population, which made it difficult to detect
      changes in balance, mobility, and the less complex cognitive tasks. Therefore, the
      investigators are proposing the current study to assess the effects of dietary strawberry on
      mobility and cognition among a compromised population, obese older adults, who are at
      increased risk for cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative disease. The risk for
      heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer and dementia increases in direct relation to
      overweight and obesity measures, and research now shows that obesity is a primary cause of
      mental deterioration among the middle-aged and senior populations. In this study, obese older
      adults (55-75yo, BMI 30-36) will consume 24g/d freeze-dried strawberry or control powder for
      3 months and complete a battery of lifestyle, mobility, and cognitive tests at 3 time points.
      The investigators hypothesize that supplementing obese older adults' diet with strawberry
      will improve performance on complex tasks involving mobility and cognition.
