      divided to MS group and manual (MA) group. In MS group, MS grips the SHVC and IHVC,
      respectively. MS's magnets are adsorbed on the wall of the basin and MS can pull the HVC
      accordingly. By changing the position of MS on the wall of the basin, the attending can
      expose the surgical field that make the operation convenient. In MA group, assistants use
      vessel forceps to pull the HVC according to the attending's requirements. In both groups,
      right adrenal vein, phrenic veins and other branches of the HVC are isolated and ligated,
      then SHVC and IHVC where MS's clamps gripped are cut off. After preparation, the SHVC and
      IHVC remain at least 1.5 cm. Excess diaphragms are removed. Outcomes of two groups are
      compared.
