    
      This is a longitudinal observational study. It is a 24-month study with the possibility of
      extending the data time points. Visits will occur monthly. However, at the discretion of the
      PI, subjects may not be required to return monthly. These subjects may return at intervals
      ranging from 2 months to a max of 6 months apart.

      In the situation that the subjects would fall out of the inclusion criteria or not be
      eligible for the LGMD2E gene therapy trial, they will be given the opportunity to roll over
      into the Natural History for LGMD (IRB17-01086). If a subject is invited to screen for the
      gene therapy trial they will discontinue this trial. By being in this study, it is not a
      guarantee that subjects will be invited to screen for the LGMD2E gene therapy trial.
