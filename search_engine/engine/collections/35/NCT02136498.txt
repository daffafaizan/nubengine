      intervention is designed to help smokers better manage issues known to reduce treatment
      adherence (withdrawal symptoms, medication side-effects, low motivation, and inadequate
      behavioral skills for medication adherence) and to facilitate greater communication between
      patients and providers so clinicians can provide appropriate oversight of medication use,
      intervene when medically necessary, and address patient concerns that may otherwise lead to
      non-adherence or early treatment termination.
