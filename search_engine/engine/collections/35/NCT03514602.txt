      lactation on preventing rapid infant adiposity gain. Investigators propose a randomized,
      controlled experiment among smoking pregnant women from 1st prenatal care visit through 6
      months of postpartum period. Two-phase randomization will be applied to separate the effects
      of smoking cessation in two different critical periods (i.e., pregnancy and lactation) on
      infant adiposity gain. Investigators will first randomly assign 40 smoking pregnant women
      into either the multicomponent intervention (N=30) or the education-only control group
      (N=10). The multicomponent intervention group will receive education and counseling,
      monitoring and feedback, contingent financial incentives, and family support, while the
      control group will receive education only. At the end of pregnancy, investigators will
      further randomize successful quitters (estimated N=20) from the multi-component intervention
      group into either the continuous multi-component intervention group in lactation (N=10) or
      the education-only control group (N=10). All women and their newborns will be followed from
      enrollment to 6 months postpartum.The key outcomes include maternal smoking abstinence
      confirmed by urine-cotinine and infant gain in weight-for-length z-score. Specific Aim 1 is
      to examine the effects of maternal smoking cessation intervention in pregnancy on infant gain
      in weight-for-length z-score from birth to 6 months. Specific Aim 2 is to examine the effect
      of maternal smoking abstinence intervention in lactation and infant post-weaning gain in
      weight-for-length z-score among the women who have successfully quit smoking in pregnancy.
