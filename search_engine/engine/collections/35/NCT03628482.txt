      obtained from all patients. Current randomized controlled trial included patients with grade
      3-4 gonarthritis suffering from intractable knee pain, scoring â‰¥5 on the Visual Analog Scale
      (VAS) during >6 months. Therapy was based on ultrasound guided radiofrequency treatment of
      the superior medial, superior lateral and inferior medial genicular nerves. VAS and Western
      Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthrosis (WOMAC) scores were assessed before therapy
      and at 1, 6 and 12 months following intervention. Eligible patients were randomized in two
      treatment groups according to the modality of radiofrequency current to which targeted
      genicular nerves had to be exposed, i.e, the pulsed and the continuous radiofrequency groups.
      Both two way repeated measures analysis of variance and generalized estimating equations were
      used to determine whether the VAS and WOMAC scores obtained with either the continuous or the
      pulsed radiofrequency modalities at each of the 4 times of assessment, i.e. at pre-treatment
      control and at 1, 6 and 12 months after the intervention, were different.
