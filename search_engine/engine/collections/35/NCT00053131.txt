        -  Compare amounts of dendritic cells and leukemia-associated antigen-specific T
           lymphocytes in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia treated with filgrastim (G-CSF) vs sargramostim (GM-CSF) after
           high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      All patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 1 hour twice daily on days 1-6 and
      mitoxantrone IV over 30 minutes on days 2-4. On day 6, patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily until blood counts
           recover in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily as in arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.
