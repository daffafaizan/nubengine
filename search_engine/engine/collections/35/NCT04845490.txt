      cancer combined with cytoreductive surgery (CRS). Further, there have been more than 20 years
      for CRS + HIPEC applying in treatment of patients with colorectal cancer peritoneal
      metastasis. While, to date, the kinds, doses, combinations of HIPEC drugs are not clearly
      been evaluate a criterion for local advanced colorectal cancer patients. Thus, This study aim
      to compare the efficacy of Mitomycin and Lobaplatin in the treatment of advanced colorectal
      cancer patients with radical surgery combined with HIPEC. We plan to recruit 201 patients and
      divide into 3 groups, 2 drug groups and 1 control group, radomly. all patients with advanced
      co cancer receive radical surgery + HIPEC + mFOLFOX6/XELOX chemotherapy regimen. the mainly
      experimental variable is HIPEC drugs and three groups employ Mitomycin, Lobaplatin and none
      respectively. the endpoints of study include peritoneal metastasis, overall survival, immune
      status and perioperative safety assessment.
