      surgery at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital. If patients agree to participate in this clinical trial,
      patient's data (such as age, body mass index, preoperative findings, laboratory findings,
      radiologic findings, operative findings, pathologic findings, postoperative findings) will be
      collected in a research database. The research database will be updated, every 6 month, to
      include data on patient's disease outcome and follow-up care. Although most data will be
      collected form the medical record, patient may agin be contacted so that researchers can
      collection some data if it is not in the medical record.
