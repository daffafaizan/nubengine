    
      Forty amputee patients will be evaluated for satisfaction with the prosthesis, pressure
      repartition pattern and functional capabilities.

      Pressure at the stump-socket interface will be recorded using a set of 14 single cells
      sensors placed in predefined positions onto the stump. Pattern of pressure will be measured
      in four tasks: sitting posture, standing posture, gait initiation, and gait at preferred
      velocity.

      Reproducibility of the pressure repartition pattern will be analyzed by repeating gait and
      standing posture task in the first 15 patients included.

      In patients whom prosthesis has been modified on the basis on the first pressure measurement
      (pressure peak and bad functional capacities), a new pressure measurement will be repeated
      2-8 weeks apart.

      Postural and gait abilities will be also assessed in 40 age/gender matched non-amputated
      subjects to serve as control data.
