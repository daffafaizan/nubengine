      feasibility of prostatic artery embolization. Fifty adult male subjects will be enrolled and
      treated in this study. Patients who provide informed consent and are deemed eligible for
      participation will undergo prostatic artery embolization in the Interventional Radiology
      department at the University of Virginia. After performing an angiogram to identify the
      prostatic arteries, tiny particles known as Embozene Microspheres will be injected into the
      prostatic artery. Injecting these particles into the prostatic artery will slow blood flow to
      the prostate and thus shrinking the size of the prostate. By shrinking the size of the
      prostate, it is hopeful that it will provide relief of lower urinary tract symptoms due to
      BPH. Subjects will be followed for 2 years as part of their participation in this study.
