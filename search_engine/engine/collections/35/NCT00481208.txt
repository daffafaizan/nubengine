      been implicated to be one of the important factors to affect visual field progression.
      However, there was no study to investigate them in medically well-controlled open-angle
      glaucoma patients. So we want to find the unique patterns.

      Study 1. Subjects : Patients with medically well controlled open angle glaucoma Method : IOP
      and peripapillary retinal blood flow were measured for 24 hours. The relationship between the
      two were studied.

      Study 2. Of the patients enrolled in study 1 , those on the same medical regimen for both
      eyes were analyzed for the presence of a latent asymmetric IOP and it's influence and
      association with visual field and diurnal IOP fluctuation.
