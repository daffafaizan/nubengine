      education styles do not teach patients in the best way as they are not consistent with how
      people of all ages currently learn (through technology). In addition, patienteaching most
      commonly occurs during highly stressful times like hospital visits with new diagnoses.
      Current patient educational methods are costly given the amount of health provider time
      required.

      Electronic KITE teaching modules are infographic visual representations that have been
      developed to provide patient teaching related to warfarin and its management.

      How much patients have learned will be assessed using the KIDCLOT validated knowledge
      quizzes. Children 8 years and older to have cognitive capacity will complete the quizzes if
      able. Caregivers will complete all quizzes linked with the modules they have completed.

      Patients may be enrolled into the appropriate cohort based on the health provider decision
      for management.

        1. Warfarin international normalized ratio (INR) testing

        2. Warfarin with home INR testing

        3. Warfarin transition from home INR testing to warfarin self management.
