      perfluorinated gas mixed with oxygen as an exogenous inert contrast agent to image the airway
      spaces in normal and diseased human lungs. This is an open label proof of concept study
      expanding on work by other groups in animals and ex-vivo human lungs and on studies in human
      subjects with such gases. Projection images (2-dimensional) and 3D images will be obtained
      using 19F MRI coupled with spirometry breathing maneuvers to correlate spirometry variables
      (e.g. FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) with regional distribution of the gas.
