      5 days post-surgery and offered to be enrolled. If agreed to participate, they will be fitted
      with a blinded CGM monitor (Dexcom G6 PRO) as soon as they are awake and alert after the
      surgery. They will continue to have their blood glucose check as usual in the ICU and on
      surgical floors with POC glucometers. On discharge, or at the end of the first CGM sensor
      life, the sensor will be removed and sensor data will be analyzed. CGM data will be compared
      with Point-of-Care blood glucose monitoring obtained in the hospital.
