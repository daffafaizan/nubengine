    
      This is a phase II multicenter study designed in two phases. A total of 32 patients will be
      included in 10 hospitals belonging to the Spanish Group for Research in Sarcomas (GEIS).
      Selection criteria are: patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma from the extremities or
      trunk with high-risk features (>5 cm and grade 2-3), or recurrences after prior inadequate
      surgery. The treatment schedule will be: initial biopsy, 3 cycles of high-dose Ifosfamide, 12
      gr/m2 in 5 days, concurrent with Radiotherapy 50 Gy, and subsequent wide surgery. To assess
      the predictive factors of response to the combination therapy, DNA and RNA extraction will be
      performed on the pretreatment biopsies. DNA will be used to hybridize Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®
      Human Mapping 500K Array, which allows for the study of 500000 SNPs throughout the genome.
      The expression of 39000 RNA transcripts will be evaluated employing the Affymetrix Genechip
      Human Genome HG-U133 Plus 2.0, and validated by real-time RT-PCR.
