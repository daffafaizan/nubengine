    
      This is a Phase II multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, vehicle-controlled, parallel
      group study of photodynamic therapy in organ transplant recipient subjects for treatment of
      AK and the reduction of new NMSC.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of the following two treatment groups (1:1) to receive
      topical Levulan® Kerastick® containing 20% aminolevulinic acid HCL (ALA, active study drug)
      or the Kerastick® containing vehicle ingredients only (VEH).

        -  Group 1 will have ALA applied to the entire scalp OR both forearms 90 +/- 30 minutes
           prior to BLUE light treatment for 16 minutes 40 seconds

        -  Group 2 will have VEH applied to the entire scalp OR both forearms 90 +/- 30 minutes
           prior to BLUE light treatment for 16 minutes 40 seconds

      Treatment Area (scalp or both forearms) must have had at least 2 NMSC in the past 12 months,
      and must include a continuous 25 cm2 Target Area containing a minimum of 3 AKs, to be
      eligible for treatment

      Each subject may receive up to nine treatments. The initial four (4) ALA-PDT/VEH-PDT
      treatments will be given at 4-5 week intervals, with the remaining five (5) treatments given
      every 6 +/-1 weeks. Post-treatment follow-up visit will be scheduled to occur 4 weeks after
      the subject's final PDT.
