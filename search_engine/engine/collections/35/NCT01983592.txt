      adult who is undergoing any type of chemotherapy administered intermittently (i.e. not
      continuously). The participant will have a homeopathic consultation within 3 days of a round
      of chemotherapy ("treatment period") and will be administered either verum or placebo
      according to a binary randomization allocation sequence unknown to both the clinician and
      participant. During the subsequent treatment period the participant will be given the other
      allocation (verum or placebo). The following pairs of allocations will also be randomized
      with treatment continuing for as long as the participant is undergoing chemotherapy
      treatment.
