      most common surgical techniques performed in the oral cavity. Conscious intravenous sedation
      could be administered for the patients to provide anxiolysis, sedation, and analgesia for the
      patient. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) which reflect stress-related changes in the autonomic
      nervous system (ANS), has been proposed as a non-invasive stress biomarker. The aim of the
      present study was to investigate whether salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels could be
      decreased by conscious sedation in the patients undergoing impacted third molar extraction. A
      total of 18 male patients were recruited. All patients were administered Modified Dental
      Anxiety Scale (MDAS) test. Patients were divided into two groups: test group (procedures
      under sedation) and control group (procedures under local anesthesia). The following
      parameters were monitored at different study time-points: systolic blood pressure (SBP),
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP), oxygen saturation (SO2), and heart rate (HR). Five samples of
      saliva were taken from each patient: the first time patient came to clinic, the patient sat
      in the chair for extraction, before local anesthesia, immediately after extraction, at 4 h
      after extraction. The concentrations of sAA were measured and compared across the different
      stages of the study between two groups.
