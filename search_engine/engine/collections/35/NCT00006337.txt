      blockade on parkinsonian symptoms and levodopa-associated motor response complications in
      patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In a controlled clinical trial, efficacy will be
      assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored by
      means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
