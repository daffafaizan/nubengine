    
      Prospective analysis of biopsies from 10 patients with local recurrence in the prostate
      selected for salvage HDR brachytherapy in MAASTRO Clinic, Maastricht. HDR treatment is
      standard in Maastro Clinic for local relapses of prostate cancer after previously irradiation
      (internal or external).

      Biopsies will be taken at 4 different time points (before and after the 1st fraction; before
      the 2nd and 3rd fraction of the salvage treatment).

      Several immunotyping (expression of PD-(L)-1, CXCL12, IL-23 receptor, etc.) and HLA class I
      expression will be performed on the biopsies. In addition, HLA genotypes will be determined
      on DNA isolated from pheripheral blood.

      The plasma and the biopsies will be stored for eventually additional research.
