    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine agreement between three different types of temperature-measuring instruments:
           the temporal artery scanner, the digital oral thermometer, and the infrared tympanic
           thermometer calibrated to an oral setting, in pediatric patients who are febrile and
           afebrile.

      Secondary

        -  Determine similarities or differences in the percent of fevers detected with oral, ear,
           and temporal artery monitoring in these pediatric patients.

        -  Determine differences in agreement of the various temperature devices in non-neutropenic
           pediatric patients versus neutropenic pediatric patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      During an afebrile episode, the patient's temperature is measured twice using the following 3
      devices: a temporal artery scanner, a digital oral thermometer, and an infrared tympanic
      thermometer calibrated to an oral setting (total of 6 temperature measurements per afebrile
      episode).

      During a febrile episode, the patient's temperature is measured twice using all 3 devices as
      above, and then at 2 and 4 hours after administration of an antipyretic medication (total of
      18 temperatures per febrile episode).

      Patients' temperatures are recorded for a maximum of 3 afebrile or febrile episodes.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
