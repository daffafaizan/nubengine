      I. Determine the efficacy of interleukin-12 (IL-12) by evaluating its effect on remission
      duration after response to second line chemotherapy with ifosfamide and etoposide in patients
      with HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Determine the safety of IL-12 when administered as maintenance therapy in these patients.

      III. Evaluate overall survival of this patient population. IV. Evaluate serum and tissue
      cytokine levels in these patients. V. Evaluate the effect of IL-12 on HIV viral load and on
      functional T-cell assays in these patients.

      VI. Evaluate the effect of IL-12 on Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) viral load in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study.

      All patients receive ifosfamide IV by continuous infusion for 2 days, etoposide IV over 2
      hours daily on days 1 and 2, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 4-13.
      Courses are repeated every 21 days. Patients who have complete or partial remission after a
      minimum of 4 courses of chemotherapy receive maintenance therapy consisting of interleukin-12
      SC twice weekly beginning on day 28 of the final chemotherapy course and continuing for 6
      months or until disease progression. All patients also receive combination antiretroviral
      therapy during study.

      Patients are followed every month for one year, then every 2 months thereafter.
