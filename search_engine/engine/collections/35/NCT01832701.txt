      acids) and bioavailability of these bioactive compounds is now somewhat well understood.
      However, even if chlorogenic acids are known to be antioxidants in the cup, reliable evidence
      remains to be observed in vivo.

      After medical examination and approval, subjects will undergo 2 periods of 21 days. The first
      7 days will consist of a dietary restriction to lower the polyphenols intake. Then subjects
      will drink at random one of the three treatments for 14 days (4 cups/day). Blood and urine
      samples will be collected throughout the study to evaluate in vivo effects on oxidative
      biomarkers. Furthermore, at day 21, subjects will undergo a physical regimen to increase
      acutely and transiently their oxidative damage. Blood and urine samples collected throughout
      this challenge will allow us to evaluate the effect of coffee intake in reducing oxidative
      damage created by exercise compared to placebo.
