      that results in progressive deterioration of social comportment, executive function, and
      language. Despite the debilitating nature of FTD and the relatively high prevalence in the
      younger patient population, available pharmacological interventions are limited to
      symptomatic treatments. There are no therapeutic agents that have been developed that
      specifically treat the progressive cognitive symptoms of FTD. This project will study IN
      insulin in FTD in 12 patients. Investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of the EXAMINER
      cognitive battery as a cognitive outcome measure in FTD, the ability of the HealthPartners
      Center for Memory and Aging's Center's ability to sufficiently recruit subjects with FTD, and
      the safety of IN regular insulin administered 20 IU twice per day in two specific variants of
      FTD (behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), semantic dementia (SD)) over a 4
      week period. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with its multiple pathological manifestations, is
