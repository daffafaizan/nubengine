      make oncologic emergencies requiring prompt drainage. In lung cancer patients, MPE is one of
      the most unpleasant terminal events. Drainage usually results in prompt palliation of
      symptoms, but recurrent effusions often occur. Sclerosis with pericardial instillation of
      various agents is reported to prevent the recurrence, and bleomycin is the most commonly used
      drug, with fewer toxicities compared with others. There is, however, no prospective trial of
      pericardial sclerosis as compared with drainage alone for MPEs, and it is far from clear
      whether sclerosis really benefits these patients in terminal stages.

      Comparison: Intra-pericardial instillation of bleomycin after pericardial drainage versus
      drainage alone for MPEs caused by lung cancer.
