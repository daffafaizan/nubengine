    
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-dose open-label, cross-over study in 76 healthy
      males and females in total. The investigational products (IPs), i.e., Nicorette Extra Mint
      Gum 2 and 4 mg, and Nicorette Mint Gum 2 and 4 mg, will be given as single doses at separate
      treatment visits. Investigational treatments will be separated by at least 36 hours.

      Blood samples for determination of nicotine will be drawn pre-dose (within 5 minutes of
      administering, i.e., start of chewing) and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, as well
      as 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 hours after start of administration.

      Used gums will be collected and analyzed to determine the amount of remaining nicotine.

      Any Adverse Events (AEs) that may occur will be registered.
