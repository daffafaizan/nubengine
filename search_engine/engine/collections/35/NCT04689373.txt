    
      Background and objectives:

      Nowadays, operations under fluoroscopy are performed at increasing rates with the aim of
      increasing case management and surgical success. Due to this increasing exposure to
      radiation, it is important to show that fluoroscopy has an impact on employees not only
      annually but also daily. The researchers will perform this study to reveal the clinical
      meaning of fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and impaired cognitive functions that are often
      expressed verbally in healthcare workers who are exposed to fluoroscopy.

      Methods:

      After obtaining written informed consent; 84 samples consisting of orthopedic surgery and
      anesthesia residents and orthopedic operating room nurses between the ages of 18-60 who do
      not have cardiological, neurological and psychiatric diseases, have had fluoroscopic
      operations lasting more than 2 hours, wear protective scopy gowns and collar during surgery,
      will be included in the study. The total number of samples required for the study will be
      reached by taking repeated measurements on consecutive days from the same sample group, but
      not on the same day. For operating room employees who meet the criteria determined before and
      after the operation; mini-mental state examination, weight, heart rate, non-invasive blood
      pressure value, VAS score for headache, radiation exposure time on fluoroscopy device, Rad
      measurement with the help of personal dosimeter before and after surgery, and total time in
      the operating room will be recorded. This prospective study will be executed between December
      2020 and June 2021.
