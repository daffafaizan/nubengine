      (FS-LASIK)has been a popular ophthalmic procedure for the correction of refractive error.
      This first all-in-one FS-laser system was designed to perform the refractive lenticule
      extraction (ReLEx) procedures, femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx).They have the same
      feature: corneal flap.

      Ocular surface disruption during corneal refractive surgery is commonly considered to be
      closely related to the development of dry eye. Multiple etiologies contribute to this ocular
      surface disruption, including the flap creation and stromal ablation involved in previous
      refractive surgery techniques. Corneal nerve damage has been considered the main cause of dry
      eye, due to disrupted afferent sensory nerves, reduced blink reflex, and increased tear
      evaporation leading to tear film instability. In addition, postoperative inflammatory
      mediator fluctuations are also a key factor related to ocular surface damage. Extensive
      research has described the effects of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in modulating
      corneal wound healing, cell migration, and apoptosis on the ocular surface after refractive
      surgery.

      This prospective clinical study is going to assess the short-term changes in ocular surface
      measures and tear inflammatory mediators after lenticule extraction (FLEx) and femtosecond
      laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) procedures.
