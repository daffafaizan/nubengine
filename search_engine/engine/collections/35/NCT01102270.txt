      cardiovascular consequences. The current primary treatment e.g. Continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) is effective but poorly tolerated by many patients particularly those with
      mild-moderate disease. Secondary treatments such as oral appliances to advance the mandible
      or surgical procedures to enlarge the airway are commonly appealing to the patient. However,
      these approaches have only modest success in reducing apnea frequency to an acceptable level.
      Thus, finding tolerable and effective therapy for sleep apnea remains an important objective.

      The causes of sleep apnea vary between patients. Targeted therapy according to the underlying
      causes of sleep apnea in individual patients is likely to be most effective. However, current
      therapeutic options for sleep apnea are quite limited. The purpose of this physiological
      research study is to determine if taking eszopiclone (Lunesta)changes the breathing effort
      required to briefly wake people with obstructive sleep apnea from sleep (the arousal
      threshold) and if administration of the sedative medication eszopiclone (Lunesta) to certain
      sleep apnea patients (those with a low arousal threshold ie wake up easily) would be
      beneficial.
