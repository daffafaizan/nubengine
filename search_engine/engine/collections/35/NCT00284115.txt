      approach. The aim of the study is to test the efficacy of a body weight support treadmill
      training technique enabling nonambulatory patients to have the repetitive practice of a
      gait-like movement compared to a conventional rehabilitation program in the acute phase.
      Hemiparetic stroke patients will be randomly included in a 4 week rehabilitation program
      associating physiotherapy and gait trainer therapy or physiotherapy alone.

      The primary endpoint will be the walking speed (time needed to walk 10 m) at the end of the
      rehabilitation program. Functional ambulatory category, walking endurance, time to self
      sufficient gait recovery, needing for mobility and self assistance, spasticity and economic
      evaluation of the two strategies will also be assessed.
