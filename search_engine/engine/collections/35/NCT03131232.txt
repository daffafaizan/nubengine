      disease with a significantly impaired prognosis compared to patients without diabetes. Recent
      data from the EMPA-REG Outcome Trial suggest that treatment with the SGLT-2 inhibitor
      Empagliflozin reduces cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality as well as
      hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing
      cardiovascular disease. Empagliflozin leads to reduction of blood glucose by an increased
      glucose excretion reduces blood pressure and weight. Still, it remains unclear how
      empagliflozin led to this pronounced reduction of cardiovascular mortality the EMPA-REG
      OUTCOME trial. Thus, our registry will analyse various biochemical as well as clinical
      markers in patients with type 2 diabetes and newly initiated treatment with empagliflozin.
      and an indication for intensification of glucose lowering therapy with empagliflozin.
      Patients with an indication for an intensified glucose-lowering therapy (HbA1c > 7,5%) will
      receive 10 mg empagliflozin and we will perform biochemical analyses of blood samples
      including insulin, glucagon as well as metabolites at baseline as well as after 1 and 6
      months. In addition we will assess echocardiographical data.
