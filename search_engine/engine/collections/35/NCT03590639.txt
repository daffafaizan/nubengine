      the interest of rapid assessment of the disease led the physicians in University Hospital of
      Nantes' department, some of whom had participated in the construction of this tool, to use it
      in routine practice for consultations of patients with IBD, joined by many
      gastroenterologists from other hospitals including the University Hospitals of Rennes and
      Angers.

      The objective of this study is to validate this tool and prove its effectiveness by comparing
      it to the gold standard represented by the IBD-DI, in the same way that the PsoDisk has been
      validated prospectively compared to other tools for evaluating the quality of life and
      activity of psoriatic disease.
