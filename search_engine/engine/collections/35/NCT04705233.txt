    
      This study is a pragmatic, individually randomized trial, set in primary care, comparing
      usual care to the use of a sputum colour chart in patients at risk of hospital admission for
      Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD), with the hypothesis
      that use of a colour chart will be non-inferior to usual care with respect to hospital
      admission rate after 12 months of follow-up, this being the primary outcome measure. Use of a
      chart might reduce antibiotic use, and thus might also change patterns of antibiotic
      resistance long term, such that these are important secondary outcomes. There is an internal
      pilot phase, a detailed process evaluation and a cost-effectiveness study.

      The trial protocol also includes three sub-studies: 1) using a daily electronic symptom diary
      capable of picking up symptom defined (but potentially unreported) AECOPD, since these are an
      important prognostic marker (section 3); 2) collecting sputum samples from patients to assess
      patterns of antibiotic resistance and 3) a qualitative study which will include staff (for
      example, healthcare staff delivering the intervention) and patients.

      This trial uses a sputum colour chart as part of a self-management intervention that enables
      patients with COPD to determine whether they have an exacerbation, and whether this requires
      antibiotic treatment. The 5 point sputum colour chart, adapted from BronkotestÂ® is being
      used.
