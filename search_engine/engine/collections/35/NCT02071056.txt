      enhanced by the leaky vasculature of solid tumors. Circulating tumor DNA has been detected in
      plasma from patients with osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and in
      cerebrospinal fluid from patients with cancer-associated neoplastic meningitis. Until
      recently, it was impractical to develop an assay to routinely quantify circulating tumor DNA
      due to heterogeneity between patients and tumors. Advances in genomic technology now permit
      sequencing a tumor genome to identify patient-specific genomic aberrations. Major genomic
      alterations (i.e., insertions, amplifications, deletions, inversions, translocations) can be
      readily detected using PCR primers and probes which will recognize tumor DNA but not normal
      DNA, permitting creation of a personalized assay to quantify tumor DNA levels in bodily
      fluids. We therefore propose a pilot study to determine whether circulating tumor DNA levels
      increase in CSF prior to cytological evidence of LM in patients with a history of cancer
      originating from a visceral organ.
