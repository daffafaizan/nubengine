      with their preferred first choice improves adherence and outcomes, in comparison to offering
      treatment that is not congruent with their preferred first choice. All subjects are offered a
      treatment with demonstrated efficacy, namely either the antidepressant medication
      escitalopram or Interpersonal Psychotherapy for 5 months. We hypothesize that patients who
      receive congruent treatment will be more likely to initiate treatment, adhere to treatment,
      and achieve depression remission.
