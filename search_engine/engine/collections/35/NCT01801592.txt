      (claudication) which limits walking capacity. Symptoms are due to pain at hip and/or buttock.
      Couple of origins may induce this pain such as vascular, cardiac, respiratory,
      musculoskeletal, neurologic, hematologic etc. The rate of associated respiratory pathology to
      patients with lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) is around 15%. The intolerance to walk
      could be link to an exercise hypoxia which appears with lower limb pain with or without
      associated dyspnea. The exercise hypoxemia becomes a diagnostic for an intermittent vascular
      claudication. Tests which are performed to diagnose an intermittent claudication are the
      Ankle to Brachial Systolic pressure Index (ABI), the echo-Doppler of lower limb arteries and
      the walking test on a treadmill associated to a measurement of the distal and chest
      transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcpO2).

      Thus, the purpose of the present research is to determine the prevalence of obstructive sleep
      apnoea in patient with PAD.
