        -  Compare the overall and disease-free survival of patients with resected adenocarcinoma
           of the pancreas treated with adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy preceded and
           followed by fluorouracil vs gemcitabine.

        -  Compare the local-regional and distant disease control in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the acute and late toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to nodal
      involvement (yes vs no), tumor diameter (less than 3 cm vs 3 cm or greater), and surgical
      margins (negative vs positive vs unknown). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning 3-8 weeks after definitive surgical resection, patients receive
           fluorouracil IV continuously for 3 weeks. Beginning 1-2 weeks later, patients receive
           fluorouracil IV continuously concurrently with radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks.
           Beginning 3-5 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive fluorouracil
           IV continuously for 4 weeks every 6 weeks for 2 courses.

        -  Arm II: Beginning 3-8 weeks after definitive surgical resection, patients receive
           gemcitabine IV once weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning 1-2 weeks later, patients receive
           chemoradiotherapy as in arm I. Beginning 3-5 weeks after completion of
           chemoradiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV once weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks
           for 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 518 patients will be accrued for this study within 8.6 years.
