    
      This is a multicenter, open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), dose-titration (to adjust the dose of a drug until optimal result is reached),
      long-term safety study in adult patients with a diagnosis of ADHD. The study consists of the
      Long-term phase (4-week titration period and 44-week maintenance period) and the 1-week
      Post-study phase. The 4 week-titration period is to find the individualized dose for each
      patient regardless of the treatments in the preceding study (JNS001-JPN-A01). Patients will
      be titrated from a starting dose of 18 mg/day for 7 days, and continue with a weekly (+/- 2
      days) increment of 9 or 18 mg until an individualized dose is achieved. The titration period
      will be followed by a 44-week maintenance period which has combined 48-week (1-year)
      treatment duration with the titration period. During the maintenance period, the dose will be
      adjusted between 18 to 72 mg depending on the patients' symptoms. In the post-study phase,
      safety information will be collected after the last dose of the study treatment or premature
      discontinuation. The study drug will be administered with water once daily in the morning at
      doses of 18 mg, 27 mg, 36 mg, 45 mg, 54 mg, 63 mg, or 72 mg per day. The study treatment
      period is 48 weeks (titration period of 4 weeks and maintenance period of 44 weeks).
