      proposed that the co-occurrence of these impairments is due to a disruption of cognitive
      processes that support both abilities: maintenance of activated semantic and phonological
      representations of words, hereafter the 'activation--maintenance hypothesis'.

      This hypothesis will be tested in the context of a treatment approach that aims to improve
      word processing and verbal STM abilities. Recently, the importance of treatment research has
      been emphasized as a critical testing ground for theories of language processing. Although it
      has been demonstrated that associations between impairments of word processing and reduced
      verbal STM capacity support the 'activation-maintenance hypothesis', direct treatments to
      improve the ability to maintain activation of word representations will serve as a stronger
      test of this hypothesis. First, empirical support will be established for the hypothesis that
      impairment to short-term maintenance of activated semantic and phonological representations
      of words impairs language and verbal STM abilities in aphasia and that direct treatment of
      this deficit will improve both abilities (Specific Aim 1). Second, the effects of this
      treatment will be compared under two administration conditions, high and low intensity
      (Specific aim 2). Finally, the neural regions associated with semantic STM and phonological
      STM will be investigated using voxel--based lesion--symptom mapping (Bates et al., 2003)
      (Specific Aim 3).

      This research represents a unique attempt to apply more recent processing theories of aphasia
      to treatment of the disorder.The outcomes will have important implications for aphasia
      rehabilitation research.
