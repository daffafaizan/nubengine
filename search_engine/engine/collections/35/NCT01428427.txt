      receives a fraction of the GSK1120212 dose that achieved a dose limiting toxicity in a
      previous study and the recommended dose of gemcitabine. Escalation will proceed until the
      maximum tolerated doses are identified. These doses will be selected based on emerging safety
      data. Confirmation of the tolerability of the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) will be
      explored in approximately 12 subjects. Subjects will continue on treatment until treatment
      discontinuation criteria are met (disease progression, intercurrent illness, adverse event or
      consent withdrawal).
