      musculature. The electrode leads are connected to a stimulator/telemeter located in the
      abdomen. After a typical post-operative period of two to five days, neuroprosthesis
      recipients will be discharged to home for two to six weeks of restricted activity to promote
      healing of all surgical incisions. After a period of exercise and training, functional use of
      the neuroprosthesis will begin. Laboratory assessments of strength, balance, and functional
      abilities with and without the system, as well as the technical performance of the implanted
      components will be evaluated.
