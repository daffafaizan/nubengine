      Ultrasound-guided paravertebral block is an advanced skill. The needle tip can be difficult
      to visualize with ultrasound, and the proximity to neurovascular structures as well as the
      pleura presents a risk of neurovascular injection and pneumothorax respectively. The midpoint
      transverse-process to pleura (MTP) block incorporates a novel needle endpoint that is
      technically easier to achieve and more distant from neurovascular structures and the pleura
      compared to traditional PVB. This study will compare the analgesic effects of MTP block to
      control and PVB.
