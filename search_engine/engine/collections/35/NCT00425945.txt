      the efficacy of pine bark extract in improving a number of cardiovascular disease risk
      factors. We are conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel trial
      that will investigate the efficacy and safety of FlavangenolÂ® (Toyo Shinyaku, Japan), a pine
      bark extract, among 130 study participants. These participants will be individuals at mildly
      or moderately elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because of having
      prehypertension, excess body weight, and insulin insensitivity. We aim to determine (in order
      of priority):

        1. The efficacy of Flavangenol in lowering blood pressure.

        2. The efficacy of Flavangenol in improving glycemic control and plasma lipoprotein
           profile.

        3. Changes in body weight, antioxidative capacity, anti-inflammatory markers, blood
           coagulation factors, and liver function tests in response to Flavangenol.

        4. The safety of Flavangenol, as confirmation of past studies.
