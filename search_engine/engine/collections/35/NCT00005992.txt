      (rPSMA)-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (CaPVax) in patients with metastatic
      hormone-refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the potential clinical response in patients
      treated with this regimen. III. Determine the effect of this treatment regimen on pain,
      physical function, and quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients undergo a delayed
      hypersensitivity skin test with 3 common recall antigens. Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are
      pulsed with recombinant prostate-specific membrane antigen (rPSMA). Patients receive
      rPSMA-pulsed autologous DC (CaPVax) intradermally. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a
      total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of
      3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CaPVax until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Quality of life questionnaires are completed five times over the
      course of the study. Patients are followed at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
