      and the American Heart Association (AHA) Diet are all recommended for the reduction of LDL-C
      and blood pressure, two major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The recommended
      food-based dietary patterns emphasize consumption of vegetables, fruits and whole grains;
      include low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils and nuts;
      and limit intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meats. The Mediterranean
      dietary pattern has gained widespread popularity because of an impressive evidence base
      showing health benefits in the prevention of many chronic diseases including CVD. The
      Mediterranean Diet Pyramid recommends that red meat be consumed less than 2 servings per
      week, with an emphasis on lean cuts. However, as the BOLD (Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet)
      study has demonstrated, lean beef can be included in a heart healthy dietary pattern that
      achieves both low density lipoprotein and blood pressure-lowering effects. The BOLD study
      utilized beef consumption levels of 4 or 5.4 ounces of lean beef daily, which is
      significantly higher than the American average of app. 3 ounces per day. This study will
      evaluate three levels of beef in the context of a Mediterranean diet, compared to an Average
      American diet.
