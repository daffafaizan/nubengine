    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of lenalidomide up to 10mg following
      non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety and tolerability of weekly bortezomib following non-myeloablative allogeneic
      stem cell transplant.

      II. Obtain estimates of non-relapse mortality. III. Obtain estimates of acute and chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). IV. Obtain estimates of 1 year relapse and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate on days -5 to -3 and undergo
      total body irradiation (TBI) on day -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive standard GVHD prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning on day -1 with taper beginning on day 100, mycophenolate
      mofetil PO BID on days 1-56, and bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) weekly from day 1 to day 91.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning on day 100, patients receive lenalidomide PO daily on days
      1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year
      post-transplant.
