      Validated Iranian versions of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and General Health
      Questionnaire (GHQ)-12 were used to assess anxiety, depression and psychological distress.

      Possible score range for anxiety and depression is from 0 to 21. Scores of 8 or higher on
      either section were considered as the presence of anxiety or depression and scores of 7 or
      less were considered as normal status. In the present study, participants who got scores of 4
      or more from GHQ were considered to have psychological distress.
