      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of adjuvant celecoxib and erlotinib hydrochloride for patients with
           hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at high risk for recurrence. (phase I)

        -  Assess disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with adjuvant celecoxib and
           erlotinib hydrochloride. (phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of celecoxib and erlotinib hydrochloride for the
           phase II portion of this trial. (phase I)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by an open-label, phase II study.
      Patients are assigned to a treatment according to Child-Pugh class of cirrhosis (class
      A/noncirrhotic vs class B).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral celecoxib once or twice daily and oral erlotinib
           hydrochloride once daily. Treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of celecoxib and erlotinib hydrochloride
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Separate dose
      escalations are conducted in the 2 groups according to liver dysfunction.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive celecoxib and erlotinib hydrochloride as in phase I at the
           MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
