    
      This study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre trial with three
      parallel arms (trial group 1, trial group 2, and control group). The diagnosis of Atopic
      Dermatitis will be made according to the criteria of Hanifin and Rajka. Participants will
      receive Jaungo or a placebo-drug for three weeks. Participants in trial group 1 will apply
      Jaungo and placebo to the lesion once a day for three weeks. Participants in trial group 2
      will apply Jaungo to the lesion twice a day for three weeks. Participants in control group
      will apply placebo to the lesion twice a day for three weeks. Each participant will be
      examined for EASI (Eczema area and severity index), SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis),
      TEWL (Transepidermal water loss) and DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) before and after
      applying medication. The outcomes to evaluate the maintenance of safety are Draize score,
      blood test and expert's opinion.
