        -  Placebo - Cx601 placebo-matching eASCs intralesional injection

      Study treatments will be allocated, on a 1:1 ratio, by central randomization through
      interactive web response system (IWRS). The study will follow an add-on design, participants
      receiving any ongoing concomitant medical treatment, at stable doses at the time of
      screening, for the CD will be allowed to continue it throughout the study.

      The primary efficacy analysis, will be conducted at Week 24 timepoint. The double blind
      design will be maintained up to Week 52 (both participant and investigator) by a specific
      blinding for study treatment administration and for evaluating its efficacy.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted globally across 150 centers. The overall time to
