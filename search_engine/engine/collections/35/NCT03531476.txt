      (TOHPC). However, many patients with chronic pain (CP) have exhausted medical options or
      could be served in the community with appropriate support for them and their family
      physicians (FPs). eConsult is a secure web-based platform that allows TOHPC physicians to
      provide pain management advice within seven days within the Champlain Local Health
      Integration Network (LHIN).

      In order to provide enhanced care to patients and improve the uptake of eConsult for CP, the
      investigators have developed a shared care model for CP in the Champlain LHIN. This program
      combines the use of eConsult for FPs and a 5-week self-directed online CP management program
      with therapist support available as needed.
