    
      The main purpose of this study is to collect and compare clinical outcomes data using the
      commercially available ROSA Total Knee robotic instrumentation and conventional
      instrumentation. This will be achieved by assessing: planned vs actual component positioning,
      operative workflow efficiency, patient safety based on incidence and frequency of adverse
      events, clinical performance measured by overall pain and function, health-related quality of
      life data and radiographic parameters.

      The primary endpoint will report on the accuracy of implant alignment for ROSA Total Knee
      robotic instrumentation compared to conventional and the secondary endpoints will record
      surgery time points and evaluate the change of clinical outcomes scores between baseline and
      post operative follow up for performance and clinical benefits
