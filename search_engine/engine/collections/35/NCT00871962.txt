      hypoxemia. The objective of this study is to measure the survival in relation to the level of
      initial resting hypoxemia, serious co-morbidities, and nutritional status in COPD patients
      treated by long-term oxygen therapy. After enrollment at the beginning of oxygen therapy,
      following data will be collected during 3 years. Lung function, blood gas analysis, exercise
      capacity measured by the 6-Min Walk Distance test (6-MWD), dyspnea scale, BODE index, quality
      of life, indirect and direct costs will be analyzed every year.
