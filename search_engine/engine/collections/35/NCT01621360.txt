      (FAI) however there is a lack of scientific evidence to support its efficacy. Two distinct
      types of FAI have been defined: cam impingement and pincer impingement. Cam impingement is
      described as an abnormally prominent anterolateral femoral head-neck junction that rubs
      against the acetabular rim during flexion resulting in impingement of the acetabular labrum.
      Pincer impingement is described as an anatomical overcoverage of the femoral head by the
      acetabulum that impinges the labrum leading to proliferation, or an increase in the
      prominence of the acetabular rim, further exacerbating the impingement. Previous studies
      investigating the efficacy of arthroscopic surgery of the knee and shoulder have shown no
      benefit compared to sham surgery and non-surgical management, therefore strong scientific
      evidence is needed to support its use in the treatment of hip pathology.
