    
      Fifty patients affected by PCOS without additional metabolic or cardiovascular diseases
      grouped in two age- and body mass index-matched treatment arms.

      Interventions: A six-month course of metformin (1700 mg daily) plus folic acid (400 microgram
      daily) (experimental group, n=25) or placebo (control group, n=25) supplementation.

      In each patient were evaluated: Complete hormonal and metabolic patterns, serum Hcy, folate,
      vitamin B12, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentrations, brachial artery diameter at baseline
      (BAD-B) and after reactive hyperemia (BAD-RH), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and intima-media
      thickness (IMT) on both common carotid arteries.
