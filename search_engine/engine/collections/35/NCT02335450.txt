      population for a variety of reasons. This research project is intended to evaluate whether
      individualized coaching combined with the use of a Fitbit physical activity wristband monitor
      will improve physical activity levels in individuals with multiple sclerosis.

      Following admission into the study, participants will be visited once a week for four weeks
      at home by a physical therapist. The participants in consultation with the physical therapist
      will set daily physical activity goals for the following week and the participants will be
      taught how to monitor their daily activity using a Fitbit physical activity wristband.

      The goals of this study are to determine whether this intervention is effective in helping
      participants increase their levels of daily physical activity and their confidence that they
      can successfully engage in daily physical activity. In addition, there will be an evaluation
      of changes from pre-intervention to post-intervention in quality of life measures.
