      the mortality of patients. Therefore, early prevention and detection of acute kidney injury
      is particularly important. In recent years, more and more studies have shown that both
      sevoflurane, an inhaled anesthetic widely used in clinical practice, and propofol, an
      intravenous anesthetic, have protective effects on kidneys. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the perioperative effects of two different anesthetic techniques on renal
      function for pediatric cardiac surgery.
