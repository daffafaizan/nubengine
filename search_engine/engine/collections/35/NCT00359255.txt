      assigned to either the experimental or the control group. The extra arm and hand exercise
      program (experimental group) will receive usual therapy plus 60 minutes per day of additional
      arm exercises. This program will last for 4 weeks while the participant is in the hospital.
      The arm and hand program will include muscle strengthening and stretching, repetitive
      reaching, folding, stacking, pushing and pulling tasks, picking up objects, and activities
      that use speed and accuracy. The family will be encouraged to participate in the program with
      the participant. The control group will receive usual therapy only.
