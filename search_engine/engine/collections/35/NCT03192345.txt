      informed consent and include a screening period of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment
      period of at least 1 or 2 cycles (21 or 14 days per cycle, respectively), an end-of-treatment
      visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient
      receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up visit 3 months
      after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease progression, or
      initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier. For the urothelial
      cancer cohort in Part 2B, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months until death or the
      cutoff date for the overall survival analysis (approximately 12 months after last patient
      first dose), whichever comes first.

      Patients who have no disease progression, and continue to benefit from the study drug(s),
      will be allowed to continue treatment beyond the common study end-date at their assigned dose
      unless the study is terminated by the Sponsor. The expected enrollment period is
      approximately 42 months.
