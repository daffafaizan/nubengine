      The resistance rate of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) to amoxicillin and metronidazole therapy is
      significantly higher in Eastern Taiwan as compared to national and worldwide rates. The high
      resistance rate in this territory justified a search for a better eradication regimen for Hp
      infection.

      AIM:

      To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a combination therapeutic regimen of
      levofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and rabeprazole (LAcR) versus a conventional seven-day
      triple therapy with clarithromycin, amoxicillin and rabeprazole (CAR) for the eradication of
      Hp infection.

      METHODS:

      We conducted a open-labeled, prospective, randomized, controlled study in a large tertiary
      referral hospital in Eastern Taiwan. Hp-positive therapy-na√Øve patients with a positive CLO
      test as proven by gastroscopy were recruited for potential random assignment to two 7-day
      treatment groups: LAcR or CAR (control). The primary end point of this study was to evaluate
      the eradication rate of LAcR regimen. Hp eradication was assessed using the 13C-urea breath
      test or CLO test performed at least 4 weeks after end of treatment. Compliance and adverse
      effects with therapy were determined by phone call or outpatient clinic follow up.

      EXPECTED RESULT:

      The seven-day LAcR regimen evaluated in this study provided improved Hp eradication efficacy
      when compared with the traditional seven-day triple therapy in Eastern Taiwan.
