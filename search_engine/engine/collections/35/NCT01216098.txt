      experimental group will receive both standard clinical care and doula support. The control
      group will receive standard clinical care without doula support. The main outcomes being
      looked at are use of epidural analgesia and cervical dilation at time of epidural
      administration. These outcomes have been chosen because of the association between the use of
      epidural analgesia and both a prolonged length of labour and the need for assisted deliveries
      (i.e. forceps assisted deliveries, vacuum assisted deliveries, and cesarean births). If it is
      found that providing doula support for women who are eligible for and attempting to have a
      VBAC reduces or delays the use of epidural analgesia, then it could be hypothesized that
      doula support for this population may also shorten the length of labour and reduce the need
      for assisted deliveries, thereby justifying ongoing research in this area.
