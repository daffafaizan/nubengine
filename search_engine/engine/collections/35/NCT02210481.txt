      months post vitrectomy for retinal detachment or epimacular membrane. The cohort is divided
      in 2 groups, one with the thinnest macular measurement under 190µm, and the others above
      190µm. We are looking for a correlation between increasing glucose rates and decreased
      macular thickness.
