           dose per tumor) on day 1 of treatment. One other tumor will be injected with normal
           saline solution. The saline solution-called a control-is necessary to determine whether
           injections (without medicine) can cause a tumor to shrink. Tumors will be measured and
           photographed prior to treatment. Ranibizumab tumors will be removed on days 8, 15, and
           29; the saline treated tumor will be removed on day 29.

        -  Participants will come into the clinic once a week for a total of 4 weeks and then again
           on Days 35. 57 and 85 for post-treatment visits. Some of the following tests and
           procedures will be performed: physical examination (including photographs of tumors),
           review of current medications, vital signs, routine blood tests, serum chemistry blood
           tests, interstitial fluid pressure measurements and tumor samples.
