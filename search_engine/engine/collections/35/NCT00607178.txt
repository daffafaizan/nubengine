      Acute respiratory infection was found to be associated with myocardial infarction (MI) [2,3]
      and a number of epidemiological studies found that mortality attributable to cardiovascular
      diseases is increased during influenza epidemics [4]. Naghavi et al [5] in a case-control
      study of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) found that vaccination against influenza
      was negatively associated with the development of new MI during the same influenza season.
      While some clinical trials found influenza vaccine effective in secondary prevention of
      cardiovascular adverse events [6,7], a large trial [8] failed to approve such an efficacy.
      Furthermore, a recent review of published trials on the subject concluded that frailty
      selection bias and use of non-specific endpoints such as all cause mortality have led cohort
      studies to greatly exaggerate vaccine benefits and that the remaining evidence base is
      currently insufficient to indicate the magnitude of the mortality benefit of the vaccination
      program [9].

      This study aims to assess the efficacy of vaccine in secondary prevention of cardiovascular
      events in MI and stable angina (SA) patients using specific endpoints including reliable
      quantitative tools.
