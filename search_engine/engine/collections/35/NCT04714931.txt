      patients. However, in early ovarian cancer systematic lymphadenectomy can be an unnecessary
      procedure which can cause perioperative morbidity and mortality. In the other hand, initially
      diagnosed early stage ovarian cancer can be upstaged after staging surgery with systematic
      lymphadenectomy. For preventing unnecessary lymphadenectomy in early ovarian cancer, sentinel
      lymph node procedure may be an alternative which can prevent major complications without
      missing the real stage of the disease.

      Aim of our study is to assess the feasibility and accuracy of lymph node evaluation with
      sentinel lymph node technique in early ovarian cancer patients. Pelvic and paraaortic spaces
      will be evaluated for the sentinel lymph nodes after the injection of the tracers in
      infundibulopelvic and utero-ovarian ligaments. Than routine systematic pelvic and paraaortic
      lymphadenectomy will be performed with the routine practice.
