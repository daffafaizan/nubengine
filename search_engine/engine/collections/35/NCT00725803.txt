      subjects will receive treatment within each of four dosing cohorts; 6 randomized to receive
      GS 9450 and two randomized to placebo:

      Cohort 1: GS 9450 10 mg or placebo given daily x 14 days Cohort 2: GS 9450 40 mg or placebo
      given daily x 14 days Cohort 3: GS 9450 80 mg or placebo given daily x 14 days

      If further characterization of the activity profile is deemed necessary, an additional cohort
      at a lower dose (5 mg) may be enrolled:

      Cohort 4: GS 9450 5 mg or placebo given daily x 14 days

      Each cohort will be conducted sequentially. Advancement to higher dose cohorts is dependent
      upon satisfactory safety and tolerability profiles of the preceding cohort as determined by
      Sponsor review (conducted in consultation with the Lead Investigator[s]). Progression to
      Cohort 4 (5 mg dose strength) will not require a safety review of Cohort 3 (80 mg dose
      strength); screening and randomization for Cohort 4 may begin immediately after fully
      enrolling Cohort 3. Alternatively, if a dose-response relationship is apparent in review of
      the blinded activity data from the first three cohorts, the final 5 mg cohort may be omitted.
