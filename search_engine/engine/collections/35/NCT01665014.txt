      double autoHSCT provides survival advantage compared to a single procedure. Most frequently
      used conditioning regimen consists pf high doses of melphalan (HD-MEL). In some studies it
      was used in combination with total body irradiation (TBI), which, however was associated with
      significant toxicity. In our center the standard procedure includes TBI as a single treatment
      at 1st autoHSCT and HD-Mel at 2nd autoHSCT.

      As in MM malignant plasma cells are localized almost exclusively in bone marrow there is
      rationale to limit irradiation to bones. For this purpose in the current study we substitute
      TBI with TMI. Additional boosts are provided for active sites of disease based on PET/CT
      imaging. Our intention is to minimize toxicity while maintaining the treatment efficacy.
