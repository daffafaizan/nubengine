      to the distance of the thickening from the center of the fovea; However, this scale does not
      define the distances which fulfill the criteria of "distant from" or "approaching" the center
      of the macula; a quantitative and reproducible tool, such as optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), could be more accurate to grade severity, by localizing thickening in a standardized
      way.

      As far as we know, distribution of clinically significant macular edema at the moment of
      diagnosis, according to the international scale has not been described. A study was conducted
      to identify the rate of eyes that had severe macular edema at the moment of diagnosis, whose
      risk of visual loss could be higher and required immediate treatment.
