      (IGT) and affects more than 40% of US adults. While glycemic dysregulation and insulin
      resistance are central to the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes, obesity also plays a
      key role. Research has begun to define the relationship between gut flora, metabolism and
      weight gain. Animal studies have linked a specific methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, to
      weight gain, and in humans we have found that increased methane on breath test is associated
      both with increased body mass index (BMI) and higher blood glucose levels. We also found that
      methane gas directly slows gut transit by 59% in an in vivo animal model. We hypothesize that
      this slowing of transit could result in a greater time to harvest nutrients and absorb
      calories, representing a potential mechanism for elevated post-prandial glycemic excursions
      and weight gain. In this study, we will test this hypothesis by determining the effects of
      enteric methane production on glucose excursions, gut transit and energy utilization in obese
      or overweight, prediabetic, adult subjects.

      We will explore the relationship between methane, M. smithii, obesity and gut transit in
      human subjects using objective measures of metabolic function, glucose excursions, energy
      utilization and transit studies, to evaluate whether intestinal methane production is
      associated with a higher incidence of diabetes risk in an obese study population. We will
      then repeat testing following a course of antibiotics known to eliminate methanogens. This
      will potentially provide novel therapies for the pre-diabetic patient, and allow new avenues
      for research.
