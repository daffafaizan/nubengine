    
      -  Patients treated with breast conserving therapy will be followed for recurrence in the
           ipsilateral or contralateral breast by physical examination every six month and imaging
           studies performed annually.

        -  The imaging including mammography, physician-performed bilateral whole breast
           ultrasonography and a dynamic breast MRI with gadolinium-containing contrast medium will
           be performed according to a standard protocol. Interpretation will be conducted
           independently and classified according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System
           (BI-RADS) by experienced radiologists.

        -  Definitive information about the presence of malignancy will be obtained by biopsy
           directed by the imaging method best depicting the lesion with 14-g or 11-g needle
           devices or needle localized excision. The absence of breast cancer was determined by
           means of biopsy, the absence of positive findings on repeat imaging and clinical
           examination, or both at follow-up.

        -  After three rounds of annual screening, the diagnostic yield of screening MRI compared
           to physical examination, mammography or ultrasonography will be assessed.
