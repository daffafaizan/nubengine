      (<300mw/sq cm)for one hour, using two probes.

      All will be treated as an outpatient and there is no form of infusion or interventional
      treatment.

      The rapid magnetic stimulation is at about 50a/us, 15Hz, 1000 pulses with 10 sec pause for
      ten days along the skull vault. Informed consent will be obtained. 30 patients will be
      recruited and sham treatment would be just applying probe without power for transcranial and
      for magnetic stimulation coil will be angled away. Data will be compiled by a separate
      blinded investigator and so with the statistics. VP shunt failure patients, which is common,
      will be included. Barthel's daily living index and standard cognitive tests will be used to
      assess results.
