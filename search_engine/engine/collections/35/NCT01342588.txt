      of spine surgeons. Since its description by Boucher in 1959 and its popularization later by
      Roy-Camille, has been considered a technique that demands great anatomy knowledge and some
      grade of expertise. Even in experienced hands the misplacement of pedicle screws could have
      an incidence of 10-40% (average of 20%). Medially misplacements during track creation and
      screw insertion are the most feared complications, because the anatomic relationship between
      medial pedicle wall and neural structures. The first attempt to use continuous electrical
      stimulation during pedicle track creation and screw insertion was communicated in 1997 by
      Welch WC, et al. In that study they used the bone impedance as a direct measurement of
      pedicle wall integrity; unfortunately they used inhaled anesthetics and assessed the final
      screw position with plain X-rays. They reported a sensibility and specificity of 98% and 99%
      respectively. The great limitation for this study is its assessment of screw accuracy
      performed by plain X-rays, now a days the best way to do it is with computed tomography (CT).

      After the Welch report, a couple of studies more have used similar techniques in the thoracic
      spine trying to avoid neurological injuries during pedicle screw insertion, but none
      described the use of continuous train pulses during screwing.

      The present study pretends to evaluate the final accuracy and trans-operative usefulness of
      the pulse train stimulation during track creation and screw insertion using intra venous
      anesthetic agents and CT scans to assess the integrity of pedicle walls
