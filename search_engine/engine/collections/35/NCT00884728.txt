      the Northern Territory (NT), where the key component involves a single mass treatment for
      scabies of all residents in the region followed by regular monitoring of skin infections with
      treatment of individuals as new cases arise. The key features of the guidelines include:

        -  Community planning and collaborative effort;

        -  Development of local educational resources;

        -  Single whole community treatment day for scabies with permethrin (5%);

        -  Community "clean up" involving house cleaning, linen and rubbish collection;

        -  Emphasis on housing functionality and "washing kids" to maintain low rates of skin
           sores; and

        -  Regular monitoring of scabies and skin sores, usually in a target group such as children

      Previous programs have been successful in controlling scabies and related skin infections in
      the NT but have been limited to single communities with varying levels of success. In
      collaboration with communities in the East Arnhem Region, we propose to conduct a coordinated
      Healthy Skin Program. By concentrating on one region, the project has an increased likelihood
      of success because reinfection due to mobility between communities will be minimised, and
      because the project will be recognised as a collaboration between multiple communities.

      The program is structured into three distinct components:

        -  Implementation of the program within the participating communities;

        -  Evaluation of the program against specific outcomes; and

        -  Integration of the program into routine service delivery.
