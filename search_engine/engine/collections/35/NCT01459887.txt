      CD20-positive DLBCL. The combination of rituximab with CHOP has been shown to increase both
      survival and response rate, in comparison to CHOP alone. CMAB304(Retuxira), a biosimilar of
      rituximab, was developed by Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd. Previous Phase I
      study showed that CMAB304 was well tolerated as monotherapy and the pharmacokinetic data
      exhibited a non-linear profile over the dose range of 250 to 500 mg/m2. In this study,
      efficacy and safety of CMAB304 were evaluated in DLBCL patients.
