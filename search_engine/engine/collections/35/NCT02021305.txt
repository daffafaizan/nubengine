    
      The aim of his observational case-control study is to :

        1. investigate if the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mediate in the development of the natural
           immunity of the uroepithileal cells against bacteria.

        2. evaluate the effect of the TLR-gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms on the
           development and clinical severity of urinary tract infections (UTI) in children.

        3. determine the association of the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 and TLR-4 polymorphisms
           with the formation of renal scar in children.

        4. investigate the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 and TLR-4 polymorphisms in healthy
           children and elaborate the results to the possible carriers of these polymorphisms.
