      in post-operative patients, thereby decreasing the chance of post-operative respiratory
      depression that occurs with opioid administration. In addition, patients may be more alert
      with less opioid medication. Currently, dexmedetomidine is not approved for use longer than
      twenty-four hours and must only be administered in the Intensive Care Unit where patients can
      be continuously monitored.

      This is a prospective, double-blinded, control group pilot study. One group (the control
      group) will receive a normal saline infusion and the second group (the treatment group) will
      receive low-dose Dexmedetomidine for up to 24 hours after they are admitted to an open
      nursing unit (not an Intensive Care Unit).

      During the surgery, the anesthesiologist will administer dexmedetomidine during the surgical
      procedure after an optional loading dose. All patients will receive pain medication using a
      Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump as per standard practice. In addition, if the
      physician deems necessary, an On-Q Pain Pump will deliver local anesthetic surrounding the
      incision under direction of the surgeon.

      Before discharge from the PACU or ICU, each subject will receive either low-dose
      dexmedetomidine or normal saline using a continuous infusion pump for up to 24 hours after
      the subject is discharged from either the PACU or the ICU to an open nursing unit. While on
      the open nursing unit patient vital signs, oxygen saturation, Ramsay score and pain score
      will recorded every two hours until the treatment drug is stopped.
