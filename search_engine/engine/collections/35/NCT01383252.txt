      Affairs (VA) patients is being promoted. Compliance with this Directive will result in an
      increased number of VA patients undergoing colonoscopy.

      The demand for colonoscopy far exceeds the capacity available to perform the procedure in the
      VA system. The conventional practice for colonoscopy at VA facilities across the country is
      to perform colonoscopy under conscious sedation with air insufflation. Efficiency is governed
      by the fact that sedated patients require time and space for recovery and these are major
      limiting factors in the current setting for the use of colonoscopy for CRC screening.

      In a prospective, randomized, controlled trial (RCT), two methods of performing colonoscopy
      will be compared in patients undergoing unsedated colonoscopy for CRC screening. We compared
      the water infusion in lieu of air insufflation (water method) with the conventional air
      insufflation method. We hypothesize that the water method (Study method) increases overall
      cecal intubation with comparable assessment of current experience and patient willingness to
      repeat future colonoscopy compared with conventional colonoscopy. In addition, the water
      method improves bowel preparation and increases polyp pickup rate.
