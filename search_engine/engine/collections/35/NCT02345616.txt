    
      Before the anesthetic induction every included patient will follow these protocol:

        -  Standard monitoring (ECG Electrocardiogram, SpO2 Pulsed oxygen saturation)

        -  Insertion of radial arterial line and periferic IV line under local anesthesia,

        -  Insertion of a internal jugular central line and Swan Ganz catheter under local
           anesthesia

        -  Preoxygenation in 100% oxygen for 10 min

        -  Further preoxygenation with a mixture of 100% oxygen associated with the iNO in a dose
           of 1,2 L / mn.

        -  Anesthesia induction and initiation of mechanical ventilation.

        -  Progressive decrease of iNO dose and stop of iNO administration.
