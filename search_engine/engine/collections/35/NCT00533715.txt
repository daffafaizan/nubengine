      early childhood. Any children with previous symptoms or present treatment for asthma,
      respiratory symptoms (cough, post nasal drip, pneumonia, rhinitis) other respiratory diseases
      were excluded from the study. Forced maneuvers were measured with a commercial spirometer,
      ZAN100 (ZAN Messgerate, Oberthulba, Germany). The spirometer software included online
      analysis of inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers. The curves were monitored on the computer
      screen to ensure best effort. The software also included an incentive-guided spirometry game.
      Inspiratory indices were not part of the games, therefore efforts were continued until the
      child could not pass the former inspiratory attempt any further. Healthy children performed
      the tests in a designated room in the kindergarten. Tests were performed in a standing
      position without a nose-clip. Maneuvers were repeated to obtain best possible efforts on at
      least three technically acceptable maneuvers. Technically acceptable curves were stored and
      the three consecutive curves with the maximal inspiratory maneuvers were analyzed for the
      study.
