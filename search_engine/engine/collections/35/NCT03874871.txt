      patients enrolled, a multidisciplinary discussion will be performed to evaluate the proper
      gastrectomy for the patients and functional preserving gastrectomy will be considered for the
      indicated patients. For patients not proper for functional preserving gastrectomy, standard
      gastrectomies will be suggested. After surgery, a close follow up will be performed. During
      the study, a thorough data collection will be performed to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of functional preserving gastrectomy and recovery and postoperative function of
      remnant stomach.
