      surface discomfort, visual impairment and even blindness, affect the quality of life of
      patients and cause social and psychological harm. Interventions related to traditional
      Chinese medicine can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms and signs of patients with
      dry eye, and are an indispensable part of the treatment of dry eye. However, at present,
      patients with dry eye are mainly diagnosed at the western medicine ophthalmology clinic. Due
      to the lack of knowledge of Chinese medicine by western medicine ophthalmologists, they are
      unable to provide patients with good guidance on Chinese medicine intervention measures,
      which may cause patients to miss Chinese medicine-related treatments. This project provides
      doctors of Western medicine with a clinical decision support system (CDSS) of Chinese
      medicine interventions for dry eye syndrome, so as to improve doctors' guidance and
      decision-making of Chinese medicine for patients. This project is based on artificial
      intelligence (AI) algorithms to screen the effective methods of traditional Chinese medicine
      intervention for dry eye and its applicable conditions, and optimize the traditional Chinese
      medicine intervention plan for dry eye through the evaluation of evidence-based medicine and
      expert consensus, and construct the Clinical Decision support system of traditional Chinese
      medicine intervention for dry eye, secondly, a real-world prospective cohort study design is
      adopted, the CDSS system is used in the ophthalmology clinic, and its practical application
      effect on patients with dry eye is evaluated.
