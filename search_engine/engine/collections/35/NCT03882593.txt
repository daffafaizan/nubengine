      intensive care unit of the Heart Institute (InCor) from Faculty of Medicine, University of
      SÃ£o Paulo (FMUSP), on patients undergoing cardiac surgery, who satisfy inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. In the preanesthetic visit, patient assessment of the criteria described
      in study methodology is verfied. During the surgery, a blood sample is taken to analyze
      hemostatic function in the begin of cardiopulmonary bypass, before arterial filter
      (pre-filter) and in the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, after arterial filter (post-filter).
      Other routine laboratory exams is being colected until first postoperative day, on the
      eletronic medical records. At the end of surgery, the arterial filter is withdrawn from
      cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to be prepared and analysed by SEM. Ten arterial filter
      samples from pre-determined sites and sizes are sent to the clinical laboratory for
      evaluation of platelet and leukocyte gene expression in arterial filter. Patients will be
      followed until hospital discharge or 28 days after surgery, regarding allogeneic transfusion
      needs, reoperation and thromboembolic events.
