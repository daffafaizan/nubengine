      be enrolled from multiple centers in China. After screening, eligible subjects will be
      randomized (1:1) into two groups, taking either Akkermansia muciniphila WST01 strain product
      or placebo product for 12 weeks.

      Blood, feces and urine samples will be collected before and after treatment. Metabolic
      parameters including waist and hip circumference, area of visceral and subcutaneous fat,
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose
      (PPG), insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), inflammation factors and lipid levels will
      be measured. Furthermore, the change of gut microbiota and metabolites will be evaluated too.

      The primary objective is to determine whether Akkermansia muciniphila WST01 strain has a
      positive effect in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. The secondary objective is to explore the
      effect of Akkermansia muciniphila WST01 strain on safety, intestinal flora, insulin
      sensitivity, and other metabolic indicators and metabolites in the patients.
