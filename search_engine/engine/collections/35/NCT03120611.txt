      program consisted of strengthening exercises for lower limbs and for the upper limb free of
      fistula. The exercise program included isotonic exercises for quadriceps, triceps surae,
      psoas, glutei, and brachial biceps; and isometric exercises for hip adductors and hamstrings.
      Elastic bands were used to apply resistance. Progression was achieved from increasing from 1
      set of 10 repetitions until 3 sets of 15 repetitions. This first part lasted no more than 30
      minutes. The program also included aerobic exercise (cycling) for up to 30 minutes. Intensity
      was adapted through the duration of the study so that the participant felt the exercise from
      hard to somewhat hard (13 to 15 at the rate of perceived exertion 6 to 20). Time and
      resistance were adapted progressively.

      The last four weeks of the program participants were randomized into virtual reality exercise
      or conventional exercise group. The virtual reality exercise group undertook 30 minutes of
      exercise. After warming up, participants had to play to an adapted 'treasure hunt' game.
      Their legs movements were the players projected into an individual tv that gave them feedback
      regarding their achievements. The aim of the game was to achieve the higher possible
      score.They moved to pick up coins and to avoid bombs. An adapted Kinect technology was used
      for the game development.
