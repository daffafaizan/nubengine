      biopsy confirmed acute rejection reactions within 24 weeks following conversion+ Incidence
      rate of acute rejection reactions (%) = number of subjects with at least one acute rejection
      reaction 1)/total number of subjects in the relevant analysis set * 100 Only those acute
      rejection reactions confirmed by biopsy will be acceptable as acute rejection reactions.

      Administration method is following The total daily dose of tacrolimus will be converted to
      1:1 (mg:mg) and the total daily dose of ADVAGRAF® will be administered only once daily in the
      morning, starting from Day 1 (at least one hour before breakfast or 2 to 3 hours after
      breakfast).

        -  Dose adjustment after conversion On Day 1, the total dose will be converted to 1:1. It
           is recommended to check the blood concentration of tacrolimus at each visit and adjust
           the dose to achieve the blood concentration maintaining at 5~8ng/ml for 0 to 3 months
           and then at 5ng/ml or below for 3 to 6 months of study treatment.

        -  Duration of treatment The investigational product will be administered for 24 weeks.
