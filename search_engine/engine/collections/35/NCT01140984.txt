    
      The study population will include 30 patients with SR AGVHD having an index of B, C, or D on
      the IBMTR severity index localized to the liver.

      Standard treatment for SR AGVHD includes: IV cyclosporine or tacrolimus with adjusted doses
      depending on serum levels and methylprednisolone or prednisone 2 mg/kg/d. This treatment may
      be continued during the study period although steroid taper down should be attempted if
      clinically possible.

      GVHD diagnosis will be based upon clinical criteria and biopsy (if needed) from an involved
      organ. GVHD will be graded according to the International Bone Marrow Transplantation
      Registry (IBMTR) severity index.

      Intra-arterial treatment should be given in less than 72h from completion of inclusion
      criteria.

      Partially responding or non-responding patients may receive a second treatment within 14 days
      of the initial intra-arterial treatment, at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Definitions

      Hepatic response:

        -  Initial response - the day in which bilirubin level began to decrease.

        -  Partial response 75 - the day in which bilirubin level decreased below 75% of basal
           level.

        -  Partial response 50 - the day in which bilirubin level decreased below 50% of basal
           level.

        -  Partial response 25 - the day in which bilirubin level decreased below 25% of basal
           level.

        -  Complete response - the day in which bilirubin level decreased to normal level.
