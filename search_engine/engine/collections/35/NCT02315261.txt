      surgery in order to significantly reduced pain scores, minimize patient distress and can
      accelerate postoperative recovery especially with the major operation This technique has been
      reported to provide better pain control and less postoperative fatigue compared with patients
      receiving general anesthesia alone.Additionally, it is recommended in patients having major
      surgery to allow patients to mobilize quickly and have effective mobilization.This technique
      has been shown to be highly efficient at preventing postoperative ileus and various
      complications. Moreover, epidural analgesic technique is demonstrated to be safer and have
      fewer side effects than using intravenous opioids alone.

      However, the epidural technique is not universally successful and the number of patients
      experiencing inadequate analgesia with this technique is approximately 12-32%. The failure of
      epidural analgesia is still a frequent clinical problem and needs active management including
      a new block or other analgesic medication in order to rescue postoperative pain. Previous
      study showed that the incidence of patients having epidural analgesia with postoperative
      moderate pain was 20.9% and that with severe pain was 7.8%. In Siriraj Hospital, recent study
      showed that 19.6% of patients having elective upper abdominal surgery under general
      anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia reported severe first pain scores in post
      anesthetic care unit.27 As a result of severe pain, patients needed a number of intervention
      and management from acute pain service, and finally spent longer time in post anesthetic care
      unit.

      Inadequate pain control in patients receiving epidural analgesia frequently occurred in
      clinical practice but the number of the success rate or the failure rate have not been
      reported in our hospital. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the epidural
      analgesia in patients having elective thoracic and abdominal surgery under general anesthesia
      combined with epidural analgesia in Siriraj Hospital.
