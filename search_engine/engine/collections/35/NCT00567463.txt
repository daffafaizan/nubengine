    
      -  Evaluate the change in airway hyperresponsiveness and in inflammatory markers in the
           blood and sputum in the population studied following a 3-month course of fluticasone 250
           µg per day followed by a 9-month course of fluticasone 1000 µg per day (before supper)
           compared to placebo as measured on a regular basis over a two year period.

        -  This study will include:

             1. A baseline evaluation period of 2 weeks before starting the 3-month treatment
                period followed by the 9-month treatment period.

             2. Treatment will be double-blinded, randomized, parallel design.

             3. A follow-up period of one year.

      Optional: Bronchoscopies with bronchial biopsy sampling will be performed before and after
      tratment in a subgroup of subjects to determine what is the influence of this corticosteroid
      treatment on airway inflammation and remodelling.
