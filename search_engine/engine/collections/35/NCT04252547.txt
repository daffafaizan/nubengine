      infant's body weight and the amount of food intake before and after breastfeeding. Each gram
      is evaluated to be equivalent to one cc breast milk. The aim of the study is to evaluate the
      effect of kangaroo care applied to the preterm infants that have attained oral feeding and
      are breastfed by their mothers, on their physiological parameters, feeding condition and body
      weight increase. After weighing the infant only in his/her diaper before the feeding and
      applying kangaroo care in which skin-to-skin contact will be provided for half an hour, the
      mother will breastfeed the infant. The infant will be weighed once again after the feeding
      without diaper change and the effect of kangaroo care on test weighing and physiological
      parameters during the feeding process will be evaluated. Sample size of the study has been
      determined by the power analysis, in line with the results obtained from the studies which
      have been conducted using a similar research method. According to the analysis results, it
      has been calculated as 23 for each group and 46 in total. Parents of the infants meeting the
      study inclusion criteria will be informed both in written and verbally and then the study
      will be conducted with mothers who agree to participate in the study with their infants.
