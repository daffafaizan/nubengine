      According to the latest guideline by European Association of Urology in the Pediatric Urology
      for the treatment of cryptorchidism, both inguinal and scrotal approaches orchidopexy are
      accepted standard treatment options. 2 In the local setting, circumcision is another common
      surgical procedure among the children, particularly under the same instance of anesthesia for
      other procedure. Not only due to religious and sociocultural reasons, male circumcision has
      been recently considered having a protective effect against acquisition of various sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs). 3 This benefit is one of many that have led to many
      affirmative evidence-based policy statements by medical bodies in support of the procedure.

      Given that both procedures are commonly done in a single setting, we adopted the technique of
      orchidopexy via circumcision incision, particularly for palpable low inguinal cryptorchidism.
      In this paper, we aim to present a novel technique and discuss our preliminary outcome of
      such procedure compared to the traditional inguinal-scrotal double incision technique.
      Specifically, we aimed to determine the differences in operative time, testicular size
      changes, peri-operative complications, pain score and parent's satisfaction of both novel
      technique and conventional orchidopexy.
