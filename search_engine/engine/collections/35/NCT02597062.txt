    
      Multiple Myeloma is a cancer that affects the bone marrow where the cells in our blood system
      are formed. This includes the white cells, red cells, platelets and lymphoid cells. In
      multiple myeloma the plasma cell (one of the lymphoid cells) starts to reproduce out of
      control. This results in crowding of the bone marrow with abnormal production of all the
      cells and a malfunction of the plasma cells. They can also cause damage to the normal bone
      resulting in pain, fractures and other complications.

      The standard or usual treatments for your disease are lenalidomide (an immunomodulatory drug)
      or bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) based treatments.

      Carfilzomib is a new type of proteasome inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of
      relapsed multiple myeloma in the United States.
