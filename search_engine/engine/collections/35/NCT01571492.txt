      standard of care at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) for the management of
      postoperative analgesia after Total Hip Arthroplasty. Over 900 continuous lumbar plexus
      blocks were performed at UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside hospital within the last year alone.
      Continuous thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is also commonly performed at UPMC
      Presbyterian Shadyside . Over 2000 are performed annually for a wide variety of surgical
      procedures. Recently authors have suggested that a lumbar paravertebral block (LPVB) may
      represent an alternative approach to the lumbar plexus. Indeed the L2 paravertebral approach
      of the lumbar plexus has been described to provide adequate postoperative analgesia following
      hip arthroscopic surgery. However, to date, there is no prospective direct comparison between
      L2 Lumbar plexus approach and the posterior approach for postoperative analgesia after Total
      Hip Arthroplasty.
