      the COVID-19 virus. Normally, when the vaccine is administered, the immune system reacts by
      creating antibodies (proteins made by the body's immune system to fight infections such as
      COVID-19) and helping the immune system's blood cells to fight it. In people with Multiple
      Myeloma and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, their immune system does not function normally,
      and an effective immune response may not occur. The research study procedures include
      screening for eligibility and the collection of data and biospecimens. It is expected that
      about 160 people will take part in this research study.
