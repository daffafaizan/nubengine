    
      This goal of this Phase 3 is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of administering
      Trogarz 800 mg once every two weeks as an undiluted IV Push over 30 seconds in clinically
      stable HIV-1 infected patients currently receiving treatment with a stable Trogarz-containing
      regimen.

      The first five (5) patients enrolled will comprise the Sentinel Group. Patients six (6)
      through twenty (20) (the Core Group) will not be screened until the Sentinel Group has
      completed Day 99 (14 weeks) of the study and the DSMB has reviewed the data accumulated and
      given approval for enrollment of the Core Group to proceed.

      The Sentinel Group will receive 2 successive doses of Trogarzo in accordance with the
      prescribing information. Safety and pharmacokinetic data from these administrations will
      serve as the comparator for each study participant. Beginning at Day 29 and continuing
      through Day 85, Sentinel Group participants will begin receiving the prescribed dosage of
      Trogarzo once every two weeks through Day 85 of the study on a schedule of increasing drug
      concentration and decreasing administration time at each visit to achieve an undiluted IV
      Push administration of Trogarzo over 30 seconds.

      After review of data from the Sentinel Group by a DSMB, if approved the study will continue
      with enrollment of the Core Group. The Core Group will receive 2 successive doses of Trogarzo
      in accordance with the prescribing information. Safety and pharmacokinetic data from these
      administrations will serve as the comparator for each study participant. Thereafter, Core
      Group participants will receive the prescribed dosage of Trogarzo via undiluted IV Push over
      30 seconds through Day 71 of the study.
