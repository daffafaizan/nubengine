      symptoms of the disease, it is closer to the "Liver wind", "Vibration" and "Chatter" in
      Chinese medicine. Scalp needle stimulation can increase the content of dopamine in the brain
      and improve mitochondrial function and reduce the death of substantia nigra.

      This study integrates TCM syndromes and pulse diagnosis, and uses laser vibration overlay and
      functional brain image to understand the effect of scalp acupuncture on Parkinson's disease.
      The project will be carried out in two phases: the first phase is the pilot study, and 200
      patients with limb shakes were collected from the neurology clinic. After the laser vibration
      overlay test, 20 patients with mild tremors and diagnosed as Parkinson's disease were
      selected. , treated by Wen's scalp acupuncture. In the second phase, 80 Parkinson patients
      were enrolled, randomized to the treatment group and the control group, and the changes in
      TCM syndrome, pulse diagnosis and Parkinson scale were compared before and after treatment,
      and the fMRI and vibration overlay ratios were evaluated after scalp acupuncture.
