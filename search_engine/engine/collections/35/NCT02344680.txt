      but is anticipated to become increasingly common as patients live longer due to
      antiretroviral therapy. In a currently approved and active research study taking place in
      Lusaka Urban district - HIV/HBV co-infection in IeDEA-SA (NCT02060162, clinicaltrials.gov) -
      800 consecutive HIV-infected adults were screened for possible causes of liver disease and
      12% were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection. HBV co-infected
      patients were more likely to have evidence of liver disease; however, ascertainment of
      critical long-term outcomes of HIV-HBV patients was not part of the study. Building on these
      preliminary results and addressing the need to study HIV-HBV during a longer duration of
      follow-up, the current protocol will focus exclusively on Zambian HIV-HBV patients. In the
      proposed study, the investigators will determine the risk factors for liver disease among
      Zambian HIV-HBV co-infected patients, and assess the long-term effectiveness of Ministry of
      Health (MOH)-recommended antiretroviral drugs in the prevention and/or reduction of HIV-HBV
      liver disease. This study will provide useful clinical and epidemiologic information to
      health policymakers in Zambia and throughout the region and may lead to improvements in the
      care of HIV-HBV patients. Further, it will strengthen collaboration between Zambian
      institutions and strengthen local capacity in HBV diagnosis and management.
