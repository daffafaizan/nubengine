    
      This is a pivotal trial that will examine therapeutic equivalence of a new generic fixed-dose
      combination product containing Budesonide 80 mcg / Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg and
      reference listed drug (RLD) SymbicortÂ® inhalation aerosol in adult patients with chronic but
      stable asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel
      Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines. To ensure adequate study sensitivity the test and reference
      products should both be statistically superior to placebo (p<0.05) with regard to the
      bioequivalent study primary endpoints.

      A secondary study objective is the safety and tolerability of the test compound.
