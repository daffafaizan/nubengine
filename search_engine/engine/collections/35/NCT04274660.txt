    
      The DWELL (Diabetes and WELLbeing) 12-week programme has been designed to incorporate
      specific elements of diabetes education and is underpinned by motivational interviewing to
      ensure it is tailored to individuals. Each of the four elements of the programme - education,
      nutrition, physical activity and wellbeing - have been carefully selected based on previous
      research into diabetes education. The Canterbury Christ Church University (CCCU) DWELL Team
      are responsible for the evaluation of DWELL, which will explore whether the combination of
      the programme elements is effective in improving self-management. Additionally, a process
      evaluation and cost effectiveness analysis will be conducted alongside participant outcomes

      The programme will be delivered at five sites (two in the UK, one in Belgium, one in France,
      one in the Netherlands). The CCCU DWELL research team will be responsible for quality
      assurance, management and analysis of data, sample size assessment and reporting of adverse
      events. Each delivery site is responsible for adhering to their own Standard Operating
      Procedures.
