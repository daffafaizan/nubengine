      quality of life after inguinal hernia repair between open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted
      surgical approaches. The study will focus on short-term outcomes through 3 months
      post-operation. During the post-operative period through 3 months, pain medication intake,
      pill count, subject-reported pain (on post-operative days 1-3 and 14 days post-surgery), and
      quality of life (at 14 days, 30 days, and 3 months post-surgery), incidence of intra- and
      post-operative complications, and time to return to normal activity will be collected.
