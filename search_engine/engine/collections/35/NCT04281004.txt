      errors. We propose that amniotic fluid drops may be beneficial in promoting ocular surface
      healing following PRK. Purified amniotic fluid (pAF) contains anti-inflammatory,
      anti-microbial and regenerative factors similar to solid amniotic membrane. Individual
      patients will be randomized to one of two post-operative drop regimens, control eyes that
      will receive placebo saline solution (NaCl 0.9%, Baxter Medical), and study eyes that will
      receive pAF four times daily for seven days.

      This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study to determine

        -  the safety of pAF in patients who undergo PRK

        -  if pAF hastens re-epithelialization following PRK compared to placebo

        -  if pAF reduces post-operative pain following PRK compared to placebo

        -  if pAF affects visual outcome following PRK compared to placebo

        -  if pAF affects ocular surface staining and corneal regularity following PRK compared to
           placebo
