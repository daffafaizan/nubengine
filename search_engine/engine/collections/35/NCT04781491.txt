      mental health of individuals with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk profile.
      Especially co-therapeutic effects in terms of resilience and salutogenesis might effectively
      and sustainably promoted by nature and forest therapy.

      The main objective of this study is to measure the effects of nature and forest therapy in
      subjects with manifest metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors. The intervention
      is a stay in the nature of the Düppeler Forest (Berlin-Wannsee) under the guidance of trained
      nature guides (90 minutes, 1x/week over 2 months), who teach exercises on the perception of
      nature and the connection between nature and health, movement and mindfulness. Subjects are
      also motivated to experience forest nature as regularly as possible (recommended ≥ 30 minutes
      daily). Participants of the control group will be offered a later participation in the
      therapy program after completion of the last study visit after 4 months (waiting list control
      group).
