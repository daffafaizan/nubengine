      TriCinch System™ provides a percutaneous solution for tricuspid valve regurgitation
      treatment: this procedure is performed through deep sedation, while the heart is beating,
      without the need for respiratory assistance.

      The TriCinch System™ consists of a Delivery System that enables transcatheter placement of an
      implant that can be adjusted to correct Tricuspid valve regurgitation. The TriCinch Delivery
      System is inserted from the femoral vein to access the right atrium of the heart. At the end
      of the correction process, the TriCinch Delivery System and the venous introducer are removed
      and the procedure is concluded.
