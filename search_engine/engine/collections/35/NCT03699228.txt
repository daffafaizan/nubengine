      Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) is utilizing the CT raw data to measure the bone
      mineral density (BMD), the visceral fat (VAT) and liver fat content in human, which can be
      widely used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, the assessment of obesity and liver steatosis.
      In this nationwide multi center study the investigators combine the low dose chest CT scan
      data with QCT technology, to measure the BMD of spine, VAT and liver fat in the health check
      subjects. This study is to evaluate the performance of QCT in the health check field, and
      further to evaluate the prevalence of osteoporosis, obesity and liver steatosis in health
      check population across China.
