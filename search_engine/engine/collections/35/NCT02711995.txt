      injection augmentation in patients diagnosed with essential voice tremor.

      Botulinum toxin treatment is the injection of botulinum toxin into the muscles of the vocal
      cords through the skin of the neck. This is identical to the injections you may have received
      in the past for your disorder.

      Injection augmentation is the injection of a filler material into the vocal cords through the
      skin of the neck, guided by the view from a flexible laryngoscope inserted through the
      nostril. The flexible laryngoscopy is identical to the procedure that the doctor has used to
      examine your vocal cords in the past. It is the routine diagnostic evaluation technique of
      voice disorders.

      Periodic injections with botulinum toxin (Botox) is the current standard of care for patients
      diagnosed with essential voice tremor, but studies show only about 60% of patients benefit
      substantially enough to continue treatment. Poor vocal fold closure, a common characteristic
      of essential voice tremor, is treated in other situations (such as vocal fold paralysis or
      paresis) with injection augmentation; thus there is reason to think that it may be helpful to
      patients with essential voice tremor, perhaps even to a greater extent than botulinum toxin.
