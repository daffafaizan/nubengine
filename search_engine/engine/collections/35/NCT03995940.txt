    
      ICH represent a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency. ICH account for 20% of strokes with a
      one-year mortality of more than 45% and an uncertain neurological outcome.

      For ICH patients, the main initial challenge is to determine the long term neurological
      outcomes and adapt the therapeutic strategy.

      The majority of primary and spontaneous ICH studies involve patients in stroke units.

      The study is an observational type 3 research with all the patients admitted in all the
      University Hospital of Grenoble Alpes ICUs between July 2012 and July 2017 for a primary and
      spontaneous supratentorial ICH
