      into the trial if eligible (see eligibility criteria) and randomly allocated into two groups.
      Children in the 'standard treatment group' will receive standard treatment for BJIs, which
      consists of IV antibiotics for 2-4 days followed by 3 weeks of oral antibiotics. Children in
      the 'entirely oral treatment group' will receive high dose oral antibiotics, followed by the
      standard dose of oral antibiotics for 3 weeks. The outcomes of children in each of the two
      groups will be compared to determine whether BJIs can be treated without needing a course of
      IV antibiotics.
