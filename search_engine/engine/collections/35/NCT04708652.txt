      and neurobehavioral assessment at term age, and neurodevelopmental assessment in the neonatal
      period, infancy, preschool and school age (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
      Development-3rd edition, Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd Edition, Child Behavior
      Check List/4-18, Wechsler Pre-School and Primary Scales of Intelligence-Revised, and
      Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration - 6th Edition).

      All families will be contacted via phone call and mail to participate in this study. Children
      and their parents will be examined for child neuromotor development, handedness and behavior
      when the children reach 12-14 years of age. All measures will be conducted at the Infant
      Motor Development Laboratory, School of Physical Therapy, National Taiwan University. The
      outcome measures in this study will consist of the growth (weight and height), neuromotor
      function (Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd Edition), handedness (Edinburgh
      Handedness Inventory) and behavior (child report and parent report of Child Behavior Check
      List for Ages 4-18 Years).
