      hypertension, with consequent effects on the structure and function of the RV. Improved
      myocardial contractility is a critical circulatory adaptation to exercise training. However,
      the types of exercise that enhance right cardiac mechanics during hypoxic stress have not yet
      been identified. This study investigated how high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and
      moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) influence right cardiac mechanics during
      hypoxic exercise (HE).

      The young and healthy sedentary males were randomly selected to engage in either HIIT (3-min
      intervals at 40% and 80% of VO2 oxygen uptake reserve) or MICT (sustained 60% of VO2 oxygen
      uptake reserve) for 30 min/day and 5 days/week for 6 weeks or were included in a control
      group (CTL) that did not engage in any exercise. Right cardiac mechanics during semiupright
      bicycle exercise tests under hypoxic conditions (i.e., 50 watts under 12% FiO2 for 3 min)
      were measured using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. The primary outcome
      was the change in right cardiac mechanics during semiupright bicycle exercise under hypoxic
      conditions (i.e., 50 watts under 12% FiO2 for 3 min) as measured by two-dimensional speckle
      tracking echocardiography.
