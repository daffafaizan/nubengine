      supplementation. Our hypothesis was that magnesium supplementation would decrease bone
      turnover markers and alter calcium-regulating hormones: parathyroid hormone and 1, 25
      dihydroxyvitamin D.

      Male and female adults over 55 without with a T-score at the hip above -2 are randomized to
      magnesium 250 mg BID or identical placebo BID. At baseline, all participants had a bone
      mineral density (BMD) by DXA scan at the hip and spine, blood biomarkers of bone resorption
      and formation, and calcium regulating hormones. Participants were followed for 12 months,
      with repeat measurement of calcium regulating hormones and bone turnover markers.
