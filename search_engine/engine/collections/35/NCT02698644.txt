      Declaration of Helsinki. For all patients after taking signed informed consent ,
      transcervical hysteroscopic cannulation of the proximal one centimeter of both fallopian
      tubes, will be done using a 5 Fr, 42cm long, polyethylene ureteric catheter, where 0.5 ml of
      Iso Amyl-2-cyanoacrylate (AMCRYLATEÂ®) will be injected in each side.

      All the surgical procedures will be performed without anesthesia, only premedication with an
      NSAID (e.g. NaproxenR) is given orally one hour before the procedure.

      Each patient will be under close observation for the first 24 hours postprocedure for any
      signs of inflammation as abdominal pain, tenderness or fever and for the vital data.

      Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy will be done, second day, a
      week, two weeks and three weeks and four weeks after injection,. Hysterectomy samples will be
      sent to histopathologist to assess the degree of tubal occlusion and the extent and the
      severity of inflammation in the tubal wall.
