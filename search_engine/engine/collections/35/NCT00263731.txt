      differently than healthy, non-cancer cells. This process of absorbing and breaking down
      substances is known as metabolism and is increased in cancer cells. Recent research suggests
      that this increased metabolic activity makes it easier for cancer cells to multiply. The
      objective of the study is to characterize the metabolism of glucose by lung tumors by serum
      metabolite analysis, using a variant of glucose (sugar) which makes up 1% of glucose in
      nature.
