    
      This is a randomized, Phase 1 study in elderly (55 to 70 years old) subjects, otherwise
      considered to be healthy with the objective of identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IkT-148009 tablets in two different settings; a
      single dose and a multiple dose setting. Escalation to the next dose will be undertaken only
      after safety, tolerability and PK data have been reviewed by the Safety Review Committee
      (SRC) and agreement reached that it is safe to increase the dose.

      The single ascending dose cohorts will consist of up to 7 visits over a period of up to 28
      days prior to dosing and 14 days after dosing. Multiple ascending dose cohorts will consist
      of up to 12 visits over a period of 49 days including 7 days of dosing.
