      version of the SAFE falls prevention intervention adapted for low vision versus individuals
      receiving the original intervention. One group of participants will complete the standard
      SAFE intervention format while another group will complete the same intervention with written
      materials adapted for those with vision loss. One intervention (either standard or adapted
      SAFE program) will be delivered at a time. The SAFE intervention is comprised of four,
      90-minute group classes that address environmental, behavioral, and physical falls risk
      factors. Classes involve lecture and group discussions as well as review of low intensity
      exercises. The adapted content is presented in large print with high contrast and has been
      rewritten on a lower grade level. A nutritionist, a physical therapist, a physician, 5 older
      adults with low vision, 10 low vision occupational therapist, and 5 health literacy experts
      provided feedback to strengthen the adapted intervention.
