    
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous engineered skin
      substitute (ESS-W) compared to conventional split-thickness AG for the treatment of
      extensive, deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns. A matched and randomized burn site
      format will be used to evaluate the successful graft take on excised deep partial- and
      full-thickness burns when grafted with either 1) unmeshed ESS-W or 2) meshed AG (the current
      standard treatment of split thickness AG).

      This research study is divided into five study periods: (1) Screening Period of up to one
      week and (2) Pre-Grafting Period, which will last approximately 35-45 days, (3) Grafting
      Day(s), which are the day(s) on which grafts are applied (i.e., First Graft: Day 0 and the
      optional subsequent Grafting Day i.e., Second Graft: Day 0), (4) Post Grafting Observation
      Period, which begins with 28 days follow-up after each Grafting Day(s), and continues till
      Post-Operative Month (POM) 6 from the last Grafting Day, and (5) Anecdotal Observation Period
