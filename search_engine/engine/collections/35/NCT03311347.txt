      during exposure to hyperoxia and +Gz-accelerations. Focus is on lung tissue compression,
      ventilation and regional perfusion. In addition, the influence of hypobaria on these
      parameters is assessed.

      This study is conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics
      Committee Ile-de-France III (ref. 3274) and the French National Agency for Drug Safety ANSM
      have approved the protocol (ref. ID RCB 2015-A00485-44 and ANSM 151046B-32).

      Primary aim, item 1: Experiments are conducted in a human centrifuge. The protocol mimics a
      routine peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and includes 1hr05 min at +1Gz followed by
      10-min exposure to +1.4 to +3.5Gz . Subjects are exposed three times to this sequence,
      breathing at positive pressure levels of 0, 5 or 10 hPa. Two groups of sixteen healthy male
      non-smoking volunteers, wearing anti-G trousers, are studied and compared: group 1 breathes
      air, group 2 100% O2.

      Primary aim, item 2: Experiments are conducted in a hypobaric chamber. Sixteen healthy male
      non-smoking volunteers are exposed to four conditions: 0 or 15,000 ft altitude, breathing air
      or 100%O2. Protocol duration is 1h15min. Positive breathing pressure can be applied depending
      on the results of the experiments of item 1.

      Secondary aim: Experiments are conducted in a human centrifuge. Sixteen healthy male
      non-smoking volunteers are exposed to four conditions: uninflated or inflated anti-G trousers
      (175 hPa), +1 or +3.5 Gz for 3 min.
