      from corn and a glucose polymer fiber. The secondary aim of this study was to examine the
      satieting effects of these fibers. This trial was double-blind and placebo controlled. On the
      first day of the study subjects consumed the breakfast cereal and milk and were instructed to
      complete visual analog scales periodically to test acute satiety. Subjects also completed
      diet records and tolerance questionnaires on days 1,2, and 10. Additionally subjects
      completed another satiety survey on day 10 to test chronic satiety. Whole gut transit time,
      fecal weight, and fecal chemistry was tested by swallowing radioopaque pellets on day 6 and
      collecting every fecal sample for the 5 days thereafter.
