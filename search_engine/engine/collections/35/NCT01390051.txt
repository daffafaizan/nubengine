      1. To examine whether treatment with low molecular weight heparin in pregnant women with
      Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)increases the birth weight of the child. Our hypothesis
      is that an increased birth weight leads to reduced morbidity and mortality among these
      children.

      Laboratory purposes:

        1. To evaluate three new methods to monitor the effect of LMWH.

        2. To investigate if 2 biochemical markers are positive predictors of IUGR IUGR is defined
           as a foetus that grows less than expected. IUGR is estimated to occur in up to 5% of all
           pregnancies, and IUGR is the second most common cause of perinatal morbidity and
           mortality. Thus, 75% of all stillbirths are caused by IUGR. IUGR is diagnosed by
           ultrasonography. In IUGR the uteroplacental blood flow is often compromised resulting in
           foetal growth restriction.

      Design: The study is a prospective randomised study where pregnant women with suspected
      severe IUGR are randomised either to treatment with Innohep速 or no treatment. Half of the
      women receive Innohep速 and half of the women do not receive treatment.

      Endpoints The primary endpoint is the difference in birth weight in children born of women
      receiving Innohep速 during pregnancy and children born of women who have not received Innohep速
      during pregnancy
