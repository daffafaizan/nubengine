        1. To evaluate the hypothesis that 12 weeks of yoga during physical education will be
           acceptable by and feasible with high school students. To test Specific Aim 1, outcomes
           assessed at both Monument Mountain Regional High School and Waltham High School include:
           feasibility and acceptance.

        2. To evaluate the hypothesis that yoga will improve self-and parent-reported psychosocial
           well-being including affect, mood, stress and anxiety in high school students, relative
           to control students taking regular physical education. To test Specific Aim 2, both
           primary outcomes (affect and mood) will be assessed at both schools. Additional
           psychosocial well-being outcomes assessed at Monument Mountain Regional High School
           include: life purpose/satisfaction and self-confidence during stress; self-esteem;
           parent-reported psychological difficulties; perceived stress; and sleep quality.
           Additional psychosocial well-being outcomes assessed at Waltham High School include:
           self-esteem; parent-reported psychological difficulties; and sleep quality.

        3. To evaluate the hypothesis that yoga will improve self- and parent-reported
           self-regulatory skills including resilience, mindfulness, emotion regulation, anger
           expression, self-esteem and self-confidence relative to physical education controls.
           Self-regulation outcomes assessed at Monument Mountain Regional High School include:
           resilience; mindfulness; emotion regulation; control of anger expression; bullying;
           health behaviors; substance use risk factors; and attention. Self-regulation outcomes
           assessed at Waltham High School include: resilience; mindfulness; emotion regulation;
           control of anger expression; substance use risk factors; and attention.
