      rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8 strain/TO-336strain) (freeze-dried live attenuated
      measles and rubella combined vaccine "Takeda") in terms of the occurrence of unknown/known
      adverse drug reactions and factors that may influence safety after the second vaccination.

      Freeze-dried live attenuated measles and rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8 strain/TO-336
      strain) is dissolved in 0.7 mL of accompanying reconstitution fluid (water for injection
      [Japanese Pharmacopoeia]), wherein a 0.5-mL portion is typically administered subcutaneously
      as a single dose.

      In addition, freeze-dried live attenuated measles and rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8
