    
      Main objective :

      External validation of a brain death evolution predictive score GRAHAL65 (initial Glasgow
      score â‰¤6, systolic blood pressure >150 mmHg, past history of alcohol abuse, herniation,
      hydrocephalus, and stroke volume>65 ml) for patients with severe stroke and withhold therapy
      built.

      Secondary objectives :

      Identification of other clinical and paraclinical predictive factors of brain death
      evolution:

        -  Age,sex,

        -  Temperature and glycemia

        -  Rostro-caudal abolition of brainstem reflexes

        -  Other cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation,
           dyslipidemia,)

        -  Antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant treatment,

        -  Intravenous thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy

        -  Type of stroke

        -  Infarct location

        -  Type of brain herniation
