      intravenously as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer therapies as first line
      (1L) and second line (2L) treatment for patients with urothelial cancer. The primary goal of
      the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of enfortumab vedotin alone
      and in combination with pembrolizumab and/or chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in
      multiple parts:

      Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer:

        -  Dose escalation

        -  Expansion

             -  Part 1: Cohorts A and Optional B

             -  Part 2: Cohorts D, E, and Optional F

             -  Part 3: Cohort G.

        -  Randomized Cohort K

             -  EV Monotherapy Arm

             -  EV Combination Arm

      Muscle invasive bladder cancer:

        -  Cohort H

        -  Optional Cohort J
