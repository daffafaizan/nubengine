      patients with mild-moderate and severe OSA and determine the impact of 1 month of CPAP
      therapy on these parameters.

      The investigators undertook a prospective study of 67 consecutive OSA patients (36
      mild-moderate, 31 severe). Measurements of plasma NOx at 11 pm, 4 am and 7 am, 24-h U-NE and
      ambulatory BP were obtained at baseline and after 1 month of CPAP.
