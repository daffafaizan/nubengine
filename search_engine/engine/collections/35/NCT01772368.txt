    
      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and open-label active-controlled,
      single-dose, 6 period crossover, dose-ranging study conducted in male and female subjects
      ages 12 years and older with persistent asthma.

      Fluticasone propionate multidose dry powder inhaler (Fp MDPI) 50 mcg was provided (to replace
      the subject's current inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)) throughout the 14 day run-in period and
      each of the washout periods between treatments. Subjects were instructed to administer 2
      inhalations of Fp MDPI 50 mcg (100 mcg total dose) twice daily during the run-in and washout
      periods. All other medications for the treatment of asthma were discontinued at or prior to
      the screening visit.

      A short-acting Î²2-adrenergic agonist (SABA), salbuterol HFA, MDI, was provided (to replace
      the subject's current rescue medication) for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms in each
      the run-in, treatment, and washout periods.

      Treatment period lasted 5 weeks with a 5 to 7 day washout between each of the six single dose
      treatments:

        -  fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate multidose dry powder inhaler (FS MDPI) given
           in doses of 6.25, 12.5, 25, or 50 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate in blinded fashion.

        -  fluticasone propionate multidose dry powder inhaler (Fp MDPI) 100 mcg in blinded fashion

        -  ADVAIR DISKUS, 100/50 mcg in open-label fashion
