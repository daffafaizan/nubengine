      squamous neoplasia. However, there is no study to investigate the sequence of Lugol's
      staining during endoscopic procedure.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of spraying Lugol's solution
      from cervical esophagus to esophagogastric junction (downward) and from esophagogastric
      junction to cervical esophagus （upward）during chromoendoscopy.
