      diabetes who are 14 years of age and older. The run-in period will be approximately up to 35
      days long, followed by a study period that will be approximately up to 33 days in duration.

      The study is anticipated to last no longer than 13 months from investigational center
      initiation to completion of all data entry and monitoring procedures. The study will target
      approximately 5 months to complete subject enrollment. Subjects can expect to participate for
      approximately 2-3 months including the run-in and study periods.

      A total of up to 75 subjects (aged 14-75) will be enrolled at a minimum 2 investigational
      centers and up to 6 investigational centers (hospitals) in China to have at least 50 subjects
      who complete the study.
