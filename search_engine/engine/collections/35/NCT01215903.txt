      effects of marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on cardiovascular disease
      risk factors such as reduced triglycerides, decreased platelet aggregation, plaque
      stabilization, antiarrhythmic effects, and reduced blood pressure. Dietary fish protein has
      also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity by 30% in insulin-resistant obese or
      overweight human subjects. In addition, an increasing number of studies describe and
      demonstrate the physiological and metabolic variations between men and women in regard to CVD
      and their risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, but the data are still limited. In
      agreement with the recent findings, this study was conducted to evaluate the combined and
      synergistic effects of omega-3 and fish protein supplements on insulin sensitivity, blood
      pressure, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obese or overweight insulin-resistant men and
      women having some or all the metabolic syndrome criteria including a deteriorated lipid
      profile, high blood pressure and high waist circumference in a free living situation.
