      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy
      uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Docetaxel may also make tumor cells more
      sensitive to radiation therapy. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.
      Drugs, such as leuprolide, goserelin, or bicalutamide, may stop the adrenal glands from
      making androgens. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy and hormone therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.
