      children affected by Secondary Hyperparathyroidism, aged 2-18 years on chronic dialysis not
      responsive to standard of care (SoC) therapy, the response after 6-month cinacalcet compared
      intra-subject to SoC alone at screening visit 6 months prior to cinacalcet start. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate effects on growth over 18 months and PK profile. At baseline
      children have PTH levels>300 pg/mL, plasma P<6 mg/dL, and Ca 8.4-10.5 mg/dL, or Ca x P
      product>60 not responsive to SoC. Initial dosing of cinacalcet will be 0.5-0.75 mg/Kg per os
      OD to be adjusted up to a max of 180mg OD for target PTH values<180 pg/mL in absence of
      hypocalcemia. Thirty children will be enrolled at 12 centres participating in a national
      paediatric dialysis registry, corresponding to an Î±=0.05 and a power of 80% using the McNemar
      test, with an expected % of responders to cinacalcet or SoC of 40% or 5% respectively, with a
      drop-out rate of 15. Primary study endpoint (EP) will be the % of children who will have a
      reduction from baseline >25% in mean PTH levels during the 6-mo efficacy-assessment period.
      Among secondary EPs over 18 mos will be the % of patients with mean PTH levels<300 pg/mL; the
      % change in PTH, Ca, P values, and the Ca x P product; PK profile (or population profile by
      age) and its correlation with PTH and testosterone levels; auxological indices and growth
      velocity; % of children with treatment-emergent adverse events and lab abnormalities;
      retention on treatment and reasons of treatment withdrawal. The study will evaluate whether
      cinacalcet represents a safe and effective therapeutic option for SHPT children.
