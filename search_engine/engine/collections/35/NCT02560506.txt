      swing and forward propulsion during body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) (Aim 1).
      Prototype models of both devices have been developed.

      These devices will be:

        1. simple to use in the clinical setting;

        2. will be easily adjustable to alter the assistance provided; and,

        3. will be able to quantify the amount of assistance necessary to facilitate normal
           stepping patterns.

      The investigators will also evaluate short- and long-term adaptations in locomotor
      performance following BWSTT in individuals with incomplete SCI with the use of these devices.
      This information will identify the effects of variable assistance at the limbs or trunk to
      modulate muscle activity and/or motor performance (kinematics) during stepping to maximize
      walking recovery.
