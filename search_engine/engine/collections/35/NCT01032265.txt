      may reduce quality of life for those affected and costs for society are high. The most common
      type of urinary incontinence is stress urinary incontinence (SUI), i.e leakage when coughing,
      sneezing or jumping. There is no association between SUI and serious medical conditions. Thus
      investigation can be kept to a minimum, including structured history taking and a bladder
      diary for correct diagnosis. Treatment with lifestyle intervention and pelvic floor muscle
      training (PFMT) give improvement or cure in 60-70% of women. A small study indicates that
      treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may improve incontinence-related quality
      of life and symptoms of urinary incontinence. Web-based management of SUI has as far as we
      know never been evaluated in a randomized controlled study. The aim of this study is to
      determine if web-based management of female SUI, with a treatment using PFMT and elements of
      CBT is effective compared to treatment supported by a pamphlet. The duration of the treatment
      programme is three months, follow-up at four months, 1 year and two years.
