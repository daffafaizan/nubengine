      assigned to the study and control groups. With the onset of endometrial preparation and
      estrogen treatment, the study group will receive 100 mg of oral aspirin and the control group
      will be given placebo. When endometrial thickness will be found between 8-14 mm, therapy with
      progesterone (100 mg IM daily) will be started and embryo transfer will be performed 48 to 72
      hours later. Doppler ultrasonography also is done to calculate Resistive Index (RI) and
      Pulsatility Index (PI), the day after progesterone administration.

      Î²HCG will be assessed 14 days after ET. If a pregnancy will be achieved, the patients in
      study and control groups will be instructed to continue the aspirin or placebo through 5
      weeks and if the pregnancy test result will be negative, the treatment with aspirin or
      placebo will be stopped. The patients will be followed until 20 weeks of gestation and the
      results of treatment cycle will be compared in two groups.
