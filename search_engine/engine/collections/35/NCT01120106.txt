      several factors in post operative phase: congenital insufficiency, cardiopulmonary bypass low
      perfusion, ischemima during the cross-clamp phase, low cardiac output syndrome, systemic
      inflammation. Furthermore, neonates have immature molecular mechanisms leading to calcium
      utilization inside myocytes. Calcium sensitizer drugs such as Levosimendan may exert
      anti-ischemic effect in addition to positive inotropic and anti-stunning effects mediated by
      the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. The aim of the study is to test the
      inodilator and myocardial protection effect of peri-operative iv infusion of 0.1 mcg/kg/min
      Levosimendan (without previuos bolus) in a cohort of neonates affected by transposition of
      the great arteries undergoing surgical correction by arterial switch.
