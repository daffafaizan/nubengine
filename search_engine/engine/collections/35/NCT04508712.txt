    
      The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to the newly discovered
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide increase
      in hospitalization for pneumonia with multi- organ disease. Survival from sepsis is
      associated with increased risk for mortality for at least 2 years. Therefore, substantial
      sequelae including new physical disability, new cognitive impairment and increased
      vulnerability to further health deterioration are likely to be seen in survivors of COVID-19.
      The investigators conduct this study to investigate daily living status of survivors of
      COVID-19 using telephone interview questionnaire including Activity Daily Living(ADL),
      modified Medical Research Council(mMRC),modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status
      (TICS-m), Zung Self-rating Depression Scale(SDS), Carcinologic Handicap Index (CHI), and New
      York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class.
