      I. To evaluate the using of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to diagnose pancreatic cancer
      arising in the setting of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) using the resected
      pancreatic specimen.

      II. To correlate OCT imaging diagnosis with histologic findings in the human pancreatic duct.

      IPMN is a premalignant lesions arising in the pancreas. Typically, IPMNs are identified
      incidentally on imaging performed for other reason or related to vague abdominal pain or
      gastrointestinal complaints. In terms of IPMN, invasive cancer can be found in this setting
      between 20 to 50% of the time[7] Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with IPMN, especially
      main duct type, the general recommendation is to undergo resection. We propose to assess the
      duct of the pancreatic specimen after resection to identify evidence of invasive malignancy
      by OCT imaging. Afterwards, the specimen will be undergoing histopathologic assessment using
      standard protocols. Our hypothesis is that OCT will accurately identify pancreatic cancer in
      resected pancreatic specimen. The assessment with OCT is non-invasive and will not harm to
      change the specimen prior to going to pathology for standard review. Future studies will then
      focus on using this imaging technique in vivo to endoscopically identify early stage
      pancreatic cancer.
