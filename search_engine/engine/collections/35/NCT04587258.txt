      COVID-19 pandemic in underserved populations of Rhode Island. The investigators will engage
      the Blackstone Valley Community Health Center. Dr. Don Dizon, a national leader in social
      media, will be a key participant.

      Dr. Don Dizon is a world expert using electronic communication and social media in the
      oncology practice. Dr. Dizon chairs the Digital Engagement Committee for the Southwest
      Oncology Group (SWOG) a national cancer institute cooperative group. He is a co-principal
      investigator of an NIH grant studying electronic patient reported outcomes - the SIMPRO
      Research Consortium. Dr. Dizon is also head of the American Society of Oncology (ASCO)
      Educational Committee and is well positioned to disseminate the knowledge gathered from the
      current project through ASCO activities.

      The initial project may be to discuss with the Blackstone Valley Community Health Center the
      possibility of developing short videos in multiple languages on the importance of cancer
      screening. The investigators will engage staff and patients of the BVCHC and the community to
      participate within the videos as a model of community-based participation. These
      informational videos could be distributed directly to the community via social media
      platforms. Data will be collecting on the rates of cancer screening including age, sex and
      race. These data could be compared to different cities within Rhode Island and the United
      States
