    
      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in four sequential groups
      of healthy subjects. Eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH on the day prior to receiving
      the first study medication. On the morning of the first dosing day (Day 1), subjects received
      BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Sinemet® 100/25; on the morning of the second dosing day
      (Day 2), subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Sinemet® 100/25 and Comtan®
      200 mg. Products were administered in fasting conditions (at least 8 hours). Subjects
      remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day
      3); then, they were discharged and will return for the follow-up visit.
