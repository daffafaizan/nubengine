      and, more recently, the role of the choroid has been studied with respect to its role in
      myopia (near-sightedness) progression. SightGlass Vision, Inc is conducting a multi-site,
      randomized, controlled, interventional study to confirm the efficacy and safety of spectacle
      lenses designed to inhibit the progression of myopia by reducing image contrast in peripheral
      vision. CORE is participating as a clinical site in this three year study which aims to
      compare changes in ocular length and cycloplegic auto-refraction in children randomised to
      wear one of either two test or one control spectacle lens designs; the CPRO-1802-001
      (Cypress_SG) study. The sponsor is interested in conducting choroidal thickness measurements
      only at CORE's site by inviting those participants who have already been found eligible for
      the CPRO-1802-001 study to participate in this parallel study.
