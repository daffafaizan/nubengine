      Chloride has a nephrotoxic effect, which can be shown partially by measuring bio markers for
      tubular injury in urine, partially by the changes in tubular transport of sodium and water in
      different parts of the nephron. This can be demonstrated using isotone sodium solutions with
      a lower chloride concentration in this study plasma-lyte versus normal isotone saline.

      Klorid has a toxic effect on the glycocalyx layer and leads to a rise in syndecan 1 and
      simultaneously a change in Salt Blood Test either by a direct simulation and ANP levels in
      plasma or as a consequence of the hyperchloremic acidosis. This can be demonstrated using
      isotone sodium solutions with a lower chloride concentration in this study plasma-lyte versus
      normal isotone saline.

      Purpose:

      The purpose is to observe changes in bio markers, vasoactive hormones and salt regulation in
      patients randomized to either 0,9% saline or plasma-lyte undergoing primary uncemented hip
      replacement surgery.

      Design:

      40 patients undergoing primary uncemented hip replacement surgery will be randomized to
      either 0,9% saline or plasma-lyte for standard fluid resuscitation and blood loss replacement
      in this controlled and double blinded study. The patients will deliver a 24 hour urine sample
      before surgery and approximately 10 days after. From the start of the surgery and to the day
      after all urine will be collected and blood samples will be taken.

      Perspective:

      If chloride is found to be nephrotoxic it could lead to a general change in fluid
      resuscitation recommendations in critically ill patient, patients with kidney disease and
      patients undergoing surgery. It will also expand our knowledge about the permeability of the
      blood vessels.
