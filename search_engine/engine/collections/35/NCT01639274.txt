      nephrologic, neurologic, osteo-articular disease, chronic hepatitis and cancer no linked to
      immunodepression). COPD prevalence has never been studied in HIV population. In consequence,
      there is no guideline about the screening, treatment or follow-up of COPD in HIV patients.
      However this population seems particularly at risk to develop COPD because of high tobacco
      consumption and accelerate ageing. Thus, we need an epidemiologic study to understand the
      prevalence of COPD in HIV population in order to organize a specific screening and follow-up.
      This is supported by an improvement of COPD if early managed. On top of that, COPD screening
      will increase awareness of HIV patients on the problematic of tobacco consumption.
