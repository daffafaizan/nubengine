      phacoemulsification of cataract. Patients between 40 and 80 years of age who met enrollment
      criteria, required cataract surgery in both eyes, and agreed to participate, were enrolled in
      the study over a nine month period in 2006 at the office of one cataract surgeon. Eyes were
      randomly assigned to receive either the eye drop or injection protocol on the initial
      consultative visit. All surgery was preformed by one surgeon (JGS) using topical anesthesia,
      the Infiniti phacoemulsification system (Alcon) and an Acrysof SN60WF (Alcon) intraocular
      lens. The fellow eye was operated upon using the same technique and instrumentation two weeks
      later and was assigned to the group opposite the first eye. All eyes were examined by the
      operating surgeon at days 1, 8, 15, 30 and 90 postoperatively with uncorrected visual acuity,
      best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, corneal edema, anterior chamber cell and
      flare recorded.
