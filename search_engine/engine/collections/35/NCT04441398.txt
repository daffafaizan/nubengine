      diagnosed with mild COVID-19 by treating them with nitazoxanide for 7 to 14 days on top of
      standard care compared to patients who receive standard care and placebo only.

      After 7 days of treatment, the Investigator can extend the treatment duration for another 7
      days at his/her discretion.
