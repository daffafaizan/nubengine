      treat psoriasis. In the second part, we are testing a drug known as Humanized CD25 Monoclonal
      Antibody (anti-TAC) or placebo to prevent disease relapse. Anti-TAC is an injectable medicine
      that is also designed to treat psoriasis by blocking a part of the immune system that we
      believe contributes to the disease.
