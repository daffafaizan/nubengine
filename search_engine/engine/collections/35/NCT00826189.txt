      clinical trial (NCT00318695) which involved 253 subjects with a first degree family history
      of allergic disease. The infants received at least 60ml of commercially available cow's milk
      based infant formula with or without probiotic supplementation (Bifidobacterium longum
      [BL999] 1×10*7 colony-forming unit (cfu)/g and Lactobacillus rhamnosus [LPR]2×10*7 cfu/g)
      daily from the first day of life for the first 6 months. A follow-up study (NCT00365469) up
      to 5 years of age is currently in process.

      This current study plans to continue the follow-up for a further 2 years till the cohort
      reaches 7 years of age. This study will only involve telephone calls which will be conducted
      every 3 months to ascertain for symptoms and incidence of respiratory allergic disease.This
      is critical in the evaluation of asthma and allergic rhinitis which tend to develop later in
      life and this step-wise, temporal development of respiratory allergies has been described as
      "Atopic March".
