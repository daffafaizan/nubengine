      eligible for the outcome evaluation. 20% of clients are likely to be on parole or probation;
      these clients will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Outcome measures that will be examined as part of the treatment outcome evaluation include:
      1) self-reported substance use; 2) urine toxicology screening; and 3) sex risk taking.
