    
      This is a phase I single-center study of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in melanoma
      patients who failed at least one line of PD-1 blockade.

      Eligible patients must have a disease amenable to biopsy and lack of contra-indications to
      FMT.

      Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation including imaging, tumor biopsy, blood samples
      and stool studies to confirm suitability for the study.

      Eligible patients will undergo FMT. The FMT includes a colonoscopy followed by stool
      capsules.

      Patients will undergo repeated evaluations including follow-up blood, stool and radiological
      testings.

      The study will be conducted over a 24-week period.
