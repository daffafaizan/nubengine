      experiences in the literature are in the form of small studies and case reports.

      Dexmedetomidine may be useful in paediatric patients for sedation in a variety of clinical
      situations. Based on literature analysis, dexmedetomidine may be potentially used in the
      intensive care unit in pediatric patients who require sedation, either breath spontaneously
      or require mechanical ventilation.

      Dexmedetomidine is a newer sedative with little safety data in paediatrics, particularly for
      therapy lasting longer than 48 h. Additional studies in paediatric patients are warranted to
      further evaluate its safety and efficacy in all age ranges.
