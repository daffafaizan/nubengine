    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      cyclophosphamide when combined with escalating doses of ABT-888 (veliparib).

      II. Identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) when combined with escalating
      doses of ABT-888.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate any effect of ABT-888 on the systemic clearance of parent cyclophosphamide and
      the dose normalized area under the curve (AUC) of 4-hydroxy (4-OH) cyclophosphamide when used
      in combination, using historical single-agent cyclophosphamide and 4-OH data.

      II. Evaluate any effect of cyclophosphamide administration on the systemic pharmacokinetics
      of ABT-888 and its primary metabolite A-925088 (M8), by comparing pharmacokinetic (PK)
      parameters of ABT-888 on day 1 (before cyclophosphamide) and day 3 (with cyclophosphamide
      administration); PK samples for analysis will not be collected from patients enrolled after
      2/15/2012.

      III. Evaluate inhibition of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) polymerase (PARP) using
      an immunoassay designed to measure PAR levels in baseline and on-study peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples; PBMC samples for PAR analysis will not be collected from
      patients enrolled after 2/15/2012.

      IV. Evaluate gamma H2A histone family, member X (H2AX) at baseline and on-study circulating
      tumor cell samples to evaluate the point of maximal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage from
      the combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin with ABT-888.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib and cyclophosphamide.

      GROUP I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) every 12 hours on days 1-4 and
      cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 3.

      GROUP II: Patients receive veliparib PO every 12 hours on days 1-4, cyclophosphamide IV over
      60 minutes on day 3, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 3.

      GROUP III: Patients receive veliparib PO every 12 hours on days 1-7, cyclophosphamide IV over
      60 minutes on day 1, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1.

      GROUP IV: Patients receive veliparib PO every 12 hours on days 1-14, cyclophosphamide IV over
      60 minutes on day 1, and doxorubicin hydrochloride over 15 minutes on day 1.

      In all groups, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
