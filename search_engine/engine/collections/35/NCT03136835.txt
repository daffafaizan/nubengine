      hyperoxygenation in pregnancies affected by fetal congenital heart disease, specifically
      those pregnancies in which the fetus has single ventricle physiology with aortic arch
      obstruction. The treatment has a potentially neuroprotective effect on the fetus. This would
      be desirable as the neurodevelopmental outcomes of the survivors of this form of congenital
      heart disease are significantly below normal. However, transplacental oxygen has not been
      tried in this setting, and so before embarking on a trial, the investigators need to
      establish that the treatment is safe and feasible. This will be accomplished by recruiting
      subjects which meet the eligibility criteria and commence treatment at the time of diagnosis,
      usually in the second trimester. The oxygen will be delivered to the mother via nasal prongs
      continuously at a rate of 4 L/min. Oxygen concentrators will be supplied to the subjects'
      homes, and a range of portable devices will also be provided to allow them to continue with
      usual activities of daily living. A series of follow up appointments will be arranged to
      check the status of the mother and fetus. Mothers will be invited to keep a diary of their
      adherence to the treatment. A range of routine clinical and research data on the condition of
      the fetus and newborn will be collected.
