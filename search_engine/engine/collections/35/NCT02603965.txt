      I. To assess the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 to detect prostate cancer (PC) within the prostate
      gland, as compared with whole mount step-sectioned surgical pathology of the prostate after
      radical prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copper Cu 64 TP3805 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/computed tomography
      (CT) at 30 minutes and 2 hours post-injection. Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy
      within 1 to 3 weeks after scans.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours.
