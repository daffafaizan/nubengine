      incidence in France is more than 10/105 per year, with a steady increase (~4%/year),
      especially in children. Infants born to parents with T1D have a 15-fold higher risk to
      develop T1D compared to the general population. The appearance of autoantibodies precedes and
      is highly predictive of the later occurrence of T1D. The activation of B lymphocytes, which
      produce autoantibodies, is controlled by T helper lymphocytes. Hence, biomarkers associated
      with initial T lymphocyte activation are likely to precede the appearance of autoantibodies.

      The aim of the TRAKR study is to determine whether the appearance of autoreactive T
      lymphocytes is predictive of the emergence of autoantibodies.

      The secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate whether metagenomic, metabolic, or environmental
      factors are associated with the appearance of autoantibodies; 2) to evaluate the incidence
      and the time of autoantibody appearance in a French population of genetically at-risk
      children; 3) to compare the incidence of autoantibodies between infants born to T1D fathers
      and mothers.
