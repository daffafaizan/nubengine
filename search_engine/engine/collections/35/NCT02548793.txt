      strategies that match training locales with at-risk populations, maximize resuscitation skill
      retention, and promote willingness to act. To accomplish this, the investigators will empower
      stakeholders at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) and local area hospitals
      to develop local implementation approaches, using either volunteer hospital personnel or paid
      research assistants as training proctors. These stakeholders will be studied as a research
      subset. The training proctors will educate family members or friends of patients at risk for
      cardiac arrest using a mobile application "app" or VSI kit (RCT), and empower them with the
      lifesaving skill of CPR. The investigators will follow up with the study subjects and conduct
      CPR skills tests 6 to 12 months from the time of training to assess whether the subjects
      retained their skills or if they had an opportunity to use the skills that they learned. The
      investigators will also gather information on how the subjects would like to be encouraged to
      practice their skills. The investigators will send a reminder notification every two months
      following training, to encourage subjects to refresh their training skills. At the follow-up
      skills test at 6 to 12 months, the investigators will administer a survey to assess whether
      the prompting encouraged the subjects to practice their skills. Additionally the
      investigators will encourage the individuals trained in-hospital to share the kit or mobile
      app with others. The investigators will follow-up with those who are identified as secondary
      trainees to assess the environment in which secondary training took place.
