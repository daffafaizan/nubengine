      a direct anti-proliferative activity against CLL cells. Lenalidomide stimulates T- and
      NK-cells, modulates the tumour microenvironment in CLL and inhibits bone marrow angiogenesis.
      There is a rationale to combine lenalidomide with the alpha-CD20 mAb rituximab because
      lenalidomide enhances NK cell mediated antibody dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab treated
      NHL cells. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that the combination of
      chemotherapy (FC) and rituximab results in highest response rates and longest
      progression-free survival in treatment naive and relapsed CLL. Besides FCR the combination of
      bendamustine, a hybrid alkylating agent with properties of a purine-analogue, with rituximab
      (BR) seems to be very active in relapsed and treatment-naive CLL based on results of a phase
      II trial of the GCLLSG. Preliminary results with lenalidomide showed a promising response
      rate of 32% including high risk patients. Thus, the combination of BRL could improve the
      therapeutic activity in high risk CLL by combining two immunomodulatory with a classic
      cytotoxic principle.
