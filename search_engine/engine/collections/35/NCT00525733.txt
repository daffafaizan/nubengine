    
      -  DURATION: Subjects will participate for at least 60 weeks and up to 96 weeks if in the
           opinion of the investigator and patient that continued therapy is in the patient's best
           interest.

        -  SAMPLE SIZE: 36 subjects randomized 2:1 multi-class versus standard antiretroviral
           therapy.

        -  POPULATION: Acutely HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral (ARV) drug-naïve (≤ 7 days of ARV
           treatment at anytime prior to study entry*) men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

        -  REGIMEN: At entry subjects will be randomized to one of the following in a 1:2 ratio:

      ARM A: FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg QD + darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg QD

      ARM B: FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg QD + darunavir 800mg/ritonavir 100 mg QD + Raltegravir 400 mg
      BID + Maraviroc 150 mg BID

      The three primary objectives are:

        1. To assess whether a multi-class regimen could completely suppress virus replication in
           HIV infected individuals based on:

             -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 48 weeks

             -  Ultrasensitive < 50 copy assay

             -  5 copy assay

             -  1 copy assay

             -  Cell associated HIV-1RNA levels at week 48

             -  Proviral DNA

             -  Levels at week 48

             -  Decay rates from week 12 to week 48

        2. To determine whether multi-class antiviral therapy results in enhanced immune
           reconstitution in peripheral blood and gastrointestinal mucosa based on flow and
           immunohistochemistry.

        3. To assess tolerability of multi-class compact antiviral therapy to that of standard
           compact antiviral therapy.
