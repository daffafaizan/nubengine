      Autonomy" (PRISMA-7) is the Ministry of Health and Social Services' reference tool for the
      frailty assessment of older Emergency department users. This tool has been initially
      developed and validated to assess disabilities in older community dwellers with the aim to
      quickly identify older individuals at risk for disabilities and who should undergo a
      comprehensive assessment. PRISMA-7 has a high sensitivity for identifying frailty in older
      community dwellers but its performance criteria for this goal has never been examined in
      older Emergency Department users. Recently, a systematic review underscored that PRISMA-7 has
      all characteristics for being a usable clinical tool in Emergency department because it is a
      brief (i.e., <5 min), simple and multidimensionality assessment. PRISMA-7 is composed of 7
      questions assessing health and functionality of older adults and stratifies risk for
      disability in two levels: low versus high. PRISMA-7 is a prognostic tool for disabilities.
