      parent interventions have been developed to address this persistent problem. Parent
      communication interventions provide an opportunity to enhance individual adolescent based
      approaches. However, there is a need for theory and culture based interventions focused on
      Latino parents. The program implemented in this study was designed for parents, to indirectly
      help reduce the health risks of their adolescents, including unintended pregnancy and STDs,
      including HIV/AIDS. The study has three aims regarding the examination of whether the
      computer based parental communication intervention is 1) associated with a greater increase
      in parents' comfort with, and quantity of communication; 2) associated with a greater
      increase in adolescents' intentions to abstain from sex and/or avoid unprotected intercourse
      and decreased self-reported intercourse and unprotected intercourse; and 3) feasible and
      acceptable to Spanish dominant Latino parents and their adolescent children.
