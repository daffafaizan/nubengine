    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the immunomodulatory activity of radiation therapy (RT) or RT in
      combination with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD)-1 antibody (MK-3475) in patients with
      recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer, renal cell cancer, melanoma and lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is associated with
      treatment response to the combination of RT and PD-1 blockade in renal cell cancer (RCC),
      head and neck cancer (HNC), lung cancer and melanoma.

      II. To explore whether circulating tumor cells can be used to determine PD-L1 expression.

      III. To explore other immune-related biomarker changes after RT: soluble PD-L1, cytokines
      etc.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM A1: Patients undergo radiation therapy on day 1 per standard of care and then undergo
      biopsy 3-10 days later. Beginning 0-7 days after biopsy, patients receive MK-3475
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses of MK-3475 repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM A2: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days 1-5 and then undergo biopsy 3-10 days
      later. Beginning 0-7 days after biopsy, patients receive MK-3475 as in Arm A1.

      ARM B1: Patients receive one dose of MK-3475 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and then undergo 1
      fraction of RT. Patients then receive MK-3475 IV over 30 minutes in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B2: Patients receive MK-3475 as in Arm B1 and undergo 5 fractions of RT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 30 days and
      then every 8 weeks.
