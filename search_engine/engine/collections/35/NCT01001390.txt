    
      1. This study will determine the impact of Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) wear on gait
           efficiency in children with ALL and Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN).

        2. The study hypothesizes that children with CIPN will have lower net oxygen consumption
           during the six minute walk test while wearing AFO as compared to their net oxygen
           consumption during a six minute walk test while not wearing AFO.

        3. The study will assess whether gait efficiency while using an AFO persists after one
           month of use.

        4. The study will hypothesize that the benefits of AFO use on gait efficiency persist after
           one month of wear.
