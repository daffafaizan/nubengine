      with NHL. Moreover, the radiolabelled antibody Zevalin has been approved for the treatment of
      relapsed NHL. The patients in this study have a poor prognosis. The treatment strategy aims
      to control the disease and to ameliorate disease related symptoms with minimal toxicity.
      Both, rituximab and low-dose radiotherapy are associated with minor toxicity if applied
      alone.

      The primary objective of the study is therefore to assess the short term efficacy of a
      combination of rituximab and low-dose radiotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
