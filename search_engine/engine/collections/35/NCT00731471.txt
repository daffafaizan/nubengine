      are infected with HIV. In phase I studies, a single vaccination with MVA85A, when
      administered at a dose of 5 x 107pfu intradermally, has been shown to be safe in both
      mycobacterially na√Øve individuals, those previously vaccinated with BCG and latently infected
      individuals. We will use 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A intradermally in this study. A trial in BCG
      vaccinated subjects showed that the higher dose (1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A) induced a significantly
      higher immune response but did not have a higher AE profile. In addition, because of a
      variable immune response, the trial in HIV positive subjects in the UK is split into two
      groups, the first getting 5 x 10^7 pfu and the second getting 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A. It has,
      therefore, been decided to use the higher dose in order to maximise the immune response
      whilst maintaining a good safety profile.
