    
      This is a prospective, randomized study conducted at 90 centers in Europe, Latin-America and
      Asia. A total of 1335 patients will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1
      basis to either the sirolimus-eluting or the paclitaxel-eluting stent system. All patients
      will have repeat angiography at eight months and will be followed for 24 months
      post-procedure.
