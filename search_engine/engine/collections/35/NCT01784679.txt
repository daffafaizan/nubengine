    
      The main objective of this program is to better understand HIBM.

      The specific HIBM Disease Registry's objectives are to:

        -  Understand the geographic distribution and regional incidence/prevalence of GNEM.

        -  Obtain an assessment of the medical history, clinical presentation and progression of
           disease in GNEM patients and provide a connection for subjects to the broader GNEM
           community and associated programs.

        -  Provide customized information to subjects and their physicians that desire information
           on their disease status and progression.

      The specific HIBM Natural History Study's objectives are to:

        -  Characterize HIBM disease presentation and progression over time using relevant clinical
           assessments of muscle strength and function.

        -  Obtain information to better characterize quality of life and understand the timing of
           significant life changing events in HIBM patients using patient-reported outcomes.

        -  Identify biomarkers and efficacy measures for use as endpoints in future clinical
           studies.
