    
      ATI-2042 is being developed as an alternative to amiodarone, which is considered a first-line
      therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation and is known to have serious side effects.
      ATI-2042 was designed to have a reduced plasma half-life and a lower volume of distribution,
      which is expected to result in an improved safety profile. In contrast to amiodarone,
      ATI-2042 undergoes rapid metabolism via plasma and tissue esterases, which may reduce tissue
      accumulation and toxicity. The current trial will determine if ATI-2042 retains the efficacy
      profile of amiodarone without the side effects attributable to tissue accumulation seen with
      long-term dosing.

      This study is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is proprietary and
      not publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial participants.)
