      brain imaging using 11 C Raclopride in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). 11 C Raclopride is
      a ligand which binds to the dopamine receptor D2 and can measure dopamine release during
      pleasure or anticipatory reward associated with sex. The current proposal will measure
      changes in DRD2 receptor occupancy using 11 C Raclopride following explicit visual sexual
      desire cues in healthy control subjects and individuals who suffer from sexual dysfunction.
      This is in order to determine how individual genotypes modulate dopamine release in vivo in
      the human brain.
