      chemotherapy (HIPEC) have been addressed for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis in
      selected patients. However, prophylactic HIPEC in colorectal cancer patients at high risk of
      metachronous peritoneal metastases remained controversial. In this study, patients with
      colorectal cancer cT4N0-2M0(AJCC/UICC staging system 8th edition) and planed to undergo
      intentionally colectomy (laparotomy, laparoscopy，or robotic ) are randomized into HIPEC group
      and control group. In HIPEC group, closed HIPEC is performed with Mitomycin C(30mg/m2) at 43
      °C for 90 minutes, simultaneously or within 2 days after colectomy and followed by systemic
      chemotherapy. For the patients in the control group, systemic chemotherapy were administered
      after colectomy. The primary endpoint is peritoneal recurrence-free survival (pRFS) rate.
      Secondary end points include overall survival (OS) rate, disease free survival (DFS) rate,
      liver metastatic rate, toxic effects, quality of life scores. All efficacy analyses are
      conducted in the intention-to-treat population, per-protocol population and pT4 subgroups due
      to pathologic tumor invasion can not be acquired before HIPEC. Safety analysis include only
      patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
