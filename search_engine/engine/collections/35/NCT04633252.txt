    
      Background:

      A phase III trial demonstrated that combining docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT) significantly improved survival (57.6 vs 44.0 months (hazard ratio HR=0.56,
      (0.44-0.70), p <0.0001) for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).
      The greatest benefit was seen in men with "high volume disease" (visceral disease or 4+ bone
      lesions with at least one beyond the pelvis and spine.)

      Clinical data has indicated that PSA <0.20 ng/mL seven months after starting androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is prognostic for overall survival based on data from the phase III
      trial.

      Docetaxel has limited efficacy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
      patients who have already progressed on anti-androgen therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide).

      Anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap (M7824) is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein
      composed of a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 fused to the extracellular domain of human
      TGF-beta receptor II (TGFbetaRII), which effectively functions to sequester or "trap" all
      three TGF-beta isoforms. A phase I study of M7824 (NCT02517398) demonstrated a manageable
      safety profile and clinical efficacy among patients with heavily pre-treated advanced solid
      tumors.

      M9241 is an immunocytokine that can enhance the efficacy of anti-PDL1 targeting antibodies
      such as M7824.

      Preclinical data suggests that there may be synergistic anti-tumor effects, when docetaxel,
      M9241 and M7824 are combined.

      Objectives:

      Phase I:

      To evaluate safety and tolerability of docetaxel in combination with M7824 and M9241 in
      participants who have metastatic prostate cancer.

      Phase II:

      Determine clinical efficacy in adults with prostate cancer treated with docetaxel in
      combination with Anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap (M7824) and the immunocytokine, M9241.

      For mCSPC participants: Clinical efficacy will be measured by prostate specific antigen (PSA
      <0.2 ng/ml) seven months after start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

      For mCRPC participants: Clinical efficacy will be measured by an increase in their median
      progression free survival (PFS).

      Eligibility:

      Men age >=18 years

      Histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer. If no pathologic specimen is available,
      participants may enroll with a pathologist's report showing a histologic diagnosis of
      prostate cancer and a clinical course consistent with the disease.

      Participants must have metastatic disease

        -  mCSPC participants must be within 134 days of starting ADT.

        -  mCRPC participants must have been previously treated with ADT.

      Design:

      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase I/II study

      To ensure safety of the combination before using in larger numbers of mCSPC and mCRPC
      participants, M9241 will be escalated from a starting dose of 12 mcg/kg and a second dose
      level of 16.8 mcg/kg along with docetaxel. mCSPC participants will receive a maximum of 6
      cycles. mCRPC participants will continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of M9241 has been defined, we will do a safety
      run-in cohort to include another 6 participants to determine the safety of the combination of
      docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 (given every 3 weeks x 6 cycles starting at Cycle 1), with M9241 at the
      RP2D and M7824 (2400 mg), given every 3 weeks from cycle 2 through cycle 6).

      The remaining participants will be enrolled onto the trial in the following expansion
      cohorts, each of which will receive the determined safe dose of M9241.

        -  mCSPC participants: ADT followed by simultaneous docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 (given every 3
           weeks x 6 cycles starting at Cycle 1), with M9241 at the RP2D and M7824 (2400 mg), given
           every 3 weeks from cycle 2 through cycle 6). Prednisone is optional and may be given
           orally at 5 mg once a day. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) may include GnRH agonist
           or monthly degarelix converted to GnRH agonist after 3 months

        -  mCRPC participants: docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 (given every 3 weeks starting at Cycle 1) with
           M9241 at the RP2D and M7824 (2400 mg), given every 3 weeks from cycle 2 onwards until
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Prednisone will be given 5 mg twice a day
           for each dose or 10 mg once a day. ADT will be continued as per standard of care.
           Testosterone suppression will be maintained throughout the study

      It is anticipated that approximately 1.5 to 2 years may be required for accrual of up to 86
      participants.
