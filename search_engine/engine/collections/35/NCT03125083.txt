      psychiatric disorders in skin-restricted lupus (SRL) patients. SRL is an inflammatory
      disease. Inflammation can lead to a decrease in the synthesis of neurotransmitters via the
      activation of the IDO enzyme and to induce the synthesis of neurotoxic molecules (kynurenin
      pathway). This leads to the development of psychiatric disorders.

      Investigator therefore want to compare inflammation and neurotransmitter synthesis in SRL
      patients according to the presence or absence of psychiatric disorders.

      Investigator expect a decrease in neurotransmitter synthesis and activation of the kynurenin
      pathway in patients with a psychiatric disorder.
