      urinary tract symptoms such as hematuria, voiding disorders, irritant bladder symptoms,
      anatomical disorders. Patients experience pain and anxiety when cystoscope is inserted into
      the bladder. The various methods (drug or non-drug) are used for pain and anxiety during the
      cystoscopy. Although there are a lot of studies on male patients, there are limited studies
      evaluating pain severity in the female patients during urological procedures. In addition,
      there wasn't found any randomized controlled study for video use from non-drug methods to
      distract attention in these patients. Based on the study results in the literature,
      investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of watching relaxing video on the pain and anxiety
      levels of female patients during rigid cystoscopy.
