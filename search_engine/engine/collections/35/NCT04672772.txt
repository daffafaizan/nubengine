    
      Retrospective observational study that aims to collect real world data on the cetuximab plus
      paclitaxel regimen as first line treatment for recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with the restriction that the data collection will
      only be clinical data from patients who received paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 as a starting dose with
      weekly cetuximab that could have been switched to biweekly during the maintenance phase.

      The main objective will be to estimate the Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients
      treated with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 as a starting dose, with weekly cetuximab that could have
      been switched to biweekly during the maintenance phase, as first line for recurrent and/or
      metastatic SCCHN.

      Secondary objectives include:

      To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR), Best Overall Response (BOR), Disease Control
      Rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), and safety in patients treated
      with the defined cetuximab plus paclitaxel regimen.

      To evaluate the percentage of long disease-free survivors (defined as patients disease-free
      and alive at 2 years), and evaluate the percentage of long non-disease-free survivors
      (defined as patients not disease free, but alive at 2 years.

      Analyses of patient outcomes by prognostic subgroups.
