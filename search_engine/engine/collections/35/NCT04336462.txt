    
      A multi-center, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical trial design is used in this study.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized into the study group and control group in a 1:1 ratio.
      In addition to the supportive treatments depending on the condition, the subjects in the
      study group will inhale the mixed gas of hydrogen/oxygen (hydrogen concentration 66%, oxygen
      concentration 33%) at a flow rate of 6 L/min every day using the Hydrogen/Oxygen Generator
      with Nebulizer (model AMS-H-03) developed by Shanghai Asclepius Meditech Co., Ltd. during the
      treatment, with the total use of no less than 6 hours per day, and the other combination
      treatments will be decided by the investigator depending on the clinical needs; the subjects
      in the control group will inhale the gas at a flow rate of 2 L/min every day using the
      reference device of EverFlo Oxygen Concentrator (registration certificate No.: NMPA
      Registration Standard: 20162542389) developed by Respironics, Inc. US. during the treatment,
      with the total use of no less than 6 hours per day, and the other combination treatments will
      be decided by the investigator depending on the clinical needs. During the treatment, the
      peripheral blood oxygen saturation should be monitored and the oxygen concentration should be
      increased when necessary (the peripheral oxygen saturation is less than 95% for 30 seconds
      and other causes have been excluded). Oxygen may be supplied by other devices if the oxygen
      concentration is sufficient for the subjects in the study group. The oxygen saturation and
      respiratory rate will be measured at the resting state every day during the treatment, namely
      after the end of daily treatment and 30 minutes after the inhalation of oxygen and
      hydrogen/oxygen.
