      of the two groups either receiving global postural reeducation added to traditional Kendall
      exercises or a group that receives Kendall Exercises only. Treatment sessions will be
      continued for a total of 12 sessions with a rate of 2-3 sessions per week. The effect of
      these two treatments will be assessed by various variables including: forward head angle via
      photogrammetry and Kinovea App, functional abilities via neck disability index, stability of
      sense of position by Cervical Range of Motion instrument (CROM) ,cognitive abilities via
      Stroop and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) tests and agreeability of treatment
      techniques via treatment satisfaction scale.
