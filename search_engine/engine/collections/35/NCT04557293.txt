    
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a very common disease in general population (24% males; 9%
      females), characterized by frequent partial or total upper-airway collapse, intermittent
      hypoxia, arousal from sleep, change in blood pressure, excessive daytime sleepiness,
      cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, psychological and cognitive consequences. The gold
      standard treatment is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), but the adherence is often
      poor. Poor therapy adherence might be partially explained by executive deficits, decreasing
      the ability to plan and pursue longsighted behaviors entailing immediate costs/efforts. We
      investigate the cognitive function, in particular effort based-decision making and the
      relationship with excessive daytime somnolence and other cognitive function in a group of OSA
      patients and in control group. We assess cognitive function in OSA patients at the diagnosis
      moment and after six months of CPAP use.
