    
      This clinical trial is one of three clinical trials of the European Commission (FP7)-funded
      "LENA" (Labeling of Enalapril from Neonates to Adolescents) project: 50 children with heart
      failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (LENA-Work Package (WP)08 Trial) and 50 children with
      heart failure due to congenital heart disease (LENA-WP09 Trial) get treated with an optimal
      dose of enalapril ODMTs for up to 8 weeks after thorough, individualised titration and get
      invited to join this 10 months Safety Follow-up Study (LENA-WP10 Trial).

      Reliable data on the long-term safety of enalapril in paediatric patients are currently not
      available. By conducting this long-term Safety Follow-up Trial in children who received or
      still receive enalapril Orodispersible Minitablets at the end of the 8-weeks PK/PD LENA-Work
      Package (WP)08 (children with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy) and LENA-WP09
      (children with heart failure due to congenital heart disease) Trials using sensitive and
      highly specific assay methodology, it will be possible to add to the generation of reliable
      PK and PD data in the whole paediatric age range from birth to 12 years. In addition, this
      follow-up study will allow to systematically collect follow-up information over 10 more
      months, so in total 12 months, in paediatric patients under long-term enalapril ODMT
      treatment and in paediatric patients who had received at least 3 days of ODMT treatment but
      then stopped for any reason.

      The End-of-study Visit of the WP08 and WP09 Trials is also the First Visit of the Follow-up
      Study. Further Visits occur after 1 month, 4 months, 7 months and 10 months.

      At each Visit blood pressure and renal monitoring as well as pharmacodynamic parameters and
      adverse events are assessed. In children under ongoing enalapril ODMT treatment, single PK
      sampling as well as acceptability and palatability assessments are made at each Visit.
