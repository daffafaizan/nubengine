      congestive heart failure, to be compared with historical control subjects. This study will be
      conducted as a collaborative project between the Sakakibara Heart Institute and the CellBank
      of Japan. The trial is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of autologous
      administration of 1,000,000 c-kit-positive cardiac stem cells (CSCs) via intracoronary route
      following cultivation. The preliminary eligibility criteria will utilize a left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% measured by echocardiography. During the coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, a part (less than 1 gram) of the right atrial
      appendage (RAA) will be harvested and frozen. When the LVEF is less than 40% after the CABG
      surgery, the subject will be enrolled as a candidate for the delivery of CSCs, which will be
      selected from the RAA tissue and cultured for a few months for expansion. The outcome will be
      evaluated by adverse events as well as cardiac functions.
