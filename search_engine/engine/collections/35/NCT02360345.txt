    
      During the dose escalation phase, patients will be enrolled alternately to either:

        -  a q1wk schedule in which ONX-0801 will be administered over a 1-hour IV infusion on Days
           1, 8, 15 and 22 of repeated 28-day treatment cycles; the starting dose will be 1 mg/m2
           for the first cohort; OR

        -  a q2wk schedule in which ONX-0801 will be administered over a 1-hour IV infusion on Days
           1 and 15 of repeated 28-day treatment cycles; the starting dose will be 2 mg/m2 for the
           first cohort;

      Cohorts of 3 patients will receive ONX-0801 at escalating doses on each schedule until a Dose
      Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occur and an Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined for each
      schedule.

      Once the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule has been established, additional
      patients may be recruited in a dose expansion phase to a maximum total of 30 patients to
      further characterize safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics. This subgroup of patients
      will be limited to those expected to have high rates of over expression of α-FR, such as
      patients with ovarian or endometrial, cancer.

      Approximately 66 patients with solid tumours will be entered into this study.

      Dose escalation: Approximately 18 patients in each schedule in the dose escalation phase. The
      final number for the dose escalation phase will depend on the number of dose escalations
      required to reach DLT.

      Dose expansion: Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase, and this
      cohort will be enriched with patients with tumour types expected to have high rates of over
      expression of α-folate receptor, including ovarian and endometrial cancer. A minimum of 20
      patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer will be enrolled.
