    
      Through a prospective trial of frontline HPE in the treatment of early-stage extragastric
      MALToma, investigators will evaluate and investigate the following issues:

        1. The CR and partial remission (PR) rate for antibiotics as 1st-line therapy for stage IE
           and stage IIE extragastric MALToma

        2. The durability of CR and PR (relapse-free survival) after antibiotics treatment (HPE) in
           early-stage extragastric MALToma

        3. The assessment of the evidence of bacterial infection, such as HP, in extragastric
           MALToma.

        4. The identification of potential biomarkers that help us predict whether extragastric
           MALToma can respond to frontline HPE.
