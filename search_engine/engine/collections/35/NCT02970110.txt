      are scheduled for routine upper endoscopy for symptoms such as dyspepsia. This study will be
      conducted at a minimum of 2 sites in the United States. Investigator sites will enroll
      prospective subjects who meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria. A case report form (CRF)
      provided by the sponsor will be used to capture basic demographic information (DOB, age,
      gender, race/ethnicity), medication history, and related clinical information. The CRFs will
      also record the results of the following tests performed with the gastric biopsy tissue
      specimens: histology and rapid urease test (RUT).
