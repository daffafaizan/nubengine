      Demographic data is collected pre-operatively along with the Harris Hip Score and UCLA
      Activity Score. Operative information includes the surgical technique and other standard
      operative information. Follow-up information includes the Harris Hip Score, UCLA Activity
      Score, and Radiographic data. Anterior/posterior and frog leg lateral X-ray data is recorded
      to show radiolucencies, component position and angles. Sites are also required to send in an
      Anterior/Posterior Pelvis x-ray for wear analysis. Implant durability is documented by asking
      the surgeon to record revisions, complications, and device related adverse events. All
      information collected is de-identified in compliance with HIPAA regulations.
