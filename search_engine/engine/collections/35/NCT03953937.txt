      January 2000 to December 2013 were enrolled. Characteristics were compared between
      early-onset idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (EOICP) and late-onset idiopathic chronic
      pancreatitis (LOICP) patients. Cumulative rates of diabetes mellitus, steatorrhea, pancreatic
      stone, pancreatic pseudocyst (PPC), biliary stricture, and pancreatic cancer after the onset
      and the diagnosis of ICP were calculated, respectively. Different cut-off values for age at
      onset of ICP were set to classify EOICP and LOICP. Then differences of clinical courses
      between EOICP and LOICP were compared when classified by distinct cut-off values.
