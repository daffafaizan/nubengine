      combined with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Despite aggressive therapy, however,
      nearly 50% of patients will relapse within 24 months of diagnosis. Furthermore, the
      application of high-dose methotrexate-based regimen is complex, needing be hydrated,
      alkalified and detoxified, and treatment-related toxicity mortality is severe[3,4]. In an
      attempt to improve upon these poor results and reduce treatment-related side effects, we will
      treat about 15-20 PCNSL patients with temozolomide concurrent chemoradiotherapy at the outset
      and then adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 cycles with temozolomide, nedaplatin, vincristine, as
      part of front-line therapy. Our objective is to assess our treatment strategies' availability
      based on response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), median PFS, and toxicity.
