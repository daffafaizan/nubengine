    
      This randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study consisted of 2 phases: a 24-month
      double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study and an
      Extension phase which consisted of a dose-blinded period and an open-label period.

      In the Core phase, patients were randomized to receive a fixed dose of fingolimod (0.5
      mg/day), fingolimod (1.25 mg/day) or placebo for up to 24 months.

      For the Extension phase, patients who were treated with fingolimod during the Core phase
      continued treatment at the assigned dose level, while those previously treated with placebo
      during the Core phase were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the two doses of
      fingolimod (1.25 mg or 0.5 mg). All patients in the extension received blinded
      investigational drug: fingolimod 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg in capsules for oral administration once
      daily until the decision to discontinue the fingolimod 1.25 mg dose became effective and
      subsequently all patients were switched to open-label fingolimod 0.5 mg.

      With the implementation of Amendment 11, the 1.25 mg dose was discontinued and all patients
      were switched to fingolimod 0.5 mg dose. With the implementation of Amendment 12, all
      patients treated with Placebo in the fingolimod Core phase were switched to treatment with
      0.5 mg fingolimod per day. The Extension phase continued until all patients either
      discontinued or transferred to Study CFTY720D2399 (NCT01201356; initiated in September 2010).
