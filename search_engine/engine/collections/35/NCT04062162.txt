    
      This study was design as a randomized controlled trial, with two study arms, which aims to
      analyse the feasibility, safety of a supervised walking football program in patients with
      PCa. Moreover, the effects on health-related quality of life; bone mineral density; body
      composition; physical fitness; physical activity levels; inflammatory and metabolic profile;
      cognitive function; and cost-effectiveness will be complementarily analysed.

      Recruitment will be conducted by invitation of Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho
      (CHVNG/E; Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal, E.P.E) oncologists and urologists. Patients who agree
      to participate in this study will be referred to a study coordinator (medical oncologist) and
      will be randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to one of the two study-arms.

      In addition to standard PCa care, patients in the interventional group (IG) will perform 3
      times per week a supervised Walking Football Program over 16 weeks and plus 16 additional
      weeks.

      Patients allocated to control group (CG) will receive standard PCa medical care and will be
      instructed to maintain daily-life routines. After the first 16 weeks, the control group
      patients' will be invited to join and preform the exercise intervention (additional 16
      weeks).

      Walking football exercise sessions will be conducted on an indoor sports hall, supervised by
      one exercise physiologist and a football coach. Exercise intensity will be monitored through
      heart rate and rated perceived exertion.
