      reducing opioid consumption and controlling postoperative pain. This opioid reducing effect
      can be associated with reduction of the incidence of PONV. However, the effect of magnesium
      on preventing PONV have not been investigated before. Thus, the investigators hypothesized
      that intraoperative infusion of magnesium will be effective in preventing PONV in patients
      undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.
