      during 2014-15 were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive 75 mg oral diclofenac or
      placebo 1 hour prior to procedure by double blind randomization. Intraurethral 2% lignocaine
      jelly (25 ml) was used in both groups. Pain during rigid cystoscopy, pain at first void and
      at 24 hours after cystoscopy was assessed using visual analogue scale [VAS] (0 to 100).
      Adverse reactions to diclofenac and episodes of acute urinary retention, if any, were
      assessed.
