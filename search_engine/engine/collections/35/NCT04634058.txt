      extremely poor. The median overall survival of first-line gemcitabine and cisplatin for
      advanced biliary tumors (including ICC) is only 11.7 months. Currently, there is no standard
      second-line or third-line treatment for advanced ICC, and there is an urgent need to develop
      new treatment methods to improve patient survival. Chronic inflammation caused by viral
      infections and bile duct stones is the most common potential risk factor for ICC. The
      abnormal immune system plays a key role in the occurrence and development of ICC. The immune
      checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are overexpressed in ICC, and they are obviously
      heterogeneous, so immunotherapy has potential value. Immune checkpoint inhibitors against
      PD-1/PD-L1 show a good objective remission rate in advanced biliary tumors (including ICC).
      CTLA-4 inhibitors combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors show significant clinical enhancement
      Role, CTLA-4 inhibitors combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been clinically studied in a
      number of solid tumors. In this phase II clinical study, we will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of PD-L1 monoclonal antibody combined with CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody in patients with
      advanced ICC who progressed after standard treatment.
