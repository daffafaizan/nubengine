      Hypertension is a well-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease in adults.
      Furthermore, many studies have shown that there is tracking among longitudinal pediatric
      blood pressure determinations. An important unresolved goal in pediatric hypertension
      research is to define at what level of pediatric blood pressure is a child at increased risk
      for adult hypertension. When the grant was awarded in February 1991, there had been two NHLBI
      Task Forces in Blood Pressure Control in Children which had published reports in 1977 and
      1987. One of the goals of each task force was to define appropriate percentiles for blood
      pressure in children. In the Second Task Force Report, results from nine large epidemiologic
      studies were combined into a data base with more than 70,000 readings from which blood
      pressure percentiles were derived as a function of age and sex. However, many research
      workers stated that height is more strongly related to blood pressure than age and have urged
      that Normative data for pediatric blood pressure be demarcated by height rather than age.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Blood pressure percentiles were constructed that were a function of age, sex, race, and
      height, thus providing a more comprehensive profile of pediatric blood pressure distributions
      than any previously published work.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
