      sensations and feared situations, which have been demonstrated to be effective for many
      individuals with panic disorder.

      All assessments and treatment sessions are free of charge. Half of the patients will be
      randomly assigned to receive D-cycloserine (DCS) and half wll be assigned to receive a
      placebo. Although DCS is used in humans to treat tuberculosis, it has not been FDA approved
      for this indication. Recent research in other anxiety disorders has shown that DCS plus
      behavior therapy is more effective than behavior therapy alone.

      This treatment study had two active interventions. All patients will receive CBT and the
      researchers expect that everybody will improve from this treatment. However, it may be that
      those patients in the DCS intervention will improve somewhat more than those in the placebo
      intervention.

      The treatment will be structured with at home practice and repeated assessments. Assessments
      are extremely important as they guide the treatment and provide the study investigators
      necessary information about the treatment. The treatment consists of 5 sessions (once a week)
      plus a one week post-treatment assessment and follow-up assessments at one month and six
      months.
