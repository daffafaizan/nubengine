      developed based upon the Message Interpretation Processing model designed to increase
      children's critical thinking skills about media messages and reduce intent to use tobacco and
      alcohol products. The purpose of this study was to conduct a short-term randomized controlled
      trial study to evaluate the effectiveness of Media Detective for achieving these goals.
