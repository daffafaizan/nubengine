      technology in reducing air pollutant exposure and the anticipated concomitant health impacts.
      High ambient levels of various air pollutants in the Shanghai area serve as a useful model to
      test the portable air purifier intervention in a realistic setting. As most people using a
      portable air purifier would only be able to do so in their residences, the investigators have
      designed our study only to test residential air purifier use. Our hypothesis is that the
      reduction in pollutant concentrations in indoor air caused by the air purifier will result in
      measurable reductions in risk factors for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
