    
      To determine the incidence of gastric ulcers following administration of PN 400 in a high
      risk population over six months. Diclofenac/misoprostol will be used as a positive control.

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the incidence of duodenal ulcers during treatment with PN 400 and
           diclofenac/misoprostol in a high risk population

        -  To evaluate the degree of upper gastrointestinal injury as measured by Lanza scores
           (1991) during treatment with PN400 and diclofenac/misoprostol in a high risk population

        -  To compare gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects treated with PN 400 versus
           diclofenac/misoprostol as measured by scores on the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating
           Scale (GSRS) instrument

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PN400 and diclofenac/misoprostol in a high
           risk population
