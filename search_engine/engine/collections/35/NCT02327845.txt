      incident cases. Patients with both familial and sporadic forms of these diseases will be
      enrolled and followed longitudinally using a standardized set of evaluations. Biological
      samples (blood, urine, CSF) will be collected from all study participants, and will be used
      for biomarker discovery and validation. Family members of affected individuals may also be
      enrolled and asked to contribute DNA and biological samples to aid genetic and biomarker
      discovery.
