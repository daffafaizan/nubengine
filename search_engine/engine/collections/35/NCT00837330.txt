      single-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, consecutive interventional case series. Enrolled
      patients are >35 years old and display exudative, active polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy
      (PCV) in 1 eye. PCV is defined as choroidal neovascularization that displays occult
      characteristics on fluorescein angiography and polypoidal interconnecting vascular channels
      with saccular dilatations on indocyanine green angiography and/or fluorescein angiography.
      Eyes receive 3 consecutive, monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg or 0.3
      mg/0.05 cc) followed by monthly evaluations with the option of additional intravitreal
      ranibizumab or alternative treatments at the discretion of the investigator. Baseline and
      follow-up evaluations include medical history, blood pressure, physical examination, early
      treatment diabetic rentinopathy study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      intraocular pressure measurement, complete ophthalmologic examination, fundus photography,
      fluorescein/ indocyanine green (ICG) angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
