      extensive (metastatic) disease.[1] It frequently has micrometastatic disease at presentation.
      Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment with radiotherapy to the primary tumour. It is now
      part of care to offer Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI)with 25 Gy in 10 fractions
      dependent on the extent of response in the primary tumour and the patient's performance
      status. PCI is routine care for limited stage patients showing response and can be considered
      in selected patients with limited stage disease showing good response.Somnolence syndrome is
      a common intermediate side effect of cranial radiotherapy that occurs about six weeks after
      treatment and manifests as lethargy, increased sleepiness and poor attention or subtle memory
      changes and altered temperament[2].

      The use of cranial irradiation is linked to neurocognitive complications such as long term
      memory, mood and concentration issues[3]. Decline in attention, executive function, motor,
      language and general intellectual skills have all been reported. There is the suggestion of a
      more rapid progression of dementing illness in patients receiving cranial irradiation
      although the numbers of long term survivors is limited[3]. Radiation mediates neurocognitive
      effects by affecting glial cells, neural stem and progenitor cells[4, 5] and the vascular
      structures[3, 6]. Cranial irradiation delivered to mice has been shown to reduce neural
      proliferation translating to long term reduction in neurogenesis[7, 8]. Lithium confers
      neuroprotection and is associated with less cognitive loss in various brain injury models
      including after cranial irradiation[9, 10]. In addition, neural stem/progenitor cells
      positively respond to Lithium treatment under basal conditions[11, 12]. In humans, 4 weeks of
      Lithium increases brain grey matter content[13] and hippocampal volume[14] as evidenced by
      MRI scanning. Lithium was found to protect irradiated hippocampal neurons in mice from
      apoptosis resulting in better performance reflecting learning and memory function[10].
      Lithium is known to reduce oxidative stress, specifically via the glutathione system. Lithium
      is a standard part of the management of moderate to severe bipolar disorder and
      schizoaffective disorders and its toxicity profile is well understood[15, 16]. In bipolar
      disorder, lithium has been shown to prevent the loss of cortical grey matter that occurs as
      part of the neuroprogressive cascade seen in the disorder[17]. There is limited prospective
      clinical data regarding the use of lithium as a neuroprotectant. A large Danish observational
      cohort study, demonstrated that use of lithium (in those with mood disorders, who display an
      increased risk for dementia) was associated with reduction of the rate of dementia to the
      same level as that for the general population[18]. A follow up study by the same group showed
      similar findings[19]. A metaanalysis of lithium on cognitive performance demonstrated minor
      negative effects on cognition[20]. There has been one early phase study using lithium as a
      neuroprotective agent presented in abstract form at the 2007 American Society for Therapeutic
      Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO)[21] and updated at the 2008 annual meeting of the Society of
      NeuroOncology (SNO)[22].

      Long term lithium treatment has also shown promise in amnestic mild cognitive impairment in a
      study that randomized 45 participants to receive lithium (0.25-0.5 mmol/l) (n = 24) or
      placebo (n = 21) in a 12 month, doubleblind trial[23]. Lithium treatment was associated with
      a significant decrease in CSF concentrations of Ptau(P =0.03) and better performance on the
      cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale and in attention tasks. The
      data support the notion that lithium has disease modifying properties with potential clinical
      implications in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.[23]
