      laser photocoagulation will not only improve the survival of twins but will reduce the
      incidence of neurologic, cardiac, and developmental sequelae of twin-twin transfusion
      syndrome (TTTS). We propose to test this hypothesis by a prospective randomized multicenter
      trial to compare serial amnioreduction with selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation in
      cases of severe (stage II-IV) twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Primary Outcomes:
      Survival of donor twin at 30 days after birth and no treatment failure; Survival of recipient
      twin at 30 days after birth and no treatment failure; Secondary Outcomes: Survival times of
      each twin in utero or after birth (which may be censored at 30 days after birth); Gestational
      age at delivery; Placental insufficiency; Cardiac outcome: echocardiographic evidence of
      cardiac compromise; Neurologic outcome: evidence of brain injury preceding birth by MRI;
      Postnatal comorbidity
