        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with bevacizumab, fluorouracil, and
           leucovorin calcium for stage IV colorectal cancer that has progressed after standard
           chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of administering "bolus" and continuous infusion fluorouracil and
           leucovorin calcium in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive 1 of 2 treatment
      regimens.

        -  Regimen I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on days 1, 15, 29, and 42 (every 2 weeks) and
           leucovorin calcium (CF) IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil (5-FU) IV bolus on days 1, 8,
           15, 22, 29, and 36.

        -  Regimen II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in regimen I and CF IV over 2 hours and 5-FU
           IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion over 22 hours on days 1, 2, 15, 16, 29, 30,
           43, and 44.

      For both regimens, courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for tumor response and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Various NCI-designated Clinical Cancer Centers and other medical
      institutions across the United States will participate in this study. A total of 35-125
      patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months.
