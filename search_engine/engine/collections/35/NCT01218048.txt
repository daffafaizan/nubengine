      patients is being conducted in order to obtain specimens before and after 4 weeks of
      cetuximab for immune biomarker studies. Stage III/IV HNC patients will be treated with
      definitive surgical resection and observed for disease recurrence. Cetuximab will be
      administered for a 3-4 week preoperative period to study biomarker modulation in correlation
      clinical response by CT scan and tumor apoptosis/proliferation after tumor excision,
      immediately after neoadjuvant cetuximab but before surgery. We will biopsy the skin/acneiform
      rash in all patients to correlate rash with biomarker modulation and clinical response.
      Cetuximab may also be given in the adjuvant setting. A primary scientific hypothesis will be
      tested: does short term pre-operative exposure to cetuximab modulate blood immune biomarkers
      and is immune modulation associated with anti-tumor effect? Forty (n=40) patients with
      complete specimens (tumor, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum) are necessary
      to enable adequate statistical power to be reached using paired specimens. A secondary set of
      hypotheses will evaluate the association between pre-operative biomarker levels and
      modulation with disease recurrence. The proposed trial will accrue stage II, III or IV
      surgical candidates without distant metastasis.
