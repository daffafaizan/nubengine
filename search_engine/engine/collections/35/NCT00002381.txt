      with NNRTI and protease inhibitor classes of antiretroviral drugs and have <= 6 months prior
      exposure to d4T at the time of screening. Part I of this trial is an investigation of
      potential pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and nelfinavir in HIV-1-infected
      adults treated with d4T. Part II is an investigation of the long-term antiviral activity of
      the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir on viral load as measured by HIV-1 RNA.
