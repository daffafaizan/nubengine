      of randomization is the clinician. Up to fifty cardiology clinicians will be randomly
      assigned to either the coaching intervention or to a control condition. The investigators
      will recruit up to 50 clinicians to ensure that we have at least 40 clinicians with complete
      pre- and post-intervention measures. Although the unit of randomization is the clinician, the
      unit of evaluation is the patient: 10 patients per clinician who get cardiology care from the
      enrolled clinicians will consent to audio-recording of their encounters and to completing the
      surveys. Clinicians randomized to the intervention will obtain verbal consent from additional
      patients to audio-record the encounter for coaching. The intervention will be delivered in
      the clinic or via video-conference (Skype or Facetime), providing individual coaching and
      professional feedback on the communication behaviors encounters. The investigators will also
      measure Press Ganey scores by clinician pre- and post-intervention.
