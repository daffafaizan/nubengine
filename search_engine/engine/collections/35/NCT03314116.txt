    
      1. Auditory screening examination using an OAE (Oto Acoustic Emission) device during the
           first week of training in the unit and before starting to be exposed to noise .

        2. If the indication obtained by the OAE device is negative, the soldier will be
           transferred to perform an audiometer test by a medic.

        3. If the audiometer is subjected to a significant drop (over 25 decibels), the soldier
           will be referred to an audiologic examination that includes a comprehensive hearing test
           and an examination by the ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat).

        4. All participants will be randomly assigned to two groups after signing an agreement
           form:

           A - The video group - will be guided by a screening of a 7 minute video that explains
           the importance of using ear plugs and correct installation.

           B- The control group, will be instructed to use earplugs properly, including practical
           exercises by a medic.

        5. After two months of training, all participants will undergo further instruction in the
           use of earplugs, the video clip group and the control group trained by a medic only,

        6. Towards the end of the training After six months of the recruitment, the investigators
           will perform an additional hearing test for all the participants in order to compare the
           results to the examination performed near their recruitment. Similar to the first stage,
           the test will be performed using an OAE device.

        7. A comparison shall be made in the auditory results data between the group that underwent
           training via video and the control group.
