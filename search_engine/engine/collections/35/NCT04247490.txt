      with typical onset in pediatric age. It is currently divided into types 1 and 2,
      differentiated and defined by the presence of specific autoantibodies. AIH type 1 (AIH-1) is
      characterised by smooth muscle and/or antinuclear autoantibodies (SMA/ANA) while anti-liver
      kidney microsomal (anti-LKM) or liver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1) identified AIH type 2
      (AIH-2). The conventional treatment is based on corticosteroids and azathioprine as first
      line therapy. The optimal duration is not clear definied, however it should be extended for
      at least five years due to the frequent relapses.

      Aims of the study: The primary objective is to describe the prevalence and incidence of type
      1 and 2 autoimmune hepatitis on a selected italian pediatric population. Secondary objectives
      are to analyze the clinical, biochemical and histopathological profiles at diagnosis and
      follow-up, type of treatment received, response to therapy and long-term follow-up.

      Methods: The investigators conducted a retrospective and prospective cohort study on patients
      aged â‰¤ 18 years who the diagnosis of AIH 1 and 2 between 01/01/1989 and 31/12/2019 and were
      followed in three Italian pediatric centers.
