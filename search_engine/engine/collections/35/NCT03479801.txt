      excellent cosmetic and several functional results. Many patients, especially women,
      undergoing thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the
      neck. Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy via vestibular approach (TOETVA) and endoscopic
      thyroidectomy via breast approach were routinely performed in our institute. The procedures
      of total endoscopic thyroidectomy by breast approach only left three incisions, while by oral
      approach did not leave any incisions in the body surface, which is scarless in the neck,
      involved with a higher cosmetic result. However, the comprehensive comparison between
      transoral approach, breast approach and conventional open method was not confirmed. The
      purpose of our study was to evaluate the surgical results of total endoscopic thyroidectomy
      (transoral approach and breast approach) versus conventional open thyroidectomy.
