      expansion phase. Paediatric/young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL will
      be enrolled. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which
      is the starting material for the manufacture. Autologous CAR T product directed against
      CD19-expressing tumor cells (CD19-CART01) will be produced and, after a lymphodepletion with
      conventional chemoterapic agents, the patient will receive CD19-CART01 intravenously. The
      construct contains also the suicide gene safety switch "inducible Caspase 9"; therefore, in
      case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in order to induce
      the apoptosis of the cells.

      After the treatment, the patients will then enter a 36-month follow-up period.
