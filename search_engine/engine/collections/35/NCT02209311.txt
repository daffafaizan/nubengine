      undergo oral mucosa biopsy and autologous MMSCs will be derived and expanded in vitro during
      3-4 weeks. After that tissue engineered construction will be created using synthetic
      tricalcium phosphate and autologous MMSCs. Patients will undergo sinus lift procedure with
      implantation of created tissue-engineered construction. Six months later patients will
      undergo dental implant installation. Biopsy of bone tissue at the site of sinus lift will be
      performed as a part of dental implant installation with subsequent histological analysis of
      bone specimen.
