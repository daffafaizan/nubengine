      referral Centres for the treatment of endometriosis completed a questionnaire regarding their
      previous pregnancies. The same questionnaire was completed by women, attending a routine
      gynecologic visit, in whom surgery or vaginal examination and pelvic ultrasonography excluded
      endometriosis.
