      aortic root aneurysms who underwent deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (18 degrees) and did
      not undergo cerebral perfusion. However, neurological changes that are reflected in the
      clinic are not always encountered. Using preoperative and postoperative diffusion magnetic
      resonance imaging, silent ischemic lesions that are not reflected in the clinic can be
      detected. Although there are studies using DW-MRI in patients undergoing different cerebral
      protection methods in the literature, there are no studies conducted on patients who
      underwent deep hypothermic circulatory arrest without cerebral perfusion.

      To detect silent ischemic lesions with preoperative and postoperative diffusion magnetic
      resonance method in patients with ascending aortic and aortic root aneurysms undergoing deep
      hypothermic circulatory arrest (18 degrees) and without cerebral perfusion, and to
      investigate the correlation between preoperative and postoperative neuron-specific enolase
      levels and serbral findings.

      Cerebral ischemic lesions that may occur in patients undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory
      arrest (18 degrees) and undergoing ascending aortic and aortic root aneurysm surgery without
      cerebral perfusion will be detected, and the clinical follow-up and treatment of the patients
      will be better managed.

      We base the imaging of diffusion MR among the examinations to be performed on literature
      studies that show that withdrawal of patients in the early postoperative period (3rd-7th
      days) due to the surgical method to be performed without cerebral perfusion under deep
      hypothermic circulatory arrest, increases the specificity and sensitivity of the test.
      Therefore, the application of diffusion MR imaging in the early postoperative period (3rd-7th
      days) after a surgical technique performed under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (18
      degrees) without cerebral perfusion constitutes an indication for diffusion MR in order to
      detect cerebral ischemic lesions in the early period. Therefore, diffusion MR imaging to be
      taken in the early period (3rd-7th days) will provide us with the opportunity to create an
      effective algorithm in terms of patient treatment and follow-up.
