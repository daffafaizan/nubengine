      to exert anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. It has also been shown that
      acupuncture can provide a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis. It is anticipated that
      the combination of Epigenome-Antivir and acupuncture will reduce pain, inflammatory and
      metabolic markers in patients with OA and metabolic syndrome.
