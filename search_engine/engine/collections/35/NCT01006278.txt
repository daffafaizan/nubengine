      prognostic indicators, and surrogate endpoints for therapeutic trials. This study describes a
      novel complex of structural degradation proteins which are present in the knees of patients
      with meniscal pathology.

      Methods: This prospective cohort study included 30 patients with knee pain, mechanical
      symptoms, and MRI positive for meniscus tear who elected for arthroscopic partial
      meniscectomy after failing conservative management. Synovial fluid was aspirated at the time
      of surgery and assayed for a complex of structural degradation proteins by means of
      heterogeneous ELISA. The results were compared to knee aspirates from 10 asymptomatic
      volunteers with no pain. The complex was identified by a proteomic analysis of including
      multiplexed-bead immunoassay, purification by anion exchange and size exclusion
      chromatography, and mass spectrometry of individual chromatographic fractions.
