      mental health care. It has the highest suicide rate in the nation. Of Montana's 56 counties,
      10 are classified as rural and 45 as frontier, accentuating distance challenges in accessing
      care. New treatment delivery modalities are needed to complement, supplement and augment
      traditional mental health care. With increase in access to the Internet,
      computer-administered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (cCBT) programs have emerged as viable
      approaches to effective treatment of depression.

      Thrive is an interactive cCBT program with a heavy emphasis on video rather than text content
      that appears to improve participant engagement, a shortcoming seen in prior cCBT programs.

      The goal of this project is to conduct a randomized wait-list controlled of Thrive to
      determine its effectiveness in reducing depressive symptom severity among Montanans, many of
      whom have few or no other options for mental health treatment.
