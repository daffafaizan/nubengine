      critically ill patients, taking advantages of spontaneous breathing and better
      patient-ventilator interaction.

      The standard treatment in patients with acute respiratory failure is mechanical ventilation
      in control-mode for the first days of acute illness. This procedure is usually associated
      with patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, higher needs of sedation and/or relaxation, muscle
      atrophy, etc. PAV + is a new ventilatory mode that applies pressure in proportion to
      spontaneous patient inspiratory effort allowing better adaptation to changes in internal
      homeostasis.

      Up to now, several reports compare PAV with assisted modes as a feasible alternative only in
      the weaning phase. However, PAV is able to unload patient effort in different levels,
      suggesting that high-assistance PAV (about 80%) could be comparable with assist-control modes
      in terms of respiratory muscles unload.

      Whether PAV is as effective as traditional ACV in terms of ventilation muscle unload in the
      acute phase of illness has not been established and we aim to address this question.

      We plan to prospectively enroll patients on mechanical ventilation early at ICU admission,
      and to ventilate them randomly under ACV (volume-assist control ventilation) or PAV+
      (beginning with 80% if possible). We will evaluate length of mechanical ventilation, sedation
      requirements and respiratory-hemodynamic variables from the very beginning and until
      attending clinicians decide that patients are ready to be weaned.
