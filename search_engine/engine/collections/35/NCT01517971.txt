      I. To develop and validate a clinically useful molecular prognostic signature based on
      ribonucleic acid (RNA)-expression arrays to accurately distinguish between good and poor
      outcome in patients with stage 1B non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (T2aN0M0) by predicting
      the risk of cancer recurrence after surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop and validate a clinically useful prognostic signature for stage 1A NSCLC
      (T1a-bN0M0) that accurately predicts the risk of post-operative cancer recurrence and is part
      of a prognostic classifier, which also includes histological, pathological, and demographic
      parameters as in the primary objective.

      II. To determine the effects on test accuracy of the histological subtype (adenocarcinoma
      [AC] vs squamous cell [SQA]) for each of the stage specific prognostic classifiers.

      III. To determine the relevant statistical features, including accuracy of predicting overall
      survival, cancer specific survival, and disease free survival at 3 and 5 years, for each of
      the prognostic classifiers validated.

      IV. To utilize the validated prognostic signatures and classifiers in stage 1B NSCLC to
      determine whether these can reliably predict good outcome among stage II NSCLC patients.

      OUTLINE:

      RNA extracted from archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for whole-genome expression by
      Affymetrix microarrays (Gene Profiling Array cGMP U133 P2) and reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
