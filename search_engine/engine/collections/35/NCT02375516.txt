      of Hispanic Americans are less than 18 years old. Unfortunately, young Hispanic Americans are
      an at-risk population more likely than their majority culture peers to drop out of school,
      become involved in the criminal justice system, fall prey to violence, and face lifelong
      economic problems. Hispanic youths are also at risk for early drug use and subsequent harmful
      use and abuse. As early as eighth grade and relative to their Black and White peers, Hispanic
      adolescents report higher rates of most harmful substances. Drug use continues to pose
      problems for Hispanic youths throughout adolescence and into adulthood.
