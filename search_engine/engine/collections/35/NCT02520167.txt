      limit gestational weight gain and prevent gestational diabetes. The intervention is based on
      the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention, will include prenatal breastfeeding
      education and online peer group support, and will be integrated into the participants'
      regular prenatal appointments. Women (n=24) will be enrolled in early pregnancy. After
      baseline assessments (demographics, maternal diet, physical activity, mental health), women
      randomized equally to the intervention or usual care conditions. Further data collection will
      occur at approximately 24 weeks gestation, 36 weeks gestation, and 6 weeks postpartum, and
      clinical data (weight, pregnancy and obstetric complications) will be abstracted from medical
      records at the end of the study. Outcomes include reach and dose of the intervention,
      gestational weight gain, dietary intake, physical activity, and breastfeeding in the first 6
      weeks postpartum. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will reduce gestational
      weight gain, improve maternal dietary intake, increase total energy expenditure, and increase
      breastfeeding exclusivity in the first 6 weeks postpartum.
