      enhance clearance of lung edema and decrease pulmonary inflammation in patients with acute
      lung injury. Because beta-2 agonists have been shown to reduce permeability induced lung
      injury, it is anticipated that the severity of lung injury will be reduced by aerosolized
      beta-2 agonist therapy. The therapy may work by enhancing resolution of pulmonary edema by
      upregulating alveolar epithelial fluid transport mechanisms that will in turn enhance the
      clearance of alveolar edema. A reduction in the severity of lung injury and the quantity of
      alveolar edema should result in earlier extubation and more ventilator free days, improved
      pulmonary oxygen uptake, and improved lung compliance.

      Study design: phase II/III prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial.

        -  In Phase II, patients will be treated with aerosolized albuterol 5.0 mg vs. normal
           saline (n=40-50)administered every 4 hours for 10 days following randomization or until
           24 hours following extubation, whichever occurs first. The protocol stipulates that the
           5.0 mg dose will be reduced to 2.5 mg if patients exceed defined heart rate limits.

        -  In Phase III, the 5.0 mg dose will be used unless there is evidence that this dose has
           an unacceptable safety profile or dose reductions for tachycardia occur in a large
           fraction of patients. In that case, a lower dose of 2.5 mg will be used.

        -  Patients will be followed for 90 days or until discharge from the hospital to home with
           unassisted breathing whichever occurs first.
