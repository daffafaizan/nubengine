        -  Compare the complete pathological response rate and/or minimal residual microscopic
           disease in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer treated with preoperative
           paclitaxel and carboplatin with vs without celecoxib.

        -  Compare the clinical response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare chemotherapy-related toxicity in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the time to progression, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to use of aspirin for prior cardiovascular disease (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on
           days 1, 22, and 43. Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1
           and continuing until the morning of surgical resection.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I and an oral placebo
           twice daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until the morning of surgical resection.

      In both arms, patients undergo surgical resection and complete mediastinal lymph node
      dissection within 3-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. Patients resume oral celecoxib
      or placebo twice daily within 28-42 days after surgery and continue until 3 years from the
      date of randomization in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients (55 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
