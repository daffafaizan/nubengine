    
      This single center study to include approximately 50 to 250 participants is designed to
      estimate the likelihood of NAb seroconversion to AAV9 because of exposure to shed viral
      vector material released by a DMD participant treated with PF-06939926 in study C3391003.
      Eligible participants will undergo a blood draw provided by a Home Health Care Vendor at
      three home visits.

      To maintain the blinded nature of study C3391003, all C3391007 study participants and
      investigators as well as the sponsor will remain blinded to the Cohort assignment of the
      C3391003 study participant in the same household until C3391003 becomes unblinded.
      Additionally, the detailed individual results will be considered sensitive clinical data and
      will not be shared with the participants, investigators, or the Sponsor until study C3391003
      becomes unblinded.

      The total duration of participation in the study is up to 4 months, including up to 48 days
      for the screening/baseline period and up to 66 days after dosing of investigational product
      in the C3391003 participant of the same household.
