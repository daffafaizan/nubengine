      scleral buckling and silicone scleral buckling in the treatment of RRD. It is a multi-center
      clinical study and is designed according to a randomized, controlled, and single-blind
      clinical research protocol. Before surgery, the retinal tear in the FCB group and the control
      group of RRD patients should be examined and precise positioned by fundus photography, and
      the relevant results will be determined by the third-party reading center to confirm that the
      patients can accept such surgery.

      The key instrument required by the FCB group is FCB. During FCB implantation, 1 ml of basic
      Ringer's solution will be injected as FCB, and then the balloon filled, so that the outer
      surface of the balloon is in close contact with the sclera, and the top The function of
      scleral compression helps to close the hiatus. The key surgical instrument used in the
      control group is silicone, but it does not require ring surgery. Silicone is also fixed to
      the outer surface of the sclera. After the conjunctiva and Tenon 's sac separated, the
      primary endpoint will be evaluated three months after surgery, and both groups will be
      followed up to one year after surgery. Relevant data will be collected and kept by full-time
      personnel, and then the statistical analysis of the data will be used to evaluate the safety,
      effectiveness, and operability of FCB implantation, and compare the treatment effect with the
      control group.
