      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery to high-risk tumor
           regions and conventional radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the absence of tumor growth and/or activity on conventional MR/MR spectroscopy
           imaging in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) CNS
           toxic effects in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the neurologic function and quality of life of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to high-risk areas of active tumor determined by
      MR-spectroscopy. No more than 2 weeks later, patients undergo conventional radiotherapy once
      daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, at 1 and 3 months after
      completion of radiotherapy, and then every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and annually thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
