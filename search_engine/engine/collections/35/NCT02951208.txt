      expression are prominent in youth at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Negative
      symptoms lead to significant functional impairment and enduring disability in these youth
      regardless of subsequent conversion to psychosis. At present, there are no established
      treatments for negative symptoms. Recent evidence from independent studies, however, suggests
      two promising novel treatment approaches for negative symptoms, transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS), and computerized remediation strategies, both of which have revealed
      significant therapeutic effects on negative symptoms in schizophrenia (SZ). tDCS involves
      delivery of a low intensity continuous electrical field to the frontal cortex. tDCS is very
      safe and well tolerated, and is currently being investigated as a treatment for several
      psychiatric disorders. tDCS is also Health Canada approved for the treatment of major
      depressive disorder. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if
      tDCS combined with a virtual reality-based computerized remediation (VR), administered three
      times per week for four weeks, is effective for treating negative symptoms in CHR youth,
      thereby mitigating the enduring functional disability these symptoms cause.
