      care clinics at Klang Valley, with 27 subjects in each arms. All post-partum women at 4 to 24
      weeks, registered at these clinics, were screened using self-administered Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale for symptoms of depression. Those who scored 12 or more and/or positive for
      question on suicidal behaviour, were interviewed by trained Research Assistants using Mini
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a diagnostic interview tool. Those with mild to
      moderate depression were invited to join this study, while severe depressed cases were
      referred to the Family Medicine Specialist for appropriate management. Consented eligible
      women were randomized into either control group; managed by Medical Officers alone, or
      intervention group; managed by both Medical Officers and trained nurses. Medical officers
      were given standard refresher course on Postnatal Depression management based on Clinical
      Practice Guideline while nurses were trained using brief cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)
      module, which consists of 6 modules for 6 weekly sessions. Depression level and its severity
      were assessed using self-administered Beck's Depression Index (BDI) and Automatic Thought
      Questionnaire (ATQ), at Baseline, Week 3 and Week 6.
