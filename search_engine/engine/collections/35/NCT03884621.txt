      post-discharge home-based care program (EHP) to address the challenges facing China on
      post-stroke care. The study will adopt a randomized controlled trial design to assess the
      effects of the EHP compared with usual care for post-discharged stroke survivors. Economic
      evaluation will be parallel with the trial.

      Eligible participants will be recruited from the neurology units of a large general hospital
      in Harbin, China. Consented participants will be randomly assigned to receive either usual
      care or usual care plus EHP intervention. The EHP has two key components: pre-discharge
      coaching and post-discharge home follow-up which involves five intervention protocols for
      assessment, treatment and procedures, teaching, guidance and counselling, case management and
      surveillance, addressing on home-based rehabilitation training and self-care. The 12-week EHP
      will be provided by a trained nurse case manager with the support of a clinical team. All
      participants will be follow-up for 12 months with three assessments on study outcomes,
      including quality of life, self-efficacy, activities of daily living, anxiety and depression,
      adherence, satisfaction and healthcare utilization after baseline data collection. The
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and cost will also be calculated and compared between
      the two groups. In addition, focus group interviews will be conducted to gain an in-depth
      understanding of stakeholders' experience on post-stroke care.
