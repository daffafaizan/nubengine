    
      Primary objectives:

        -  To investigate safety and toxicity of Radspherin®

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Radspherin®, among the four suggested
           doses 1, 2, 4 and 7 MBq, as a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection and two repeated IP
           injections following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic IP chemotherapy
           (HIPEC)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To establish a recommended dose of Radspherin® as a single IP injection and two repeated
           IP injections following CRS and HIPEC

        -  To describe the biodistribution of Radspherin®

        -  To examine the efficacy and clinical benefit of Radspherin® following CRS and HIPEC

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To explore the association of biomarkers with activity/clinical benefits, adverse events
           (AEs), or other effects associated with Radspherin®

        -  To explore effects of catheter placement, Radspherin® administration technique, and
           infusion volume on the distribution of 224Ra labelled micro particles in the peritoneal
           cavity

      The maximum number of subjects receiving Radspherin® in this study is 39. Subjects who
      discontinue prior to Radspherin® administration will be replaced.

      Dose escalation cohorts (Phase 1a): 3 - 24 subjects Repeated injection cohorts (Phase 1b): 3
      - 9 subjects Expansion cohort: 6 subjects
