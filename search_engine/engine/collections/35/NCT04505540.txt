      disorder in medication-assisted treatment, the most effective current treatment for the
      disorder. Patients presenting at the emergency department with opioid use disorder will be
      given the opportunity to immediately start medication assisted treatment with
      Naloxone/Buprenorphine then referred either to a specialized addiction bridge clinic or a
      local waivered provider for further treatment. Differences in outcomes related to whether the
      patient is referred to a bridge clinic or local provider will be assessed.
