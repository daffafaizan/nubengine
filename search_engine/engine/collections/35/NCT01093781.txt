      conservative therapy consists of restricting dietary protein intake, and controlling blood
      pressure (target blood pressure is â‰¤ 125/75 mmHg), hyperlipidemia, and edema.
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)
      are effective anti-hypertensive agents that can reduce proteinuria and slow progression of
      renal disease in both diabetic and nondiabetic chronic nephropathy patients and for these
      reasons they are the preferred agents to treat hypertension in proteinuric renal diseases.

      Recent studies suggest that renin inhibition with aliskiren may be renoprotective and reduce
      proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Similar observations have also been reported in
      patients with membranous nephropathy and proteinuria in the range of 1-3 g/24h. These
      observations suggest that aliskiren may have powerful antiproteinuric. However, it is
      important to emphasize, that none of the patients in these studies had proteinuria greater
      than 3.0 g/24h. Thus, the antiproteinuric effect of aliskiren in patients with heavy
      proteinuria (e.g. >4g/24h) is unknown.
