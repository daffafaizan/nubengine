      panels of patients in a real clinic environment

      Investigators will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to test the impact of peer health
      coaches on prediabetic patients cared for by patient-centered medical home model (PCMH) teams
      to:

        1. Reduce the incidence of type 2 DM in pre-diabetic, PCMH patients;

        2. Promote weight loss among pre-diabetic patients;

        3. Increase patient activation levels, a measureable construct of engagement, efficacy,
           skills, and confidence in managing one's health, among pre-DM patients, resulting in:

             1. Improved secondary clinical outcomes: better glycemic and blood pressure control,
                and lower Framingham risk scores;

             2. Increased utilization of preventive services (e.g. MOVE!, TeleMOVE!, Healthy
                Lifestyles, etc);

             3. Improved health behaviors (e.g. making dietary and exercise changes); and

        4. Develop, implement and assess strategies to recruit, train, and integrate peer CHW
           health coaches within the PCMH model.

      This study will test a scalable model of peer health coaching to address the millions of
      patients at risk for Diabetes Mellitus (DM),using low cost, culturally congruent personnel to
      promote prevention of DM in PCMH practice.
