      treatment with radiation, chemoradiation, or robotic surgery. Many oropharyngeal cancers are
      caused by infection with the human Papillomavirus (HPV), and patients with HPV-mediated
      tumors have much better prognosis and treatment response compared to patients with
      HPV-negative tumors. The investigators will test the hypothesis that radiation-based therapy
      of oropharyngeal cancer is associated with activation of the endogenous HPV-specific immune
      response. In this study the investigators will collect blood at several time points before,
      during, and after treatment to monitor the immune response in patients with tumors positive
      and negative for HPV versus normal healthy volunteers.
