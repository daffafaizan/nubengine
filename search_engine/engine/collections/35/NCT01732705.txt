      individuals with type 2 diabetes, but implies a considerable time commitment. High intensity
      interval training (HIT) is time-efficient exercise consisting of repeated bouts of short
      duration high intensive workloads. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of HIT in
      patients with type 2 diabetes, and to clarify the mechanisms of a possible positive effect of
      HIT.

      Exercise is performed as 2 weeks one-legged training on an ergometer bicycle. Thus one leg
      serves as a control leg. Insulin sensitivity in trained and non-trained muscle will be
      measured after completion of the overall training program by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
      clamp method and a-v catheterization of both legs. Muscle biopsies will be obtained during
      training period for measuring of muscle glycogen content, and muscle biopsies for further
      analysis obtained during the experimental day.
