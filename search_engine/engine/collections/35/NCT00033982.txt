      patients with invasive fungal infections that are resistant or refractory to the best
      available treatment, or who are unable to tolerate the best available treatment. We have
      observed significant short and long term toxicities from amphotericin and its various
      preparations in our patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and Hyper IgE recurrent
      infection syndrome (HIE or Job's). We now have now had 5 CGD patients on dialysis, and
      several more have progressive renal failure, all thought due to high dose, prolonged
      amphotericin. In addition, many of our more severely affected CGD patients have had multiple
      thoracic surgeries, leading to reduced lung capacity. Several of our HIE patients have
      persistent fungal lung infections that have not cleared with extensive therapy with
      amphotericin and/or other new triazole antifungals. Therefore, agents of high tolerability
      and high potency are still desperately needed. Posaconazole has a broad spectrum of action
      against a large number of molds and fungi at easily achievable concentrations in plasma. It
      has a favorable toxicity profile and has performed well in clinical trials to date. This drug
      will be administered orally twice daily. Close monitoring of tolerance, toxicity, and
      efficacy will be performed. We anticipate enrollment of up to 50 patients over the next 2
      years.
