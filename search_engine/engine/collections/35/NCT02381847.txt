    
      The objective of the trial is to compare the treatment of patients with advanced gastric
      cancer without evidence of distant metastases treated with D2 radical gastrectomy and
      intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) and postoperative chemotherapy (Group B) and patients
      treated with D2 radical gastrectomy alone and postoperative chemotherapy (Group A).

      The hypothesis of the trial is that D2 radical gastrectomy with intraperitoneal
      chemoperfusion (Group B) is superior to D2 radical gastrectomy (Group A) in terms of overall
      survival.

      The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, open, multicenter and parallel group
      study.
