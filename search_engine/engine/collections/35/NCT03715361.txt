      shown that atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and
      reduced quality of life. Patients with atrial fibrillation have a three times higher risk of
      heart failure and a four to five times higher risk of ischemic stroke. In addition to these
      risks, atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and therefore more difficult to diagnose. It
      is estimated that about one third of all atrial fibrillation patients are asymptomatic.

      For this reason, the study "Opportunistic Screening in Pharmacies for Atrial Fibrillation in
      Seniors" was conducted in Aachen. Within four weeks more than 7000 volunteers could be
      measured in participating pharmacies using a ECG hand-held diagnostic tool. Since the already
      measured subjects only have the SL-ECG measurement of the hand-held diagnostic tool, the aim
      of this substudy is to establish a reference group. In this reference group a 12lead-ECG is
      performed by routine ECG and a SL-ECG measurement by ECG hand-held diagnostic tool. The aim
      of the study is to compare the measured parameters and to optimize the algorithm to evaluate
      the remaining SL-ECGs of the main study.
