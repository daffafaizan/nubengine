      circumferences will be measured with a measuring tape from wrist ulnar styloid to axilla at 4
      cm intervals. The point where the difference between the upper extremities was highest and
      the control point with no difference in the lower extremities will be marked.
      Ultrasonographic skin and subcutaneous thickness measurements will be performed from 4
      quadrants; volar medial-lateral and dorsal medial-lateral sides of the extremity, with the
      probe placed transverse and perpendicular to the skin at the marked points.

      The severity of lymphedema was graded ultrasonographically according to the SEG scale. (Stage
      0: No increase in echogenicity in the subcutaneous layer. That is, subcutaneous fat is
      observed as black. Stage 1: Diffuse increase in echogenicity, but identifiable horizontal or
      oblique-oriented echogenic lines caused by bundles of connective tissue can be seen. Stage 2:
      A widespread increase in echogenicity echogenic lines cannot be identified.) Spearman test
      was used for correlations and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was
      used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a
      statistically significant threshold. Differences between ultrasonographic measurements
      between control points in lower extremities were compared with Wilcoxon test.

      The minimum number of patients to be included in the study, according to the G-Power program,
      effect size d = 0.5, alpha-Î± = 0.05 and power 0.80 was calculated to be at least 34.
