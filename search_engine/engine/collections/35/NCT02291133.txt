    
      The study will be conducted on patients with primary liver tumors. 10 patients will be
      included in phase I clinical study and additional 15 patients in phase II clinical study (or
      in the extension of the clinical study).

      Depending on the position of tumors, appropriate electrodes will be selected; hexagonal
      needle electrodes with fixed geometry for tumors not larger than 3 cm in diameter, where
      lower edge of the tumor is located up to 3 cm below the liver capsule or longer single needle
      electrodes. Individual electrodes, positioned according to the prepared treatment plan will
      be used for tumors up to 7 cm in diameter, or located near vena cava or large hepatic or
      portal veins.

      Electrochemotherapy will be performed within 8-28 min after intravenous in bolus
      administration of bleomycin (15 mg/m2).

      Triggering of electric pulses will be synchronized with ECG signals, through the ECG
      triggering device AccuSync to avoid delivery of pulses in vulnerable period of the heart.

      All patients will be treated after the procedure has been thoroughly described to them, and
      have signed informed consent.
