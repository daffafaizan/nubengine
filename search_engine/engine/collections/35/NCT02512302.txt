    
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-dose per dosing period, five-way crossover study in
      subjects 40 to 70 years of age with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD per Global
      Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. After a subject provides consent
      for study participation, there will be a Screening Period lasting up to 3 weeks to determine
      study eligibility and to allow for appropriate washout of prohibited medications.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of 10 treatment Sequences. There will be a
      minimum of a 7-day washout period between each treatment visit. At each visit, subjects will
      receive one dose of study medication according to the sequence assigned.

      Subjects with a â‰¥ 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) based on
      review of the Visit predose value compared with the Screening value will be evaluated by the
      investigator for continuation in the study.

      Subjects taking theophylline will not be able to participate in the study.
