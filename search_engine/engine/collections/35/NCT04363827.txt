      evaluating the role of Hydroxychloroquine versus observation only in preventing infection to
      COVID-19 or treating early phase COVID-19 patients.

      Each index case is randomised to either Arm A: Hydroxychloroquine or Arm B: observation in a
      2:1 ratio on an open label basis. Participants in the same cluster receive the same
      intervention.

      Study population is constituted by:

      Group 1: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - Corona Virus (CoV)-2-exposed subjects ,
      as household members/contacts of COVID-19 patients.

      Group 2: Patients with COVID-19 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic in home situation.
