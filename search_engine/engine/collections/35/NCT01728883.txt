      function with the myVisionTrack®, and for reporting, storage, and maintenance of collected
      data. The myVisionTrack® is intended to be used remotely by patients to monitor their
      disease. In the case of significant changes, patients will be prompted to visit their
      ophthalmologist. It is hypothesized that this can lead to earlier detection of disease
      progression, which, in turn, can lead to earlier treatment and better prevention against
      vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy (DR).
