      benign disease, it often progresses to a serious state, and mortality is still high.
      Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) was first used to describe cases of pancreatitis with narrowing
      of the pancreatic duct, enlargement of the pancreas, hyper-γ-globulinaemia, and antinuclear
      antibody (ANA) positivity serologically by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). The main
      differential diagnosis is pancreatic cancer, which can be ruled out through radiological,
      serological, and histological investigations.

      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral pathogen in humans. It is a lytic virus that causes a
      cytopathic effect in vitro and in vivo. Seroprevalence for CMV worldwide ranges from 60%-100%
      but the severity of illness varies. Primary CMV may be asymptomatic or may cause a mild and
      self-limiting mononucleosis-like syndrome. The self-limiting course of CMV infection
      typically includes fever, malaise, splenomegaly, mild hepatomegaly, small increases in serum
      transaminase activity, and variable elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase. CMV infection
      can cause severe hepatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, colitis, pancreatitis and
      pneumonitis. Coxsackie-B virus can also cause acute pancreatitis.

      VDR are also expressed on pancreatic Ɓ cells, and may play an essential role in maintaining
      normal insulin levels in accordance to glucose concentrations and to maintain glucose
      tolerance. Because vitamin D acts through VDR, their impairment or reduced functionality,
      e.g., as a result of polymorphisms occurring in the VDR gene, may have a crucial impact on
      the balance in the vitamin D concentration in the circulation, and the final metabolite
      activity throughout the body.
