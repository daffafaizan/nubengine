      Intravenous amphotericin B is effective for acute disease but relapse occurs in the majority
      of patients. Maintenance therapy is recommended but must be balanced against the multiple
      toxicities of the drugs used and the problems associated with the weekly administration of
      intravenous therapy. Treatments that are equally or more effective and less toxic than
      traditional methods are needed, especially oral therapy. SCH 39304 is an orally active
      antifungal drug that in animal studies is active against a wide range of systemic fungal
      infections including infections due to Cryptococcus. Features of SCH 39304 suggest that it
      might be of value in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

      HIV-infected patients with a diagnosis of acute cryptococcal meningitis, previously untreated
      or relapsed following a successfully treated acute episode, are enrolled in the study. SCH
      39304 is administered orally once daily for 3 days followed by a lower dose once daily for 12
      weeks. Patients who respond to primary therapy are randomized to receive SCH 39304
      maintenance therapy at a higher dose once weekly or at the lower dose once daily for up to 12
      months under this protocol.
