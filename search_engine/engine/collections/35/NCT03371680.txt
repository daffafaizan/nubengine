    
      Patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have low concentrations of
      disaturated-phosphatidylcholine and surfactant protein-B and C in bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid and altered fluid metabolism.

      Injection of stable isotopes such as 13 Carbon Leucine and deuterated water allows the
      analysis of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine and surfactant protein-B and C kinetics, total
      body water and water turnover in patients with ARDS and in human adults with normal lungs
      (controls).
