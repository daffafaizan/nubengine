    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      palbociclib administered in combination with re-induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients
      with relapsed B- or T-lineage ALL/LL.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of palbociclib administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib in pediatric patients with relapsed
      B- or T-lineage ALL/LL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of palbociclib in combination with
      chemotherapy for children with relapsed ALL/LL within the confines of a Phase 1 study.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of palbociclib in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Palbociclib PO (or via NG-tube) once daily on Days 1-21; Intrathecal
      cytarabine (IT ARAC) on Day 1, Doxorubicin IV push or infusion over 1-15 min on Day 4;
      Prednisone or prednisolone PO on days 4-31; Vincristine IV push or mini-bag per institutional
      policy on Days 4, 11, 18, and 25; and Pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on Days 5, and 18. If
      CNS3 leukemia is present, patients receive Intrathecal Triple Therapy (ITT) on days 4, 11,18,
      and 25. If CNS1 or 2 disease status, patients receive Methotrexate (IT MTX) on Days 18 and
      32. Patients known to be CNS3 at study entry may receive ITT on Day 1 rather than IT ARAC.
      Treatment will be given for one cycle, 32 days, in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
