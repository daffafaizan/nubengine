    
      The trial will enroll up to 173 subjects diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease of the
      lower extremities at up to 20 sites (up to 3 international sites), including 133 Intention to
      Treat subjects and up to 2 additional Roll-In subjects at each site (up to 40 Roll-In
      subjects total). The primary disease must be located in reference vessel diameters ≥ 2.5 mm
      and ≤ 7.0 mm. Trial success is focused on safety including rates of major adverse events
      through 6 months as adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee. Effectiveness will be
      evaluated using technical success, defined as the percent of target lesions that have a
      residual diameter stenosis <50% post-treatment with the Pantheris device alone as assessed by
      Angiographic Core Lab.
