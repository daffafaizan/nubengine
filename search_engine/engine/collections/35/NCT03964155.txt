    
      Patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (within 24 hours of onset) and already receiving
      inhaled sevoflurane for sedation as a current practice in participating centers will be
      enrolled in this observational study.

      After an exposure duration of at least 12 hours, a sample of directly-aspirated, undiluted
      pulmonary edema fluid will be collected concurrently with AnaConDa-S®filter collection. This
      sample will be the only specific intervention of this study.

      Patient data prospectively collected from the medical record will include demographics, ARDS
      risk factor, chest x-ray, ventilator settings at the time of AnaConDa-S ® filter collection,
      hospital and ICU length of stay and hospital mortality. Murray's lung injury score and the
      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score will be calculated from data
      already available in the medical record.

      AnaConDa-S ® filters will transported to the laboratory on ice and centrifuged at 2,000 x g
      for 10 minutes to collect condensed fluid that will be subsequently aliquoted and stored at
      -80°C for further analysis. Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid will be centrifuged at 2,000 x g
      for 10 minutes. Supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at - 80°C. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6,
      IL-8, TNF-α, soluble TNF-receptor 1, angiopoietin-2, and sRAGE will be measured in duplicate
      in both types of fluid with Multiplex.
