      fixed combination timolol/dorzolamide (T/D) in eyes with exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and
      elevated IOP.

      Methods: A randomized, prospective, international, 12-center, two-year, open-label clinical
      trial was conducted. XFS patients aged 50-80 years with untreated IOP ≥22 mmHg and open
      angles with or without mild to moderate glaucomatous damage were included. One eligible eye
      per patient was randomly assigned to latanoprost and pilocarpine qhs to increase aqueous
      outflow and inhibit pupillary movement (group I), or to decrease aqueous production with
      timolol or T/D bid as needed for IOP control (group II). IOP, tonographic outflow facility,
      and trabecular pigmentation were measured every 6 months.

      Results: 277 (146 male) patients (mean age 69.1±6.8 yr, range 50-80 yr)' were enrolled
      between October 2000 and July 2003. XFS was unilateral in 118 (42.6%) and bilateral in 159
      (57.4%) patients. Baseline TM pigmentation at the 6:00 angle was significantly associated
      with IOP (p=0.01). IOP reduction was 1.3 mmHg greater in Group I (n=145) than in Group II
      (n=132) (p=0.0003). Mean increase in outflow facility in Group I was 0.005 µl/mmHg/min vs 0
      μl/mmHg/min in Group II (p<0.001). TM pigmentation at the 6:00 position at 24 months
      decreased from baseline more frequently in Group I than in Group II [34(26%) vs 20(16%)] and
      increased from baseline more frequently in Group II than in Group I [31(25%) vs 24(18%)].

      Conclusions: Subjects in Group I had lower IOP, improved outflow facility and decreased TM
      pigmentation. Initial therapy to increase aqueous outflow and interfere with dispersion of
      exfoliation material and iris pigment by inhibiting pupillary movement is preferable to
      reducing aqueous secretion, which may be deleterious as primary treatment in this disorder.
