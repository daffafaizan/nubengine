        1. Predicting the overall impact of prognostic factors (including the new factor of genetic
           polymorphism of the IL28B) on Sustained Viral Response (SVR).

        2. Identify those patients most likely to respond.

        3. Therapy and therefore optimize resources

      The validation tool will check into clinical practice its predictive power (it will consider
      its ability to calibrate and discriminate) and make correct inferences and interpretations of
      the scores obtained when applying.
