      transduced chondrocytes that express Transforming Growth Factor(TGF)-b1 to regenerate the
      damaged cartilage.

      During the clinical trial Phase 2A, we compare low dose or high dose TissueGene-C in 6 months
      trial with 28 outpatients who have degenerative arthritis. The patients are randomized to two
      dose levels of TisssueGene-C by 1:1 ratio, and they are monitored and recorded for
      alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of adverse
      events.
