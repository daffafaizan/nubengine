    
      Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups and the visit schema for each group is
      delineated below. The group determination in which the subject will receive either the
      standard of care treatment or the fat grafting procedure will be determined using the
      GraphSoft random number generator function.

      Subjects will randomized to a group assignment (Either YEAR A PATHWAY with fat grafting
      procedure during year one or YEAR B PATHWAY with observational visits at 6 and 12 months with
      fat grafting procedures during year 2).

      YEAR A PATHWAY - this occurs after screening visit and upon eligibility determination

      YEAR B PATHWAY - this occurs after screening visit and upon eligibility determination. Pre-
      Operative research visits will occur at month 6 and 12 and will be concurrent to the
      subject's standard of care treatment. Visits at months 6 and 12 will be performed by a
      podiatrist as standard of care.
