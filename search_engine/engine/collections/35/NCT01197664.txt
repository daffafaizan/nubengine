      I. To evaluate toxicity and tolerability of oral paricalcitol at 2 Î¼g/day when
      co-administered with oral 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil)-based chemoradiation in patients with
      histologically confirmed, resectable T3-T4 adenocarcinoma of rectal mucosal origin or
      node-positive disease with no known distant metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the biologic effects of oral paricalcitol in addition to oral 5-fluorouracil
      chemoradiation on Vitamin D receptor staining, MIB-1, Caspase 3, P 21, and Bax protein
      expression in these patients.

      II. To identify patterns of gene expression in tumor samples of patients who receive chemo
      radiation with and without Paricalcitol supplementation using gene microarray technology.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paricalcitol orally (PO) daily. Patients also receive standard care
      chemoradiotherapy with fluorouracil PO.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard care chemoradiotherapy as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues until surgical resection in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month after surgery.
