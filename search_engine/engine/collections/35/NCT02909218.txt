      HIV-positive individuals to improve patient health outcomes and reduce HIV incidence is
      building, and the resource-limited countries where this approach could have the biggest
      impact want to evaluate if this is a feasible and effective intervention to turn the course
      of their HIV epidemics. The MaxART Early Access to ART for All (EAAA) implementation study
      was designed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, clinical outcomes, affordability,
      and scalability of offering early antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive individuals in
      Swaziland's government-managed health system.

      This is a 3-year randomized stepped wedge design with open enrollment for all adults 18 years
      and older across 14 rural health facilities in Swaziland's Hhohho Region. Primary endpoints
      are retention and viral suppression. Secondary endpoints include ART initiation, adherence,
      drug resistance, tuberculosis, HIV disease progression, and cost per patient per year.

      Sites are grouped to transition two at a time from the control (standard of care) to
      intervention (EAAA) stage at each 4-month step. This balanced design will result in
      approximately one half of the observations being under an intervention clinic, and the other
      half under control.

      Power calculations were conservatively based on the estimated number of individuals expected
      to enroll in the study comparing the first 12-month measure of retention and 6-month of viral
      suppression on ART of those entering clinics during their control stage versus those that
      will be entering a clinic during intervention period.

      A strategic mix of multidisciplinary research methodologies will be applied to meet the study
      aim, including implementation science, social science research, economic evaluations, and HIV
      incidence modeling.
