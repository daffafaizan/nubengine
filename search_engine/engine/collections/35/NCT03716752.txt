      surface denuded. Treatment of Class III and IV defects and achievement good of results seems
      to be quite difficult due to the advanced loss of the soft and hard tissues supporting the
      affected teeth. Furthermore, partial to total loss of the interproximal papilla is one of the
      main challenges that contribute for achieving higher levels of esthetics especially in
      anterior zone. In such a case, conventional techniques of root coverage results usually in
      poor prognosis.
