      women undergoing elective first trimester surgical abortion. These women will be premedicated
      with either two tabs of 5/350 hydrocodone/acetaminophen or 2 tabs of a placebo. All subjects
      will receive ibuprofen and lorazepam preoperatively and a PCB. This study will examine the
      incremental benefit of HC/APAP over this standard medication regimen. Randomization will be
      stratified into two groups. Subjects less than 8 weeks gestation will comprise the early
      gestational age group. Subjects between 8 weeks 0 days and 10 weeks 6 days will comprise the
      late gestational age group. The investigators will be assessing patient perception of pain,
      nausea, satisfaction, and anxiety at multiple points during the clinic visit using 100-mm
      visual analogue scales (VAS).
