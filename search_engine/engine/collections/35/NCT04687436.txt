      patients per group with 80% power and 0.05 alpha error.

      The inclusion criteria are age between 18 and 40, singleton pregnancy, vertex presentation,
      bishop score <6, using a foley catheter or cook balloon for cervical ripening and high-risk
      pregnancy (Oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, pregestational
      or gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders).

      The exclusion criteria are being younger than 18 or over 40, communication problems, bishop
      score >6, being at active labor, multifetal pregnancy, non-vertex presentation, scarred
      uterus (cesarean or myomectomy), fetal structural or chromosomal anomaly, non-reassuring
      fetal cardiotocography before cervical ripening, regional anesthesia during the first stage.

      The primary outcomes are the rate of bishop score >6 after ripening, vaginal delivery rate
      and vaginal delivery within 24 hours of the initiation of ripening.
