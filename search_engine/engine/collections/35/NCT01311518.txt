    
      This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, dose finding study. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to receive one of two doses of RGN-352 or matching placebo with
      an equal allocation ratio (i.e., 1:1:1). Approximately 75 subjects will be randomized to
      study treatment to achieve at least 60 evaluable subjects with 20 to 25 subjects per group.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two RGN-352 doses of 1200 mg, or 450 mg, or
      placebo, administered iv by iv push daily for the first 3 consecutive days and weekly for 4
      consecutive weeks. Study subjects will undergo cardiac angiography to assess initial coronary
      artery patency and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade both pre- and
      post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) angioplasty. A total of 7 doses will be
      administrated over the treatment period. The first dose of either RGN-352 or placebo will be
      administered to randomized subjects following PCI angioplasty and specifically within 30
      minutes after balloon deflation, with a further 2 doses. The remaining 4 doses will be given
      weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Follow-up is on Months 2, 4, and 6.
