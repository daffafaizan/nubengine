      world and also common among chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. Patients with chronic HCV
      often have increased liver iron, a condition associated with reduced sustained response to
      antiviral therapy, more rapid progression to cirrhosis, and development of hepatocellular
      carcinoma; however, little is known about the mechanism of iron accumulation in the liver.
      Recently identified hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide hormone exclusively synthesized in the
      liver, is thought to be a key regulator for iron homeostasis and is induced by infection and
      inflammation. Hepcidin expression is modulated by iron stores, so that it decreases in iron
      deficiency to facilitate iron absorption while it increases in iron repletion to prevent
      pathological overload. Interleukin (IL)-6 has been proposed as a major inducer of hepcidin,
      via direct transcriptional activation of hepatic hepcidin expression by binding to its
      receptor complex containing gp130 to activate janus kinase (JAK) and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT 3).
