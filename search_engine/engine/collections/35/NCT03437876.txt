    
      A group of 60 patients with HBV induced cirrhosis will be recruited for study, which involved
      a 4 times IMT with gastroduodenoscopy and the time interval is generally 2 weeks.
      Participants can keep taking their present treatment. All participants will be assessed at
      baseline, after 3 months, 6 months, 12 months from baseline in order to evaluate the possible
      changes in:

      (1)Imaging changes: Color Doppler ultrasound of portal vein, CT/MRI, Fibroscan score of liver
      fibrosis and steatosis, Grading of varicosity under gastroscopy(GI); (2)Basic information and
      symptoms; (3)Biochemical indexes: Liver function, four items of liver fiber, lipid
      metabolism, blood routine, coagulation function, blood ammonia, inflammation, oxidative
      stress, urine routine; sugar metabolism indicators (blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin,
      insulin level and insulin resistance level).

      (4) Changes of gut microbiota: The changes of gut microbiota will be assessed by
      High-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA) on baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after
      treatment samples to assess changes associated with IMT.
