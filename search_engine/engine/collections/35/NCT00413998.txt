    
      70 patients with moderate functional ischaemic MR who are undergoing CABG will be recruited.
      Patients will be randomised to undergo either CABG alone or CABG combined with mitral
      annuloplasty. Patients will be investigated at baseline, 3 months and 1 year after surgery to
      determine functional capacity, quality of life, and cardiac function.
