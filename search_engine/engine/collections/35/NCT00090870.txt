      Primary

        -  Determine the response to PEG-interferon alfa-2b, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and thalidomide
           in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerance to and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the median and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 8,
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-10, and oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
