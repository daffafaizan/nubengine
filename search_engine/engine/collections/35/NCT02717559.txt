    
      The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis two and ten year post ACL reconstruction from information available at the
      time of surgery. Hypothesis: Smoking status, older age, higher BMI, increased severity of
      cartilage injuries, increased meniscal resection, revision surgery, and incidence of
      additional arthroscopic procedures will result in more symptoms and signs of osteoarthritis
      at 10-year follow-up.

      Primary outcome measures will be the joint space width measured on weight-bearing
      radiographs, as well as the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS).

      Secondary outcome measures will include the knee related quality of life subscale of the Knee
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS).
