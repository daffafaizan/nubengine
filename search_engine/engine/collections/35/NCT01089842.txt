      studies have shown that a sedentary lifestyle is associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular diseases, mainly related to classical risk factors (obesity, diabetes,
      hypertension). International guidelines recommend, because of that, a minimum of 30 minutes
      per day at least 5 days per week of moderate physical activity for primary and secondary
      cardiovascular disease prevention.

      Physical inactivity is an increasing public health problem in developed countries. It is
      known that clinical advice has a poor efficacy to increase levels of physical activity on
      individuals and new strategies need to be developed.

      Coaching is a strategy of personal help that is being widely and successfully used in
      business world. It consists of an structured and individualized process of assistance to
      people to promote cognitive changes needed to achieve behavioural changes. It can be a
      complementary method to information and sanitary education emphasizing on consciousness and
      responsibility of the patient and is now starting to be used in medical practice. The purpose
      of the study is to define usefulness of an strategy based on coaching techniques to promote
      physical activity practice and healthy lifestyle on individuals with known coronary heart
      disease or cardiovascular risk factors.
