    
      The objectives of this study are to determine

        1. whether the pharmacogenetic guided arm can maintain patients a greater time in
           therapeutic range (TTR - percentage of values in the targeted therapeutic range once a
           therapeutic INR has been established) without clinical adverse events (i.e., bleeding
           complications or thromboembolic events),

        2. whether the pharmacogenetic guided arm can achieve a higher percentage of therapeutic
           warfarin levels by days 5 and 8 of therapy (without intervening non-study dose
           adjustment), and

        3. whether the pharmacogenetic guided arm can reduce the need for unplanned dose
           adjustments and additional INR measurements because of excessive (or insufficient) INR
           level and clinical adverse events, i.e., bleeding complications or thromboembolic
           events.

      The goal is to achieve >75% TTR in the PG-algorithm arm. Compare proportion of patients
      reaching therapeutic INR on days 5 and 8 and the subsequent and overall proportion ("time")
      of INR measurements in therapeutic range (TTR) over 3 months between standard and PG-based
      arms.

      This study will enroll 200 qualifying, consenting patients of either gender, 18 years and
      above, any ethnicity, with life expectancies > 1 year, beginning on chronic outpatient
      warfarin therapy for AF, or emergency department/outpatient therapy for spontaneous DVT, or
      inpatient therapy (and continued for 1 mo) after orthopedic surgery for DVT prevention, or
      heart failure patients (EF<25% or apical akinesis or left ventricular aneurysm or extensive
      wall motion abnormality) being started on therapy to reduce the risk of thromboembolism.
