    
      Single-center, prospective, randomized, investigator-initiated study

      250 cataract patients, aged 60 or older, will be tested for ocular surface inflammation with
      the InflammaDryÂ® immunoassay

      Patients with bilateral positive MMP-9 will be randomized into a group treated with Xiidra
      two weeks preoperatively and six weeks postoperatively or a group not treated with Xiidra

      The investigator hypothesizes that treatment with Xiidra prior to routine cataract surgery
      will significantly improve the quality of keratometry readings and BCVA.
