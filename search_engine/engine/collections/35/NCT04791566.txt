      leading to tissue edema. Since the vascular endothelium contributes to homeostasis,
      endothelial damage may increase the risk of cardiovascular and hemodynamic complications.

      Pre-operative high-dose glucocorticoids provide reduction in the inflammatory response after
      surgery, effective pain relief in several major surgical procedures, as well as reducing
      fatigue, impairing endothelial dysfunction, potentially amend fluid extravasation, edema and
      dyscoagulation and vasodilation.

      However, glucocorticoids have not been assessed in patients with peritonitis or intestinal
      obstruction, specifically, the impact on pain, fluid dynamics, respiratory as well as
      endothelial function and mobilization in both obstruction and perforation.

      In this study, patients will be randomized to either high dose dexamethason (1 mg /kg) or
      placebo (0,9% NaCl), administered as a single dose preoperatively. The investigatoris
      hypothesize that a preoperative single high dose of glucocorticoid reduces systemic
      inflammatory response after emergency laparotomy.
