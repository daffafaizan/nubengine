      combination of inflammatory and neuro-degenerative processes. To test whether low-dose
      lithium carbonate ameliorates disability accumulation in progressive MS, patients with
      progressive MS were randomly assigned to take lithium in either the first or second year of a
      two-year trial. The trial was designed as a cross-over study to maximize exposure to lithium
      to for two reasons: 1) To increase the number of persons with MS exposed to lithium for
      purposes of assessing safety and tolerance; and 2) To increase the power to detect changes in
      the primary radiological outcome (change in brain volume) and also in secondary clinical
      outcomes (disability, mood, fatigue, cognition).
