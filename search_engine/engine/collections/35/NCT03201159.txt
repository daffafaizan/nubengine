    
      This is an open label, multiple cohorts, dose escalation Phase Ib study, in which up to 3
      doses of VLX103 will be assessed for safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in well
      defined moderate ASH patients cohorts receiving increasing doses of VLX103. The overall study
      design is characteristic for early phase, first in patient clinical evaluation of safety and
      pharmacodynamics, especially when prudent dose escalation is recommended. A maximum of 18
      moderate ASH patients will be enrolled and treated in at least 4 clinical sites throughout
      the US. The open label nature of the study design will allow to efficiently monitor the
      safety of VLX103 throughout the trial, and taking rapid decisions about dosing adjustments
      (dose reduction or discontinuation within each dosing cohort, for each patient).

      After an adequate screening period (Day -7 to -1), all eligible patients of the first dosing
      cohort will receive the initial, low dose of VLX103 150 mg per day (QD) for 14 consecutive
      days. Subjects will be evaluated only for safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
      during this period. Pre-established safety criteria will be used to decide upon dose
      escalation, for each subject. If patients tolerate well VLX103 at 150 mg QD , a second cohort
      will then receive a 300 mg QD regimen for 14 days. At the end of this period, safety,
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics will be assessed as well. The next dose will be 450 mg
      QD for 14 days, with the same monitoring process. Long term safety will also be assessed, at
      all 3 doses, at Day 30 and 90 post treatment initiation.
