      oropharyngeal cancer, undergoing resection through trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) of all
      gross visible disease at the primary site and in the lymph nodes. A total of 36 patients at
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and its affiliates (Tower Hematology-Oncology, Torrance Memorial
      Physician Network) who have had or will require surgery to remove cancer cells prior to
      starting chemoradiation may be enrolled. All eligible patients will receive de-intensified
      cisplatin-based chemoradiation, with high-risk patients receiving a higher dose and longer
      treatment period than other patients on the study. The treatment period will last 3 to 5
      weeks depending on whether the patient is considered high-risk or not. The study will assess
      whether a de-intensified version of standard chemoradiation treatment will be just as
      effective in treating HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer while causing less side effects
      than standard dosing.
