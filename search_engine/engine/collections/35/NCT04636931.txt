      revascularization for coronary artery disease. However, their efficacy is limited by in-stent
      restenosis and stent thrombosis. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) deliver an anti-proliferative drug
      into the vessel wall and leave nothing behind, which is a promising technique in the
      treatment of coronary artery disease. Previous many studies have confirmed that DCB treatment
      for de Novo coronary lesions is safe and efficient. But, data about morphological changes of
      plaque and factors influencing plaque healing after DCB for de Novo Coronary Lesions is
      scarce. The study compares morphological changes of plaques evaluated by OCT between baseline
      and 1-year follow-up and evaluates factors influencing plaque healing. All the included
      patient will receive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for one month followed by clopidogrel
      treatment.
