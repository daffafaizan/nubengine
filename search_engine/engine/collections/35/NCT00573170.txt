    
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
      crossover, three-attack, outpatient study in which TREXIMET® will be compared to a
      butalbital-containing combination medication (BCM; acetaminophen 325mg, caffeine 40mg, and
      butalbital 50mg [Fioricet]) for the acute treatment of migraine headaches. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of 6 possible treatment sequences (TPB, TBP, BTP, BPT, PTB, PBT where T =
      TREXIMET®; P = Placebo; B = Butalbital-containing Combination Medication) . Subjects will
      treat each of the 3 migraine attacks when pain is moderate to severe. The study will include
      4 visits: (1) a Screening visit at study entry, (2) a Drug Screen visit, (3) a Randomization
      visit, and (4) a Final visit. The Final visit occurs either (A) upon withdrawal or (B) after
      treatment of 3 migraine attacks. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of
      TREXIMET® versus BCM for the acute treatment of moderate/severe migraine. These two replicate
      studies were amended while ongoing to allow for the reporting of pooled data only.
