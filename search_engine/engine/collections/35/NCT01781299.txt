      breast reconstruction in order to protect the implant from exposure under a thin mastectomy
      skin flap while also allowing better control of the inframammary fold and, therefore, a
      better cosmetic result. In current clinical practice, cost is a factor in considering
      procedures and adjunct products. AlloDerm RTU and SurgiMend PRS are dissimilar in cost, with
      AlloDerm RTU more costly by 30-50%, and it is unclear if they are similar in efficacy.

      This study will be a prospective, randomized-to-test article (ADM), controlled,
      blinded-to-aesthetic/biopsy specimen evaluator trial. It will provide a way to assess the
      relative performance and complication rates between the AlloDerm RTU and SurgiMend PRS
      product as well as the relative economics of these two treatment options. Study subjects will
      only be randomized to one of two surgical mesh products. Patient information including age,
      BMI, smoking history, tumor size and location, preoperative bra cup size, mastectomy specimen
      weight, mastectomy method, plastic surgeon, mastectomy surgeon, quality of skin, tissue
      expander type and maximal volume, intra-operative fill volume, gel/saline implant type and
      size, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy will be summarized.
