      Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of development of chronic
      liver disease and cirrhosis. The incidence of NAFLD among the general population is about
      17-30%. There are no published studies which have investigated the incidence of NAFLD in
      pregnant women or the correlation between the metabolic changes in pregnancy and this
      phenomenon.

      We aimed in our study to explore the incidence of NAFLD in pregnancy by ultrasonography (US)
      during the end of the pregnancy or immediately after birth (after 36 weeks) and to look for a
      correlation between fatty liver and demographic, clinical, nutritional and laboratory data
      during pregnancy.

      Methods: US examination will be performed by an experienced technician. The liver will be
      scanned by B mode US using a 2-5 MHZ transducer. In those with fatty liver as seen by US, a
      repeat examination will be performed after 6 weeks and 24 weeks. For women with the diagnosis
      of fatty liver, serum lipid profile, glucose, liver function tests and insulin will be done.
      Homa score as well as BMI will be calculated for each woman with fatty liver. All
      participants will sign an informed consent which has been approved by the hospital ethical
      committee.
