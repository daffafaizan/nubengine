      functions and pathologic changes of the internal organs in TKM.

      However, traditional tongue diagnosis has inevitable limitations because of the clinician's
      subjectivity and environmental factors influencing on the diagnostic results.

      Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the availability of the tongue diagnosis system
      (TDS).

      The aim of the this study is to investigate the agreement between the measurement of TDS and
      the conventional way of tongue diagnosis about TCT in the tongue diagnosis of TKM. So, we
      will assess the agreement between the measurement of TDS and the final diagnosis of 5
      clinicians with five or more years of clinical experience about TCT.

      Additionally, we will evaluate the reproducibility of TDS. In the 2nd visit, taking tongue
      images of each patient with TDS will be performed again at 30 minute-intervals in the same
      way. And then, we will compare the two TDS measurements of each patient about TCT.

      After twice examination of TDS, the weight of tongue coating (mg) will be measured
      quantitatively by tongue scraping to analyze the correlation between the weight of tongue
      coating and the measurements of TDS.

      In addition, after the collection of 60 patients' tongue images is completed, we will
      ascertain the validity of the five clinicians for diagnosing the TCT by assessing the
      inter-and intra-rater reliability of the five clinicians.
