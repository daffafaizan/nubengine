    
      This randomized study involves 12 weeks of treatment with riociguat pills or placebo pills,
      and a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment. The dose is adjusted every 2 weeks based
      on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and well-being assessed at that visit. Physical
      examinations, vital signs, blood tests and questionnaires will be performed at 2 week
      intervals during the double blinded study treatment. Echocardiogram, urine testing,
      six-minute walk distance and questionnaires will be assessed at the beginning and end of the
      treatment phase.
