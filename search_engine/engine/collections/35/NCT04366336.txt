      restrict arterial inflow and venous outflow to the limb during low-load resistance exercise.
      BFRT has the potential to augment strength gains for rehabilitation patients who are unable
      to tolerate high intensity resistance training.

      Objective To determine if BFRT will accelerate the recovery of thigh muscle function and
      strength in post-operative TKA compared to a standard post-operative rehabilitation protocol.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      Quadriceps Strength: dynamometry (hand held)

      Secondary Outcomes Measures:

      Patient Reported Outcomes Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Jr Veterans Rand -12
      Functional Measures Timed stair ascent Four square Test 5x Sit to Stand Test

      Study Design Open label randomized clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation in random sized
      blocks

      Sample Size Based on a Pre-TKA Quadriceps Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction mean of 18
      with a standard deviation of 8, expecting a 20% improvement of MVIC with BFRT compared to
      standard Physical Therapy, with an α of 0.05 and β of 0.20 (80% power), the sample size is 63
      in each arm. To account for a 20% drop-out rate, a total of 75 subjects will be enrolled in
      each arm

      Study Arms Control arm: Subjects will receive American College of Sports Medicine
      guided-strength training Experimental: Subjects will receive BFRT strength training as part
      of their post-operative physical therapy program for two months during normal post-op rehab.
