      (NSCLC). However, surgery is invasive and not all patients are surgical candidates, thus
      providing an opportunity for percutaneous microwave ablation, for both primary and metastatic
      disease. Patients that are deemed inoperable are typically treated with other targeted
      therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation and stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT), or systemic therapies. Percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) is an
      alternative option for targeted treatment of cancer. Microwave tumor ablation is a procedure
      that uses heat made by an electric current to destroy a tumor (ablation). With imaging
      equipment, such as ultrasound or CT (computed tomography), and a small incision made in the
      skin, the tumor is located and treated with radiofrequency energy. The cells that are killed
      by the microwave ablation are typically not removed but are eventually replaced by fibrosis
      and scar tissue. Patients will be followed for 1 year by contrast enhanced chest CT, chest
      PET/CT and chest PET/MRI to evaluate lesion outcomes.
