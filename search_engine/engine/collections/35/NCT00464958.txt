      administration of once nightly sublingual tizanidine before sleep results in a statistically
      and clinically significant reduction in next-day spasticity, as compared to placebo. The
      clinical effect following 12 mg sublingual tizanidine was larger (4-5 units on the Ashworth
      scale) and more sustained (up to 18-20 hours post-dose) than was seen for 8 mg tizanidine
      (earlier study, Protocol C2/5/TZ:MS-03z). This study also reconfirmed that the increased
      improvement in next-day reduction of spasticity following overnight sublingual tizanidine
      dosing is not accompanied by a concomitant increase in next-day somnolence.

      This study, a 12 month open label extension, will allow those patients who successfully
      completed Protocol C2/5/TZ-MS-05 and who found tizanidine to be beneficial, to continue
      treatment under close medical supervision. The study will provide long-term (12 months)
      clinical efficacy and safety data re: the use of once daily sublingual tizanidine,
      administered at night, just before bedtime.
