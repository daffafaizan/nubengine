      sinonasal cavity and the subarachnoid space. It may occur spontaneously or secondary to
      accidental or iatrogenic trauma. CSF leak is a potentially devastating condition that can
      lead to ascending meningitis, pneumocephalus, and intracranial abscess. Surgical repair is
      recommended for most patients with CSF leaks to prevent the potential sequelae.

      Multiple graft materials have been employed in the approach, including temporalis fascia,
      middle turbinate flap, fascia lata, fat, free cartilage or bone, vascularized nasoseptal flap
      and acellular skin grafts. Among these options, vascular nasoseptal ï¬‚aps are the most popular
      materials at present. Limited literature has been reported the use of free middle turbinate
      flap during an endoscopic approach to treat CSF rhinorrhea, and the results were
      inconclusive. There were a large number of cases using free middle turbinate flap for CSF
      rhinorrhea repair in our institution. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy
      and safety of the free middle turbinate flap for repair of CSF rhinorrhea.
