      myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the
      ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. Ranging in
      severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe, anemia can result in patients requiring regular
      red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which can lead to further complications from iron
      overload. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept versus
      epoetin alfa in anemic patients who are categorized as International Prognostic Scoring
      System-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
      are ESA na√Øve, and require constant RBC transfusions. The design of the study will allow a
      period of initial randomization of patients into either the luspatercept or epoetin alfa arm,
      followed by an open-label treatment period. In both treatment arms, best supportive care
      (BSC) may be used in combination with study treatment when clinically indicated per
      investigator. Best supportive care includes, but is not limited to, treatment with
      transfusions, antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy, and nutritional support as
      needed. Best supportive care for this study excludes the use of ESAs outside of the study
      treatment. Patients should receive treatment up to a minimum of 24 weeks after which an MDS
      Disease assessment visit is scheduled to assess the response to treatment. Patients who are
      determined to be experiencing clinical benefit may continue treatment. Continued clinical
      benefit will be re-assessed every 24 weeks. Once patients are discontinued from study
      treatment, they will enter a post treatment follow-up period.
