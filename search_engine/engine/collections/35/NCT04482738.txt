      a sedentary lifestyle are driving the current obesity pandemic. These factors activate the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the key regulatory pathway of energy homeostasis.
      Activation of the HPA-axis leads to secretion of glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands,
      which control energy homeostasis by mobilizing and redistributing energy substrates.

      Animal models of obesity have shown that glucocorticoids play a key role in the development
      of the metabolic syndrome. However, studies in humans yielded conflicting results. These
      studies have a major limitation in common. They do not consider glucocorticoid rhythmicity
      but rather investigate a snapshot of glucocorticoid secretion. Rhythmicity, however, is
      crucial because already minor glucocorticoid phase disturbances cause disease and could
      contribute to obesity.

      Interestingly, excessive food intake may increase cortisol levels in healthy subjects . The
      consequence of this food-induced cortisol peak is not understood, but it may be key to
      restoring energy homeostasis after a meal. Whether the food-induced cortisol peak in obese
      subjects is disturbed is not known

      With this study, investigators aim to better understand the role played by glucocorticoids in
      the origin of overweight and obesity. Researchers will investigate, in lean and obese
      subjects, whether the pulsatile release of cortisol increases after intake of a high-calorie
      meal. 36 subjects will take part in the study: a group of 18 male lean subjects and a second
      group of 18 male obese patients.
