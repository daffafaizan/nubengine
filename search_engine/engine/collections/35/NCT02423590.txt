    
      This is an open-label, multicentre, 2-arm randomised phase II trial of
      gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427) versus gemcitabine/carboplatin alone in
      patients with previously untreated advanced squamous cell lung cancers. Patients will be
      randomised (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms:

        -  Gemcitabine/carboplatin

        -  Gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427)

      Randomisation will be stratified by the following criteria:

        -  Stage (IIIB versus IV versus recurrent disease)

        -  Performance status (0 or 1 versus 2)

      Gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy will be continued for 4-6 cycles unless there is
      evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or if the patient requests that study
      treatment be discontinued or to be withdrawn from the study. If chemotherapy is discontinued
      prior to disease progression, patients in the combination arm should be continued on
      Apatorsen (OGX-427) single agent therapy until disease progression unless there is evidence
      of unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent or termination of the study,
      whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed for disease progression. Tumour
      evaluations will be performed before the initiation of treatment and every 6 weeks during and
      after completion of chemotherapy. Once disease progression is documented, patients will enter
      a Survival Follow-up Period during which data will be collected every two months regarding
      further cancer therapy, secondary malignancy and survival status. The study will also assess
      the relationship between the anticipated anti-tumour activity of the treatment regimen and
      biological characteristics of patients' tumours at baseline.
