      post-treatment. All participants received the same treatment protocol (described in detail in
      Appendix A and in Minkina et al. (under review)). In order to control for improvement in
      language function related to passage of time, and for the effect of repeated exposure to
      outcome measures, individuals were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: delayed
      treatment or immediate treatment (Figure 2). Participants who were randomized to the delayed
      group received repeated testing three times before and three times after a six-week delay.
      During the delay phase they were permitted to participate in usual speech-language care
      (e.g., conversation groups and individual therapy).

      Standardized assessments and outcome measures (described in detail below) were administered
      prior to the start of treatment (for both immediate and delayed groups), at the end of the
      delay phase (delayed group only), immediately after treatment termination, and at three
      months post-treatment.
