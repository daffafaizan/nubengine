      immune responses and (ii) developing safe and well tolerated strategies which will favour the
      development of T-cell responses that may enhance anti-HIV HIV therapy with the forward
      looking goal of working towards functional eradication of infection. The investigator
      proposes to combine the previously used IM and TC methods because preclinical data suggest
      that the combination of methods will favour the development of CD8 T cell responses. All
      groups will receive 6.0mg of the vaccine IM given in 3 doses over 12 weeks. Group 1 will
      receive the 6.0mg IM with electroporation (EP) and Group 2 will receive the 6.0mg IM without
      EP but together with an additional 1.2mg vaccine TC. The primary immunogenicity endpoint will
      be to determine whether either intervention group augments the cellular responses to vaccine
      specific peptides in relation to baseline. It is anticipated that none of subjects receiving
      saline placebo would have an increase in vaccine specific responses relative to those at
      baseline. Therefore if the differences between the active groups and saline placebo are
      sufficiently large, for example 80% responders in a GTUÂ®-MultiHIV DNA active group, <10% in
      the control group, this would be significant.

      Should the regimes prove safe, acceptable and induce significant immunogenicity then the
      intention is to move one or both regimes into a larger study powered to determine their
      potential long-term impact on therapy when used in combination with conventional ARV
      regimens. Proof of concept that DNA vaccination can induce de novo HIV specific responses
      that are associated with control of viral replication, would justify further investigation of
      their use in immunotherapies combined with ART intensification and/or anti-latency drugs.
