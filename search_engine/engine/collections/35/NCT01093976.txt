      be started on open-label dronabinol 2.5mg/day for 3 weeks. The dose will be increased to
      5mg/day at visit 2 (Week 3), to10mg/day at visit 3 (Week 6), and to 15mg/day at Visit 4 (Week
      9) unless clinical improvement is attained at a lower dose (clinical improvement will be
      assessed by the investigator with respect to obsessive thoughts, urges and compulsive
      behaviors). Subjects will be seen every three weeks during the 12-week, open-label study. All
      efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at each visit. Subjects who are not
      compliant with their use of study medication (i.e. failing to take medication for three or
      more consecutive days) will be discontinued from the study.

      Laboratory testing, including liver function tests, a blood chemistry panel, and urine
      toxicology will be completed for subjects at baseline if in the opinion of the study
      physician the medical history of the subject warrants such tests for their safety. All
      females, regardless of age, will undergo a urine pregnancy test at screening and all subjects
      will be required to do a urine drug screen at the screening visit to test for drugs of abuse.

      At study conclusion, subjects will be given the option to continue on medication (via
      prescription) if covered by insurance, and will then be followed in our clinic or referred to
      another psychiatrist. All study subjects will be offered follow-up care with CBT and/or
      medication in our outpatient clinic (if covered by insurance) or be given a list of
      appropriate referrals in the community.
