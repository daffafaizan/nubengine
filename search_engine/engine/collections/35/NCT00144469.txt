    
      Treatment-naïve patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 48 weeks of double-blind
      treatment with subcutaneous, once-weekly injections of 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD)
      plus either twice-daily oral ribavirin (600 to 1000mg/day) or placebo.

      All patients who had received previous treatment with conventional interferon but had failed
      to respond (no suppression of HCV-RNA below detection limits of a sensitive assay) or had
      relapsed (reversion to HCV-RNA positive state after suppression) received the combination of
      peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) plus ribavirin for 48 weeks at the dosages stated above.
