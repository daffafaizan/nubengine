      reduce the incidence of preterm births through this study. The goal of this study is to
      reduce the risk of recurrent preterm births for the participating mothers and healthy
      development of their infants. The investigators hope that this study will accomplish the
      following for the mothers: Utilize technology to strengthen knowledge of healthy behaviors;
      Improve adherence to both behavioral and medical interventions that specifically aimed at
      reducing the risk of spontaneous recurrent preterm births; Develop a platform that can
      capture participant behavior regarding the participant's lifestyle, environment, social
      factors, and personal health status; Allow participants to be co-creators of content, thus
      creating a support network. The investigators hope to achieve improvements in the following
      primary outcome: Inter-pregnancy interval and the following secondary outcomes: postpartum
      depression, infant-mother bonding and breast milk feeding between the control and the
      intervention groups. Ultimately, the investigators hope improvements in these outcomes will
      improve secondary prevention of preterm births and ultimately reduce infant mortality.

      Additionally, PretermConnect will monitor mothers on their social circumstances, such as
      housing and food insecurity, family employment status, and perceived importance of
      recommended care for the baby's and the participant's own health.

      The investigators also want to observe if a mobile-delivered health management approach can
      be more effective than a traditional paper-based health management plan in reducing the
      incidence of subsequent preterm births amongst individuals who have already had at least one
      preterm birth.
