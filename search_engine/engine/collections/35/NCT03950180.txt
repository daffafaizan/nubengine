    
      Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were consented and randomized to receive
      standard of care counseling (SOC) versus the same counseling plus provision of their specific
      LE (PCCI). Patients were blinded to the specific content of their counseling session. After
      counseling, patients completed the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), Death Anxiety Scale
      (DAS), Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC), and Patient Satisfaction
      Questionnaire (PSQ-18). Treatment preferences were assessed.
