      combination therapy with sorafenib in a 2 step dose escalation. Up to 20 patients with
      advanced HCC will be included in Part A. Tumor assessment will be performed every 8 weeks.The
      first 10 patients (cohort 1) will start with IV infusion of 300 mg DKN-01 on day 1 and 15
      (monotherapy for 28 days). DLTs will be determined. After cycle 2 of monotherapy patients of
      cohort 1 will continue with combination of 300 mg DKN-01 IV on day 1 and 15 and sorafenib
      (recommended dose 800 mg per day or at discretion of the investigator) until disease
      progression. After 2 cycles of combination therapy and prior to the start of the next cohort
      DLTs will be determined. Part B is a phase II study to investigate the anti-tumor activity
      and safety of DKN-01 in patients with advanced HCC. DKN-01 is administered at the recommend
      phase II dose (RP2D) for monotherapy and at the recommend phase II dose for combination
      therapy established in Part A. Depending on the tolerability, the doses may be different for
      monotherapy and for combination therapy. Up to 50 additional patients with advanced HCC may
      be enrolled in Part B. Every 8 weeks tumor assessment will be performed. If progression of
      disease (PD1) is observed with DKN-01 monotherapy, patients will continue on study receiving
      DKN-01 at the recommend phase II dose for combination therapy.
