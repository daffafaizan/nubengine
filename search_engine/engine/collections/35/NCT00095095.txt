      back pain caused by degenerative changes and instability of the spine. The surgical treatment
      involves the removal of an intervertebral disc, and subsequently the union of the two
      adjacent intervertebral bodies, such that a bony connection is formed within time after
      surgery. Lumbar spinal fusion is being performed with increasing frequency. Many interbody
      fusion methods have been described. In recent years, several types of fusion cages have been
      developed. These cages are made of various materials: titanium, stainless steel, carbon fiber
      or polyethylethylketone (Peek). Fusion cages have been quickly integrated into orthopedic
      practice.

      To date, no studies have been conducted that compare the efficacy of nonresorbable and
      bioresorbable fusion cage devices. In this study the surgical and clinical outcomes are
      compared of patients with degenerative lumbar spine disorders who undergo lumbar fusion with
      a nonresorbable versus a bioresorbable fusion cage. Patients with lumbar spinal disorders
      will be recruited from several European centers and randomly allocated to one of the two
      intervention groups. In both treatment groups lumbar spinal fusion is performed using a
      standardized technique.

      Patients will be evaluated during two years post-operatively. During this follow up period,
      the clinical outcome and fusion parameters will be assessed.
