        -  To identify and characterize changes in clonal populations of B cells in children with
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis and Day 29 of induction.

        -  To define the ability of this technology to reclassify patients as minimal residual
           disease (MRD) positive at Day 29 of induction.

        -  To determine whether more sensitive detection of MRD at Day 29 would have clinical
           prognostic value in children with ALL.

      OUTLINE: DNA extracted from diagnostic cells are analyzed for immunoglobulin heavy chain
      variable region by next-generation sequencing.
