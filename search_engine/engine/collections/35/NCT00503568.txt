    
      Overall Goals:

      - to evaluate the safety and induction of anti-tumor immunity by administration of an
      immunogenic human tumor cell vaccine, and assess immune response in relation to clinical
      outcome.

      Primary Aim:

      - to evaluate the safety of administering a heat shock protein gp96-Ig-secreting allogeneic
      tumor cell-vaccine (gp96-Ig vaccine) in patients with advanced NSCLC.

      Secondary Aims:

        -  to study the immune response to vaccination,

        -  to monitor clinical responses and

        -  to recommend a dose-schedule combination for further testing in an initial Phase II
           trial of vaccine efficacy.
