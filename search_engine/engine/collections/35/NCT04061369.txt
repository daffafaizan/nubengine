      of single meals consumed by subjects who have been previously fasting for 12 hours overnight.
      Capturing the full thermic effect of a meal may take up to 8 hours, depending on the calorie
      load, nutrient composition of the meal, and rate of digestion. The investigators will test
      meals consisting of conventional foods that are low (20% of energy), moderate (40% of energy)
      or high (60% of energy) in fat calories, as fat is thought to slow the digestive process. The
      investigators will test a liquid meal, that is high (60% of energy) in fat calories, as
      liquid foods are thought to move more quickly through the digestive process. Another purpose
      of this study is to determine the test-retest reproducibility for the meals described above.
      To accomplish reproducibility, a volunteer will be permitted to repeat a test day two times
      using the same test meal.
