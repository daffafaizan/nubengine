      A root surface with new caries experience was recorded when a root surface which was sound at
      baseline was found to have a carious lesion or a filling at a follow-up examination. Arrested
      root caries was recorded when the active root caries found at baseline changed into inactive
      root caries at follow-up. The status of each root surface was recorded using the codes
      recommended by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS â…¡)
      Coordinating Committee in 2009.

      A mean root caries increment of around 0.8 root surface per year of control group was
      reported in a previous clinical trial conducted in Hong Kong. Thus, in this study, a 24-month
      increment of 1.6 new decayed root surfaces and a standard deviation of 2 was anticipated. In
      order to show that a 50% difference in mean caries increment between the test and control
      groups was statistically significant using a 2-sample t-test at a 5% significance level and
      at an 80% power, a sample size of 100 subjects in each group was required. Allowing for a
      drop-out rate of 20% over 24 months, a total of 480 subjects (120 in each group each site)
      were needed.
