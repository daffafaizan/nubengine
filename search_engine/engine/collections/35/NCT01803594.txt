      bioactive dietary ingredients in various combinations on three separate test days influences
      postprandial lipoprotein metabolism in participants with low circulating HDL-cholesterol.

      The dietary ingredients include:

      Dairy phospholipids(PC700); krill oil (K); lutein (L); and Niacin

      Eligible participants will arrive to the University of California Davis (UC Davis), Ragle
      Human Nutrition Center on the morning of each test day after a 10-12-hr overnight fast. Upon
      arrival participants will fill out a questionnaire about their dietary and medication intakes
      and physical activity for the past 72 hours to ensure compliance. Compliant participants'
      weight and blood pressure will be measured and a fasting blood draw will be taken before
      participants consume their test meal in the form of a milkshake (control, PC700KL, PC700KL +
      Niacin). On each test day, participants will be given only this meal and provided with ample
      supply of bottled water.

      Participants will only consume this test meal and water freely for the duration of the test
      day. Blood will be drawn serially at 2 and 4 hours postprandially. Participants will also be
      asked to provide 3 urine samples throughout the study: before and 2, and 4 hours after
      consumption of the milkshake. Participants will be tested on two additional separate test
      days after the first day separated by a two-week washout. The first two test days will be
      randomized, however the third test day will always contain niacin in order to require
      participants remain at Ragle for the first two hours of the study to monitor niacin flushing
      reactions. Participants have the option of participating in two out of three of the test days
      if they wish to exclude themselves from the niacin test day.
