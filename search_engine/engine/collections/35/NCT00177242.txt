      second line therapy. Docetaxel has known single agent activity in pancreatic carcinoma,
      resulting in a median survival of 5.9 months, similar to gemcitabine, when assessed in Phase
      II studies (10) and pancreatic tumors are known to express EGFR. We propose that the
      combination of docetaxel with Gefitinib will have activity against pancreatic carcinoma,
      whether the regimen is administered as first or second-line therapy for metastatic disease.
      Given the toxicity profiles of both agents, we believe this will be a well-tolerated regimen.
      In fact, preliminary analysis of a phase II study of docetaxel and Gefitinib with an
      identical regimen in non-small cell lung cancer patients showed this regimen to be safe and
      active.
