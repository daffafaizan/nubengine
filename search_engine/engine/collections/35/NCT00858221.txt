      polymorphisms, with obese subjects who are "resistant" to weight loss in a defined program.

      The SECONDARY goal of this study is to investigate if additional candidate obesity genes that
      have previously been associated with obesity or energy metabolism show association with
      resistance to weight loss in subjects on an energy restricted diet. Additionally, we would
      like to investigate if any metabolic syndrome parameters, such as dyslipidemia or abnormal
      fasting glucose are associated with perilipin or variations in other obesity-related genes.
