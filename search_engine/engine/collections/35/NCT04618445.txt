      in which the prevalence of students of TMD will be reported. The association between TMD and
      other variables will be also studied. Therefore, no matching criteria or allocation ratio are
      required.

      Variables It has been shown from literature that many variables are associated with TMD. It
      was therefore, decided to study the correlation between these variables with TMD among
      Egyptian population via a regression model once the assumption for regression analysis are
      satisfied. Binary variables are analyzed through logistic regression, while continuous data
      through a multivariable regression analysis. If one of the assumptions for regression
      analysis is violated, a subgroup analysis for each variable will be considered.

      These Variables include gender, age, psychological stress, oral habits, parafunctional
      activities as gum chewing, previous dental treatments , previous trauma to jaws.

      Data sources and management Data sources, the answered questionnaires and subsequent spread
      sheets will only be shared by the team members.

      Addressing potential sources of bias Selection bias: an email will be sent to all the
      students through their university email addresses. Due to the COVID-19 situation only
      convenient sampling could be used. whenever possible printed questionnaires are handed to the
      students.

      Quantitative variables: Handling of quantitative variables in the analyses None of the data
      is a continuous variable. All exposure factors are binary or categorical data. Therefore, no
      plans are set for simplifying continuous data or converting them into binary ones.
