    
      Randomized patient-blind placebo controlled study. Hb level of 10 g/dl will be used as a
      cut-off value for our study based on the guidelines published by American Society of Clinical
      Oncology and the American Society of Hematology for the treatment of cancer-related anemia,
      recommending Hb<10 g/dl as a treatment threshold.

      Ferinject® to be administered based on Hb and body weight per approved summary of product
      characteristics (SmPC).

      5 - 7 days after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, consented patients with 7g/dl≤Hb<10g/dl will
      be administered Ferinject® or placebo (normal saline) based on the results of randomization.

      • Study Group Ferinject®to be administered as IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection
      with a minimum administration time of 15minutes (for 1000mg single administration) for body
      weight ≥50 Kg or 6 minutes (for 500mg single administration) for body weight <50Kg .

      Note, Ferinject® should be administered to a maximum of 20mg iron/kg. Therefore in patients
      with a body weight <50kg, administration of Ferinject® should be limited to 500mg at baseline
      . All patients with a serum ferritin value <15ng/mL at week 4 visit that a second dose (of
      500mg iron or equivalent placebo) will be given.(Study group: Ferinject®500mg, Control
      Group:Placebo)

      • Control Group Placebo will be in the form of normal saline administered over same time
      period as equivalent Ferinject® administration. IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection
      with a minimum administration time of 15 minutes (200mL as infusion or 20mL as bolus
      injection) for body weight ≥50 Kg or 6 minutes (100mL normal as infusion or 10mL as bolus
      injection) for body weight <50 Kg.
