    
      Subjects suffering from cancer or non-cancer pain suffering from constipation cased or
      aggravated by opioids will be randomised to one of four ratios of hydromorphone PR plus
      naloxone PR or Hydromorphone PR plus placebo to investigate whether a hydromorphone/naloxone
      combination will lead to comparable analgesia, with a decrease in constipation, and to
      investigate the optimal dose ratio of hydromorphone and naloxone.
