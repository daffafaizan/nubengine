      reduce the incidence of elevated body temperature (≥40°C) associated with misoprostol. The
      study will compare the incidence of high fevers following treatment with 600 mcg sublingual
      misoprostol to previously documented rates using 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol. An
      additional line of research is to investigate whether some women are more susceptible to
      experiencing high fevers following misoprostol administration, and whether genetic factors
      are responsible for misoprostol-induced fevers.
