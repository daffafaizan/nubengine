      had failure of current stenting procedures to achieve an adequate clinical outcome. A routine
      CT scan of the chest is required on all individuals going through the procedure for stent
      placement (rigid bronchoscopy). The physician investigator will use this CT scan to measure
      and build a patient-specific stent or modify existing stents to fit the specific need.
