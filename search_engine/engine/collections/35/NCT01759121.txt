    
      This randomized, parallel controlled, clinical-trial aims to evaluate the therapeutic
      efficacy of 532nm laser partially subthreshold panretinal photocoagulation with PASCAL
      endpoint management function for severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy : (1)To
      evaluate therapeutic effect of 532nm laser partially subthreshold panretinal photocoagulation
      with PASCAL endpoint management function for severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy;
      (2)To compare side effect of 532nm laser partially subthreshold panretinal photocoagulation
      with PASCAL endpoint management function on retina with traditional visible endpoint
      panretinal photocoagulation.
