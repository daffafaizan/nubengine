    
      This protocol is designed to provide a mechanism for investigators in the Laboratory of
      Malaria and Vector Research (LMVR) to collect and process peripheral blood samples from
      volunteer donors. Donors who meet standard eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate
      blood via standard phlebotomy techniques at the NIH Clinical Center.

      The LMVR has ongoing in vitro studies to characterize the effects of hemoglobin mutations and
      erythrocyte polymorphisms on the pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of the most
      deadly malaria in humans. G6PD deficiency, hemoglobinopathies such as HbS, HbC, and HbE, and
      the thalassemias are thought to have evolved as protective traits against malaria in endemic
      areas of the world. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations exert their protective
      influence are largely unknown. Culturing P. falciparum in erythrocytes carrying protective
      traits will allow researchers in LMVR to characterize the cellular and molecular bases of
      protection using in vitro methods such as growth analyses and electron microscopy. To this
      effect, patients with known or suspected erythrocyte variants will be recruited in addition
      to normal controls.

      Signed informed consent will be obtained by an authorized investigator. The nature of the
      study as well as the risks and benefits of the donation process will be explained to each
      participant. Donors will be compensated for each blood donation or for unsuccessful attempts
      at venipuncture. Samples will be used solely for in vitro research. To ensure
      confidentiality, blood will be assigned a unique code; investigators listed on this protocol
      will serve as the custodians of the codes that link the samples to the donors' identities.
