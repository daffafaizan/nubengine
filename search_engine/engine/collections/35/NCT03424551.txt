    
      This study was included 17 patients with spastic spinal cord lesions and 23 healthy control.

      Soleus T-reflex, soleus H-reflex, soleus tonic vibration reflex (TVR), and reflex muscle
      response induced by whole body vibration was evaluated this study. To obtain the H-reflex
      response, the tibial nerve in the popliteal region was stimulated by using a stimulator
      (FE155 Stimulator HC ADInstrument, Oxford UK) with 1 ms-pulse current. The records was taken
      with the Ag / AgCl electrodes (Kendall Â®Coviden, self-adhesive electrodes) placed on skin
      according to the SENIAM protocol. To obtain T-reflex response, an electronic reflex hammer
      (Elcon 100-150 Germany) was used. After H-reflex and T reflex records at rest, to obtain
      Tonic vibration reflex, local vibration was applied to the Achilles tendon at 50, 85, 140,
      185, 235 and 265 Hz. To obtain the reflex response induced by Whole body vibration, vibration
      was applied at 35, 37, 39, 41, 43 and 45 Hz. Tibial nerve stimulation was performed again to
      determine Hmax during whole body vibration and local vibration.H-reflex records was taken
      while the subject is sitting on a chair.

      The data was recorded with the PowerLab data acquisition device (ADInstrument Oxford UK). For
      Whole-body vibration, PowerPlate Pro5 (London UK) was used.
