    
      This was a continuation trial of adalimumab in participants with moderate to severe chronic
      plaque psoriasis who had completed Study M04-688 (NCT00338754), a 24-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. This study was an open-label extension study that continued until
      the approval of adalimumab for the treatment of psoriasis in Japan.

      During Study M04-688 (NCT00338754), participants received 24 weeks of treatment with
      adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) with or without a loading dose, adalimumab 80 mg eow,
      or placebo.

      At the start of this study, participants who had received adalimumab 40 mg eow or adalimumab
      80 mg eow in Study M04-688 (NCT00338754) continued on the same treatment regimen.
      Participants who had received placebo during Study M04-688 (NCT00338754) were re-randomized
      at the start of this study to receive adalimumab 40 mg eow or adalimumab 80 mg eow.

      Participants in the adalimumab 40 mg eow treatment group who failed to achieve a PASI50
      response (>= 50% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from Baseline of
      Study M04-688 [NCT00338754]) at or anytime after Week 12 of this study were given the option
      to increase their dose to adalimumab 80 mg eow. Once the dose was escalated, there was no
      option to de-escalate dosing back to 40 mg eow. Participants who failed to achieve PASI50
      responses while receiving adalimumab 80 mg eow may have been discontinued from the study
      after evaluating the risk/benefit of further treatment with adalimumab.

      At Week 28 of this study, it was mandatory for all participants who started the study in the
      adalimumab 80 mg eow treatment group (i.e., not including the dose escalators described
      above) to reduce their dose to adalimumab 40 mg eow, regardless of their response status.
      Following this mandatory dose reduction, if these participants failed to achieve or maintain
      PASI50 response, they were permitted to escalate their dose to adalimumab 80 mg eow. There
      was no option to de-escalate dosing back to 40 mg eow following dose escalation.

      Data in this clinical trial results disclosure are analyzed as observed according to
      treatment received at the start of this study (i.e., adalimumab 40 mg eow or adalimumab 80 mg
      eow) regardless of subsequent dose escalation. Data are summarized according to participants'
      cumulative exposure to adalimumab in Study M04-688 (NCT00338754) and this study.
