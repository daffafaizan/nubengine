      apomorphine. APO401 provided an opportunity for all patients who had participated in a
      Mylan-sponsored placebo controlled trial of apomorphine to receive apomorphine therapy as
      ambulatory outpatients. Patients other than those enrolled in a Mylan-sponsored study were
      allowed to participate. Additional data regarding the safety and effectiveness of outpatient
      use of subcutaneous apomorphine were derived from this experience.
