      treatment called "Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives"
      (HOBSCOTCH) on sixty patients with refractory epilepsy (PWRE). The investigators will employ
      a prospective, single blind randomized clinical trial design with wait-list controls to
      examine both objective and subjective measures of daily life, daily functioning, cognition,
      and emotional well-being. Investigators will also assess the impact of HOBSCOTCH on
      employment and work productivity using the Lam Employment absence and Disability Scale
      (LEAPS) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Lastly, the investigators will examine
      whether changes in these domains are maintained three months after completion of the
      intervention. The study will expand the efficacy literature for HOBSCOTCH and further refine
      its use in a busy clinical environment, and therefore has potential to benefit the patient
      population (PWRE), who currently lacks treatment options besides the pharmacological and
      surgical care currently available.
