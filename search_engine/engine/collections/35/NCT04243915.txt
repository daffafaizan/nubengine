    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using percutaneous neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation (PNMES). PNMES is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, medium and
      long-term of PNMES on muscle activation (increased cross-sectional area in activation) and
      the function of multifidus and abdominal transverse muscle in patients with chronic low back
      pain with random assignment to four treatments: PENS plus motor control exercise program or
      Sham PNMES (introducing the needle) plus motor control exercise program or Transcutaneous
      Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES
      (without inserting the needle) plus motor control exercise program.

      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, medium and
      long-term of PNMES on pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), chronic Pain Grade
      Questionnaire, pressure pain threshold (PPT), area and distribution of pain, conditioned pain
      modulation and temporal summation in patients with chronic low back pain with random
      assignment to four treatments: PNMES plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES
      (introducing the needle) plus motor control exercise program or Transcutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (TENS) plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES (without inserting
      the needle) plus motor control exercise program.

      Aim #3: To compare the effect of the short, medium and long-term of PNMES on disability as
      measured by Oswestry Disability Index, strength and quality of life with random assignment to
      four treatments: PENS plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES (introducing the
      needle) plus motor control exercise program or Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation
      (TENS) plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES (without inserting the needle) plus
      motor control exercise program.

      Aim #4: To estimate the immediate effects of the PNMES technique after the first session.

      Aim #5: To determine if psychological factors (anxiety, depression, kinesiophobia and
      catastrophism) change with any of the treatments and if is related with the primary and
      secondary outcomes.

      Aim #6: To evaluate the change perceived by the patient measured with Global Rating of Change
      Scale (GROC).
