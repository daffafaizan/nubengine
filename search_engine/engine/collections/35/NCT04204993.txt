      affects between 10 and 46% of the population each year and causes around 12 deaths in every
      100,000 people infected. Furthermore, new strains of flu viruses emerge unpredictably every
      few years, causing pandemics that spread rapidly across the world. Since currently available
      antiviral drugs and vaccines cannot prevent these outbreaks, it is essential to be able to
      identify flu infections at an early stage to enable rapid treatment of individuals and
      implementation of public health measures.

      The aim of the study is to investigate disease in volunteers deliberately infected with
      influenza A(H3N2), including biological markers of inflammation and immune response, and
      changes in physiological parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, physical
      activity, oxygen saturation and electrocardiographic data during the onset of influenza
      infection. To achieve this, the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers and inoculate
      them with a flu virus, after which they will be observed in hospital while they develop a
      cold. Each volunteer will be given a number of devices that they will wear before and during
      infection. In addition, they will have blood and nasal samples taken to examine the way their
      immune system responds to infection. The resulting data will be analysed to see if the
      sensors data correlate with the onset of infection and these will be compared with measures
      of the immune response. Ultimately, the investigators anticipate that optimised sensor data
      from devices to be developed may be useful in rapidly detecting when someone is about to
      develop flu infection, so that they can quickly be treated and outbreaks may be identified at
      an early stage.
