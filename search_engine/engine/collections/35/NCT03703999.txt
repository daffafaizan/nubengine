    
      Freestyle Libre is a new technology developed to monitor glycemic values in diabetic
      patients.

      The system is available in Italy from 2014 but in Veneto region reimbursement for insulin
      treated diabetic patients is available from august 2017.

      International trial (for example Impact trial) demonstrated efficacy of the system (reduction
      of the time spent in hypoglycemia).

      Aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy in real life in term of glycated haemoglobin
      (HbA1c) reduction. The investigators will enrollee in this trial all type 1 diabetic patients
      that will start to use the system, on the basis of clinicians decisions and reimbursement
      criteria.

      Investigators will evaluate changes in HbA1c and changes in hypoglycameia fear and therapy
      acceptance through validated questionnaires after 3 and 6 months of system use
