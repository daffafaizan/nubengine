    
      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the 2 year-progression free survival in multiple myeloma with an allogeneic
           transplant using a conditioning regimen of melphalan + fludarabine + Bortezomib in
           patients < 60 years of age and available HLA-matched donor and compare it with the 2
           year-progression-free-survival after an autologous stem cell transplant with
           melphalan+Bortezomib conditioning in patients < 60 years.

        -  To determine the 2 year-progression free survival in multiple myeloma with an autologous
           stem cell transplant using a conditioning regimen of melphalan + Bortezomib. for
           patients > 60 years of age and patients < 60 years of age who decline allogeneic stem
           cell transplant.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the overall survival in multiple myeloma with autologous or allogeneic stem
           cell transplants using the above conditioning regimens

        -  To determine the response rates in multiple myeloma using the above regimens.

        -  To determine minimal residual disease status using allele specific oligonucleotides
           (ASO-PCR) by PCR and flow-cytometry for multiple myeloma cells.

        -  To correlate minimal residual disease status with 2 year progression free survival and
           overall survival.

        -  To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
           multiple myeloma with allogeneic stem cell transplant using the above conditioning
           regimen.

        -  To examine quality of life in patients treated with allogeneic and autologous stem cell
           transplants using the above conditioning regimen.
