      infusion preceded by non-myeloablative chemotherapy and followed by high dose bolus
      interleukin-2 can result in an improved progression free survival when randomly compared to
      ipilimumab in 168 stage IV melanoma patients. A health technology assessment (HTA) will be
      performed to evaluate the impact of the TIL treatment on patients and organizational
      processes and cost-effectivity. This will be done via questionnaires at baseline, just after
      treatment and during follow-up. Also healthcare providers will be interviewed after 6 months
      after starting the trial.
