      around 40%. After restoring intravascular volume, many patients need vasopressor agents to
      maintain arterial blood pressure, which leads to improvement of perfusion at some vascular
      beds, however some organs may suffer from maldistribution of blood flow. These changes of
      regional blood flow may compromise oxygen delivery and perpetuate the inflammation and tissue
      damage associated with the state of shock.

      One of the main mechanisms of vasodilation after inflammatory insults, is the activation of
      the inducible isoform of Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), and the subsequent increase in the
      levels of nitric oxide, which even reduces the response to vasoconstrictor agents. Methylene
      blue (MB) is a selective inhibitor of iNOS, which has been used successfully in patients with
      post-cardiopulmonary bypass associated vasoplegia, however, the evidence of the use of MB in
      septic shock patients is limited to case reports, observational and small studies. In this
      randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare the efficacy and safety outcomes
      of repeated doses of MB in patients with septic shock.
