      Duloxetine of 1 capsule formulation with Duloxetine 60 mg to demonstrate bioequivalence of
      both formulations in terms of rate and extent of absorption:

        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andr√≥maco S.A.

        -  Reference Product: Cymbalta[Trademark], product of Eli Lilly, Puerto Rico. The 90%
           confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus
           Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma
           concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72
           hours (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Duloxetine will be
           determined.

      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 25,5 hours during each
      study period (for 10 hours pre-dosing and for 15,5 hours post dosing) during which
      pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 17 blood samples will be taken up to 24
      hours after the administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to
      provide additional blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose.The washout period between the
      two study periods will be at least 14 days.

      The samples from each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods of high performance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total Duloxetine in
      plasma.

      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in subjects by
      collecting adverse events.
