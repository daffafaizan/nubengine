      All assessments should be performed within 14 days of the scheduled day according to the
      visit schedules, and whenever clinically indicated otherwise. Radiological studies must use
      the same techniques as used at baseline. Evaluation will be based on RECIST criteria.

      Safety: Safety assessments will consist of evaluating adverse events and serious adverse
      events, laboratory parameters including hematology, chemistry, vital signs, physical
      examinations, and documentation of all concomitant medications and/or therapies.
