      13 to 20 years. Participants included both male and female students aged 13 to 20 years.
      Owing to the large number, the students were divided into two groups. The Pre-test was then
      administered. Following this, two health education sessions were delivered by two registered
      nurses for each session. A week after these health talks, the research team went back to the
      school to collect data for the post-intervention. Questionnaires used for both pre and post
      assessment collected data on demographic factors and knowledge on dietary and physical
      activity behaviours linked to hypertension.
