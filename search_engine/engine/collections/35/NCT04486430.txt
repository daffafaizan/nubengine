      neuroprotectant acting as a moderate NR2B-selective NMDA receptor antagonist and potent
      antioxidant, in acute ischemic stroke patients within 6 hours of onset. Compared to NMDA
      antagonists or antioxidants, improved efficacy and therapeutic time window of Neu2000 have
      been well documented in four animal models of stroke. Notable Safety of Neu2000 has been
      demonstrated in 168 human subjects conducted in the US and China as well as animals.

      In the present phase II study, patients with acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours of onset
      would be assigned randomly to one of four groups as follows:

        -  Group A receiving 2.75g Neu2000KWL for 5 days

        -  Group B receiving 5.25g Neu2000KWL for 5 days

        -  Group C receiving 6.00g Neu2000KWL for 5 days

        -  Group D receiving placebo for 5 days

      Patients will receive intravenous infusion of the clinical study drug twice a day at 12Â±1
      hour intervals for 5 days.
