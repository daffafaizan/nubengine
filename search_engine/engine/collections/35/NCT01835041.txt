    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic
      acid), when used in combination with modified leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan
      hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX), in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX combination in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

      II. To collect tissue for future genomic analyses. III. To obtain preliminary data on
      efficacy of treatment with CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid.

      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1
      and 3. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours,
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.
