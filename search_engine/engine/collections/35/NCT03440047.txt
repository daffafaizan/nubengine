      significant risk, will be used for routine endoscopic procedures at Mayo Clinic Florida.
      Where indicated based on clinical standards of care, a biopsy or tissue removal will be
      performed. Immediately prior to tissue removal, a standard set of electronic images will be
      captured including white light, Blue Light Imaging, BLI-bright, Linked Color Imaging (LCI).
      Each image will be stored in high resolution lossless format and later correlated with the
      final clinical and histological (tissue study) diagnosis.
