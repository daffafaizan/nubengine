      concerns on longterm disease outcome. Accordingly, to increase the knowledge on recovery from
      symptoms of acute infection and longterm health effects, a regional COVID-19 online survey on
      the health-status after infection will be performed.

      This cross-sectional anonymous online survey is initiated and conducted by an
      interdisciplinary study team of the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.

      For each participant, demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender, district affiliation,
      profession), medical history (presence of comorbidities, medication), diagnosis of COVID-19,
      symptoms and their duration, treatments and special conditions will be collected.

      The aim of the survey is to better understand the pattern of acute infection and the time of
      recovery of various symptoms.

      The anonymous online survey is open to individuals after COVID-19 infection (proven by
      SARS-Cov-2 positive PCR or antibody test) over the age of 16 and living in Tyrol
      (Western-Austria).

      The survey takes around 30 minutes to complete.
