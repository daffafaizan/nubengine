    
      The study will be prospective, multicentric, single-arm, observational (non-interventional)
      to evaluate the safety and performance of the CELLIS membrane used in abdominal wall
      reconstruction including, but not limited to, ventral hernia repair and stoma closure.

      All evaluations will be performed and products used according to the usual practice, without
      additional or unusual diagnostic, treatment and monitoring procedure.

      The study will be conducted in France in 3 investigational centres including 112 patients
      scheduled for an abdominal wall reconstruction.

      Each patient will participate in one assessment period including a preoperative visit,
      followed by the day of surgical procedure and a hospitalization period.

      Patients will return for ambulatory visits on day 30 (+/- 7 days), on month 3 (+/- 2 weeks),
      on month 12 (+/- 2 weeks) and on month 24 (+/-2 weeks) post-surgery.

      CELLIS will be implanted by open technique following standard techniques. The membrane can be
      used in bridged or reinforced repairs. Mesh placement can include inlay (bridging), underlay
      intraperitoneal, sublay (retrorectus/retromuscular) positions.
