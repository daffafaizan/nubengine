      Subjects and Methods:

      investigators randomly assigned 150 adults (the average age was 59.32 years Â±2.79) with
      chronic diabetic macular edema involving the macular center for repeated ranibizumab
      injections (group A-75) or focal/direct argon laser after repeated ranibizumab injections
      (group B-75). The outcomes were the changes in visual acuity letter score and the central
      subfield thickness (CST) from baseline to one year. visual-acuity Letter score, and CST were
      analyzed with independent t-test and Mann Whitney-test. General linear model with
      multivariate analysis was used for visual acuity letter score, and CST in both groups.
