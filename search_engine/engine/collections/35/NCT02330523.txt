      regeneration (GBR) is a common treatment for the regeneration of ridge form and volume
      preservation allowing dental implant placement. Many bone augmentation biomaterials are
      employed to accomplish GBR, and both the medical/ dental community and, subsequently,
      patients benefit from understanding whether a given GBR biomaterial might be more
      efficacious. To this end, a randomized, case series comparison of allograft + x-linked
      collagen membrane versus xenograft + non-x-linked collagen membrane would be beneficial to
      both the dental community and patients.

      The study compares the effectiveness of demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft + x-linked
      collagen membrane with xenograft + non-x-linked collagen membrane for posterior region
      extraction socket ridge preservation.
