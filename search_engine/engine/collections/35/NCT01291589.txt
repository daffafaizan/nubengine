      in an open trial format an 8-session, individual, cognitive-behavioral therapy based,
      intervention on ten (10) HIV-infected men who have sex with men who report very high levels
      (>10 episodes) of sexual transmission risk behavior (unprotected anal intercourse with
      serodiscordant partners). That is, to pilot test a novel prevention intervention designed to
      effect reductions in sexual transmission risk behavior among the riskiest men in the largest
      HIV risk group in the US. Effecting even modest reductions in the mean number of risk acts in
      this group will likely have substantial public health significance through the number of
      averted new HIV infections. Traditional secondary HIV intervention strategies (e.g.,
      Information, Motivation, Behavior change (IMB)) models only have modest effects for
      HIV-positive MSM and there is evidence to suggest that these effects tend to diminish over
      time.
