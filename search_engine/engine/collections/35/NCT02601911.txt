      injection. Sixty healthy adult volunteers with including criteria and with no spontaneous
      pain, reporting no or mild (Visual analog scale≤54) pain in response to cold testing and
      electric pulp tester, are participating. The patients will be divided into 3 groups on a
      random basis and will be randomly given one of the oral medications including 1) 10 mg
      Ketorolac, 2) 10 mg Ketorolac plus 1000mg Acetaminophen, and 3)Placebo, 45 minutes before
      applying the injection. All patients will receive standard Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block
      injection with one carpule of 4% Articaine with 1:100000 Epinephrine. Patients with no
      anesthetic sign (lip numbness) and positive responses to cold and electric pulp tests would
      be excluded from the study. Endodontic access preparation will be initiated 15 minutes after
      Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block injection. Pain during treatment will be recorded using a Heft
      parker Visual Analog Scale(VAS). Success will be considered as no or mild pain (VAS≤54)
      during caries/dentin removal, access cavity preparation and working lengths measurements.
      Data will be analysed using Mann-U-Whitney and Kruskal-wallis tests.
