    
      The study includes patients over 18 years old who were hospitalized in our covid intensive
      care unit between March 16 and May 16, 2020.

      Retrospective records will be examined by examining the electronic data files of the
      patients.

      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests performed with nasopharyngeal swab taken from the
      person, which is the standard diagnostic method, and also the diagnosis of infection
      symptoms, risk factors and thoracic CT scans indicating pneumonia were diagnosed.

      Patients over 18 years of age with and without a medical history of DM in their history will
      be identified and compared in 2 groups.

      Demographic data such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI) of all patients, presence of
      additional comorbid disease, blood glucose values during hospitalization in intensive care,
      ferritin, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), respiratory support methods (nasal oxygen, nasal high
      flow, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, intubation), length of stay in intensive care
      unit, and mortality will be recorded.
