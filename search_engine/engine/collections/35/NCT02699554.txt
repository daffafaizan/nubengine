      neuromuscular control in order to optimize treatment planning and improve mobility for
      individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). As a first step, the aims of this proposal are to
      evaluate neuromuscular control before and after one of the most common treatments for
      individuals with CP, orthopaedic surgery. The investigators will evaluate if patient-specific
      measures of neuromuscular control, based upon the framework of muscle synergies, can predict
      improvements in walking ability after surgery. Further, investigators will determine whether
      neuromuscular control changes after surgery and if these changes contribute to improvements
      in movement. To achieve these goal the investigators will implement and test new tools to
      quantify neuromuscular control which integrate clinical gait analysis and two computational
      techniques: synergy analysis and dynamic musculoskeletal simulation. This research will
      provide the foundation to use measures of altered neuromuscular control to inform treatment
      planning, develop alternative treatments, and improve mobility in CP and other neurologic
      disorders.
