    
      Specific aims are as follows:

      Aim 1 (Stage IA): Modify Alcohol and Sexual Assault Prevention (ASAP) content to an eHealth
      format to include personalized content for each risk group (1. cisgender heterosexual men; 2.
      cisgender heterosexual women; and 3. sexual and gender minorities).

      Aim 1a: Assess normative behaviors (n = 500) regarding alcohol use and SA for feedback.

      Aim 1b: Adapt and assess initial acceptability of a workbook version of the intervention
      content among key stakeholders (college administrators and students from each risk group [n=5
      from each group]).

      Aim 2 (Stage IB): Open Pilot Trial. Obtain usability of ASAP among 30 students who engage in
      HED (10 from each risk group) in an open pilot trial.

      Aim 3 (Stage IB): A pilot to assess effect size and variability for planning a randomized
      trial in the future. Randomize students who engage in HED to ASAP or control condition to
      observe preliminary effect sizes and estimate the variability using a 3-month follow-up.
      Sample size was determined to estimate the variability within a reasonable margin of error.
      This calculation also accounted the low base rates of SA and 20% attrition. This led to a
      sample size of 162 students (n=54 from each risk group).
