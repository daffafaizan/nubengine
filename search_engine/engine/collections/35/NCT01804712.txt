      patients with high risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy. Prior to
      prostatectomy, patients will receive one treatment cycle (28 days) of rituximab 375 mg/m2
      intravenously once weekly. Patients will be scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy within
      two weeks of completing study treatment. Tissue from prostatectomy will be used for
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of pharmacodynamic markers.
