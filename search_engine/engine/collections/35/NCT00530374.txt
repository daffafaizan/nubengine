      development are its most significant consequences. These may be prevented by giving oral iron
      supplements (OIS), such as Sprinkles. ID treatment was controversial because high dose
      parenteral iron therapy is strongly associated with severe infections when given to severely
      malnourished children. Many studies have since demonstrated the safety of low dose OIS. WHO
      guidelines reflect this finding: population-wide iron supplementation campaign (PWISC),
      without prior screening, is recommended when ID prevalence is â‰¥ 40%.

      However, a gap in the safety evidence has been identified: children with moderate or severe
      malnutrition (MSM) are strikingly absent from the studies performed to date to investigate
      the link between OIS and infectious morbidities. In this context, PWISC may have unrecognized
      deleterious effects when the prevalence of MSM is high, since safety is assumed, but
      incorrectly extrapolated from available evidence.

      We wish to emphasize an additional concern with regards to safety studies published thus far:
      all were designed as superiority trials. In this context, it is statistically incorrect to
      conclude that failure to show a significant difference between iron and placebo means that
      their respective side-effect profiles are similar.
