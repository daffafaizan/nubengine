    
      One alogliptin 25 mg tablet was orally administered once daily before breakfast for up to 52
      weeks.

      The dose of alogliptin was adjusted according to the severity of the participant's renal
      dysfunction based on serum creatinine (SCr) levels. Participants with moderate renal
      dysfunction (SCr, >1.4 - ≤2.4 mg/dL for men and >1.2 - ≤ 2.0 mg/dL for women) received
      alogliptin 12.5 mg tablets.
