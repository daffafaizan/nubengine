      (PPI)-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy as 1st line treatment. However, in Korea,
      eradication rates of PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy have been decreased to less
      than 80% due to increased clarithromycin resistance. In areas of high clarithromycin
      resistance (resistance rate more than 15%), guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy as
      a 1st line treatment for H. pylori eradication. Clarithromycin resistance rates reported from
      15.7% to 42.1% in Korea, thus, bismuth quadruple therapy may be better 1st line treatment
      than PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy. However, only one limited study was
      performed to compare effects of the both treatment regimens in Korea. Thus, studies
      evaluating the effect of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy as the first line treatment for H.
      pylori infection.
