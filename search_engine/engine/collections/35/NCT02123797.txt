      Program has two components: Primarily, the program is centered in a multidisciplinary clinic,
      wherein patients and their informal caregivers are seen by multiple specialists at a single
      appointment time; secondarily, the program includes a multidisciplinary conference, wherein
      all of the specialists potentially involved in lung cancer care discuss patients referred for
      presentation and make consensus recommendations for care. This study focuses primarily on the
      experience and outcomes of care delivered to patients evaluated in the multidisciplinary
      clinic. However, data from the conference will also be included in some aspects of the study.
      The goal is to improve the access and quality of thoracic oncologic care delivery within the
      Baptist Healthcare System The investigators specific aim is to perform a prospective, matched
      cohort comparative effectiveness study of patients receiving serial vs. multidisciplinary
      care, with key patient-centered endpoints (survival, stakeholder satisfaction with the care
      experience, timeliness and stage-appropriateness of care, quality of staging). Serial care is
      defined as the current system of linear, sequential, referral-based care delivery.
