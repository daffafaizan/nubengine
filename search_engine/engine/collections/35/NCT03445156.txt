      whether violent shooting can train people to shoot targets in the head, both during gameplay
      (Pilot Study) and after the game is turned off (Experiment Proper). Participants in both
      studies played a violent shooting game with humanoid targets that rewarded headshots, or a
      nonviolent shooting game that punished shots to bull's-eye targets with faces. Afterward,
      participants shot at a mannequin with a realistic CO2 gun. We anticipate that participants
      who play the violent game which rewards headshots to hit the mannequin's head more often than
      those who play the non-violent game.
