      value-based cognitive-behavioural therapy program (V-CBT) is able to prevent the development
      of persistent disability, pain, and psychological distress if delivered within the first
      three months after a whiplash injury. Methods. The current study is a two-armed randomized
      controlled study with a crossover design. Group A is scheduled for V-CBT within one week of
      randomization and group B with a delayed onset 3 months after randomization.
