      between respiratory problems and dental caries in children who exhibit the habit of bruxism.

      Method: Patient histories were taken and clinical exams were performed on 90 children for
      selection and allocation to one of two groups. For the determination of bruxism, a
      questionnaire was administered to parents/guardians and an oral clinical exam was performed
      based on the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Thirty-three male and female
      children between four and seven years of age participated in the present study - 14 children
      with bruxism and 19 children without bruxism. The data were statistically analyzed using the
      chi-square test, with level of significance set at 5% (p < 0.05).
