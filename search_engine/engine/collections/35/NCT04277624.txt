      days between investigational product (IP) administrations. Participants will be randomized to
      1 of 2 sequences: either fezolinetant test formulation followed by fezolinetant reference
      formulation or fezolinetant reference formulation followed by fezolinetant test formulation.
      Participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and will be residential for 2
      study periods for a total of 10 days/9 nights. Premenopausal female participants will be
      admitted to the clinical unit during days 1 to 3 of their menstrual cycle. Participants will
      receive a single dose of test formulation or reference formulation under fasting conditions
      on day 1 of each period i.e., days 2 to 4 (period 1) and days 7 to 9 (period 2) of their
      menstrual cycle for premenopausal female participants. Participants are to remain
      semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for 4 hours postdose.
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected predose on day 1 of each period and at multiple
      time points postdose. Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted.
      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 4 of period 2 on the condition
      that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a
      longer stay in the clinical unit.

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 5 to 9
      days after discharge from period 2 or at early discontinuation from the study.
