      diagnosis of CFRD is crucial to prevent the unnecessary deterioration of pulmonary function
      and nutritional status, both of which affect the patient's overall survival. The selective
      approach takes less patient time and is less expensive. If it is equally accurate it should
      be used routinely. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the accepted method for
      detecting CFRD and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust guidelines recommend that patients with CF over
      the age of twelve years should be screened annually. Yung et al, questioned this approach and
      argued that performing OGTT on all CF patients is inconvenient and may not be cost effective,
      as patients have to starve overnight and need to spend an extra 2 hours in the hospital in
      addition to all the other annual review tests.

      In this study, a selective approach in performing OGTTs in the screening for CFRD will be
      used; this includes the use of a combination of clinical and biochemical criteria that of
      abnormal random blood glucose and /or abnormal glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and/or
      symptoms of hyperglycaemia, or weight loss.
