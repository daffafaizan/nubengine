      produce subject discomfort with medical and economic consequences. This study was designed to
      evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety of palonosetron for the subjects who undergo
      gynecologic or simple laparoscopic surgery. As the previous studies of palonosetron evaluated
      only the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), there was no evidence-based
      guideline of palonosetron for treatment of PONV. The aim of the present study is to evaluate
      the treatment efficacy and safety of palonosetron for the patients who undergo laparoscopic
      gynecologic, abdominal or other surgery under general anesthesia.
