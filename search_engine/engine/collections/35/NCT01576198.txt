        -  To analyze 250 favorable-histology Wilms tumor (FHWT) samples from patients registered
           on NWTS4 for gain of 1q and 15q, and loss of 1p, 16q, 17p, and 22q by subtelomeric
           multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and to determine their
           association with relapse-free and overall survival.

        -  To develop a robust multiplex MLPA test using multiple synthesized probes to those
           targets identified as significantly associated with relapse in Aim 1.

        -  To validate the multiplex MLPA test designed and tested in Aim 2 on an independent set
           of 1727 FHWT and 250 anaplastic WT registered on NWTS-5.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for gain of 1q and 15q, and loss of 1p, 16q, 17p,
      and 22q by MLPA. Assay results are then researched for accuracy, clinical validity,
      sensitivity, precision, and potential analytical interferences.
