      their regular healthcare provider. No additional study medication was administered. This
      study enrolled patients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to very severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study looked at the prevalence of chronic
      bronchitis in patients suffering from moderate, severe or very severe COPD, and it also
      compared worsening of COPD in patients with or without chronic bronchitis. This study
      enrolled 976 patients. This multi-centre trial was conducted in Belgium and Luxembourg. The
      overall time to participate in this study was at a single, regularly scheduled visit at the
      pulmonologists office. There were no follow-up assessments for this study.
