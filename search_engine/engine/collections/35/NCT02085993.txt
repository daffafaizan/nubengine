    
      This cross-sectional study involves direct observation by a healthcare professional of a
      series of subjects and caregivers in the act of administering romiplostim at their first
      standard-of-care visit occurring 4 weeks after training with the HAT pack. Further
      observations, if they occur, will also be recorded in the study if made within 16 weeks of
      enrolment. (Additional observations are voluntary and are not required for study
      participation; they occur only if the healthcare professional requests them.) Additionally,
      data will be collected from the subjects' dose diary at the first standard of care visit to
      ensure there were no problems with administration while not at the clinic.
