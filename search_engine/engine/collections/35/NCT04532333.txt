      aneurysms. Despite advances in technology and techniques, thromboembolic and bleeding events
      are still encountered as inherent perioperative complications. Hypercoagulability as a
      systemic response to acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may be associated with an increased
      incidence of thromboembolic events.

      The administration of anticoagulant may reduce thromboembolic events during the endovascular
      embolization, meanwhile, involves the risk of bleeding. Although heparin is commonly used
      during the procedure, the safety in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms has not
      been established. In contrast to heparin, bivalirudin is a short-lived direct thrombin
      inhibitor with an intrinsic antiplatelet activity and more stable pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties which has been associated with reduced bleeding and an overall
      favorable profile. Bivalirudin administration in patients with high bleeding risk during
      coronary intervention is recommended by current guidelines.

      This is an open label, multicenter, randomized pilot study, which is aimed to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of bivalirudin coil embolization in patients with ruptured intracranial
      aneurysms.
