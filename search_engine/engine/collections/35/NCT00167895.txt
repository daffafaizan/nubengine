      on initial wound healing. Haematoma formation may lead to prolonged wound drainage and tissue
      necrosis1, which can have a negative effect on early range of motion, post-operative pain and
      length of hospital stay. In addition, studies have suggested that prolonged wound drainage
      also leads to a higher infection rate.

      To decrease haematoma formation, primary soft tissue homeostasis and adequate tissue repair
      are essential. During the immediate reaction of tissue to injury, haemostasis and
      inflammation occur. Growth factors, especially PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) and
      TGF-Î² (transforming growth factor-beta), play a crucial role in the biochemical cascade at
      the site of repair. These growth factors are mostly derived from platelets. They act as
      chemotactic agents for polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and
      lymphocytes. Both factors stimulate angiogenesis and fibroplasia. PDGF also has a role in
      wound contraction and remodeling. When applying large concentrations of growth factors in a
      wound, faster tissue repair and homeostasis can be expected, thus leading to less haematoma
      formation.

      Treatment with autologous platelet concentrate involves direct application of concentrated
      platelets, growth factors and fibrin in the operation wound. A small volume (55-110 ml) of
      the patient's own blood is taken to derive a platelet rich gel which can be sprayed directly
      into the wound.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of autologous platelet concentrate on
      blood loss (post-operative decrease of haemoglobin concentration), wound healing
      complications, range of motion, pain reduction and outcome scores when used in total knee
      arthroplasty.
