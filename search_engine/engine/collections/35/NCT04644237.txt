      5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) in
      participants with HER2-mutated metastatic NSCLC. Each participant is expected to receive
      approximately 14 months of trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment. The primary endpoint of the
      study will be objective response rate (independent central review). Secondary endpoints will
      include, but not limited to, disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free
      survival, objective response rate (investigator), overall survival, and safety.
