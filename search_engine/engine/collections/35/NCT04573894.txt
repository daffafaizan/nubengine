      culture bottles from either the patient's or healthcare worker's flora, or the immediate
      environment during specimen collection. Species considered as potentially contaminating
      (coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Cutibacterium
      acnes, Micrococcus spp., viridans group streptococci, and Clostridium perfringens) can,
      however, be responsible for true bacteremia. If an organism belonging to one of those species
      is detected in isolates, rapidly and accurately assessing its contaminant or infectious
      potential is hence important to ensure effective antibiotic therapy as well as to reduce
      financial burden caused by unnecessary treatments, and additional clinical and laboratory
      costs.

      Blood levels of the prohormone procalcitonin (PCT) markedly increase in the early stages of
      bacterial infections. The aim of our study is to determine the role of plasma PCT as a
      biomarker differentiating blood culture contaminations from true bacteremia.
