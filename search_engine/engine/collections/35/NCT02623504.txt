      tolerance and safety of extended release Equetro (carbamazepine) versus placebo followed by
      an open label and long term maintenance treatment on extended release Equetro in children and
      adolescents aged 10-17 year diagnosed with acute manic or mixed bipolar I disorder. The
      safety evaluations will be based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events,
      laboratory values, physical examination, vital signs ECG and trough serum level of study
      medication. The secondary objective is to evaluate under double blind conditions the efficacy
      of extended release Equetro versus placebo followed by an open label and long term
      maintenance treatment on extended release Equetro in children and Adolescents Aged 10-17
      years diagnosed with acute manic or mixed Bipolar I disorder. Efficacy evaluations will be
      based on the measures of YMRS, CGI-S, CGI-I, CDRS-R. Manic episodes over double blind and
      open label periods will comprise the use of study medication and duration of night time sleep
      as monitored using a daily diary. Subject's will be enrolled in the double blind period for
      two months and evaluated on a weekly basis. Once completing the db phase they will continue
      on Equetro for long term maintenance for an additional six months. Placebo subject will have
      the opportunity to continue for another eight months in the study. The first two months will
      be the titration period as was done in the db phase and then they will have the option to
      continue in the study for an open long term maintenance for and additional 6 months. During
      the maintenance period subjects will be evaluated for safety and efficacy on a monthly basis.
      At the end of the study there will be a 30 day follow-up.
