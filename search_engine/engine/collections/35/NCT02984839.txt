      problem that contributes to adverse outcomes in the post-anesthesia care unit
      (PACU).Unidentified residual neuromuscular blockade (defined as a train-of-four (TOF) ratio
      <0.9) has been reported in up to 30-42% of patients in the recovery room.Though current
      literature supports the use of quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular blockade,
      conventional qualitative TOF count monitoring and clinical signs (head lift, grip strength)
      continue to be used.There is strong evidence that shows reduction of clinically significant
      post-operative residual neuromuscular blockade (PRNB) after implementation of quantitative
      monitoring. Post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are notable adverse outcomes of
      residual neuromuscular blockade. The implementation of quantitative monitoring may be
      particularly beneficial to patients who are already predisposed to PPCs secondary to the site
      of surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of PRNB with use of quantitative
      neuromuscular monitoring in patients undergoing intra-abdominal procedures compared to
      patients undergoing other surgical procedures that also require NMBA administration.
