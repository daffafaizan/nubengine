      with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at the dose
      level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events
      occurring from the intravenous injection of CPI-300 within 28 days:

        -  Grade 4 or greater treatment related adverse events

        -  Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity
           (including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea lasting more than 72 hours)

      Blood samples will be drawn to determine drug blood concentrations for pharmacokinetic
      assessment.
