      libraries, microarray chips, tissue specific probes, and proteomics development and
      validation. This protocol will allow acquisition of patient samples at the time of tissue
      sampling for surgery, diagnostic tests, or therapeutic phereses. These samples will be
      forwarded without patient identifiers, pathology reports, or other labels. Tissue pathology
      will be verified within the Laboratory of Pathology and samples used strictly for CGAP and
      Proteomic Initiative indications.
