      non-small-cell lung cancer patients who are not eligible to operation is to administer
      EGFR-TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib or erlotinib). To determine the
      effectiveness of nicotinamide on lung cancer, nicotinamide or placebo tablet will be
      co-administered with gefitinib or erlotinib for two years until the event or censoring
      occurs. The stratified block randomization was designed with 3 covariates (EGFR mutation
      status, kind of EGFR-TKI, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status score
      variation). The size of lesions will be checked every other months by radiology. PD
      (progressive disease) will be assessed according to RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors)1.1. After observing 36 events, an interim analysis of hazard ratio by Cox
      proportional hazard regression will be performed. The final analysis will be done by the same
      protocol after observation of 72 events. The significance level of the interim and final
      analysis were set to 0.0075 and 0.0209 respectively. Response rate, quality of life (measured
      by 10 questions at every visit), and overall survival will be analysed together. All other
      adverse reactions will be analysed and reported, if there.
