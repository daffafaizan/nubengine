      needle phobia for 10% of adults. Current pain relief options include numbing creams,
      vapocoolant spray, or injected lidocaine. 17 million pediatric IV access procedures are done
      yearly with no pain intervention. An inexpensive, immediately acting form of needle pain
      control could reduce needle phobia in the long term if demonstrated to be effective for
      needle pain.

      This study will evaluate pain self report and parent report using the Faces Pain Scale
      revised, and video-coded OSBD-R scores for patients undergoing emergency department venous
      access or cannulation procedures. Demographic information, pre-procedural anxiety, and
      success data from the attempts at placement will be included.
