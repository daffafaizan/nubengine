    
      To compare the diagnostic value of uPAR-PET/CT for prognostication compared to the current
      imaging options (CT, MRI and ultrasound) by observer-blinded readings. The reference that
      will be used as "gold standard" is the pathological examination of the surgically removed
      tissues.

      The new imaging modality (uPAR-PET/CT) will be used in two separate groups of patients with
      head and neck cancer:

      Study I:

      Patients with oral cancer without clinical evidence of spread (OSCC in stage cN0)

      Study II:

      Patients with metastatic oral cancer (OSCC in stage cN +) and patients with metastatic
      oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC in stage cN +).
