      (i.e. IV iloprost) induce major adverse effects, limiting the use of such therapies.
      Iontophoresis is a non invasive route of administration of drugs. In experimental and
      clinical preliminary studies, the investigators have shown that iontophoresis of treprostinil
      on the forearm of healthy subjects induces a sustained increase in skin blood flux and that
      it is well tolerated (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01082484, manuscript in press). The investigators
      therefore aim at validating this proof of concept on the digits of SSc patients.
