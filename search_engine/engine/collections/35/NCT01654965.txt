      I. To establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of ARQ 197
      (tivantinib) and intravenous (IV) topotecan (topotecan hydrochloride).

      II. To describe the toxicities of ARQ 197 and IV topotecan at each dose studied.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of ARQ 197 given concurrent use of IV
      topotecan.

      IV. To document all clinical responses to ARQ 197 with IV topotecan.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tivantinib and topotecan hydrochloride.

      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, topotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 6.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
