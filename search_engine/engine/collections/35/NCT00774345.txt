      completed an multiple sites to compare the safety and efficacy (how well a drug works) of
      lenalidomide maintenance therapy to placebo (dummy capsule that contains no lenalidomide or
      active substances) maintenance therapy.

      Patients are assigned by a computer with a 50/50 chance to receive placebo or lenalidomide
      study treatment. Study drug will be taken once each day until the patient discontinues the
      study. Patients will remain on study drug until progression of disease.

      Patients will visit their study doctor every 28 days until disease progression to complete
      safety and efficacy assessments. Quality of life assessments will be completed every other
      month. If a patient who discontinue study drug prior to disease progression (i.e. due to an
      adverse reaction to the study drug), they will continue to visit the study doctor each month
      to complete the efficacy assessments up to progression of disease. Safety assessments may
      include laboratory blood tests, ECG tests and questions about any medical conditions or side
      effects experienced during the study. Efficacy assessments may include laboratory blood tests
      and focused physical exams.

      Computed tomography (CT) scans along with blood tests and bone marrow samples will be
      collected to confirm if a patient has improvement of response while on study.

      After disease progression, patients will be contacted every 12 weeks for survival
      information, next CLL treatments and quality of life questions.

      Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment
      immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment. The subjects will then
      transition to the survival follow-up period.
