      be enrolled that have at least 50% cerumen impaction. All ears/subjects will receive at least
      a single dose (approximately 1 - 2 mL) of the test product applied topically in the study ear
      canal. The test product will be supplied from a qualified compounding pharmacy that receives
      a by-subject prescription from the investigator. The subject will be dosed with the head
      tilted in order to keep the test product in the ear canal for 15 minutes. At 5 and 10
      minutes, subjects will be instructed to move their jaw up and down (and side to side) a few
      times and, manipulate/massage the ear canal by pressing between jawbone and ear lobe with a
      rotating motion for 10 seconds, which may aid in distribution of the test product in the ear
      canal. Fifteen minutes after product instillation, it will be removed by having the subject
      tilt the head over a disposable container to catch the solution. The ear canal will be
      irrigated (low pressure) with warm water and, the evaluator will try to visualize the
      tympanic membrane using an otoscope (before and after lavage). The amount (change in area,
      volume and depth) of the tympanic membrane that can be visualized and the categorization of
      cerumen impaction (according to a 5 point scale) is the primary efficacy parameter of this
      study. Efficacy will also be assessed using subjective questions (improvement and change in
      symptoms) that will be asked by the study staff and documented prior to the subject having
      any knowledge of the otoscope results (visualization of TP).
