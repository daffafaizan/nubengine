      in disease free intervals, disease free survival, and the severity of treatment related
      toxicities. However, it is important for patients and families to know the quality of life
      (QOL) they can expect following an allogeneic transplant. In this longitudinal study we will
      compare the QOL of patients undergoing a non-myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant (A-PBSCT) prospectively with that of a myeloablative A-PBSCT. Subjects
      (n=106) over the age of 18 will be enrolled. Measures of quality of life (Medical Outcomes
      Study Short Form-MOS SF-36 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and Bone
      Marrow Transplant - FACT-G and FACT-G/BMT) and symptom distress (Symptom Distress Scale -
      SDS) will be administered prior to transplant (baseline) and at set interval post transplant.
      Data will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance and regression analysis.
