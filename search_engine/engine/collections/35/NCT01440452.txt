      muscles to cause the weakened or paralyzed muscles to contract and produce a cycling motion
      of the legs. The FES cycling in this study will be done through a device called the RT300-SL
      Cycle Ergometer (RT300).

      Although this device has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by
      individuals with neurological disorders, we are trying to find out the best way to use it in
      order to obtain the greatest results.
