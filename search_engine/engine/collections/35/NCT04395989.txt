      and safety of multiple targeted treatment vs. traditional chemotherapy in patients with
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The specific
      grouping of patients' depends on FUSCC 500+ gene panel testing and IHC subtype staining.These
      tests would be done on their rebiopsy tumor specimen. Specifically, as to TNBC molecular
      subtyping,FUSCC data identified the genomic aberrations that drive each TNBC subtype by
      applying an integrative analysis combining somatic mutation, copy number aberrations (CNAs)
      and gene expression profiles, which classified TNBC patients into four subtypes, namely
      luminal androgen receptor (LAR), immunomodulatory (IM), basal-like immune suppressed (BLIS),
      and mesenchymal-like (MES). Then, FUSCC conducted a IHC subtyping model to replace complex
      genomic sequencing, which have been validated in FUSCC cohort.FUSCC 500+ gene panel was
      developed combining public database(TCGA, METABRIC, 560WES, MSKCC-IMPACT ect.) and FUSCC
      private TNBC database.
