      two data collection sessions, one before and one after a 14-day stress reduction training
      course conducted via a smartphone that participants provide. This course entails
      instructor-facilitated stress reduction exercises previously shown to reduce stress and
      improve well-being. Participants will be randomly assigned to a mindfulness course or a
      cognitive reappraisal course. Both of these courses -mindfulness training (MT) and cognitive
      reappraisal training (RT) - involve expert-facilitated mental wellness techniques. MT
      emphasizes mindfulness-based techniques to reduce stress and promote wellbeing, whereas CT
      emphasizes reframing and reappraisal techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being.
