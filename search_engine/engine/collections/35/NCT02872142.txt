      and safety of PE with AlbuteinÂ® 5% in subjects with ALS. The planned enrollment is 10
      subjects who have a definite, possible, or probable diagnosis of ALS, according to the
      revised El Escorial criteria. Enrolled subjects will be treated with PE using Albutein 5% as
      a replacement solution during an Intensive Treatment Phase (2 PEs per week over 3 weeks)
      followed by a Maintenance Treatment Phase (weekly PE for 21 weeks) for a total treatment
      duration of 6 months. A 6-month follow up will begin after the last PE.
