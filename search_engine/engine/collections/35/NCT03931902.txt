      airway group (LMA group) and endotracheal tube group (ETT group). Masking ventilation with
      sevoflurane will be used for anesthesia induction till the adequate anesthetic depth.
      Intubation with laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or endotracheal tube (ETT) will be done as
      allocated group. After the surgery completed and the patient wakened up, the anesthesiologist
      will remove the LMA or ETT according to the clinical criteria for extubation.
