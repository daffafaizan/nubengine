    
      Emergence agitation was assessed using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED)
      scale.The PAED scale contains five items (eye contact, purposefulness of actions,awareness of
      surroundings, restlessness and consolability), each scored on a 0 to 4 scale, for a maximum
      of 20 points.

      A perfectly calm child scores 0 and extreme agitation corresponds to 20 points. The peak EA
      score was recorded. Agitation scores < 10 were interpreted as an absence of agitation,
      scores>= 10 were regarded as presence of agitation.
