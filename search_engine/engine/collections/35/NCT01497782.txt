      Throughout the last decade several studies have found a positive effect on the learning curve
      as well as improvement of basic psychomotor skills in the operating room after VR training.
      VR simulators offer standardized and reproducible laparoscopic tasks, ranging from simple
      basic skills training to full procedures such as a cholecystectomy or salpingectomy. Despite
      the now well-established advantages of VR simulators, the majority of surgical and
      gynecological departments encounter hurdles when implementing this form of training in the
      surgical education. This is mainly due to lack of knowledge concerning the time and human
      resources/cost needed to train novice surgeons to an adequate level.

      This randomized trial investigates whether instructor feedback is pivotal for the trainee
      when training operational tasks (a laparoscopic salpingectomy) on a VR simulator. The VR
      simulator used in this trial is the LapSim from Surgical Science, Sweden. Instructor feedback
      consists of standardized feedback for ten minutes and with a maximum of three optional
      feedback sessions; the trainees (in the intervention group) decides them selves when they
      want a feedback session. The trainees in both the control group and the intervention group
      have to reach a predefined proficiency level on the VR simulator within 8 weeks with 3-hour
      training sessions each time. Furthermore, the trial focuses on different learning approaches,
      e.g. a self-directed approach and an independent approach.

      The randomization process will take place at a central unit; Copenhagen Trial Unit, Denmark.
      Stratification variables are: 1)Gender 2)Computer game experience (less that 20 hours
      annually)
