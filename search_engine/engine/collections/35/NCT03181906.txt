      risk of medication discrepancies. Despite medication reconciliation service being practiced
      in the hospital setting, there was limited knowledge on its effectiveness in the primary care
      setting. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a pre-consultation medication
      reconciliation service in reducing medication discrepancies in patients who transit from
      hospital to primary care. Adult patients who made their first visit to the polyclinics
      following a recent hospital discharge and were prescribed with 5 or more chronic medications
      were randomised to 2 groups. Pre-consultation medication reconciliation by a pharmacist was
      carried out for the intervention group. Outcome was assessed by a different pharmacist who
      was blinded to the randomised allocation. The control group underwent usual care without a
      pre-consultation medication reconciliation.
