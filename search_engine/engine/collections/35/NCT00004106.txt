        -  Determine the response rate to temozolomide in patients with relapsed mycosis fungoides
           or Sezary syndrome.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate pretreatment AGT activity in tumor cells with response to this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 1 year.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
