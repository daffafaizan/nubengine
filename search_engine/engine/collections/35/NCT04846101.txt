      control. The cavities will be prepared according to the concepts of minimal invasive
      dentistry. Prior to placing the composite resin, the margins of the cavities will be finished
      using ultra fine grit diamond bursÂ·and beveled in a 1-mm area. Deep cavities suspected to be
      near the pulp be lined with RMGI. Inclusion criteria: class Ill and Class IV carious lesions.

      The enamel margins of the cavities will be acid etched for 60s with 37% phosphoric acid and
      then rinsed thoroughly with water spray. Afterwards, the dentin bonding system will be
      applied, left undisturbed for 20 s and then excess removed using an air syringe and light
      cured for 20s. The restorative composite material will be placed in incremental layers,
      adapted, each layer cured for 40s. After polymerization, the restorations will be finished
      under profuse water spray using diamonds, Sof-Lex finishing discs and polishers.

      All restorations will be placed by one dentist (Pl). Written informed consent will be
      provided to all participants prior to starting the treatment
