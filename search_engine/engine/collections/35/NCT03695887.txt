      significantly altered metabolism. Unfortunately, the use of regular general anesthesia or
      conscious sedation is not a viable option due to the resources required, and as the
      hypermetabolism of burn injury would result in compromised wound healing with repeated
      periods of without eating related halting of nutritional intake. This has led to the use of a
      number of adjuncts ranging from nonmedical (virtual reality, mindfulness, hypnosis etc.) to
      medication (ketamine, anxiolytics etc.). Historically Nitrous oxide has been used in similar
      settings where severe procedural pain is of relatively shorter duration, such as tooth
      extraction, labor or minor surgical procedures. Nitrous oxide is a rapidly acting analgesic
      that takes effect seconds after inhalation, and lasts minutes. While a randomized trial of
      Nitrous oxide in burn care has been proposed, the only published information currently
      available is in a Chinese medical journal.

      To address this a gap in knowledge, a pilot Randomized Controlled trial is proposed to
      evaluate if Nitrous Oxide in the form of limited dose inhaler canisters can be used to
      improve pain control during burn dressing changes compared to placebo canisters.
