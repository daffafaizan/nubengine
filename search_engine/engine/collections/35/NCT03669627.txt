      mortality) similar to that of the elderly, and have been identified as a high priority target
      for vaccination programs by Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization. There is
      evidence that a person's first exposure to influenza antigens may have long-term implications
      for protection.

      This is a randomized, controlled, observer-blind study that will assign participants to one
      of three groups. Group 1 will receive MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (two doses one month
      apart) in the fall of year 1, followed by QIV (one dose) in the fall of year 2. Group 2 will
      receive QIV (two doses one month apart) in the fall of year 1, followed by QIV (one dose) in
      the fall of year 2. Group 3 will receive MF59-adjuvanted IV (two doses one month apart) in
      the fall of year 1, followed by MF59-adjuvanted IV (one dose) in the fall of year 2.
