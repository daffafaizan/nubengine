      with advanced solid tumors for which no standard therapy exists. Patients will receive
      PNT2258 as an intravenous infusion once daily for 5 consecutive days (Days 1-5) of every
      21-day cycle (3 weeks). At first, patients will be treated in single patient cohorts
      following an accelerated titration design and evaluated for toxicities. After the accelerated
      portion ends, patients will be treated in cohorts of at least 3 patients at each dose level
      and evaluated for treatment-related toxicities.
