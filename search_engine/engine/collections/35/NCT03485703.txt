      the release of immunoinflammatory mediators. However, safe drug therapy that decreases its
      severity is not available. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic with potent
      anti-inflammatory effects, but has been poorly studied in preterm infants except for very few
      studies in extreme preterms for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of azithromycin on the prevention of
      cytokine-mediated MV-induced injury in cytokine plasma levels (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10
      and TNF- α) in preterm newborns, submitted to mechanical ventilation in the first 72 hours of
      life.

      It is a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. When the use of azithromycin was
      considered, after signing the informed consent, a randomization was performed by the
      intravenous mixtures center of Hospital de clinicas de porto alegre where a group of newborns
      will receive azithromycin EV at the dose of 10mg / kg / day and another group will receive
      placebo (SF 0.9%) in the same volume, a blood aliquot of 300μL will be collected in all ETDA
      for cytokine analysis and PCR for Ureaplasma. After 5 days of starting azithromycin or
      placebo, a new sample will be collected for cytokines along with blood collection from the
      patient's routine. There will be no blood collection exclusively for the study.
