      this study in 21 centers in France.

      500 patients are planned to be included.

      After written informed consent will be obtained, the patients will be randomized in two arms:

        -  comorbidities

        -  self-assessment/self-management The patients will be seen again in the same center 12
           months later in order to collect the outcome measures

      The two primary objectives of this trial are :

        -  To evaluate the impact of a nurse led program of self-assessment of disease
           activity/severity and self-management on the level of satisfaction/coping

        -  To evaluate the impact of a nurse led program of assessment of comorbidities on the
           management of such comorbidities

      The Secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities in SpA;

        -  To evaluate the level of adherence to recommendations of prevention of comorbidities;

        -  To evaluate the impact of the nurse led program of self-assessment / self-management on
           the amount of NSAID (Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) intake and the level of
           disability (e.g. functional disability)
