      I. To show that multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine (folate receptor
      [FR]alpha peptide vaccine) with sargramostim (GM-CSF) adjuvant will prolong the disease-free
      survival (DFS) compared to GM-CSF adjuvant treatment in patients with triple negative breast
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the safety and tolerability of metronomic cyclophosphamide followed by FRalpha
      peptide vaccine with GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether high level of antibody and cellular immune response toward the
      FRalpha measured at baseline is a prognostic factor for vaccine immune response and/or cancer
      relapse.

      II. To determine whether the level of tumor expression of FRalpha at baseline is a prognosis
      factor for vaccine immune response and/or cancer relapse.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and 15-21
      of cycle 1 only. Starting cycle 2, patients receive multi-epitope folate receptor alpha
      peptide vaccine with sargramostim intradermally (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for cycles 2-7 and every 6 months for cycles 8-14 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide as in Arm I. Starting cycle 2, patients receive
      placebo vaccine with sargramostim ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for cycles 2-7
      and every 6 months for cycles 8-14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
