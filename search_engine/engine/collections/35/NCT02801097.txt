      with irinotecan. After the first 3 subjects of each cohort complete Cycle 1, the safety will
      be assessed before moving to the next dose level. Subjects in the current cohort will
      continue treatment immediately following the completion of Cycle 1, for as long as therapy is
      tolerated and the RECIST v.1.1 definition of progression is not met.
