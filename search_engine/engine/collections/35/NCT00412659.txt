      sinus. However it's associated with high incidence of post operative infection and
      recurrence. On the other hand Karydakis operation (excision lateral of the midline,
      transposition flap and primary suture) is just a slightly more complicated procedure but has
      five times less recurrences reported in case series. The purpose of the present study is to
      compare the surgical results and costs of the two surgical methods utilized. In addition the
      investigators aim to compare the quality of life at defined time points after surgery.
      Eligible patients are randomized to two groups of surgeons, well trained in either the
      midline operation or the Karydakis operation (expertise based design). The design of the
      study allows wide inclusion criteria for participants, a cost-utility approach in the
      analysis, and a high external validity of the conclusions reached.

      Comparison: Midline excision andd primary suture compared with the Karydakis operation
      (excision lateral of the midline and primary suture) for pilonidal disease.
