      Traditional treatments for vitiligo including topical corticosteroids and phototherapy lead
      to limited clinical effects. Autologous melanocyte transplantation is another way to treat
      vitiligo. However, the effect is largely affected by whether cultivated melanocytes are
      successfully uptaken by vitiliginous skin. The aim of this study is to survey the
      self-assembly on biomaterials and functional analysis. In the long run, this study may
      provide a better way for treatment of vitiligo.
