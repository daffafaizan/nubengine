      therapy resistant hypertension, all trials published so far face the problem of a certain
      proportion of nonresponders to treatment. Previous data shows, that to some extent this might
      be attributable to arterial stiffening. Elevated invasive pulse wave velocity as an
      established marker for arterial stiffness has been found to be associated with nonresponse to
      renal denervation treatment in a smaller trial population. This trial attempts to assess the
      predictive value of different invasive and non-invasive markers for arterial stiffness in an
      adequately powered population.
