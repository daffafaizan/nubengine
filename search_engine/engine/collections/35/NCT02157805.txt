      infusing 15N ammonium sulphate during 50 days in the rumen of an heifer. Two different
      cooking conditions have been applied to this meat (5 min at 55°C vs 30 min at 90°C). Ten
      healthy elderly volunteers will test each processed meat according to a cross-over design,
      during 2 different metabolic studies separated by at least 2 weeks. Volunteers will be
      submitted to a diet controlled for its protein content, for 4 days (1.2 g protein/kg/day)
      before each metabolic investigation.

      On the 2 days of metabolic investigations, after an overnight fast, blood samples will be
      collected for basal measurements. Then the subjects will be perfused with L-[1-13C] leucine
      for 9h30 hours, during which expired gas and blood samples will be regularly taken, and CO2
      production measured. The volunteers will be asked to eat a 130 g beef meat 2.5h after the
      onset of the perfusion. Isotopic enrichments in expired gas, in plasma alpha-cetoiscaproate
      and in free leucine will be measured to determine whole body amino acids fluxes (oxidation,
      protein synthesis and proteolysis). 15N enrichments of leucine will allow splanchnic
      extraction measurement.
