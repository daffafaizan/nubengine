    
      The study consists of a Screening Period (3 weeks), a single-blind Prospective Confirmation
      (PC) Period (6 weeks), a Double-blind Treatment (DBT) Period (10 weeks), and a Safety
      Follow-up Period (6 weeks).

      Patients who did not fulfil the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, were withdrawn
      from the study after the PC period.

      Patients who fulfilled the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, continued into the DBT
      Period and were randomized into one of 3 treatment arms (1:1:1) with either Lu AF35700 10
      mg/day, Lu AF35700 20 mg/day or to continue the treatment allocated in PC Period (olanzapine
      or risperidone) at the dose set at last visit of PC Period. This mean that approximately one
      third of the confirmed treatment-resistant patients were randomised back to the failed
      treatment used in the PC Period.

      Data was not collected separately for the DBT Olanzapine and DBT Risperidone participants,
      and there was no intent to compare Lu AF35700 to each drug separately.
