      depending on the weight of the individual in the case of certain agents. However, the plasma
      levels of antiretrovirals following the administration of a fixed dose present a marked
      interindividual variability. Moreover, a significant proportion of the patients on treatment
      with PIs presented plasma levels regarded as suboptimal in previous studies.

      Moreover, for the correct modification of the dosage of a drug, populational data on its
      pharmacokinetic behaviour during the dosing interval is required. Only by integrating this
      information with the specific characteristics of each individual is it possible, using
      mathematical models, to estimate the effect that a modification of the dosage of the drug
      would have on its plasma concentration. However, populational data on the pharmacokinetic
      behaviour of antiretroviral agents are still very limited at this moment, and have not always
      been obtained in populations similar to the one to which they are to be applied.

      Thus, knowing the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the antiretroviral agents in our population
      and the influence of certain individual characteristics on this behaviour may be of great
      interest, since only in this way will we be able to tailor the dosage of antiretrovirals
      reliably in our patients.
