    
      This pilot study aims to test Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) for
      adolescents with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

      The study has a single case research design (multiple baseline) and will include 12
      participants with GAD according to a semi structured diagnostic interview.

      Participants will be randomized to either two, six or ten weeks baseline measurements prior
      to starting treatment, and will thus work as their own controls.

      Primary outcome measures will be collected at 10 weeks after treatment start. Follow-up
      assessments will be made three month after treatment.
