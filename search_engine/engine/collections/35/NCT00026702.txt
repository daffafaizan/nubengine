      There are no established effective drug therapies, and dialysis may promote renal injury via
      hypotension or neutrophil activation. Many agents [e.g., mannitol, furosemide, dopamine,
      Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1), thyroid hormone, etc.]
      are effective in animal models but ineffective in treating or preventing human ARF. The
      failure of these agents in human ARF may be due to late enrollment into the trial; effective
      therapy will likely require earlier detection.

      The objective of this clinical study is to identify new biomarkers of renal injury,
      progression or recovery by analyzing urinary proteins during ARF. We will enroll patients
      with ARF, patients at high risk of ARF, patients with volume depletion, patients with urinary
      tract infection, patients with chronic kidney disease, and normal subjects. The diagnosis of
      pre-renal versus renal ARF will be made by routine clinical and laboratory testing. The level
      of renal dysfunction will be determined by creatinine clearance. Those patients at high risk
      for ARF will be followed prospectively and will undergo additional testing if ARF does
      develop. Patients will also be studied after creatinine levels return to normal. We will
      identify protein and/or microRNA biomarkers that are unique to patients with ARF,but not
      found in normal subjects or patients with volume depletion. It is hoped that some of these
      proteins may form the basis of new diagnostic tests for ARF.
