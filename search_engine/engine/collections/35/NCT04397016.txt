      participating urologic surgeon will begin in the usual care arm of the study. Subsequently,
      the surgeons will be randomized to the intervention arm at staggered time points to undergo
      training and begin using the decision aid intervention with patients who are diagnosed with
      slow-growing prostate cancer. This study will consist of two aims. The first aim is to
      examine the use of an encounter decision aid with cost information on the presence and impact
      of out-of-pocket cost conversations. The investigators will train participating clinicians on
      how to use the decision aid intervention and available financial resources. With patient and
      clinician consent, the investigators will audio record clinical encounters and measure cost
      conversations using a previously-developed checklist to code transcripts derived from the
      audio recordings. Patients can still participate if they do not consent to audio recording as
      these topics will be assessed in the self-report survey after their clinic or virtual visit.
      The second aim will examine the impact of an encounter decision aid with cost information on
      high-quality decision-making. The investigators will collect a post-visit questionnaire from
      participating patients, including patient-reported measures of decisional conflict, decision
      regret, and the shared decision-making process. Participants will be sent a follow-up
      questionnaire 3 months after their initial study enrollment to assess decision regret and
      financial toxicity.
