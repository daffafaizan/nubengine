    
      Non-invasive Position-Induced Opening of the Intervertebral Foramen in sidelying position, as
      an adjunct to pharmacological treatment, was used in the case of acute lumbosacral
      radiculopathy.

      20 examinees were split into two groups, 10 in the experimental and 10 in the control group.
      Experimental group was given positional opening of the intervert. foramen, together with
      pharmacological treatment - steroid antiinflammatory drug - dexamethasone, nonsteroid
      antiinflammatory drugs and pain killers while control group was given just the same
      pharmacological treatment and recommended rest.

      Measured dependent variables were:

        1. Visual analogue pain scale (VAS) for the low back and radiculopathy, separately

        2. Straight leg raise in supine position - nerve mobility test

        3. EuroQol questionnaire - general health condition questionnaire

        4. Oswestry questionnaire - activities of daily living (ADL) specific questionnaire for low
           back pain and lumbosacral radiculopathies Inclusive criteria were: Age between 20 - 60,
           lumbar disc herniation recognized by the MRI, lumbosacral radiculopathy with symptoms
           such as radicular pain, sensation dysfunctions or motor dysfunctions, recognized by
           electromyography (EMG) diagnostics.

      Exclusive criteria: age more than 60, degenerative lumbar stenosis, spondylolisthesis,
      vertebra fractures, tumours.

      Conclusion: Physiotherapy with a positional, mechanical decompression of the compressed
      lumbosacral nerve root, as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment, is proved to be efficient
      with the lumbosacral radiculopathy. It is recommended to be applied since the first day of a
      patient admittance in the hospital if there is a position that can reduce the pain.
