      acute kidney injury or end stage renal disease. Currently, two modalities of PD exist and is
      individualized based on patient and life-style specific factors. Continuous ambulatory
      peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) allows 4 - 5 exchanges performed manually whereas automated
      peritoneal dialysis (APD) involves continuous, automated, cyclical exchanges performed by a
      device at home during the night. Peritonitis is a common complication in PD and accounts for
      a large portion of hospital readmission and mortality. Vancomycin is the most common
      antibiotic recommended and has notable gram-positive coverage used empirically during
      suspected peritonitis.

      Despite widespread use, vancomycin lacks good pharmacokinetic characterization in PD. Early
      pharmacokinetic studies using vancomycin were conducted predominantly in patients on CAPD on
      glucose-based prescriptions. Data is non-existent in PD patients administered the novel
      dialysate solution icodextrin, or those treated with overnight APD. The impact of residual
      kidney function (RKF) on vancomycin in PD is also lacking. Enhanced vancomycin clearance in
      RKF may result in under-dosing, while overdosing may result in nephrotoxicity and loss of
      clinically important RKF.

      The investigators will characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of vancomycin following a
      single intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin in icodextrin dialysate to non-infected PD patients
      and examine the relationship between RKF and vancomycin clearance using serum, dialysate and
      urine. The goal is to use this data in non-infected subjects to generate information to guide
      vancomycin dosing in patients on rapid-cycling PD modalities.
