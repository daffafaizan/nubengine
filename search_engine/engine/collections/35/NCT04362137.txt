    
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in patients aged â‰¥12 years with COVID-19
      associated cytokine storm. The study will enroll patients to ruxolitinib or placebo, in
      addition to standard of care (SoC) per local practice. Patients who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either oral ruxolitinib 5
      mg twice daily + SoC or oral matching-image placebo + SoC for a total of 14 days. An
      additional 14 days of study drug may be given, if in the opinion of the investigator, the
      patient's clinical signs and symptoms are not improved or worsen and the potential benefit
      outweighs the potential risk.

      The study will include:

        -  Screening period of 0-2 days.

        -  Study period of 29 days (treatment of 14 days; an additional 14 days of study drug may
           be given, if in the opinion of the investigator, the patient's clinical signs and
           symptoms are not improved or worsen and the potential benefit outweighs the potential
           risk).

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy (as measured by a composite endpoint of
      proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure [require mechanical ventilation],
      or require intensive care unit care) of ruxolitinib + standard-of-care (SoC) therapy compared
      with placebo + SoC therapy, for the treatment of COVID-19 by Day 29.
