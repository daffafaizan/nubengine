      is vascularizing fibular graft. However, it requires high microsurgical technique. Also it
      needs very long operation time (3-6hours), and morbidity associated with surgery is not low.
      In early stage osteonecrosis, osteoclasts are activated and resorb the necrotic portion of
      bone and osteoblasts are followed to lay down new bone. This process can weaken the bone
      function to support loading and can lead to collapse of bone. Bisphophonate can inhibit this
      osteoclastic bone resorption and enhance osteoblastic new bone formation. Recently, everyday
      oral intake of alendronate with vitamin D and calcium had a high success rate to prevent the
      collapse and decrease of hip joint pain in a short-term follow-up. However, the compliance or
      adherence to everyday oral intake is questionable. Moreover, the exact comparison based on
      MRI according to various classifications is not available currently. There is no report about
      the effect of zoledronic acid to prevent early collapse and progression of joint dome
      depression (â‰¥2 mm by X-ray) of the early stage large nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the
      femoral head or its effect on MRI signal change after infusion of zoledronic acid in
      noncollapsed cases (estimated about 30% of cases) The investigators need a controlled
      randomized multicenter interventional study about the efficacy of bisphophonates in the
      treatment of ONFH.
