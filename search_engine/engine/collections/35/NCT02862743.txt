      biomarker on the circulating tumor DNA from peripheral blood.

      The secondary objectives of this study will be:

        -  Study the concordance between mutations in circulating tumor DNA and mutations in tumor
           tissue - Study the associations between mutational profiles and clinical and
           histological features of melanoma.

        -  Study the prognostic impact on survival of the identified genetic profile from the
           circulating tumor DNA
