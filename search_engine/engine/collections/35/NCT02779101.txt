      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (CR/PR) in patients treated with pembrolizumab for
           relapsed PCNSL after MTX-based first-line therapy

        -  To evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in subjects diagnosed with recurrent PCNSL

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To describe Best Overall Response categories (CR, PR, SD, PD) in patients treated with
           pembrolizumab for relapsed PCNSL after MTX-based first-line therapy

        -  To describe individual duration of response over time

        -  To assess progression-free survival in this patient population

        -  To assess overall survival in this patient population

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess PD-L1 as a predictive marker for response to pembrolizumab
