      without onion powder for 2 weeks. Between the two 2-week period is a 4-week wash-out period.
      One week before and during each intervention period, the participants will be instructed to
      avoid consumption of onion, garlic and all foodstuffs containing the same bioactive
      components (polyphenols, sulfur-molecules)as in onion. This includes a number of vegetables
      and fruits, condiments, tea, chocolate, red wine etc.

      Fasting blood samples will be drawn before and after (on 2 separate days) each intervention
      period, where also weight and blood pressure are measured.

      Participants will collect 24-hour urine and feces samples twice before and at completion of
      each intervention period.

      After the fasting blood sampling on the first blood sampling day in each period, participants
      will receive a test meal (with 10 g onion powder or placebo, i.e. 8.5 g sucrose+ 2 g soy
      protein isolate). The acute effects will be studied by blood sampling and urine sampling 0,
      2, 4 and 24 hours after the test meal.
