    
      Purpose of Study>

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of tailored therapy compared to concomitant therapy.

        2. Difference in eradication rate according to the frequency of 23S ribosomal RNA point
           mutation in clarithromycin.

        3. To evaluate the compliance of tailored therapy compared to concomitant.

        4. To analysis of factors which influence to the eradication rate.

      Patients>

      ; Target disease

        -  peptic ulcers(gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer),

        -  gastric MALToma,

        -  Endoscopic therapy state of early gastric cancer or gastric adenoma,

        -  Patients who require H. pylori testing by clinical judgment, such as chronic gastritis.

      Method>

      Patients with H. pylori infection who have been screened for a 23S ribosomal RNA point
      mutation (A2142G, A2143G point mutation) and randomized to a concomitant treatment group and
      a tailored treatment group. In concomitant treatment group, lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin
      1.0 g, metronidazole 500 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg were administered twice a day for 2
      weeks, regardless of 23S ribosomal RNA point mutation. In tailored treatment group, In the
      case of 23S ribosomal RNA point mutation negative, lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1.0 g, and
      clarithromycin 500 mg were administered twice a day for 2 weeks. In tailored treatment group,
      In point mutation positive cases, lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1.0 g and metronidazole 500
      mg For 2 weeks. For each treatment group, at least 4 weeks after completion of drug
      administration, confirm the sterilization and confirm the compliance and adverse effects of
      the drug.
