      option, oral steroids, affects biochemical substances that have been associated with the
      development of chronic sinusitis and polyps. In order to do this, we need to study people
      with different forms of chronic sinusitis and compare them to individuals without allergies
      or sinus disease. We will also look at patients with chronic sinusitis who are treated with
      oral steroids and compare them to chronic sinus patients who have not received oral steroid
      therapy prior to surgery. This study may help pave the way to new treatments that address
      specific parts of the chronic sinus inflammatory pathway.

      Hypotheses

        1. Oral steroid treatment of patients with CRS will lead to a correction in the
           inflammation that is observed in sinonasal tissues, nasal brushings, and nasal lavage.

        2. Steroid induced changes in inflammation will differ in chronic sinus patients with
           polyps than in those without polyps.

        3. Changes in inflammation will correlate with clinical variables.
