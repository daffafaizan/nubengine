      divided into two groups as hippotherapy simulator group (HSG) (n = 13) and conventional
      exercise group (CEG) (n = 13). Patients were evaluated with Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for
      balance, Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS) for postural control, Rivermead Mobility
      Index (RMI), and Time Up- Go Test (TUG) for mobility, 2min. Walking Test (2mWT) for
      functional capacity and Barthel Index (BI) for the level of independence respectively before
      and after treatment.
