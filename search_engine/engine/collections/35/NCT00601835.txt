    
      This is a multi-center, partially open-label, partially randomized double blind trial for
      immunogenicity and safety in the United States. Participants will be enrolled to one of three
      treatment groups:

        -  Subjects ages 11-59 years will receive Canadian manufactured Td vaccine on Day 0

        -  Subjects 60 years or older will be randomized to receive either US manufactured Td on
           Day 0, or,

        -  Subjects 60 years or older randomized to receive Canadian manufactured Td on Day 0

      The trial is designed to assess the safety of Canadian Manufactured Tetanus and Diphtheria
      Toxoids Adsorbed vaccine in all trial participants 11 to 59 years of age and to describe the
      immune responses in subsets of adolescents (11-14, and 15-18 years of age) and in a subset of
      adults 19-59 years of age. The trial will also compare the immune responses and safety in
      subjects ≥ 60 years of age receiving Canadian Manufactured Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids
      Adsorbed vaccine to an equal number of subjects ≥ 60 years of age receiving US Manufactured
      Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed vaccine.
