    
      A randomized, open-label, two-arm, two-week crossover study will be conducted to assess the
      study objectives. The study will enroll 24 participants with insulin pump-treated type 1
      diabetes. Upon study enrollment, participants will complete two consecutive 2-week periods -
      a 'usual care' period and 'dasiglucagon' period. During the 'usual care' period, participants
      will manage episodes of manifest or impending hypoglycemia as usual, e.g. through
      carbohydrate consumption or manual insulin pump suspension. During the 'dasiglucagon' period,
      participants will use pen-administered low-dose dasiglucagon to treat or prevent episodes of
      hypoglycemia.
