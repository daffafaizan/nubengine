    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial evaluating subcutaneous
      testosterone for the alleviation of aromatase inhibitor induced arthralgia. A parallel group
      design will be utilized for this two-arm study: subcutaneous testosterone vs. placebo.
      Patients are stratified according to baseline pain score (5-6 vs. 7-10) and age (< 50 vs.
      50-60 vs. > 60). The primary objective is to determine whether testosterone will reduce
      AI-induced arthralgia and associated joint symptoms. The secondary objective is to explore
      whether testosterone will have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with particular
      reference to androgenic adverse events including acne, hirsutism, and alopecia.

      Patients are followed up to six months as defined in the protocol.
