    
      Two groups of patients with atrophy in posterior maxilla indicated for sinus lift.

      (A) First group will be subjected to open sinus lift with chin bone graft.

        -  All cases will undergo surgery under general anesthesia for sinus lift and other surgery
           under local anesthesia for implant placement .

        -  Exposure of the anterior wall of maxilla according to standardized surgical approach.

        -  Open sinus lift and bone graft.

        -  After 6 months, implant will be drilled and inserted in the recipient site according to
           standard protocol.

        -  Loading on implant after 5-6 months.

      (B)Second group will be subjected to sinus floor elevation using a bone ring.

        -  All cases will undergo surgery under local anesthesia for implant placement in the
           mandibular chin and other surgery under general anesthesia for sinus lift using bone
           ring with the implant.

        -  Exposure of the mandibular chin will be done under local anesthesia using a standardized
           surgical approach.

        -  Implant will be drilled and inserted in the chin according to standard protocol.

        -  After 3 months, second surgery under general anesthesia to place the implant and
           surrounding ring in the atrophied posterior maxilla.

        -  The bone ring containing the implant allowed to heal for 5-6 months.

      Follow up:

        -  Clinical evaluation will be performed at the first week post-operative.

        -  Three months post-operative second surgery to put the implant with surrounding ring in
           atrophied posterior maxilla.

        -  Five months post-operative to the second surgery, implant will be loaded with the final
           restoration.
