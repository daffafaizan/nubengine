      shoulder surgeries. In the first group of patients (Group IPSB), interscalene brachial plexus
      block will be applied 30 minutes before surgery, while interscalene brachial plexus block and
      suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) administration to the second group patients (Group SSNB)
      before surgery. Patients in the third group (Group C) will be considered the control group
      and no block will be performed. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine will be used
      in all three groups for postoperative analgesia. Preoperative hemodynamic data of patients,
      postoperative pain scores (VAS), morphine consumption, patient satisfaction score,
      requirement of additional analgesia and observed side effects were recorded. Consumption of
      analgesia 24 hours after surgery and patient satisfaction will be evaluated.
