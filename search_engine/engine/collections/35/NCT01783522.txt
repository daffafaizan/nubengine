      I. Estimate the objective effect size of glutamine compared to placebo as a prophylactic
      intervention to prevent bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy in multiple myeloma patients
      4 months after their first dose of study drug.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate whether glutamine delays or prevents the onset or worsening of any neuropathy as
      determined by National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) v4.03 criteria.

      II. Determine if glutamine may improve adherence to bortezomib therapy.

      III. Assess response rate (RR) and clinical benefit response rate (CBR) according to uniform
      international response criteria and modified European Group for Blood and Marrow
      Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.

      IV. Determine if glutamine may improve quality of life (QOL) at 4 months.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive glutamine orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days
      for 4 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID. Courses repeat every 28 days for 4 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
