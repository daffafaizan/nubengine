      compared with modified radical hysterectomy, both plus level 1 pelvic lymph-node dissection,
      in patients with early stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer ≤ 2cm. The experimental procedure will
      be considered to be promising for treatment of stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer ≤ 2cm if the
      Bayesian posterior probability of "the difference of the 3-y DFS rate is less than the
      non-inferiority margin of 5%" is at least 50%. Thus, using this proof of concept design, the
      planned sample size is 40, with 20 cases per arm, which provides 72% chance of satisfying the
      above criteria, under the hypothesis that the lowest 3-y DFS rate in each arm is 90%. As
      required, adjuvant therapy will include cisplatin-based chemo-radiation or pelvic radiation
      alone (EBRT +/- intracavitary brachytherapy) indicated according to the #GOG92 and #GOG109
      criteria.
