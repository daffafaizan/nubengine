      Rehabilitation Sciences on 56 healthy young adults. Study will be conducted in 6 months (May
      2020 to December 2020). Healthy young adults of both genders between 20-40 years of age will
      be included in the study. Adults with any diagnosed cardiovascular, metabolic, orthopedic or
      neurological disease, active/ongoing infection, recent history of upper extremity fracture or
      history of vascular medication will not be included in this study. The outcome variables will
      be hand grip strength measured through hydraulic hand held dynamometer and forearm
      circumference through anthropometric measuring tape.After assessment and screening, subjects
      will be randomly allocated in Control group "A" receiving low intensity strength training and
      Interventional group "B" receiving blood flow restriction training along with low intensity
      strength training via lottery method.Each participant will receive three sessions per week
      for two consecutive weeks making 6 treatment sessions in total. The outcome variables will be
      assessed at the start of 1st session and then at 6th session. To carry out the anthropometric
      assessment, anthropometric tape for circumference measurements, a digital scale for measuring
      weight and a stadiometer to measure height will be used.
