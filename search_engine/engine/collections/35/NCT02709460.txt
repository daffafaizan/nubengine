    
      Laparoscopic hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is today a well-described method for the
      removal of the uterus. The operation is offered in case of bleeding disorders where other
      treatments have been unsuccessful, uterine fibroids or other conditions requiring surgery
      with removal of the uterus.

      The operation is done today in most cases by dividing the uterine artery at the entrance to
      the cervix, where the artery divides into one ascending and descending branch.

      The most common complication of hysterectomy is bleeding perioperative well as
      postoperatively, which may result in a hematoma above the vaginal vault.

      Through the years different methods have been tried to reduce this complication, including
      tranexamic acid without great success. The hematoma may result in infection postoperative and
      subsequent poor healing, with the possibility of dehiscence of the vault.

      In the worst case, the gut is displaced through the vagina postoperatively. This condition
      can lead to diffuse peritonitis, which can be fatal in rare cases.

      Since the hemostasis related to the dividing of the artery uterine can be problematic,
      especially in case of fibroids it may be a technical advantage to coagulate the Uterine
      artery at the exit of the Internal Iliac artery. This operation also ensures identification
      of the ureter, which can be spared. Lesions to the ureter are detected in up to 1% of all
      surgical procedures at hysterectomy.

      Dividing of the Uterine artery at the Internal Iliac Artery also ensures that the artery can
      be divided with minimal bleeding at the cervix.
