      induction or coinduction of general anaesthesia. During all stages of general anaesthesia,
      both agents may induce seizure-like movements or seizures (clinically manifested events and
      confirming electroencephalographic pattern) accompanied by haemodynamic instability. Their
      proconvulsant activity should be verified and assessed.

      The aim of the additional analysis was to identify whether observance of the variations of
      values displayed on different depth of anaesthesia monitors (DOA monitors) reliably reflect
      the actual depth of general anaesthesia during presence of epileptiform patterns (EPs) in
      EEGs during VIGA with sevoflurane using two different techniques and intravenous induction of
      general anaesthesia with single dose of propofol.

      We performed standard 30-minute initial EEG recordings for all patients participating in the
      study to exclude any pre-existing epileptic EEG patterns. We took the initial EEG recordings
      in a dark quiet room for 5 minutes as a baseline, followed by three eye opening and closing
      sequences of 10 seconds each and photostimulation lasting 10 minutes (flash stimuli at
      frequencies of 3/6/9/12 Hz- alpha; 15/18/21/24 Hz- beta). Then we obtained another baseline
      reading and we asked the patients to achieve a state of hyperventilation by taking 20
      forceful breathes per minute for five minutes. Finally, we obtained another baseline reading.

      Throughout the induction of anaesthesia and the surgery, standard monitoring procedures were
      utilised to pay close attention to the vital parameters such as non-invasive arterial
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), standard electrocardiography (ECG) II, arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2), fraction of inspired oxygen in the gas mixture (FiO2), facial
      electromyography (fEMG), fraction of inspired sevoflurane (FiAA), fraction of expired
      sevoflurane (FeAA), exhaled carbon dioxide concentration (etCO2), minimal alveolar
      concentration of sevoflurane (MAC).
