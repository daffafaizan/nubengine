      functioning of the pelvic floor muscle would improve in the sitting and supine postures or in
      the control group during pelvic floor muscle training with forced exhalation. We enrolled
      nulliparous women in supine (n = 22), sitting (n = 19) and control (n = 14) groups. We
      performed the 8-week combined pelvic floor muscle training programme. We examined the effect
      of training on the parameters with the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the pairwise comparisons with
      the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Wilcoxon-rank test with the Bonferroni correction.
