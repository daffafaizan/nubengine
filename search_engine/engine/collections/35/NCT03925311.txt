      implantation (WOI), occurs only for a very short period of time. However, so far, there is no
      reliable clinical and biochemical indicators of WOI. Therefore, this study is to correlate
      and identify the biochemical markers which may reflect WOI.

      participants will be asked to be:

        1. performed endometrial biopsy

        2. taken blood for a few time points (e.g. pre-conception and being pregnant) to compare
           different kinds of biochemical markers.
