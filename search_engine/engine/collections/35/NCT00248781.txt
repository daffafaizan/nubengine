      age-related decline in muscle strength. In this context, a rapid decline in strength among
      older adults has been linked to physical frailty, falls, functional decline, impaired
      mobility, and nursing home placement. Substantial evidence now suggests that habitual
      physical activity is associated with the maintenance of muscle strength and physical function
      well into the 8th and 9th decades of life. We propose to investigate the effects of a
      home-based resistance exercise program, administered via an interactive telecommunications
      system without the participation of health professionals, in functionally limited older
      veterans. Subjects will be randomized to either the automated exercise group or an attention
      placebo control group. The exercise group will undergo resistance training at home three
      times a week for 6 months, guided by the telecommunications system, followed by a 6-month
      maintenance phase of less frequent interaction with the system. Outcome measurements will
      include muscle strength and physical performance related to daily activities at 3, 6, and 12
      months to determine the efficacy of the intervention and the time course and durability of
      the effect. The control group will also interact with the telecommunications system once a
      week for the whole year, but no exercise will be prescribed. If this home-based, automated,
      interactive exercise program is effective, it will provide a low-cost easily disseminated
      approach to improving the strength and functional status of older veterans
