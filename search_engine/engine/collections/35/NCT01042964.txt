      To evaluate safety and tolerability by using adverse events (AEs), vital signs including
      blood pressure/pulse rate (BP/PR), electrocardiographic examinations (12 lead ECG), bleeding
      time, evaluation of antibody titer and safety laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology,
      coagulation, urinalysis)

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (collagen-induced platelet
      aggregation)of six ascending single intravenous doses of PR-15 in healthy, male volunteers
