      prostate cancer (CRPC) but duration of response is limited, with median time to
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression of 6-8 months. There is currently no standard
      second-line therapy for patients who have progressed after receiving docetaxel. Carboplatin
      and paclitaxel have demonstrated activity, but prospective clinical trials evaluating this
      regimen are limited. In addition, correlative studies investigating why some patients respond
      are lacking.
