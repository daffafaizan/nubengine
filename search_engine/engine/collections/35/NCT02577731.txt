      cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow and muscle cells after trauma injury in elderly subjects is
      different when compared to non-injured subjects.

      There will be three groups for this study: 1) Elective hip surgery subjects, 2) Trauma
      subjects and 3) deidentified bone marrow of healthy controls.

      Samples of bone marrow and a blood sample will be collected at the time of surgery. The
      deidentified bone marrow of healthy controls will come from a tissue bank.

      The blood will be used to perform PB colony assays, ELISAs to test for the following
      parameters: EPO, G-CSF, Reticulocyte, iron levels and cytokines and inflammatory markers.

      The bone marrow and blood samples will be processed and sorted to isolate hematopoeitic stem
      cells for genomic content to determine genomic expression, oxidative stress, mitochondrial
      activity, apoptosis, autophagy, analysis of circulating erythroid progenitor cells,
      reticulocytes, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor assays, erythropoietin and iron levels.

      Clinical data and hemodynamic measurements will be collected daily while subjects are
      hospitalized and trauma surgery subjects will be followed to evaluate for malunion and
      subsequent additional surgical procedures for repair.
