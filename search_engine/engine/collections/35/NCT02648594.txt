      When patient presents a lung node, there is an important risk that this node was a tumor. For
      patients who have these nodes, the surgery is the best treatment. When the surgery is
      possible, the thoracoscopy may be more advantageous compared to thoracothomy (decrease of
      post surgery pains, decrease of recovery time and decrease of drugs consumption).
      Nevertheless, thoracoscopy needs specific materiels and nécessite un équipement spécifique
      and trained physicians. In France, only 1% of surgeries qu'en France, thoracoscopy represents
      less than 1% of lung cancer surgeries while it represents 30% of interventions in Japan.

      Moreover, this technic needs that nodes was well localized. For this, radiologists use
      CT-guided hook wire localization of these lung nodes before surgery.

      According to the litterature, this localization technic is efficient (Chen et al, 2011).

      The hook wire laying is delicate. It can lead secondaries effects as pneumothorax,
      dislodgement of the hook wire before and after surgery. The success rate of hook wire
      fixation in lung near of the node is primary.

      The main objective of our study is to assess the success rate localization of node in surgery
      piece, that is to verify if the hook wire have allowed to localize the lung node in surgery
      piece. This implies that:

        -  the hook wire was well CT-guided in the lung

        -  the hook wire did not present a dislodgment before or during surgery

        -  the hook wire is near of the node to be removed Among secondaries objectives, the
           investigators will assess the safety and possible complications which could occur. The
           investigators will also measure the distance between hook wire and center of the node
