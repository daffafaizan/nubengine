      with routine surveillance of influenza using mid-turbinate nasal swabs for sample collection
      and RT-PCR testing. Shelters will be randomized to implement a test-and-treat strategy at
      different months throughout flu season, treating individuals who present ARI symptoms or new
      or worsening cough within 2 days (48 hours). Shelters will continue routine surveillance
      until all offer the test-and-treat strategy. Eligible individuals will be tested on site with
      a point-of-care molecular influenza test and, if positive, offered antiviral treatment.
      Individuals with 3-7 days of symptoms, or who choose not to participate in the intervention
      strategy, will still be eligible for participation in the routine surveillance.

      Our primary hypothesis is that implementation of a point-of-care diagnostic and antiviral
      treatment intervention among sheltered individuals experiencing homelessness will reduce the
      incidence of influenza within this population over the course of a flu season. A process
      evaluation will also be conducted to explore the feasibility of point-of-care testing
      implementation in this population.
