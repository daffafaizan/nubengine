      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved atezolizumab for this specific disease but it has
      been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved
      bevacizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Atezolizumab and bevacizumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging
      the body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells and stop the growth of cancer.
      Atezolizumab and bevacizumab work by stopping various molecules on cancer cells and body
      cells from working against the immune system's natural fight against cancer.
