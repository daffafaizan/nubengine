    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial
      comparing dextromethorphan and placebo for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy, assessed with a (0-10) numerical scale. Cognition, anxiety, depression, sleep and
      quality of life are also assessed.

      The influence of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and MDR1 polymorphism on the dextromethorphan analgesic
      efficacy will be measured.
