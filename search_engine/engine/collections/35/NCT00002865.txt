      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
      followed by ifosfamide, methotrexate, vincristine, cytarabine, etoposide, and dexamethasone
      in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). II. Determine the
      toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive up to six alternating courses (every 3-4 weeks) of two
      chemotherapy regimens: cyclophosphamide, oral dexamethasone, methotrexate with leucovorin
      rescue, vincristine, and doxorubicin over 5 days; and ifosfamide/mesna, oral dexamethasone,
      methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, vincristine, cytarabine, and etoposide over 5 days.
      G-CSF is given following each course until recovery of the neutrophil count. All patients
      receive triple intrathecal chemotherapy on day 1. Patients with CNS disease receive
      intrathecal therapy twice weekly until the CSF is clear, then weekly for 4 weeks, and monthly
      for 1 year; those who have not received prior CNS irradiation also receive whole-brain
      radiotherapy. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for 18 months, every
      6 months for 2 years, then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 evaluable patients will be accrued if at least 4 of the
      first 17 patients respond.
