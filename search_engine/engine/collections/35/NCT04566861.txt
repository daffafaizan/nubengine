      intervention in Pakistan (R01-MH111859) to explore potential biological mechanisms. This CBT
      intervention targets both sub-threshold anxiety symptoms and generalized anxiety disorder
      (GAD) in early- to mid- pregnancy, aiming to both prevent and treat Common Mental Disorders
      (CMDs) (GAD and major depressive episodes (MDE)) as well as improve birth outcomes. The study
      team proposes to additionally study biological correlates of antenatal anxiety (i.e., immune
      and endocrine functioning) in 300 women: in addition to 200 drawn from our randomized trial
      (100 intervention, 100 usual care), the study will also include 100 healthy women without
      anxiety or depression. The aims are to 1) characterize the "immune phenotype" of anxious
      women across the peripartum, specifically by measuring the relation among anxiety symptoms
      and peripheral markers of inflammation within and across women (both anxious and healthy) and
      between those receiving the intervention and control; 2) determine the relation between
      levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in pregnancy and concurrent anxiety symptoms and future
      symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), 3) examine the relation between changes in immune
      functioning and ALLO levels in anxious pregnancy across time, 4) examine whether immune
      function and/or ALLO are mediators or moderators of the association between antenatal anxiety
      and preterm birth and/or small-for-gestational age, and 5) examine the effects of both
      anxiety and the intervention (including biomarkers) on infant development at six weeks
      postpartum.
