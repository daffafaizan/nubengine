      study with 2400mg mesalamine (5-ASA), 1200mg mesalamine (5-ASA) or placebo in LS patients for
      a 2-year treatment. 540 tumor free carriers of a known genetic mutation in a major MMR gene
      (including patients in which the polyps are endoscopically removed) will be randomized 1:1:1
      (180 each) to receive 2400mg mesalamine, 1200mg mesalamine or placebo. Patients will be
      identified through local or national registries and through collaboration with sites. Tumor
      free patients, assessed by white light high resolution colonoscopy, will be randomized to the
      study. A serum and stool sample will be taken to identify for mesalamine compliance and
      potential biomarkers. Biopsies of the normal tissue of ascending colon and rectum will be
      taken at the first and the last colonoscopy.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of regular treatment with mesalamine
      (5-ASA) on the occurrence of any colorectal neoplasia, tumor multiplicity (the number of
      detected adenomas/carcinomas) and tumor progression in LS patients.

      A 50% reduction of the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia in mesalamine-treated patients is
      expected. Tumor multiplicity and tumor progression (severity of the neoplastic lesions) will
      be investigated.
