    
      The study duration will be maximum 21 months with 12 months of inclusion and 9 months of
      follow-up.

      Patients aged 3 years and older who present common warts (Verruca vulgaris), and/or plantar
      warts (Verruca plantaris), and/or flat warts (Verruca plana) during a visit with their
      dermatologist/general practitioner.

      The total number of patients to include will be 374 with 187 patients per group.

      Primary objective:

      Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at the end of
      treatment (6-month visit) between the 2LVERU® JUNIOR and 2LVERU® versus the placebo group.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at 4 months
           between groups.

        -  Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the level of disappearance (4 levels) of
           warts at 4 months and 6 months (end of the treatment) between groups

        -  Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the recurrence of warts 3 months after
           the end of treatment between groups

        -  Compare the pain related to warts during the study between groups

        -  Safety issues.

      Treatment phase:

        -  Group n°1 = 2LVERU® JUNIOR / 2LVERU® (6 months of treatment)

        -  Group n°2 = Placebo (6 months of treatment)

      Post-treatment Follow-up phase: 3 months

      Treatment will be considered successful if the following three criteria are met for all
      treated warts as described at the baseline visit:

        -  Normal skin colour at the wart site

        -  Normal skin texture at the wart site

        -  Normal touch at the wart site Treatment will be considered a failure, at the end of the
           treatment, if at least one of the above three criteria is not met for all treated warts
           as described at the baseline visit.
