      have standard MTM conducted. Another third of the participants will be randomized to MTM plus
      drug interaction risk analysis via YouScript software. The remaining third will be randomized
      to MTM along with drug interaction risk analysis via YouScript software and genetic testing.
      The software will identify polypharmacy patients who may benefit from pharmacogenetic testing
      based on their current medication regimen. Results of the testing will be mailed to both the
      participant and their provider. Participants who undergo testing will also receive a
      follow-up phone call. All participants, including those who receive MTM alone, will receive a
      contact 3 months later to assess quality of life.
