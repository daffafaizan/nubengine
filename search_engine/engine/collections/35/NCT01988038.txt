      Based upon the estimated prevalence of PKD (1:500 and 1:1000 live births), it is estimated
      that there may be 10,000 PKD patients in the New York City area. This sample size far exceeds
      any database established thus far. As many as 40% of affected PKD patients are reportedly
      unaware of a family history of this disease, in part because many patients may go undiagnosed
      until they present with a medical complication (e.g., hypertension, kidney failure).
      Furthermore, this initiative will provide an opportunity to compare data from racially
      diverse populations.
