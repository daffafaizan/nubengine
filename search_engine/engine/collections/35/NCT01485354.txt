      It passively counterbalances the weight of the arm, thereby reducing the effort required to
      overcome gravity during the performance of upper-limb movements. The device provides subjects
      with augmented feedback via a virtual environment (i.e. computer games). The tasks to be
      performed in the virtual environment are designed to achieve functional movements, such as
      arm reaching movements.

      The goal of the study is to assess the clinical outcomes of upper extremity training using
      the Armeo Spring system in a chronic post-stroke population with impaired upper extremity
      function. The Armeo Spring system is equipped with a grip sensor that subjects squeeze with
      their hand to interact with virtual objects during the games. In a first phase of the study,
      we attempted to replace the grip sensor that is part of the system with a sensorized glove,
      to facilitate a more natural movement of hand opening/closing. However, we experienced
      technical difficulties with the sensorized glove and decided to abandon this aim for the
      purpose of gathering data about the clinical outcomes of upper extremity training using the
      Armeo Spring system.
