    
      A feasibility trial assessing patient recruitment, retention, randomization, and surgeon
      acceptability of topical anaesthetic use during rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids.

      A patient and assessor blinded feasibility trial. The trial population will prospectively be
      recruited from colorectal surgery outpatients. Patients will be randomized to two groups to
      receive: lubricating gel (K-Y Jelly) and topical anaesthetic gel (Instillagel) or lubricating
      gel alone (the standard care).

      The intervention group will receive lubricating gel and topical anaesthetic gel (containing
      lidocaine active ingredient) administered rectally, whilst the control group will receive
      lubricating gel alone (standard care). This will be carried out in Colorectal Outpatients.
      The band ligation of the haemorrhoids should occur between 5-10 minutes after administration
      of the topical anaesthetic/lubricating gel. Pain scores and the use of oral analgesia will be
      measured immediately after the procedure (5 minutes), upon leaving the clinic (approximately
      30 minutes after), at 4 hours, and 72 hours following the procedure. Vasovagal symptoms or
      other complications will be recorded whilst the patient is in the clinic. At 1 month post
      procedure, patients will be phoned to determine if any adverse events have occurred.
