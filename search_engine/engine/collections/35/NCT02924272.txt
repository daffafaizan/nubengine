    
      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. This study will look at the long term
      safety profile of ixazomib in participants who have previously received and tolerated
      ixazomib in a Millennium-sponsored clinical study, and in the investigator's opinion and
      confirmed by the Millennium medical monitor, may benefit from continued ixazomib therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 250 patients.

      All participants will receive ixazomib at same dose and schedule that they were receiving in
      the parent study until they experience disease progression, clinical deterioration in the
      investigator's judgment, experience an unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, pursue an
      alternative therapy, meet other study-specified reasons for discontinuation of study drug, or
      until ixazomib is available to the participant through commercial channels, including
      reimbursement for the participant's indication, whichever is sooner.

      This multicenter, rollover study will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate
      in this study is up to 7 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a
      final visit after 30 days of last dose of ixazomib for a safety assessment.
