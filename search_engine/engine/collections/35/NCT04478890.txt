      function in 5 consecutive patients undergoing LVAD implantation at the University of
      Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC). Pre-, intra- and postoperative care delivery to all enrolled
      and consented patients will meet the standards of care otherwise delivered to patients
      undergoing LVAD implantation at UMMC; care delivery will be at the discretion of the clinical
      care team and will not be altered based on the output of the right ventricular high-fidelity
      conductance catheters.
