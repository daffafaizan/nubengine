      colon cancer. The usefulness of chromoendoscopy is debated. Previous studies are either based
      on magnifying endoscopy or on non-randomized trials. Some guidelines recommend
      chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies and some normal colonoscopy with up to 40 random
      biopsies.

      Chromoendoscopy has the ability to identify subtle lesions that are otherwise missed by
      standard endoscopy. Whether chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies can replace standard
      colonoscopy with random biopsies in the surveillance of patients with chronic colitis is
      unknown.

      Aim: In a RCT in surveillance colonoscopies in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      colitis, we will determine if chromoendoscopy using a dilute solution of Indigo-carmine will
      improve dysplasia detection rate compared with colonoscopy without chromoendoscopy.

      Methods: After informed consent patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy will be
      randomized to be examined by the study or control method. The study method will employ a
      0.2-0.5% Indigo-Carmine solution sprayed over the colonic and rectal mucosa. The control
      method will be colonoscopy without Indigo-Carmine chromoendoscopy. In both the study arm and
      the control arm all subjects will have 32 random biopsies taken (4 from each of 8 defined
      segments of the colon) and biopsies from suspicious mucosa.
