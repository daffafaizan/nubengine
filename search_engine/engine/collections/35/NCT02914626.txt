      ranibizumab (LucentisÂ®) as an adjunct in the treatment of patients with neovascular glaucoma.

      28 patients with neovascular glaucoma (14 in the study group and 14 in the control standard
      of care group) will be recruited at a single center- University of Sao Paulo Medical School
      General Hospital. A complete ophthalmologic exam will be carried out, including the obtention
      of an informed consent for eligible patients willing to participate on the study.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either standard of care- retinal laser photocoagulation
      and clinical management of intraocular pressure with drops, or standard of care plus
      intravitreal ranibizumab injections. Two injections will be performed 30 days apart. The
      patients will be followed for 6 months.
