      impairment of physical and psycho-social functions in a large number of individuals.Severe
      PPP may significantly influence 4-8% of the surgical population, depending primarily on the
      surgical procedure and technique, but also patient-related pre-surgical factors.Updated
      criteria for PPP have recently been suggested. Inguinal herniorrhaphy qualifies for
      PPP-research due to a high surgical volume. Paradoxically, while the surgery is considered a
      minor procedure with limited tissue damage it is carried out in a territory with abundant
      nerve and vascular supply, and, complex musculoskeletal functions essential for locomotor
      actions. Persistent pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy may develop after a seemingly
      successful surgical procedure, and, is seen in a severe form in 2-4% of the patients
      associated with significant deterioration of the health-related quality of life.

      The transition process from acute to persistent pain may be more complex than previously
      assumed, making the study of temporal pain trajectories interesting. Based on clinical
      experience from a nationwide research center in PPP following inguinal herniorrhaphy, the
      authors decided first, to perform a prospective exploratory cohort study examining graphical
      pain charts by planimetrics, attempting to construct a valid statistical sub-classification
      of the trajectories. Secondly, the relationship between the sub-classification of the
      trajectories, and, potential explanatory variables, based on individual profiles of pain,
      psychometrics, quantitative sensory testing, and surgical procedures, were analysed, using
      principal component analysis and logistic regression models.
