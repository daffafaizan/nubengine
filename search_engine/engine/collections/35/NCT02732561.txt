    
      Cranial Electrostimulating (CES) Therapy is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
      treatment for depression and anxiety. However, there are no known studies on the use of this
      device with homeless adults. The objectives of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the
      acceptability and feasibility of CES as a treatment for homeless adults; and 2) to evaluate
      the efficacy of CES for the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms among homeless
      adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatments: sham (n=10) or CES
      (n=10). Changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms will be evaluated over time.
