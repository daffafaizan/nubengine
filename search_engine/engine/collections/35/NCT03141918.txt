    
      The study is characterized as a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Participants in the
      study will be adults living with HIV / AIDS who undergo regular clinical follow-up at some
      Specialized HIV / AIDS Care Service.

      The sample will consist of 20 volunteers, 10 in the experimental group (GE) and 10 in the
      control group (CG). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the groups by lottery by
      a researcher not participating in the study. The researcher responsible, as well as the
      volunteers, will not be aware of which participants are in the GE or the GC.

      The study will be carried out in the Movement Laboratory of the Physical Education Department
      of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.
