      immediate implant placement after tooth extraction. The emergence profile will be conditioned
      with either a stock or a customized healing abutment. A definitive screw retained restoration
      will be inserted 4 months postoperatively. Peri-implant tissues will be evaluated using pink
      and white esthetic score, radiographs and periodontal parameters at 3,6 and 12 months after
      implant placement.
