      health. Resting heart rate has been linked to longevity and freedom from cardiovascular
      morbidity, and heart rate during exercise serves as a measure of aerobic capacity. In
      addition, heart rate recovery after exercise carries implications for an individuals' health.

      Like physicians, coaches and athletic trainers employ heart rate measurement on a daily
      basis. In the athletic setting, heart rate during exercise is used as an indication of
      aerobic exertion. Elite athletes and their coaches often design workouts based upon achieved
      and targeted heart rates.

      Once the province of physicians and elite athletes, heart rate monitoring has become
      widespread among the general public. In the nineteen eighties, fitness companies added heart
      rate monitors to their product lines. Systems employing a chest strap to monitor electrical
      activity, telemetry and a wrist-borne receiver became popular, and several controlled,
      scientific studies confirmed their accuracy.

      More recently, manufacturers have marketed a new class of heart rate monitors that consist
      solely of wristwatch-style devices. These heart rate monitors use optical sensing technology
      to measure heart rate. While they offer convenience, their accuracy, particularly during
      exercise, is uncertain. A recent article in USA Today suggests that these wrist-worn monitors
      fail to provide accurate readings during exercise; however, to date there has been no
      rigorous scientific inquiry addressing this question.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of four popular, commercially available
      wrist-worn heart rate monitors under conditions of varying physical exertion.
