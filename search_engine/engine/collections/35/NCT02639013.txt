      determining the presence of intra-abdominal hypertension. This measurement can guide patient
      management. Monitoring intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal per-fusion pressure.

      for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome has become an inexpensive and useful diagnostics
      tool for identifying complications. An integrated approach to screening and monitoring for
      intra-abdominal hypertension may improve patient outcomes and decrease hospital costs. Due to
      the high incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, it is
      essential for critical care nurses to regularly monitor intra-abdominal pressure and
      abdominal per-fusion pressure.

      Critical care nurses have the ability to identify intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal
      compartment syndrome, implement and evaluate management interventions. Nursing practice
      should be centered on evidence based practice guidelines . Nurses should provide a standard
      of care in managing patients who are at risk of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal
      compartment syndrome from pre hospital, emergency, operating room and intensive care areas
