      investigating the effects of pramipexole 0.25-0.5 mg on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) symptoms
      in patients suffering from opioid withdrawal. The investigators hypothesize that pramipexole
      is an effective treatment for RLS symptoms in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) patients during
      post-detox clinical stabilization. Further, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of
      RLS in this context will also improve overall symptoms of opioid withdrawal.

      RLS is a sensory-motor neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move
      the legs. The investigators have recently confirmed anecdotal reports that RLS is common
      among patients with OUD experiencing opioid withdrawal. Dopamine agonists such as pramipexole
      are efficacious and first-line FDA-approved treatments in low doses for RLS.

      Recruitment and enrollment will occur at the Gavin Foundation Clinical Stabilization Services
      (CSS) in Quincy, Massachusetts. Eligible patients will be randomized to two weeks of
      pramipexole or placebo after an initial 3-day screening period and will be asked to complete
      5 remote study visits over video or phone. Participants will be asked to complete sleep
      diaries and questionnaires at various points throughout the study.
