    
      PROMs (Patient Reported Outcomes Measures) are used globally for the evaluation of the
      results of a prosthetic surgery. One of the most used methods in the evaluation of PROMs in
      hip prosthetic surgery is the WOMAC Score, usually measured in an outpatient setting using
      paper questionnaires.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the validity of an alternative method of evaluating
      PROMs in which the questionnaire will be administered to the patient digitally (Google Forms)
      in an out-of-patient setting.

      The questionnaire aimed at the subjective evaluation of the discomfort induced by arthrosis
      of the hip (WOMAC Score), will be administered during the pre-hospitalization visits and
      again during the follow-up visits carried out at 1, 3 and 6 months after intervention. The
      digital evaluation will be sent to the patient during the outpatient visits and will be
      considered valid only if completed within 48 hours of the same.

      On each patient the measurements will be carried out in both methods and differences in terms
      of compliance and satisfaction with the two methods under examination will be detected. Any
      differences in the final result of the WOMAC Score compared to the two methods and the
      differences in terms of outpatient assessment times will also be evaluated.
