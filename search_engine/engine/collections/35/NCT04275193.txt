    
      This study will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo parallel controlled
      clinical trial with a course of 12 weeks.

        1. Multicenter: During the study period, it will be decided whether to increase the
           improvement progress of the research unit according to whether it will be difficult to
           join the group and the overall progress, so as to complete the clinical study on time in
           accordance with the research plan.

        2. Random scheme: In this study, a dynamic random variance minimization random scheme will
           be adopted. Considering the two influencing factors of SLEDAI score and complement
           level, the DAS for Interactive Web Response System(IWRS) will be used to calculate and
           distribute random numbers and dispensing drugs.

        3. Control drug: Placebo will be used as control in this trial.

        4. Blind method: The Zishenqing simulator will be prepared by double-blind design, the
           dosage form, appearance, size, color and smell will be consistent with the experimental
           drug, and the test process will be in a double-blind state.
