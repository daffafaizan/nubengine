      i.e., formalize and train, and retrain if needed, anesthesia providers in the standard
      practice of titrating infusion rate to effect and clinically evaluate the effect of race and
      ethnicity on propofol monotherapy sedation during GI endoscopy. The ultimate goal is to make
      it less likely that patients from races known to be sensitive to propofol experience
      inadvertent overdosing.
