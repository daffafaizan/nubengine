    
      This prospective, pilot phase, clinical trial is an imaging study to optimize the necessary
      MR sequences on the Alberta linac-MR P3 system to allow for MR-guided radiotherapy in adult
      patients with cancer that are treated with high dose external beam radiotherapy. Each
      participant will undergo a single MR imaging session (30 - 40 minutes) on the Alberta
      linac-MR P3 system. Towards the end of the study, patients will be approached to participate
      in an optional sub-study, where they will undergo a total of five MR imaging sessions
      (performed every two to five days) to allow for an assessment of inter-fraction motion.
