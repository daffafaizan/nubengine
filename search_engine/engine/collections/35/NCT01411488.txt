      systems. Anal erosion was defi ned as localized mucous membrane tissue impairments of the
      anal canal caused by corrosive fecal enzymes and/or indwelling devices. DESIGN: Randomized
      comparative effectiveness clinical trial comparing 2 commercially available indwelling fecal
      management systems. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The target population was adults cared for on
      medical, surgical, and neurological intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICU units with an
      order for indwelling fecal management system placement. The research setting was a 1200-bed
      quaternary-care medical center in the Midwestern United States. 90 patients were enrolled in
      the study. The number who started and completed the study; 41 of 47 received system A and 38
      of 43 received system B. Subjects' mean age was 64 ± 13.6 years (mean ± SD), and 52% were
      female.
