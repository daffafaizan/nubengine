      is very important to find the lesion. Desirable bowel preparation drug must be clearly
      removed stool, effective on colonoscopic finding and pathologic finding, quickly
      administrated agent and eliminated stool, comfort for patient, and less side effects.

      PEG is very safe osmotic laxative. New agent(coolprep) which add ascorbic acid is less salty
      and less volume. Picosulfate+magnesium citrate(picolyte) taste orange, can be easily prepared
      bowel for colonoscopy by good taste and small volume. Magnesium with citrate acts like
      osmotic agent, picosulfate acts irritant agent.

      The investigators will compare with PEG+ascorbic acid and picosulfate+magnesium citrate about
      bowel preparation, patient's satisfaction, side effects to identify effectiveness of new
      bowel preparation drug.
