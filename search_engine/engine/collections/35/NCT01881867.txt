      I. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      T-cell immune response to the sipuleucel-T fusion protein vaccine construct prostatic acid
      phosphatase granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PAP-GM-CSF) (PA2024).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      T-cell immune response to PAP.

      II. To assess the character of the T-cell immune response to PAP and PA2024. III. To
      determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      antibody immune responses to PAP and PA2024.

      IV. To quantify the effects of CYT107 on T-cell repertoire diversity. V. To assess the
      effects of CYT107 on the immune competence of patients with advanced prostate cancer.

      VI. To assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sipuleucel-T plus CYT107 compared
      with sipuleucel-T alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive no treatment (observation) after completion of standard
      sipuleucel-T therapy.

      COHORT II: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 subcutaneously (SC)
      every week for 4 weeks (on days 0, 7, 14, and 21) beginning 3-7 days after completion of
      standard sipuleucel-T therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 53 weeks. Patients are
      followed by phone, once a year, after completion of Week 53 for overall survival.
