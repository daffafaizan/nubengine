      adalimumab as part of their standard of care for the first time will be recruited for this
      study. Patients will be randomly allocated to replace either half of their normal diet with
      nutritionally complete milkshakes or to follow their usual diet for 6 weeks. The
      investigators will compare the proportion of patients whose symptoms and disease markers will
      improve between the two groups at 6 and 12 weeks, and how many of them will remain
      symptoms-free for up to a year following treatment. The investigators will also explore
      whether the half-liquid diet will influence patients' nutrition and quality of life. Last,
      the investigators will investigate if gut bacteria changes and their metabolites associate
      with patients' eating habits and their responses to treatment with biologics.

      The primary aim of the BIOPIC study is to investigate if replacement of 50% of habitual food
      intake with a proprietary liquid diet for 6 weeks will improve remission rates at 12 weeks in
      adult patients with active ileocolonic CD treated with first-line biologics (TNFα
      antagonists, adalimumab) as their standard treatment of care. The secondary aim is to
      investigate if replacement of 50% of habitual food intake with a proprietary liquid diet for
      6 weeks will prolong remission in adult patients with active ileocolonic treated with
      first-line biologics (TNFα antagonists) as their standard treatment of care.
