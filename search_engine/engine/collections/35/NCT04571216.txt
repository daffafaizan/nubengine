    
      Long-term smoking cessation or reduction had been observed in thousands of patients when 1 or
      2 subcutaneous injections of a desensitization treatment against tobacco allergy were taking
      place concomitantly with Target Quit Date (TQD). NFL Biosciences SAS developed a tobacco
      cessation drug candidate (NFL-101) consisting of a nicotine-free extract of tobacco proteins.
      According to the observations made during CESTO, a Phase I study on 24 smokers, NFL-101
      appears to work by reducing cigarette appetence immediately and over a week after each
      injection.
