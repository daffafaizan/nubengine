      device many individuals can stay active, but most do not achieve a medically desired physical
      activity level. This creates a risk for cardiovascular disease. It is thought that
      individuals with amputation walk less because it is more difficult to get around, and recent
      advances in robotic prosthetic technology may make such activities easier. However, these
      prostheses have not yet been evaluated to determine their effectiveness during extended
      periods of walking. Despite the goals in design of new devices it is unclear whether
      individuals using them are able to incorporate them into making daily activities easier.
      Therefore, the goal of this research is to determine the effectiveness of a powered
      prosthesis compared to an unpowered prosthesis during long periods of walking.
