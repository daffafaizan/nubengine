    
      This is a randomized, comparator controlled, study of intrapartum vaginal preparation with
      either chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine solution. Women undergoing non-emergent
      cesarean delivery will be randomized to receive vaginal cleansing with either 4%
      chlorhexidine solution or 10% providone-iodine solution.

      The study will have two arms that will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. After inclusion criteria
      have been satisfied, subjects in the comparator control arm will receive vaginal preparation
      with 10% provodone-iodine solution prior the skin incision. Subjects in the study arm will
      receive vaginal preparation with chlorohexidine gluconate 4% solution. The selected skin
      preparation will be applied according to the manufacture guidelines with a minimum of four
      completed minutes of drying time before placement of surgical drapes. A block randomization
      method will be used to control for variations in care. Both groups will receive standard
      obstetrical care, continuous fetal monitoring, and pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics at
      least one hour prior to skin incision.
