    
      Briagen, the study product being used in this study, is a natural complex carbohydrate wound
      dressing for skin wounds created by Mohs surgery.

      Briagen was developed with the intent to improve healing time and reduce scarring of skin
      wounds. Briagen seeks to match the mechanical aspects of your skin (thickness, stiffness,
      hydration, pore size) to assist in the healing process.

      The purpose of this research study is to observe healing time of Briagen applied to wounds
      created as a result of Mohs surgery.
