      Echocardiography along with the American College of Cardiology released Appropriate Use
      Criteria (AUC) for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 2007, and these have been
      subsequently updated in 2011. TTE ordering patterns have been evaluated and have shown that
      between 15-30% of TTE ordered are inappropriate. The highest rate of inappropriate TTE is
      found in the outpatient environment, where routine or "surveillance" studies are common.
      These studies have also found that internists and cardiologists order the majority of TTE.
      The investigators previously documented that an AUC-based educational and feedback
      intervention reduced the rate of inappropriate TTE by cardiology and internal medicine
      physicians-in-training. Whether this type of intervention can improve TTE ordering of
      attending level physicians is not known.
