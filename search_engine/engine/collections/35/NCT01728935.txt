      potent antiviral efficacy in both nucleoside-naive and -experienced chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
      patients. At present, there has been no identifiable amino acid substitutions associated with
      resistance to TDF.

      Since TDF and adefovir (ADV), another licensed drug for CHB, belong to same molecular group,
      acyclic phosphonate, there had been various studies investigating the efficacy of TDF in
      ADV-resistant patients. The efficacy of tenofovir in this group of patients is conflicting.
      While several studies have shown TDF achieving similar viral suppression when compared to CHB
      patients without ADV-resistance , another study found that patients with the signature ADV
      mutations of rtA181V/T and /or rtN236T responded suboptimally to TDF. For all published
      studies, the number of patients with documented genotypic resistance to adefovir is actually
      small (n = 17-40), and therefore, further studies in this area are required.

      Another interesting point to note was the relatively high rate of hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg) seroclearance found in patients taking TDF. The cumulative rate of HBsAg
      seroclearance up in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive was 10% after 4 years . However,
      the same study did not find any HBeAg-negative patients achieving HBsAg seroclearance. In
      addition, studies on TDF were mainly performed in Caucasian patients, the majority being
      genotypes A and D. A preliminary study performed in Asian patients, predominantly genotypes B
      and C, did not discover any cases of HBsAg seroclearance . Given the majority of the CHB
      population is found in Asia, further studies are needed to clarify if HBsAg seroclearance by
      nucleoside / nucleotide analogues is potentially achievable using TDF.
