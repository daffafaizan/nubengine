    
      This study is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, multi-center study of a trivalent
      ganglioside vaccine plus the immunological adjuvant OPT-821 (Arm A) versus OPT-821 alone (Arm
      B) for patients with metastatic sarcoma at initial presentation or with relapsed disease who
      have been rendered disease-free following either surgical resection or multi-modality
      therapy. The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of vaccine therapy over
      non-specific immune therapy. Another aim of this study is to obtain sufficient data to
      further the development of this specific vaccine therapy as well as guide future study
      designs for therapeutic cancer vaccines in general.

      To be eligible, patients must have histologically confirmed sarcoma, must be clinically free
      of disease after surgery or multimodality therapy, and must be within 8 weeks of completion
      of such therapy. Given the limited data regarding ganglioside expression in Ewing sarcoma,
      rhabdomyosarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, patients with these sarcoma subtypes
      with the exception of pleomorphic/anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma will be excluded. Patients must
      have a history of distant metastatic disease; patients with locally recurrent disease only
      will not be eligible, as these patients demonstrate a different natural history from those
      with metastatic disease.

      All treatment will be performed in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive a total of 10 treatments of either the vaccine plus OPT-821 (Arm A) or
      OPT-821 alone (Arm B). Treatment will be administered on Visit Weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, 28, 40,
      52, 68, and 84. All patients will receive 150 mcg of OPT-821.
