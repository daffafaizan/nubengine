      predictable platelet inhibition for all patients is an important therapeutic goal.
      Determining the optimal dose of antiplatelet therapy to achieve this goal has been hampered
      by considerable interpatient variability in response to clopidogrel, which largely reflects
      gene polymorphism. Most of the evidence is centred around cytochrome 450 2C19.

      A substudy of TRITON TIMI 38 has recently shown that among persons treated with clopidogrel,
      carriers of a reduced-function CYP2C19 allele had significantly lower levels of the active
      metabolite of clopidogrel, diminished platelet inhibition, and a higher rate of major adverse
      cardiovascular events, including stent thrombosis, than did noncarriers (N Engl J Med
      2009;360:354-62). As a contrary, common functional CYP genetic variants do not affect active
      drug metabolite levels, inhibition of platelet aggregation, or clinical cardiovascular event
      rates in persons treated with prasugrel (Circulation. 2009 May 19;119(19):2553-60).

      More recently, it has been shown that CYP2C19*17 carrier status is significantly associated
      with enhanced response to clopidogrel and an increased risk of bleeding. (Circulation.
      2010;121:512-518). Whether CYP2C19*17 carrier status enhances response to prasugrel is
      unknown.

      Attention has also been placed on a potential interaction observed between clopidogrel and
      the widely used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

      The CYP2C19 isoform is the key enzyme in the metabolism of many of the PPIs, which are also
      inhibitors of the CYP2C19 isoenzyme in varying degrees. This is important because the
      antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel rely, to a degree, upon CYP2C19 activity. However, the
      recent COGENT study and sub-analysis of the TRITON-TIMI 38 have both apparently mitigated
      this concern. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether PPI can father blunt response to
      clopidogrel especially in patients carrying the loss of function 2C19 allele.

      A recent review paper (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 31, 810-823) included 23 studies covering
      93,278 patients. There was substantial heterogeneity in the meta-analyses of major
      cardiovascular events (19 studies, I2 = 79%) or myocardial infarction (12 studies, I2 = 77%).
      Analysis of propensity-matched or randomized trial participants showed no associated
      cardiovascular risk with PPIs, whereas other observational studies generally showed a
      significant association.

      Thus, still today there is an emerging need for more studies, especially prospective
      randomized studies, to investigate the effect of individual PPI agents on clopidogrel's
      effectiveness. Such studies should also include a genetic component to stratify response
      based on the presence of reduced-function alleles of the CYP2C19 enzyme
