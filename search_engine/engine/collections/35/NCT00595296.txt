    
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to gather data to estimate the positive
      predictive concordance (PPC) between the GeneSearchâ„¢ BLN Assay and histology as routinely
      practiced, i.e., routine H&E histology of sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN) and, when available,
      routine histology of non-sentinel axillary lymph nodes (ALN). This study will provide
      information on the assay that will augment the performance data gained in pre-market
      validation studies. In addition, with the assay being used for ALND decision-making, the
      metastatic status of the non-sentinel axillary nodes can be taken into account in the
      performance measures, i.e., if the patient's sentinel or non-sentinel nodes are
      histologically positive, the patient will be considered positive for the primary comparison
      to the assay results.
