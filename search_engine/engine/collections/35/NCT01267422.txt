    
      Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited ocular disorder
      associated with a mutation in mtDNA . The common manifestation is visual loss which caused by
      the respiratory chain enzymes complex dysfunction resulting in increased oxidative stress
      enzymes production.

      Material and Method Seven patients with 11778 LHON mutation were randomly treated with a
      Single IVT Injection of recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus-NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 4
      (complex I)（rAAV2-ND4)（0.05ml).The dose was 5 × 10^9 vg/0.05 mL for patients younger than 12
      years old, and 1 × 10^10 vg/0.05 mL for patients older than 12 years old. The visual acuity,
      visual evoked potential （VEP）,optical coherence tomography（ OCT）, computerized visual field,
      electroretinograms(ERG), retinal nerve fiber layer(RNFL)and Liver and kidney function in
      plasma were compared before and after treatment at 1,3,and 6, months interval.
