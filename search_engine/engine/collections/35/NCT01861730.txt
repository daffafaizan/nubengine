    
      This is a Phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, immunogenicity
      and dose-range finding study in HIV-uninfected, HIV-unexposed, BCG-primed infants. The study
      vaccine AERAS-404 or placebo will be administered without concomitant EPI vaccines (Cohorts 1
      to 5, N = 159 subjects) and with concomitant EPI vaccines (Cohort 6, N = 70 subjects). Study
      vaccine or placebo will be administered as a single dose (injection) at Study Day 0 ( ≥168 to
      ≤ 196 days of age, Cohorts 1 and 2), a 2-dose schedule at Study Day 0 (≥ 168 to ≤ 189 days of
      age) and Study Day 28 (Cohorts 3A and 3B) or a 3-dose schedule at Study Day 0 (≥ 84 to ≤ 98
      days of age), Study Day 42 and Study Day 98 (Cohorts 4 and 5). Subjects in Cohort 6 will
      receive the study vaccine or placebo at Study Day 0 (≥ 64 to ≤ 83 days of age), Study Day 28
      (≥ 91 to ≤ 105 days of age), and Study Day 210 (≥ 273 to ≤ 287 days of age). A cohort will
      enroll once safety in the previous cohort has been established. AERAS-404 is an
      investigational vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (SP) and Statens Serum Institute
      (SSI).
