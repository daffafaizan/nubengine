      girls were eligible for vaccination. Vaccine uptake with at least one dose of vaccine was
      >80%. With such a high vaccine uptake an important herd immunity might be expected. The main
      objective of this study is to measure the prevalence of different HPV types in unvaccinated
      sexually active boys aged 16 to 20 years. This is a cross sectional study which includes one
      visit for all participants. Self sampling technic is used. During this phase of the study a
      total of 681 boys will be recruited. An additional phase of the study will be conducted at
      the condition that the prevalence of HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52 and 58 in unvaccinated boys
      will be at least 8.65%. The second phase of the study if conducted will measure the
      prevalence of the same HPV types in 681 vaccinated boys of the same age.
