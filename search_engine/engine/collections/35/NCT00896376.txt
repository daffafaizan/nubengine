      Primary

        -  To evaluate the predictive value of genetic factors on the toxicity and efficacy of a
           trastuzumab-based therapy in women with metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To analyze tumor factors potentially related to the efficacy of trastuzumab (i.e.,
           expression of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive standard treatment with trastuzumab. Blood is collected periodically for
      pharmacogenetic analysis.
