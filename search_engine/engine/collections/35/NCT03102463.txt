      with the development of insulin resistance, which precedes type 2 diabetes development by
      decades, novel food based solutions are required to improve glycaemic control and attenuate
      insulin resistance.

      In the current study insulin resistant individuals will undergo 4 study visits, 1 screening
      visit and 3 subsequent visits. At each of the 3 visits they will receive an oral lipid load
      consisting of 100mL soya bean oil, followed by either a water control; the hydrolysate being
      tested or the parent protein from which the hydrolysate was derived. After which they will
      undergo a 4 hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic clamp at each visit to assess their insulin
      sensitivity.
