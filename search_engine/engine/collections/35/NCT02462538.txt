      at least one line of conventional chemotherapy or if they are ineligible for conventional
      chemotherapy.

      Imatinib will be given continuously starting from day 1 of the first cycle at an oral dose of
      100mg daily. The dose will be increased to 200mg daily starting from day 1 of the second
      cycle if no DLT occurs during the first cycle. BV will be given 3 weekly starting on day 1 at
      a dose of 1.8 mg/kg body weight. In the absence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) i.e.
      haematological toxicity ≥ grade 2, non- haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3, after 3 weeks of
      therapy, and in the presence of a clinical response (CR or PR) after cycle 1, the BV dose
      will continue every 3 weeks for 48 weeks. Dose modifications and stopping rules will be
      introduced as described in chapter 6. In case of progression at any time during the study the
      patient will go off trial and receive salvage treatment.
