      available; however, in clinical trials 30-40% of patients do not experience even a 50%
      reduction in depression severity scores, while 50-70% fail to achieve a full therapeutic
      response. Futhermore, impairment from the disorder continues essentially unabated in patients
      who are treated but do not fully remit. If anything, the situation is at least as bad or not
      worse in clinical practice. Clearly, alternatives are needed to manage this common clinical
      condition.

      The addition of bupropion ER (extended release) to an SSRI has empirical support, and has
      become the most common augmentation strategy in the US. A comparative trial of the
      combination of risperidone or bupropion ER added to an SSRI in treatment resistant deperssion
      could help support risperidone for this condition; such a trial seems warranted at this time.

      Patients who are currently on a SSRI at an adequate dosage for at least 3 weeks with no
      response, will be randomly assigned (open-label) to either risperidone or bupropion ER
      augmentation for a period of 6 weeks. Patients will be followed weekly at the beginning and
      bi-weekly towards the end of the trial to compare the response of each group.
