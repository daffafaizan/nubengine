      albumin is the principle carrier (95%). IC-GREEN is taken up from the plasma almost
      exclusively by the hepatic parenchymal cells and is secreted entirely into the bile. It
      undergoes no significant extrahepatic or enterohepatic circulation. Simultaneous arterial and
      venous blood estimations have shown negligible renal, peripheral, lung or cerebro-spinal
      uptake of the dye. Therefore, the serum clearance rate (determined from serial serum
      concentration measurements at various times after intravenous injection) can serve as a
      useful index of liver function.
