      emotional responses. The usual treatments for Frontotemporal dementia focus on reducing
      agitation and aggressive behaviours. However, these drugs do not help all patients who
      experience blunting of emotion and loss of empathy. This study will evaluate the effects on
      emotions and neural activity of a one time dose of intranasal oxytocin vs. placebo in
      patients with FTD and healthy controls.
