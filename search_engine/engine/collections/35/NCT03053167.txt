      amenable for surgical resection is palliative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy.
      However, response rates are low and prognosis remains poor, with median survival times about
      one year. Until recently, second-line therapy options were limited.

      Irinotecan is a semisynthetic camptothecin derivate that acts as a DNA-topoisomerase-1
      inhibitor,its most frequent toxic effects are diarrhea, neutropenia and cholinergic syndrome.
      Raltitrexed is a quinazoline folate-based specific thymidylate synthase inhibitor, its
      clinical activity in this setting is similar to that of modulated 5-FU regimens but with a
      better toxicity profile (mainly asthenia and increased serum transaminase levels). There
      seems to be no cross-resistance between 5-FU and raltitrexed. Irinotecan and raltitrexed have
      different toxicity profiles and modes of action. Both drugs are active as single agents and
      may be given as a short 3-weekly infusion, thus obviating complex schedules or the need for
      implantable venous access devices. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a pronounced
      sequence-dependent synergy between SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) and
      raltitrexed. It seems then interesting to explore the feasibility and therapeutic potential
      of this association.

      With this background, the investigators have performed this study to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of irinotecan plus raltitrexed as second-line treatment in advanced colorectal cancer
      patients.
