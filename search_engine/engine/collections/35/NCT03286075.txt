    
      To study the modulation of the DLPFC (left and right) by tDCS (anode, cathode and placebo) on
      the processing of emotions and the impact on attentional resources, and physiological
      responses, subjects will undertake 3 tasks before and after a unique tDCS session of 30
      minutes.

      The first task is a facial expression recognition task, the second measures the attentional
      processing of emotional information ("Free-viewing task") and the last task focuses on
      working memory (digit sorting task).

      Each task has its cognitive variables but physiological responses will also be measured
      during each task before and after the tDCS session (Eye movement, i.e. Pupil dilatation and
      time spent on region of interest; heart rate, skin conductance and respiratory frequency).

      3 arms will take part in the study: Anode tDCS Cathode tDCS Placebo tDCS These 3 types of
      tDCS stimulation will enable us to study the different modulations possible for the DLPFC and
      the impact on all the variables previously mentioned.
