      each arm, a total of 98 patients. Patients will be randomized with a block randomization
      schedule generated by computerized random numbers using a 1:1 allocation to pyridium and
      routine perioperative care. The study is powered to see a difference in incidence of urinary
      retention after midurethral sling using 25% as the historic control for our institution.
      Statistical sample size was based on a decrease in incidence to 5% in the pyridium arm. This
      is with 80% power and alpha 0.05. After the patient's surgery, including a midurethral sling,
      the patient will have an active voiding trial performed as described by Pulvino et al. The
      patient's bladder will be backfilled with 300cc of sterile saline. If the patient cannot
      tolerate 300cc, the patient will be filled to maximum capacity. The patient will be allowed
      20 minutes to void. The patient must void greater than two thirds the volume that was
      instilled in the bladder to consider it a passed voiding trial. The timing of the voiding
      trial will be at the discretion of the surgeon, accounting for factors such as complexity of
      concomitant surgery, the patient being alert, ambulating, with tolerable pain.
