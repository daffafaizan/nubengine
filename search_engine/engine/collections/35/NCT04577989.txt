      concern in the antibiotic resistance crisis. In gram-negative bacteria it evolves primarily
      through the production of beta-lactamases that allow the rapid hydrolysis of common
      antibiotics - most notably 3rd generation cephalosporins. Particularly, the production of
      Ambler class C beta-lactamase (AmpC) is a very concerning and unique resistance mechanism as
      so called derepressed mutants can be induced during treatment. Information on recent
      epidemiological trends as well as comparative information about the treatment strategies
      (cefepime versus piperacillin/tazobactam versus carbapenems) for infections with
      AmpC-producing Enterobacterales in Switzerland is still lacking. This study is to investigate
      the recent epidemiological trends and the treatment outcome in terms of the length of
      hospital stay, the relevant renal and neurological side effects, risk factors for developing
      these side effects, the selection of more resistant pathogens under therapy as well as the
      incidence of Clostridium difficile infections under treatment.
