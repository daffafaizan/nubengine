      therapeutic goal in improving liver function and potentially expanding the number of
      transplantable livers. This study aims to assess the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide to
      limit ischemia-reperfusion injury in transplanted livers and by doing so improve liver
      function post transplantation and decrease patient hospital length of stays.
