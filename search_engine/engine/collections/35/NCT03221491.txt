      postoperative analgesia.Patient-controlled analgesia with opioids is now widely used after
      surgery for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. This technique provides effective pain
      treatment, adjusts the dose according to personal need and keeps plasma analgesic levels at a
      constant level,but the incidence of opioid-induced side-effects still be reported
      frequently.A proper PCA programme may increase efficiency of analgesic and decrease incidence
      of analgesic-induced side-effects.

      In this study, 90 patients who is undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery will be
      randomly allocated into three groups (no background infusion group(Group B0),low background
      infusion group(Group B1) and high background infusion group(Group B2)). Patients in all
      groups will be given a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump in post anesthetic recovery
      unit (PACU) after surgery.The PCA programme of Group B0 is dezocine 0.6mg/kg, flubiprofen
      3mg/kg, diluted into 120ml and administer at a background infusion of 0ml/h, and a bolus of
      4ml, with a lock-out of 15min. The PCA protocol of Group B1 is dezocine 0.6mg/kg,flubiprofen
      3mg/k diluted into 120ml and administer at a background infusion of 1ml/h, and a bolus of
      2ml, with a lock-out of 15min.The PCA protocol of Group B2 is dezocine 0.6mg/kg,flubiprofen
      3mg/k diluted into 120ml and administer at a background infusion of 2ml/h, and a bolus of
      2ml, with a lock-out of 15min.
