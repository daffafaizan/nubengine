      Elevated pro-inflammatory mediators in obesity and metabolic syndrome have an inhibitory
      effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) leading to hypogonadism.
      Decreased testosterone production in obese men in turn promotes additional fat deposition,
      contributing to a vicious cycle of fat accumulation. This complex pathophysiological
      interplay is termed hypogonadal-obesity-adipocytokine hypothesis, describing a bidirectional
      relationship between low levels of testosterone and the metabolic syndrome.

      TestIL is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to
      test the hypothesis that inhibition of IL-1-activity diminishes the inhibitory effects on HPG
      axis and increases testosterone levels in men with metabolic syndrome.
