    
      Through 6 health education events at the worksites, blue-collar workers (who face dual health
      risks through their exposures to occupational hazards and their high rates of tobacco use)
      will gain the knowledge, skills, and social support needed to quit tobacco use.

      Simultaneously, management will receive OH and tobacco policy consultations to help build a
      healthy and safe work environment, where workers' hazardous exposures are reduced.
