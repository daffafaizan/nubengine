      in the past and 10 subjects who have not had such procedures. For each subject, pain
      tolerance in three areas will be assessed: temple, midface/cheek, and abdomen. In two areas
      of the face (temple and midface/cheek), a small sterile needle will be inserted into the skin
      along with three applications of the following devices that are FDA approved for use on the
      face: an ultrasound device (Ulthera), a pulsed dye laser (VBeam), and a radiofrequency
      (Thermage) device. Additionally, the abdomen will receive three of these four devices in a
      randomized order: small sterile needle insertion, a pulsed dye laser (VBeam) pulse, and a
      radiofrequency (Thermage) exposure (the ultrasound device, Ulthera, will not be used on the
      abdomen because it is currently not FDA approved for this indication). Subjects will then be
      asked to rate their pain after each application at each individual site using a pain scale.
      In addition, subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding their pain experiences and
      other possibly related factors before and after the procedures.
