      those with chronic heart failure (CHF). It was about 4-5 times more prevalent among patients
      with CHF than healthy population and independently associated with poor outcome of CHF. As
      suggested in the clinical management guideline of CHF, it is imperative to create integrative
      intervention for older adults with CHF, including timely detection and intervention, and
      ultimately improving the clinical outcome of CHF. However, the approach appropriate for
      depression intervention among Chinese older adults has yet been developed. This study aims to
      explore the effectiveness of psycho-behavioral intervention on depression associated with
      chronic heart failure in old age.
