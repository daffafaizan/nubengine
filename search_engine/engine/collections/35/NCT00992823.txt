      0.0005); the reduction was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.35). The
      mean hemoglobin concentration increased in both groups (Group 1: 0.27 g/dL; P < 0.016 and
      Group 2: 0.47 g/dL; P < 0.0005) without significant differences between the groups (P =
      0.17).
