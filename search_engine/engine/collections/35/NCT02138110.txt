      evaluate the safety and probable benefit of the poly(lactic-co-glycolic
      acid)-b-poly(L-lysine) Scaffold ("Scaffold") in subjects with thoracic AIS A traumatic spinal
      cord injury at neurological level of injury of T2-T12.

      The study will be conducted by qualified Investigators who have been trained on the surgical
      Scaffold implant procedure in order to enroll subjects in the Primary Endpoint Analysis Set,
      defined as all subjects with a successful Scaffold implant, no major protocol deviations, and
      a complete 6-month Primary Endpoint Follow-up Visit. After receiving the Scaffold and
      following discharge, subjects will participate in a comprehensive rehabilitation program. For
      the first 24-months after implantation of the Scaffold, Follow-up and Long-term Follow-up
      assessments will be conducted at either the study site or the rehabilitation center. The
      Long-term Follow-up annual visits for years 3 through 10 will be conducted over the
      telephone.
