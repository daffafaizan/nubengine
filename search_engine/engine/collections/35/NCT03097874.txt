      University, University of California, San Francisco, other bay-area medical programs and
      clinics, and online advertisement to the population at large. If participants are deemed
      eligible, participants will be invited for a baseline interview (about 2 hours in duration)
      during which the investigators will conduct interviews and collect questionnaire measures.
      Then, participants and participants' families will begin Family Based Treatment (FBT) with a
      study therapist at Stanford University or University of California, San Francisco,
      respectively. All assessments and treatments are conducted through tele-health.

      At session 4, if participants have not gained 2.4kg, an indicator of early treatment
      response, participants and participants' families will be randomized to receive either
      treatment as usual (FBT) or an adaptive form of FBT, during which families will receive
      additional Intensive Parental Coaching (IPC). If participants have reached weight milestones
      (i.e., 2.4kg at session 4), participants will continue FBT as usual.

      At 3 months of treatment and end of treatment, the investigators will collect the same
      measures taken at baseline. The investigators also ask that families participate in 6- and
      12-month follow-up, respectively.
