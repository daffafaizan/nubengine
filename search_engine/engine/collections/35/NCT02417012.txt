      glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, few have investigated
      the combined effects of these lifestyle changes on maintenance of glycemic control while
      decreasing the usage of anti-diabetic medications.

      The primary hypothesis is that lifestyle change is equivalent in maintaining glycemic control
      (Hba1c) compared to the standard pharmacological treatment,

      The U-TURN trial also tests the effects on one key secondary outcome (glucose lowering
      medication) and examines the effects on sleep quality, fatigue sleepiness, sleep pattern,
      cardio vascular disease risk factors, psychological outcomes, blood pressure and cholesterol
      lowering medication. The participants (N=120) is randomized into a experimental group (N=80)
      and a standard care group (N=40).

      Additionally, the effects of the study will be evaluated 24 month post randomization.
