      Nasal CPAP therapy is in widespread use as the primary treatment for OSAS, a sleep-related
      breathing disorder affecting more than 15 million Americans. The therapeutic effectiveness of
      CPAP in providing significant, stable, and long-term neurocognitive or other functional
      benefits to patients with OSAS has not been systematically investigated.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study is a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, multi-center trial of CPAP therapy. The
      principal aims of the study are: 1) to assess the long-term effectiveness of CPAP therapy on
      neurocognitive function, mood, sleepiness, and quality of life by administering tests of
      these indices to subjects randomly assigned to active or sham CPAP; 2) to identify specific
      neurocognitive deficits associated with OSAS in a large, heterogeneous subject population; 3)
      to determine which deficits in neurocognitive function in OSAS subjects are reversible and
      most sensitive to the effects of CPAP; 4) to develop a composite multivariate outcome measure
      from the results of this study that can be used to assess the clinical effectiveness of CPAP
      in improving neurocognitive function, mood, sleepiness, and quality of life; and 5) to use
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare cortical activation before and after CPAP
      therapy, and to assess whether this change is associated with improvement in specific
      neurocognitive task performance. The primary endpoint of the study is the effect of six
      months of CPAP treatment on neurocognitive function. A total of 1100 subjects (550 per
      treatment group) will be enrolled from the patient populations at five sites (Stanford
      University; University of Arizona; Brigham and Women's Hospital; Massachusetts; St. Luke's
      Hospital, Missouri; St. Mary Medical Center, Washington).
