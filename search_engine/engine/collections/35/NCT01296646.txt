      recruited to participate in this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eighty
      alcohol-dependent individuals will be randomized into the study and we are allowing for 50
      screen failures. Participation in this study will be an alternative to standard treatment.
      Subjects will be blindly assessed for SL/SDL status to yield 50% representation of each
      trait.

      Procedures (methods): Subjects who meet general inclusion/exclusion criteria based on the
      screening interview will complete a sweet taste assessment. Results, along with craving
      score, will be given to the Investigational Drug Services for randomization purposes. The
      study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which participants
      will receive 50 mg oral naltrexone or matching placebo for a 12-week period. In addition
      participants will meet with a trained therapist for nine 30-minute BRENDA therapy sessions
      Medical monitoring will also be conducted by study physicians and will consist of review of
      vital signs, concomitant medication use, and general inquiries into side effects.
