    
      Primary Objective To evaluate the effect of Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxin A) on lower extremity
      spasticity (soleus, gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, flexor
      digitorum longus, flexor halluces longus, rectus femorus, vastus lateralis, lateral
      hamstrings, medial hamstrings, adductor magnus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, triceps
      surae, tibialis posterior or anterior tibialis).

      Other Objectives

        -  To explore the effect of Dysport® on improvement in walking ability in patients with MS

        -  To explore the effect of Dysport® on quality of (QoL) in patients with MS. Primary
           Endpoint Absolute change from baseline in Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) through 20 weeks
           of treatment.

      Other Endpoints

        -  Change from baseline in MAS scores at Weeks 12, 16, and 20.

        -  Change from baseline on QoL based on patient reported outcome (PRO) measures on the
           MSWS-12, MSIS 29, pain scales (0-10 pain scale) the MSSS-88, and the Penn spasm
           frequency scale through 20 weeks of treatment.

        -  Change from baseline on the time 25 foot walk (T25FW) test with timed up and go (TUG)
           through 20 weeks of treatment.

        -  Change from baseline on expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score at Weeks 12, 16,
           20.

        -  Change from baseline in speed, cadence, general symmetry, propulsion, stride length,
           T25FW, TUG using GWALK device for gait assessments through 20 weeks.

        -  Adverse events over 20 weeks

        -  Serious adverse events over 20 weeks
