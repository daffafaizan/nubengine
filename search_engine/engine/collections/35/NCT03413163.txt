      prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer which is not suitable for surgical treatment with
      closed method. This method is commonly used among urological procedures which are open
      surgical procedures. Patients after this procedure often complain of excessive pain.
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids are used for postoperative analgesia. In
      addition, in the past decade, in the guideline of ultrasonography, peripheral block types
      have been described that demonstrate analgesic activity in open prostatectomies as well as
      many operations on the development of regional anesthesia and analgesia techniques. The
      ultrasonography guideline reported that the transverse abdominal plane (TAP) block provides
      effective analgesia in these cases. The ESP block is a new block for the treatment of
      thoracic neuropathic pain. In the following process; ESP block thoracic and breast surgery,
      bariatric surgery, and upper abdominal surgeons have also been reported to provide effective
      postoperative analgesia.

      The standard practice for post-operative pain management for retropubic radical prostatectomy
      in Maltepe University Hospital consists of routine intravenous analgesic and rescue
      analgesics and in combination with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).

      The application of erector spinae plane (ESP) block technique under ultrasonography guideline
      under sedoanalgesia in patients who will undergo retropubic prostatectomy with open method
      should determine the effect on the patient's pain level in the first 24 hours after
      operation.
