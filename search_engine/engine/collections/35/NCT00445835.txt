      close correlation between the extension of coronary artery disease and the severity of
      atherosclerotic lesions in extra coronary arterial beds. In addition, these symptomatic
      extracoronary lesions dramatically decrease the survival of these patients. However, scant
      data are available regarding the prevalence of extracoronary asymptomatic lesions.
      Conversely, the annual absolute risk of these lesions remains unknown. Consequently, whether
      a systematic identification of these extracoronary asymptomatic lesions is relevant remains
      to be established. The Primary Objective and Primary Endpoint of the AMERICA study is to
      demonstrate the superiority of an active detection and management of the extension of
      atherothrombosis in high Risk coronary patients (active strategy) in comparison with standard
      of care for coronary atherosclerosis (conservative strategy).
