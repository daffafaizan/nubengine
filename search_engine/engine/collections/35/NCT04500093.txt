      studies assessing post-THR hip function using robotic dynamometry have focused on evaluating
      surgical outcomes and prosthetic selection. These studies provide insight regarding the
      strength deficits of older adults after THR. However, the data are not consistent, making it
      difficult to assess the nature of the deficit.
