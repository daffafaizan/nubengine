      randomized into one of three arms: consumption of 50 gm of extra virgin coconut oil daily OR
      50gm of butter daily OR 50gm of extra virgin olive oil daily (50gm is about 2 ounces, or 2
      table spoons), to be consumed over a one month period. The food will be provided in the form
      of processed cheese to mask participants.

      After full informed consent, participants will attend an assessment visit and have a baseline
      measures of weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, a blood sample for
      assessment of blood lipids and other metabolic markers, and fill in a health questionnaire
      and dietary questionnaire. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three arms:
      coconut oil, butter or olive oil and will be given supplies of these

      After one month, participants will return for follow up assessment which will include a
      repeat blood sample, anthropometric measures and blood pressure, and questionnaire.

      Blood samples collected by venipuncture will be stored at the University of Reading.

      At the end of the study, all participants will be given the individual participant results of
      the anthropometric measures and lipid profiles at baseline and follow up as well as the
      overall findings of the trial.
