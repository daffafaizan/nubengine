      importance because of their possible association with the severity of HCM and the presence of
      arrhythmias. However,current literature appears conflicting.

      This is a prospective cohort study aiming to examine the echocardiographic parameters of
      myocardial deformation, estimated by the "speckle tracking" method, and their correlation
      with clinical presentation and symptomatology, other imaging parameters, exercise capacity,
      arrhythmias (ventricular or supraventricular) and risk factors for sudden death in patients
      with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

      Although, similar efforts have been made in international literature, they are scarce and
      their results contradictory. The present study is the first to be performed in a Greek
      population, a fact that is particularly important given the genetic heterogeneity of the
      disease.
