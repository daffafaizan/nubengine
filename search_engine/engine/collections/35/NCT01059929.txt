      medications to relieve pain and anxiety associated with intubation, mechanical ventilation,
      and critical care in general. While integral in minimizing discomfort, these medications may
      increase mechanical ventilation time, the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ICU
      complications (e.g. delirium, ventilator associated pneumonia, venous thromboembolism), the
      morbidity associated with critical illness, and patient mortality. This study compares two
      sedative medications that have been used in patients who require a mechanical ventilator.
      Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to receive propofol or dexmedetomidine for
      sedation while they require ventilatory support. All patients will also receive the pain
      medication fentanyl as needed.
