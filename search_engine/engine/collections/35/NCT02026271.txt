      for tumor resection. Patients who are scheduled for a standard of care craniotomy and tumor
      resection will receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12
      will be administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14
      days.

      Patients not scheduled for tumor resection will receive Ad-RTS-hIL-12 by stereotactic
      injection and then will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.

      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the
      follow-up period.
