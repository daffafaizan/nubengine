      commercial stepping for at least 90 min/day of TV programming, with that of walking at least
      30 min/day (30 min walk) on daily step counts, TV viewing, and diet during a 24 week PA
      intervention. Sedentary, overweight or obese, adults will be randomly assigned to either the
      TV commercial stepping, or 30 min walk group during a 24-week behavioral PA intervention.
      Both groups will attend 8 sessions, but receive different PA goals. PA, TV watching time,
      diet, and anthropometric data will be collected at 0, 12, and 24 weeks. It is hypothesized
      that the TV commercial stepping condition will, show an equal increase in PA at 12 and 24
      weeks as compared to the 30-min walk condition. Neither group is hypothesized to demonstrate
      changes in TV viewing time, dietary intake, or weight.
