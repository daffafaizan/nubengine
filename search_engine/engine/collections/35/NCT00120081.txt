      burden of disease in developing countries. This is especially true for children and women of
      reproductive age who represent populations that are highly vulnerable to the effects of
      hookworm disease. Up to 65,000 deaths annually have been attributed to human hookworm
      infection. However, the mortality estimates of hookworm pale in comparison to global disease
      burden estimates.

      The primary approach to hookworm control worldwide has been the frequent and periodic use of
      benzimidazole anthelminthics for school-age children. However, school-based anthelminthic
      chemotherapy programs miss populations highly vulnerable to hookworm, including adolescent
      and adult women. In addition, high rates of hookworm re-infection occur within 4-12 months
      following anthelminthic chemotherapy, and there is evidence for diminished efficacy of
      benzimidazoles with frequent and periodic use, possibly because of emerging drug resistance.
      These concerns have prompted interest in developing alternative tools for hookworm control.
      Vaccination to prevent high intensity hookworm infection would alleviate the public health
      deficiencies of drug treatment alone.
