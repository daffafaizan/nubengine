    
      This is an trial designed to evaluate the positive predictive value of 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging
      in men diagnosed with prostate cancer with increasing PSA levels. Patients will receive a
      single dose of 18FDCFPyL PET and undergo a PET imaging study. 18F-DCFPyL Injection is an
      18F-labeled small molecule that targets the extracellular domain of PSMA. One intravenous
      catheter will be placed for radiopharmaceutical administration. Patients will be injected
      with ≤ 333 MBq (≤ 9 mCi) of 18F-DCFPyL via this catheter. The dose range for 18F-DCFPyL will
      be 7 - 9 mCi. The PET imaging may be repeated at a later date if the biopsy of the lesion is
      negative and if the lesion is present on follow-up imaging.
