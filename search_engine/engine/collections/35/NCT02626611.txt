      multi food allergies. The investigators anticipate enrolling 70 subjects with multi food
      allergies at more than one site. Subjects must have food specific Immunoglobulin E >4 kilo
      Units/Liter for each allergen or a skin test reactivity to each food allergen greater than or
      equal to 6mm wheal diameter. In addition, subjects must have a total Immunoglobulin E <2,000
      kilo Units/Liter, a clinical reaction during a double blind placebo controlled food challenge
      (DBPCFC) with food protein/powder to establish sensitivity to given food protein/powder
      (pecan, milk, egg, peanut, almond, wheat, cashew, sesame seed, soy, walnut, hazelnut, shrimp,
      cod, salmon) and no clinical reaction during placebo (oat) as per Chemistry Manufacturing and
      Control section of Investigational New Drug.

      Each subject is planned to be enrolled in the active phase of the study for 36 weeks.

      Food protein and powder will be obtained and prepared as per Investigational New Drug 14831
      and will be in compliance with all applicable regulations.

      Omalizumab is approved by the European Medicines Agency (European FDA) for patients with
