      period in chronic stroke patients relative to healthy age-matched controls. Motor learning
      will be assessed by improvements in the Jebsen-Taylor test, a validated tool widely used in
      rehabilitation that measures upper extremity function. Additionally, we intend to evaluate
      changes in the excitability of the primary motor cortex associated with learning using
      transcranial magnetic stimulation.
