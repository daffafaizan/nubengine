      kidney injury, arryhthmias and infection). The investigators aimed to study the effects of
      two different anesthesia techniques, i.e. combined spinoepidural anesthesia and general
      anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative complications such as arrhythmia, pulmonary
      thrombeoembolism, infection, acute kidney injury and mortality.
