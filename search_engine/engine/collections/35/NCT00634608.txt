      variety of patient medical conditions and the quantity of materials needed. Increasingly,
      electronic resources such as those found on the internet have the potential to provide easily
      accessible needed information. However, clinicians do not have the time to assemble a list of
      websites for their patients and even if they did, the quality of information varies greatly
      and would require close screening. MedlinePlus is a free National Library of Medicine
      sponsored website that features health information on hundreds of conditions with all
      information carefully screened for quality standards by expert librarians. We will conduct a
      pilot study to seamlessly integrate provider-customized MedlinePlus health education
      prescriptions for specific conditions into the normal clinic workflow to motivate patients to
      access and expand their use of MedlinePlus to benefit their health. As HIV
      prevention/education is very important, we will include the HIV clinic as well as a general
      internal medicine clinic.
