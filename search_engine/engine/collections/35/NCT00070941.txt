      efficacy in patients with PD and may exacerbate motor symptoms. SAM-e is available in the
      United States as a food supplement and is promoted as a mood enhancer. SAM-e improves
      dopamine transmission, may have a beneficial effect on dopamine receptors, and may be a good
      alternative to the currently-used antidepressants in patients with PD. This study will
      investigate whether SAM-e is safe and effective in the treatment of depression associated
      with PD. The efficacy of SAM-e will be compared to placebo and to escitalopram, a selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor commonly used for the treatment of depression in PD.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive SAM-e, escitalopram, or
      placebo for 12 weeks. Some participants may choose to extend treatment for an additional 12
      weeks (for a total of 24 weeks on study medication). Participants will have study visits at
      entry and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Study visits will include neurological evaluation,
      psychiatric evaluation, blood tests, and quality of life questionnaires. A telephone
      interview will be conducted at Week 10.
