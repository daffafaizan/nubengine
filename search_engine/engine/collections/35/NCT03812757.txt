      medicine. Verification of correct catheter tip placement is a primary aspect of safety and
      quality of central venous catheterization as malposition may lead to life-threatening
      complications such as thrombosis, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, and arrhythmias.
      Conventional chest x-ray (CXR) is routinely performed after every insertion and is considered
      gold standard to examine catheter tip location and evaluate for complications such as pneumo-
      and hemothorax. However, CXR exposes the patient to ionized radiation, requires a
      considerable amount of time, and is workload-generating for both ICU and radiology staff.

      Weber et al has described the use of the right supraclavicular fossa view for real-time
      ultrasound-guided placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) via the right internal jugular
      vein (IJV) in adults. This approach has subsequently been validated in a clinical study and
      has also been used for supraclavicular subclavian line insertion. The approach requires use
      of a microconvex probe, which couples good image resolution and high scanning depth. The use
      of a microconvex probe for infraclavicular subclavian central venous catheter (CVC) insertion
      has been described previously, but this is the first description of the supraclavicular fossa
      ultrasound view to guide correct catheter tip placement in infraclavicular right subclavian
      CVC placement.
