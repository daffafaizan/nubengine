      HEROES) is a non-randomized cohort study based at the University of Texas Health Science
      Center of Houston. This study recruits participants through three avenues: assertive
      community outreach with a peer coach and paramedic following and opioid overdose, community
      referrals, and emergency department referrals. The study explores the effect of the
      combination of assertive outreach, same-day induction into medication for opioid use
      disorder, ongoing maintenance treatment, behavioral counseling, peer recovery support, and
      paramedic follow-up on patient outcomes. The primary outcome is engagement and retention in
      outpatient treatment. Secondary outcomes include quality of life assessment as well as
      subsequent relapses and overdoses. The hypothesis is that patients with earlier induction
      into MOUD treatment who receive routine follow-up, are more likely to engage and remain in
      treatment long-term.
