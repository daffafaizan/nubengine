      empowerment program (PEP) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patient self-management compared
      to traditional diabetes health education.

      Methods: Two hundred and twenty-five patients, recruited from community health centers (CHCs)
      and the family medicine clinic in the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital in Shenzhen,
      were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. Patients in the intervention
      group (n=117) received a four-session PEP in small groups over one month by trained nurses
      and doctors. The control group (n=108) received the traditional lecture-style health
      education on DM. All the patients were followed up for three months. Outcomes included
      problem areas in diabetes (PAID) that measures diabetes-related emotional distress, patient
      enablement index (PEI), mental health, patient satisfaction respectively as well as lifestyle
      behaviors were assessed at baseline, post-activity and three months.
