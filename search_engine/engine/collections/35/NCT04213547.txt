      sleep duration. Participants will be recruited either before or after a routine outpatient
      clinic visit and asked to complete intake questionnaires. They will then be provided an
      actigraphy watch device which will be worn for 14 days to estimate sleep duration, and Libre
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to estimate glycemic control. After their visit, clinical
      data will be extracted from the electronic medical record.

      Aim 2 will be an interventional study design utilizing Fitbit to perform a loss-framed
      incentive intervention designed to motivate participants to increase their sleep duration.
      Glycemic control will be measured via laboratory testing of hemoglobin A1c and Libre
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 2 weeks pre- and post-intervention.
