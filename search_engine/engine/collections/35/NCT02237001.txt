      criteria. Screening will include an x-ray of the injured knee and evaluation of an MRI of the
      injured knee within 6 months prior to the scheduled procedure. During the procedure, the
      meniscal tear will be evaluated by arthroscopy to determine if the tear meets study
      requirements. If the meniscal tear is determined to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, the
      subject will be considered enrolled. If any inclusion/exclusion criteria is not met, the
      subject will be considered a screen failure and will not be enrolled. For enrolled subjects,
      specific information regarding the repair and repair technique will be collected during the
      procedure, including still and video images.

      Subjects will be contacted 7-15 days post-procedure for safety follow-up. Subjects will
      return for follow-up visits at approximately post-procedure Days 90, 185, 365 and 730.
      Identical questionnaires will be completed at each visit to assess knee pain and knee
      function. Safety information will be collected at each post-procedure visit. Additionally, an
      in-office arthroscopy of the treated knee will be performed at participating sites at Day
      185, an MRI of the treated knee will be performed at Day 365 and an X-ray of the treated knee
      will be performed at Day 730. The patient will exit the study at the Day 730 visit.
