    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), active-controlled
      (agent that is compared with a study medication to test whether the study medication has a
      real effect in a clinical study), double-dummy (placebo [inactive substance that is compared
      with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study] is
      administered to maintain the blind when the comparator medication cannot be made identical to
      the study medication), parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same
      time), multicenter study to assess the effectiveness and safety of 7 day course of doripenem,
      compared with 10 day course of imipenem-cilastatin in patients with ventilator-associated
      pneumonia. This study will consists of 3 phases: (1) a pretreatment phase with a maximum of
      24 hours for the screening/baseline visit, (2) a double blind, double dummy, treatment phase
      of 10 days (Day 1 to Day 10) and an end-of-treatment (EOT) assessment within 24 hours after
      the last dose of study medication therapy administered on Day 10 or at the time of early
      withdrawal from study medication, and (3) a post treatment (follow-up) phase consisting of an
      early follow-up (EFU) visit within 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication, and
      last follow-up (LFU) visit within 28 to 35 days after the last dose of study medication for
      all patients including those who discontinued study medication early. Two hundred and seventy
      four patients will be randomly assigned to receive either doripenem or imipenem with placebo
      of the other medication given simultaneously to maintain the blind (eg, 1 group will receive
      blinded doripenem from Days 1 to 7 and imipenem placebo Days 1 to 10, other group will
      receive blinded imipenem Days 1 to 10 and doripenem placebo Days 1 to 7). A sample of
      secretions from the lower respiratory tract will be obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
      or mini-BAL within 36 hours prior to administration of study medication from the enrolled
      patients and sent for culture. Patients, whose baseline BAL or mini-BAL culture results will
      yield at least 1 qualifying pneumonia pathogen will continue to receive study medication
      therapy and patients, whose baseline BAL or mini-BAL culture results did not yield at least 1
      qualifying pneumonia pathogen will be discontinued from study medication therapy but will
      remain enroll in the study and will be followed for safety. Safety evaluations including
      adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs and physical examinations will
      be monitored throughout the study period. The total duration of an individual patient's
      participation in the study will be approximately 5 to 6 weeks.
