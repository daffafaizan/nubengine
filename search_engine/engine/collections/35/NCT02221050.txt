        -  Food wanting evaluated by the sequential presentation of 18 images of food (6 fat-, 6
           carbohydrate- and 6 protein-rich foods),

        -  Two blood samples for the assays of leptin, ghrelin, creatinine, albumin and pre-albumin
           as well as plasma amino acids.

           24 healthy subjects are also evaluated in order to compare the results from patients to
