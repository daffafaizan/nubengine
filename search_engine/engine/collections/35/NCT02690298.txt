      in the clinical environment, the respiratory volume monitor (RVM) was tested throughout a
      range of respiratory rates and also during erratic breathing patterns. At 4 and 36 breaths
      per minute (the extremes of the rates anticipated to be encountered in the clinical setting),
      and during erratic breathing, RVM and spirometry measurements were found to be
      highly-correlated (r=0.98 ±0.01 (mean ±95%CI) at 4 breaths/min, 0.97 ±0.01 at 36, and 0.93
      ±0.04 during erratic breathing). These studies also included calibration of the ExSpiron to
      the spirometer.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume
      (TV) and respiratory rate (RR) measurements collected and reported by the ExSpiron, without
      prior ExSpiron calibration, against acquired MV, TV, and RR measurements from an ExSpiron
      with prior individual specific calibration to a spirometer using either a Wright Spirometer
      or a Morgan Flow Volume Loop (FVL) Pneumotachograph Spirometer. A secondary objective will be
      to confirm the PadSet functionality after 24 hours of wear in accordance with current
      labeling.
