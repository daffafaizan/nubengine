    
      The proposed study is two centers, unblinded, non randomized, phase I/II trial in which the
      patients will be treated with a single dose of autologous stromal vascular cells (SVF) in
      combination with platelet rich plasma (PRP).

      This study aimes to evaluate the clinical efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived MSC
      transplantation in patients with confirmed osteoarthritis at grade II and III. Adipose tissue
      is isolated from the belly, and used for extraction of the SVF. The SVF is mixed with
      activated platelet-rich plasma before injection. The clinical efficiencies are evaluated by
      the pain score (VAS), Lysholm score, and MRI findings. SVF is isolated from about 100 mL of
      adipose tissue, and PRP is prepared from 20 mL of peripheral blood. Total injection volume
      will be about 5-10 mL. The total number of SVF to be injected is 1.0 x 10(7) to 5 x 10(7).
