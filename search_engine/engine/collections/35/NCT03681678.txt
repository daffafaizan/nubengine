    
      Fractional carbon dioxide (fCO2) laser treatment of the vaginal tissue has been proposed as a
      treatment for various genitourinary symptoms, including vaginal itching, burning, dryness,
      dyspareunia (difficult or painful sexual intercourse), dysuria (painful or difficult
      urination), nocturia (waking at night to urinate), incontinence (the involuntary loss of
      urine), urine frequency, urine urgency, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

      Case report and case series data suggest that laser treatment of the vaginal tissues is well
      tolerated by patients and does not pose serious risks to the patient. Several case series
      demonstrate improvements in vulvovaginal and urinary symptoms, and in sexual function.
      However, these studies are from a select few centers, are small, and are also biased in that
      the laser treatment is only available to patients who are able to pay for it. Additionally,
      most studies report only on vulvovaginal symptoms, despite increasing use of laser for
      urinary symptoms. Several recent editorials have called for larger studies with longer
      follow-up and high quality outcome measures. This study has been designed to address these
      needs.

      This is a prospective observational study of women undergoing vaginal treatment with the fCO2
      laser for a wide range of patients with vulvovaginal, sexual and/or urologic complaints. The
      effects of fCO2 therapy will be evaluated by various physical assessments and patient
      questionnaires.
