      of skeletal muscle to insulin in lean and obese adults. Participants will complete 4 study
      visits consisting of: 1) screening visit, 2) maximal exercise test visit, and then a
      randomized order of 3) a resting metabolic study visit, and 4) an exercise metabolic study
      visit. Metabolic study visits for resting and exercise conditions will be identical, other
      than remaining sedentary or performing exercise. Skeletal muscle biopsy samples will be
      collected during resting, immediately post-exercise and during insulin stimulated conditions.
