      is that of anxiety. Anxiety is common in PDD, but has not yet been fully characterized. The
      primary objective of this study is to conduct a preliminary placebo-controlled trial of
      mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety associated with PDDs. We hypothesize that
      mirtazapine will be safe and well tolerated.
