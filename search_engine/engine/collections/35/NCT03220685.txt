    
      From the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) there is a quantitative and qualitative
      alteration of intestinal microflora (dysbiosis); so the composition and metabolic activities
      of microflora are changed in CKD. These alterations include changes in intestinal transit,
      decreased protein absorption, decrease in dietary fibre intake, treatment with oral iron and
      frequent use of antibiotics.

      All of this contributes to systemic inflammation and the accumulation of uraemic toxins that
      are absorbed by intestine and eliminated by the kidney.

      This uraemic toxins have been associated with deleterious biological effects in different
      tissues and cell lines and with an increased risk of the progression of CKD, morbidity and
      mortality)

        -  Progression of CKD: both indoxyl sulfate(IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) are associated
           to the development of fibrosis, deterioration of renal function and disease progression
           . In vitro studies have shown a deleterious effect of these molecules on renal tubular
           cells. - Cardiovascular complications: in CKD patients, IS is associated with
           endothelial damage, arterial stiffness and aortic calcification .

        -  Anaemia: IS has been associated with anaemia of the renal patient; it interfere with the
           adequate production of erythropoietin and increased eryptosis (programmed cell death of
           red blood cells) .Polyamines are associated to anaemia in renal patients, through an
           intra-erythrocytic effect ,reduces erythropoiesis, and inhibit the activity of
           erythropoietin)

        -  Alterations of bone-mineral metabolism: IS reduces bone formation by promoting oxidative
           stress in osteoblasts and inducing resistance to PTH, which favours the development a
           dynamic bone .There is a positive correlation between FGF-23 and IS serum levels,
           suggesting an association between this molecule and metabolic bone disease in uraemic
           patients .

        -  Insulin resistance: In CKD patients the catabolism of insulin is reduced and often, they
           also have insulin resistance, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality;
           it seems that insulin resistance is related to some of the uremic toxins .
