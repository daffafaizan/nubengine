      selected for the RESPECT study. Fifteen primary care centers were invited to participate in
      this study.

      Fifteen investigators (10 from St.Petersburg and 5 from Arkhangelsk) were recruited
      (predominantly doctors and two highly educated nurses). All investigators received study
      information, including a detailed study protocol and recent guidelines on COPD, and
      participated in a three-week course on spirometry and the clinical diagnosis and management
      of obstructive lung diseases. The sample size was calculated based on two goals: 1) to
      determine a reliable estimate of the prevalence of COPD and 2) to estimate the diagnostic
      value of symptoms with an acceptable confidence interval.

      The sample size for the RESPECT study was estimated using 2828 subjects (based on an 8%
      prevalence of COPD in RF). Assuming an anticipated refusal rate of 20%, 3500 participants
      from St.Petersburg and 1500 from Arkhangelsk were invited to participate in this study.

      The analyses will include cross-sectional and prospective approaches. Prospective analyses
      will be performed on the entire cohort.
