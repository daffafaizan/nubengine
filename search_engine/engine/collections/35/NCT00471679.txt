      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of the ethanol-lock strategy (ETL) in preventing
           central venous catheter infections in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma being
           treated on clinical trial MSKCC-03077.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether this strategy increases the likelihood of remaining infection-free for
           6 months.

        -  Determine the cumulative incidence of a single positive centrally-drawn blood culture in
           these patients and compare to previously obtained historical controls.

        -  Determine the median time-to-infection of the central line, where infection is defined
           as any positive centrally-drawn (from the treated line) blood culture.

        -  Determine the cumulative incidence of central line removals in these patients and
           compare to historical controls.

        -  Collate the types of organisms among these patients who develop a positive
           centrally-drawn blood culture and compare to historical controls.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, historical control study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody 3F8 on clinical trial MSKCC-03077. In each course of
      monoclonal antibody 3F8 treatment, patients receive ethanol-lock treatment on days 0-3 (after
      each monoclonal antibody 3F8 infusion) for up to 6 months for central venous catheter
      management.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
