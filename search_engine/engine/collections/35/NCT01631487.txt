    
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled
      study (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug
      has a real effect in a clinical trial). The study consists of 2 Parts. In Part 1, three
      groups of healthy Japanese men and 3 groups of healthy Caucasian men will receive a single
      oral dose of JNJ-39439335 or placebo on Day 1. Each group will include 8 participants. The
      study duration of Part 1 for each participant is approximately 8 weeks: screening phase of up
      to 28 days prior to dose, treatment phase of 14 days, and a follow-up phase of 14 to16 days.
      In Part 2, three groups of healthy Japanese men will receive once-daily doses of either
      JNJ-39439335 or placebo for 21 days. Each group will include 12 participants. The study
      duration of Part 2 for each participant is approximately 11 weeks: screening phase of up to
      28 days prior to dose, treatment phase of 21 days, and a follow-up phase of approximately 28
      days. During the treatment phases, the participants will remain in the study unit. Blood
      samples and urine will be collected for drug concentration measurements and laboratory safety
      assessments.
