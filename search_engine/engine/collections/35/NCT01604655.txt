      patients admitted with with chest pain. Very little is known about which test provides the
      best information to physicians, positively impacts patients medical care, and decreases
      future hospital admissions and testing. To study this the investigators are randomizing
      patients admitted to our hospital with chest pain to a stress test or coronary CT
      angiography. The investigators will then follow these patients for a 2 year period.
