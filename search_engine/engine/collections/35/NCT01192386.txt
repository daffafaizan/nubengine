    
      The study consists of a single visit at which patients fill in a questionnaire on actual
      hayfever and asthma symptoms as well as current treatment. Blood samples and nasal lavages
      are drawn and analysed for eosinophils as well as eosinophil cationic protein and tryptase.
      Spirometry is performed.

      If patients use drugs which can interfere with results, ie. corticosteroids or beta-agonists,
      biochemistry and/or spirometry are omitted.
