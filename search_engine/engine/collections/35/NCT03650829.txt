      drugs used on women and health of IVF offspring have always been concerned in the
      reproductive field and in public. With the increase of the prevalence of infertility and
      development of ART, China is facing a IVF babies boom. It has been reported that ART was
      associated with higher risk of cancers among women undergoing treatment of ART, and an
      increased incidence of autism and noncommunicable chronic diseases, such as obesity, among
      IVF offspring. Epigenetics is documented as one of the possible mechanisms, while answers
      remain to be explored. A birth cohort would provide an opportunity to examine the short- and
      long-term effects of ART exposure on health consequences of the mothers and babies.
