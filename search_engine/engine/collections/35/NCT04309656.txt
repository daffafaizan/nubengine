    
      This is a single-dose, open-label, randomized, four-period, four-treatment, crossover study
      in healthy adult subjects. Each panel of 24 subjects will be randomized according to the same
      4-sequence, 4- period Williams design, in which each participant will receive four
      single-dose treatments. Subjects in Panel 1 will receive all treatments after consuming an
      FDA standard high-fat, high-calorie breakfast following an overnight fast of at least 10
      hours. Subjects in Panel 2 will receive all treatments directly following an overnight fast
      of at least 10 hours. The two panels will be investigated concurrently.
