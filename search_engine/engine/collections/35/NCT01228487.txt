      cartilage destruction. This is due to the long time clinically silent progress of the
      disease. A biomarker screening profile for joint damage is a valuable tool for the detection
      of over use and joint damaging conditions especially in competitive sports. This would
      provide a method for OA risk assessment for the patient before clinical symptoms occur. For
      this the first step is the identification of biological substances reflecting pathologic
      changes in the joint.

      Since preterm chondrocyte senescence, apoptosis and ageing related changes are key factors in
      OA pathophysiology and each of these factors is closely related to oxidative dysbalance the
      measurement of these factors and correlation with the amount of joint damage is promising.
