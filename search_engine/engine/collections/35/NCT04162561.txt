    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of therapy in patients having come for the
      first time consultation to the specialized cardiology department of the scientific research
      centre within the PROFILE registry and to try to correct therapy according to current
      clinical guidelines paying particular attention to reaching target blood pressure (BP),
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glycosylated haemoglobin - HbA1c (in patients
      with diabetes mellitus) levels, improving exercise tolerance and quality of life.

      The first visit (V0) is an inclusion in the study. During this visit, an attempt to correct
      or start (if it had not been started before) antiplatelet, hypolipidemic, antihypertensive
      and antianginal therapy will be made.

      The second visit (V1) is planned for each patient three months after the first visit (V0).
      During the second visit number of patients who reached target levels of BP, LDL-C, frequency
      of angina attacks will be assessed. If necessary, correction of therapy will also be made.

      The third visit (V2) is planned for each patient one year after the first visit (V0). During
      the third visit reaching target BP, LDL-C levels, frequency of angina attacks will be
      assessed. If necessary, therapy correction will be recommended.

      The last visit - telephone contact with patients - is expected in 2 years after the first
      visit. During that visit it is planned to assess life status, complications and current
      medical treatment.
