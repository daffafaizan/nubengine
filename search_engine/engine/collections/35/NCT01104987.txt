      0.5-1.0%. Men are more commonly affected by the disease as compared to women, ratio 2.6-4:1.
      Pain in the back is a frequent symptom of debut. This pain is often associated with
      sacroilitis. In later stages also the lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine are hit by the
      disease. Peripheral joints, eyes, heart, lungs and urinary tract may also be influenced.

      The risk of osteoporosis is increased in AS. However, this field has not yet been
      significantly studied probably due to several reasons such as the predominance of men with
      the disease and men are more seldom investigated for osteoporosis compared to women. When AS
      progresses syndesmophytes of the spine are developed which makes it difficult to assess bone
      mineral density (BMD) correctly with the conventional method, dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA). Fractures in the spine are easy to foreseen since the pain of the
      patient might be misjudged to be related to increased disease activity. Fractures are also
      overlooked in radiographs in AS. AS is associated with both increased bone formation and
      increased bone resorption. The bone remodeling process in the spine renders the spine less
      flexible and stiffer and as a consequence also a quite small trauma may result in a fracture.
      These fractures are often instable risking injuring the spinal cord and nerves.

      Treatment with bisphosphonates in AS have indicated an anti-inflammatory effect. The effects
      of treatment with bisphosphonate on BMD assessed by DXA, QCT and Xtreme CT in AS has not yet
      been fully investigated.
