      inserted. Following this, a tracheal tube is mounted on a fiberoptic scope with the tip of
      the scope behind the tip of the tube. This way, the tracheal tube is not guided by the scope,
      but the scope visualizes the course of the tracheal tube in the laryngeal mask and the
      glottic opening as if the tracheal tube was advanced blindly: Visualized blind intubation
