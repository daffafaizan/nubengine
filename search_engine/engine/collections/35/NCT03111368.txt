      aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic mass using two different techniques of needle suction.
      Negative pressure and slow-pull. 50 patients with pancreatic mass will be submitted to four
      passes with both techniques. Each patient will be randomized to decide which technique will
      be first and subsequently on a alternated fashion until four passes are completed. Smear
      cytology and cell block preparations for each technique were obtained. The pathologist was
      blinded for the EUS-FNA technique.
