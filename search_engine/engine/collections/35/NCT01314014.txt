    
      A phase II exploratory trial of imexon in lymphoma is justified by: (1) the observation of
      clinical activity (partial response to the drug observed in phase I testing in a subject with
      refractory indolent lymphoma); (2) the finding that imexon prevents the development of human
      immunoblastic lymphoma in SCID mice; (3) the finding that lymphoma cell lines are killed by
      readily achievable doses; and (4) translational studies implicating the importance of the
      redox state of the cancer cell.

      The dose and schedule chosen (1000 mg/m2 daily X 5 days every 3 weeks) is based on
      tolerability and subject acceptance in prior AmpliMed phase I studies.

      The planned correlative studies should help to identify potential biomarkers for response to
      imexon and provide further insight into potential mechanisms of imexon action hypothesized
      from results of prior laboratory studies.
