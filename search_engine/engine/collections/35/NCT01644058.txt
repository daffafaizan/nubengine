      of complete denture. Then, following standard procedures, 3 threaded implants (OsseoSpeed
      TXTM, Dentsply Implants, MÃ¶lndal, Sweden) were placed in the mandible in each patient, and
      locator abutments (Zest Anchors LLC, Escondido, U.S.A.) were inserted on the right and left
      side implants. The midline implant served as a control for within-patient comparison. The
      immediate loading was conducted within 24 h of surgery. Data were collected at baseline (T0),
      12 (T1) and 24 (T2) months after immediate loading. The clinical outcomes included implant
      survival rate, crestal bone level changes and implant stability. These criteria were assessed
      through clinical and radiographic examinations as well as resonance frequency analysis.
      Patient-centered outcomes included patient satisfaction and oral health-related quality of
      life measured using validated questionnaires. Brunner-Langer approach was used for
      statistical analysis.
