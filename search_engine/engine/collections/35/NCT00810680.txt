      Though various drugs such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites such as fludarabine and
      targeted antibodies such as rituximab are effective against this condition, relapses are
      frequent and cure is rare. There exists a subset of CLL patients who are refractory to many
      of these first line agents. Though one or the other of the above mentioned class of drugs can
      be substituted for patients who have relapsed or have refractory disease, no therapy has been
      conclusively proven to have survival advantage in this condition. The costs and toxicities
      add to the burden of these therapies. Valproic acid is a well studied drug used for the
      treatment of epilepsy for over 30 years. It has a well documented side effect profile, is
      generally well tolerated and is inexpensive. Recently, it has been shown to be an inhibitor
      of the enzyme, Histone de-acetylase(HDAC). Inhibition of HDAC promotes apoptosis, and could
      lead to the death of CLL cells which harbor defective apoptotic mechanisms. In vitro studies
      have proven the ability of therapeutic concentrations of Valproic acid to achieve cell kill
      in cultures of CLL cells. This study aims to identify whether valproic acid, used in standard
      doses has single agent activity against CLL and to assess its tolerance in these patients.
