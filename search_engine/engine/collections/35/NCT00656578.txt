      conducted in the US. A dose of 4975 will be evaluated against placebo in patients undergoing
      bunionectomy. Upon enrollment, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      4975 or placebo.

      After the surgery, patients will be admitted to the clinical study site, where trained study
      personnel will monitor them for up to 48 hours. While at the clinical study site, patients
      will undergo safety and efficacy assessments. After discharge, patients will report pain
      severity daily through Day 14 via an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Also, safety
      and patient-reported outcome assessments will be performed at the Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 28
      (Week 4) clinic visits.
