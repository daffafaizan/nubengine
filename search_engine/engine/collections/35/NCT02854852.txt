      photoplethysmography to diagnose changes in the vascular resistance during anesthesia. The
      investigators will studied 50 mechanically ventilated patients undergoing general anesthesia.
      Photoplethysmography will be continuously recorded in the right thumb during anesthesia.
      Duplex color and power Doppler will measure flow in the radial artery of the right hand.The
      contour analysis of both, photoplethysmogram and radial artery flow will be analyzed,
      correlated and compared using the Bland-Altman plot.
