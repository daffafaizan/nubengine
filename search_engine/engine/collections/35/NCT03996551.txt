      two transplant sites in London. Participants will be randomized to either the 12-week kidney
      transplant specific novel online weight gain prevention resource (n=25) or usual care (n=25).
      All participants will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 12 months. The primary outcome of
      this study is feasibility (screening, recruitment, randomization, retention, adherence to the
      intervention and adherence to the study visits). The research team will also assess the
      ability to collect measures for a definitive study (body weight, body mass index, body
      composition, quality of life, self-efficacy, fatigue, arterial stiffness and physical
      function).

      A nested qualitative study will capture participant experience at two time points during this
      12 month trial. At 3 months semi-structured individual interviews will be conducted in a
      purposive approximately 6 to 10 of the intervention participants until data saturation is
      achieved. These interviews will assess the experience of using the online intervention. At 6
      months a purposive sample of approximately 16 participants from both groups will complete
      individual semi-structured interviews to assess the experiences of participating in this
      trial.
