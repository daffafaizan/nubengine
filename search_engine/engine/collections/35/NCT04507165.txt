    
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lung resection is traditionally performed under
      general anesthesia with opioid-based analgesia. It is associated with higher incidences of
      respiratory depression, hypotension, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), dizziness,
      constipation and urinary retention, and more severe acute postoperative pain.

      The purpose of our study is to compare the opioid-free general anesthesia with the
      opioid-based general anesthesia with respect to the primary outcome measures of the total
      incidence of opioid-related adverse effects (including respiratory depression, hypotension,
      PONV and dizziness) and secondary outcome measures of incidence of intraoperative and
      postoperative cardiovascular complications, pain relief, analgesic requirement , and other
      postoperative recovery parameters [e.g. duration of tracheal extubation, departing from
      post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), exhaust, defecation, and stay in hospital
      postoperatively].
