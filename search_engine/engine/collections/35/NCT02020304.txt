      their labor pain; however, they will be randomized to receive either a dose maintained at
      room temperature (60-75 degrees F) or one maintained in a refrigerator (~<43 degrees F).
      Duration of action will be done by assessments of pain, vital signs, nausea, itching, bromage
      and fetal heart rate every 15 minutes until the subject requests additional pain medication
      to treat their labor pain.
