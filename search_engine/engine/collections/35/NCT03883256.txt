      recruited from outpatient department. After signing informed consent form, patients undertake
      an incremental exercise test and two constant load exercise at the 70% of maximum workload
      achieved at a previous incremental exercise test on arm ergometer in two separate days. The
      constant load tests will be performed with HFNC and with nasal cannula at the same inhaled
      oxygen fraction in random order. The hemodynamics CO, SV, EF of all subjects during exercises
      will be measured by a bioelectrical impedance device (Physioflow), and cerebral oxygenation
      status (oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb)
      was measured by a near infrared spectrophotometer (NIRS).
