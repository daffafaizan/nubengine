    
      All patients will receive standard supportive care based on current established management
      practice of cardio-thoracic patients. The only difference in treatment will be the
      randomisation of patients to receive/not receive protocolised administration of frusemide
      targeting a urine output.

      There will be 2 groups of patients. The control group-which will receive frusemide bolus
      doses if required as determined by the surgeon/consultant physician. The frusemide infusion
      group-which will be monitored to achieve a trial specified hourly urine output target range
      of 1-2mls/kg/hour. In order to achieve this target the patient may need to receive a loading
      dose of frusemide and may also then require a frusemide infusion. The aim will be to maintain
      the urine output within the target range for the first 48 hours after cardiac surgery.
