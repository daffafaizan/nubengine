      visualization of intestinal mucosa under colonoscopy. Some studies have shown that bowel
      preparation must be customized according to the age, weight and clinical status of the child.
      However, there is no internationally recognized standard scheme for pediatric intestinal
      reserve. In pediatric clinical trials, polyethylene glycol with electrolyte solution
      (PEG-ELS) is more effective than bisacodyl, folium sennae and magnesium citrate. PEG-ELS is
      an electrolyte balanced isotonic solution, which can be used to clean the intestinal tract by
      large volume irrigation. Polyethylene glycol 4000 is a long-chain linear polymer, which can
      hardly absorb and decompose after oral administration. It can effectively increase the
      composition of intestinal fluid, stimulate intestinal peristalsis, cause watery diarrhea, and
      achieve the purpose of cleaning the intestine. The inorganic salt composition and proper
      amount of water in the formula ensure the balance of water and electrolyte exchange between
      intestinal tract and body fluid. In this study, PEG-ELS short protocol and long protocol were
      selected for intestinal preparation, and the effectiveness and safety of different intestinal
      preparation protocols under electronic colonoscopy for children over 2 years old were
      compared.
