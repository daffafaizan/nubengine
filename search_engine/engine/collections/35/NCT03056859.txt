      observational trial will be prepared as usual for central venous catheter (CVC) placement.
      The Compass pressure measurement device will be included in the CVC placement apparatus as
      per the manufacturer's directions. Data will be recorded on the placement procedure, operator
      satisfaction, routine patient demographics, and incidence of inadvertent arterial puncture.
