    
      A two-phase multi-center study with an open label 8-week induction phase and a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled maintenance phase to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      HMPL-004 for a 52-week maintenance therapy in adults with mild to moderate UC and who have
      demonstrated a sub-optimal response to mesalamine treatment. The study participants will
      consist of subjects who have completed either the HMPL-004-03 or HMPL-004-05 induction study,
      complemented by the enrollment of additional subjects in the open label induction phase who
      meet the entry criteria of this study. . Subjects entering this maintenance study from one of
      the HMPL-004 induction studies will have their modified Mayo baseline score from that study
      as their baseline score for this study. All subjects enrolled in the open label induction
      phase of the study will be re-evaluated for clinical response and remission after the 8-week
      open label 2400 mg HMPL-004 treatment period. Clinical responders and remitters will be
      randomized 2:1 (HMPL-004: placebo) to HMPL-004 1800 mg/day or placebo group for the 52-week
      maintenance phase of the study.
