    
      One of the major complications in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is marked bone loss
      because it greatly predisposes to skeletal fractures, even after minimal trauma. The use of
      low magnitude mechanical stimulation has been shown to be both safe and effective in
      improving bone mass and strength in animal studies. This modality has also been shown a
      beneficial effect in children with disability and in postmenopausal women. The investigators
      are interested in obtaining data to determine the possible benefits that mechanical
      intervention with vibratory stimulation may have on bone in individuals with subacute SCI
      (e.g., >1 month after injury but <1 year). Changes in bone density and mass of the leg and
      arm will be determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); bone architecture of the
      distal leg and distal arm will be determined by peripheral quantitative computed tomography;
      circulating metabolic markers of bone will also be performed.

      OBJECTIVES

      In persons with subacute spinal cord injury:

        1. To determine differences in bone mineral mass and parameters of bone structural
           integrity of the stimulated tibia versus the unstimulated tibia.

        2. To determine changes in the metabolic markers of bone resorption and formation in
           persons with subacute spinal cord injury.
