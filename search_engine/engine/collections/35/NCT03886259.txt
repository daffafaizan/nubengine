      population, and the knee joint is one of the joints most commonly affected.

      End-stage osteoarthritis is often treated with knee replacement, and total knee arthroplasty
      is considered an effective treatment for pain relief and improved function. However, several
      studies have reported less favorable outcomes after total knee arthroplasty, and systematic
      reviews found chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty at 12 months post-operative in
      13-17% of the patients and chronic pain rates at 2-7 years post-operative varying between
      8-27%. No randomized controlled trials evaluating exercise and pain education treatments to
      patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty exists, and this highlights the need
      for evidence-based knowledge of which treatment should be considered for this population.
