    
      This pilot study is a single-center, two-arm randomized study that by design is unblinded.
      200 total participants are planned. Each participant will be randomized in an unblocked
      manner to receive "usual care" or the ECA/KAC intervention. Participants will have study
      visits at baseline and time 30 days. Adherence to using the ECA/KAC in combination over 30
      days will be quantified. Following participation study participants randomized to the ECA/KAC
      intervention will undergo an interview to determine their experience with the ECA/KAC.
      Participants and their physicians will receive a summary of ECA use and symptoms and
      correlated findings by KAC.
