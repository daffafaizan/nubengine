      stenting procedure. Yet, this therapy is underutilized across the nation. Henry Ford
      currently enrolls about 42% of eligible patients. In addition, it currently takes, on
      average, 42 +/-26 days from hospital discharge to enrollment in rehabilitation. During this
      delay, there is strong tendency to return to prior habits (sedentary lifestyle, smoking, poor
      nutrition, etc.) that led to the myocardial infarction in the first place. This delay is both
      1) unnecessary and 2) probably harmful to the patients' readiness to make changes.

      The investigators seek to perform a randomized controlled trial of early (7-10 days) vs
      standard referral (5-6 weeks) to cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the investigators will
      examine the patients' readiness to change through the first 3 months of the
      post-hospitalization period and correlate that to their behavior and enrollment in cardiac
      rehabilitation. Assessment of readiness to change will be accomplished by serial survey's,
      which will be administered at discharge, 2 weeks, 5 weeks, and 13 weeks after discharge.

      Patients will consent to take the survey and be observed in a clinical study. However, in
      order to avoid the Hawthorne Effect, patients they will not initially be aware of the primary
      hypothesis, as the investigators strongly believe this will affect the main behavior they are
      trying to measure. Full patient disclosure will occur at the end of the trial.
