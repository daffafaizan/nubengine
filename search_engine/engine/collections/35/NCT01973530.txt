    
      A total of 80 patients who will undergo total knee arthroplasty will be randomized into two
      groups:

      Treatment groups Treatment details Femoral Group (40 patients) Continuous femoral nerve block
      (bolus: 0.5% Ropivacaine 10-15 ml ; infusion of 0.15 % Ropivacaine 4-6ml/h) Adductor Group
      (40 patients) Adductor canal block with steroid adjuvant (bolus: 0.5% Ropivacaine 10-15ml;
      Dexamethasone 4mg) (Total 80 patients will be recruited)

        -  All patients will receive single shot tibial nerve block with local anaesthetics (0.5%
           Ropivacaine 5-8ml) before surgery for analgesia of posterior knee.

        -  All patients will receive the same preemptive and postoperative multimodal medications
           for perioperative analgesia.
