      lenalidomide and with a similar toxicity spectrum. Phase I trials have shown that
      pomalidomide 1 to 5 mg is well-tolerated1,2.

      TT3 has been remarkably successful in the management of newly diagnosed MM, inducing CR rates
      of >60% and 4-year estimates of overall and event-free survival of 85% and 75%. Of those
      achieving CR, estimated 4-year CR rate is 85%. TT3 maintenance has been with either VTD in
      2003-33 or VRD in 2006-66, so that pomalidomide's role in overcoming refractoriness to
      lenalidomide can be assessed.

      Pharmacogenomic investigations comparing GEP data obtained at baseline and 48hr
      post-treatment have been performed in case of thalidomide, dexamethasone, lenalidomide,
      bortezomib and melphalan3. Thus, as most patients on TT3 had baseline and 48-hr GEP
      investigations performed after bortezomib, the opportunity exists to investigate, at the time
      of relapse, not only a re-challenge with bortezomib with 48hr GEP but also pomalidomide's
      effect.

      This is a phase II study, open-label, single institution trial of pomalidomide in
      GEP-defined, high-risk relapsing/refractory multiple myeloma. Prior therapy must have
      included lenalidomide.
