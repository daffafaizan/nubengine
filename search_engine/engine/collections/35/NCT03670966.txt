      BC8-B10.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive astatine At 211 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8-B10
      infusion over 6-8 hours on day -8, fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6
      to -2, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5. Patients also undergo TBI on
      day -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow transplant on
      day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3-4,
      mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO three times daily (TID) on days 5-35, and tacrolimus IV over
      1-2 hours (changed to PO once tolerated) on days 5-180 with taper beginning on day 84 per
      physician discretion. Patients also begin granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) IV or
      subcutaneously (SC) on day 5 to continue until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1000/mm^3 x
      3 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 100, and at 6, 9, 12,
      18, and 24 months.
