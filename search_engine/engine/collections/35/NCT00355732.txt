      (ICU) for the duration of 2 years. A total of 136 COPD patients who required mechanical
      ventilation longer than 24 h fulfilled the inclusion criteria and they present the research
      sample. After fulfilling the criteria for weaning, patients were randomized to a 2-h
      spontaneous breathing trial with either T-tube or pressure support ventilation (PSV). The
      patients with successful 2-h trial were extubated and were excluded from further research.
      Patients with 2-h trial failure were defined as difficult to wean, they had mechanical
      ventilation reinstated and the same weaning procedure was repeated after 24 h, if the patient
      again fulfilled the weaning criteria. In these patients, two methods of weaning were compared
      according to the patients clinical characteristics, objective parameters and procedure
      outcome.

      31 (47%) patient with T-tube and 32 (46%) patients with PSV had 2-h trial failure. Of those
      patients, successful extubation was in 17 (56%) patients with T-tube and in 23 (72%) with PSV
      (P <0.001), whereas extubation failure was in 14 (44%) patients with T-tube and in 9 (28%)
      patients with PSV (P <0.001). Mechanical ventilation duration was 186.7 h with T-tube and
      163.2 h with PSV (P <0.001), time spent in ICU was 240.7 h with T-tube and 210.2 h with PSV
      (P <0.001).

      In patients with COPD who failed the 2-h spontaneous breathing trial, based on parameters of
      procedure outcome, high advantage of PSV method was confirmed.
