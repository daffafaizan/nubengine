      In computer guided Implantology, are surgical stents designed from scan of dental model by
      CBCT and from digital impression as accurate as surgical stents designed from desktop
      scanner?

      Statement of the problem:

      The role digital dentistry is improved in computer guided implantology especially with
      development of computer guided implant software, desktop scanner and intra oral scanner
      development and CBCT machines.

      Intra-oral scanner, desktop scanner and CBCT scanner can be used in creation of 3D digital
      model that can be used with computer guided implant in fabrication of the surgical stent.

      And the question, is the accuracy of surgical guide will be affected when designed by one of
      these different modalities?

      Rationale for conducting the research:

      Digital 3D dentoginival details are very important in computer guided implantology and
      designing of surgical stent.nowadays there are many methods to obtain this soft tissue
      replica as CBCT,desktop scanner and intra oral scanner.this study is conducted to asses the
      effect of different method of soft tissue digitization on the accuracy of surgical template
      used in computer guided implantology.
