      present study. Enrolled patients were examined and characterized for clinical and blood
      samples analysis, and salivary IL-6 levels. The Spearman Correlation Test and
      Jonckheere-Terpstra Test were applied in order to assess the interdependence between salivary
      IL-6 levels and clinical periodontal parameters.
