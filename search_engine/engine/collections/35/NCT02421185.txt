    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (when
      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), 2 parts
      (First, dose escalation Phase and second, dose expansion Phase) study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical responses of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in
      Asian participants with advanced HCC. The duration of study will be approximately 11 months
      per participant. The study consists of 2 periods: Screening (28 days before study commences
      on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (dose escalation portion of the trial [Part 1]), participants
      are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in 28 day
      treatment cycles. Part 2, the cohort expansion part of the trial, will further explore the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) as determined in Part 1; and
      follow-up Phase (up to 6 months). Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and predictive biomarkers at pre-dose and post-dose of
      study treatment. Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) will be
      evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
