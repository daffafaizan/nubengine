    
      A total of 40 patients who have had ALIF surgery will be invited to have an ultrasound scan
      of their kidney on the side where the operation was performed (where the scar is). Should
      hydronephrosis of this kidney be detected, the investigators will go on to scan the second
      kidney. Should hydronephrosis be detected the patient will be given a letter to take to their
      General Practitioner (GP) advising them to be referred to a Urologist.
