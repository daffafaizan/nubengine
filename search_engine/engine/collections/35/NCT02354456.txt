    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of preventable stroke and strongly
      associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with a prevalence of 1-2% in
      general population.The first multicenter trial in AF patients in our country, Atrial
      Fibrillation in Turkey: Epidemiologic Registry (AFTER) study, showed that 40% of non-valvular
      AF patients were on warfarin therapy with an effective INR rate of 37% and the most frequent
      cause of warfarin underuse was physician neglect. Yet, the use of new oral anticoagulants,
      time in therapeutic INR range (TTR) in warfarin users and the main management modality
      (rhythm or rate control) in AF patients have not been studied in Turkey. Therefore, in this
      multicenter trial, we aimed to assess the extent of effective anticoagulant use (by means of
      TTR) and epidemiological characteristics of the nonvalvular AF patients with the use of new
      oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in clinical practice in addition to increased awareness provided
      by AFTER study.

      AFTER-2 study is planned as a prospective, observational and multicenter study with a 6 month
      and 1-year follow-up of the patients. A total of 4100 patients in 42 centers reflecting the
      population of the twelve regions of our country according to the Nomenclature of Territorial
      Units for Statistics will be included in the study.

      The detailed characteristics of the patients with non-valvular AF, the rates and kind of oral
      anticoagulant use, the effect of increased awareness and NOACs on anticoagulant use rate, TTR
      in warfarin using patients and the bleeding risks of the patients will be determined in this
      study. At the end of the study, we will question the patients in terms of major adverse
      events and analyze the independent predictors of these events.
