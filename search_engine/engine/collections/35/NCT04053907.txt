      implementing community-based clinical case management (CCM) (year 1). In this year, the
      investigators will quantify gametocyte carriage and transmission from clinical cases
      passively recruited by CCM, and gametocyte carriage and transmission from asymptomatic
      infections detected in community surveys. These data will support the interpretation of the
      main study outcomes in year 2 when the investigators will directly compare the effect of CCM
      on the human reservoir of infection as compared to three different approaches, namely i)
      active fever screening and treatment that should detect symptomatic infections for early
      treatment; ii) Mass Screening and Treatment (MSAT) that will systematically screen, using
      point-of-care diagnostics, the whole population, with infected individuals immediately
      treated; and iii) mass drug administration (MDA) that will treat the whole population with a
      full course of an antimalarial treatment.
