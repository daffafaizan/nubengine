      specifically to the extracellular domain of EGFR. It is composed of the Fv regions of a
      murine anti-EGFR antibody with human IgG1 heavy and k light chain constant regions and it is
      expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells. It has the same amino acid sequence as cetuximab
      (C225, ErbituxÂ®) , but it has slightly different abilities for glycosylation and other
      post-translational modifications, and it is developed by Shanghai Zhangjiang Biotechnology
      Limited Company and produced by Biomabs. Phase I study results suggest that CMAB009 showed
      well-tolerated safety profile and primary efficacy. This multicenter, open-label study was to
      determine whether adding CMAB009 to irinotecan increased the response rate and prolongs
      survival in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously
      treated with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin.
