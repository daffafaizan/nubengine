      invasive fungal infections in transplantation patients.

      Invasive fungal infections (IFI) ---organ-related or systemic infections--- are in fact one
      of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing solid organ
      transplantation (respectively, 70% and 100%).

      The rationale of the proposed study is to evaluate a new protocol for the prevention of IFIs
      through the use of a newly introduced anti-fungal, caspofungin (commercial name: Cancidas),
      to be used for primary prophylaxis of fungal infections post-OLTx and to compare to drugs
      already in use (eg. amphotericin B, fluconazole), until 21 days after liver transplantation.

      The aim of this study is determine viable use of caspofungin in post-OLTx patients, and to
      demonstrate in particular the effectiveness, understood as the ability to reduce the
      incidence of invasive fungal infections, and to assess the ability to reduce the risk and
      incidence of side effects (toxicity) which may arise in transplant patients treated with
      other drugs, especially in individuals recognized as high risk (e.g. renal failure).

      The possibility of reducing the risk of fungal infections in liver transplant patients
      (usually between 7 and 42%) is therefore an important clinical goal.
