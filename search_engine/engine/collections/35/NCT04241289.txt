      on patients and health care resources. Covert (sub-clinical) strokes are associated with
      these complications. The investigators conducted a prospective cohort pilot study enrolling
      consecutive cardiac surgery patients to receive a post-operative brain MRI and a series of
      questionnaires to assess for changes in cognition, physical function and delirium. Regional
      cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was recorded during surgery with the use of near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors placed on the patients' forehead. The primary aim was to
      determine the feasibility of conducting a larger study to establish an association between
      covert stroke and long-term cognitive decline in cardiac surgery patients.
