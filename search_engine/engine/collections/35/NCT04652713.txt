    
      This study is a single-blind randomized Cross-Over trial with 30 women aged 18-30 years, each
      completing three trials. Participants will consume either dairy-based protein-rich breakfast,
      isocaloric, fiber matched, fat matched, carbohydrate-rich breakfast or no breakfast in
      randomized order. Three hours later a standardized ad libitum lunch will be served.

      Blood samples will be collected (pre, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 175 min after
      breakfast) and VAS rating hunger, satiety and desire to eat will be determined (pre, during
      breakfast, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min, during lunch, after lunch). Twenty-four hour food
      logs on the day before the test day and on the test day will be collected.

      Participants will be characterized by determining height (cm), weight (kg), and body
      composition by a dual-energy X-ray (DXA) scan before the first test day.
