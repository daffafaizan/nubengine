      inserts. Present technology uses microscopic cytogenetics for detection of large
      rearrangements (greater than 2 Mb) and molecular techniques for small rearrangements (less
      than 2 Mb). There is a gap in practical diagnostic technology in that microscopic
      cytogenetics has poor sensitivity for aberrations less than 5 Mb and the molecular techniques
      are cumbersome for clinical use in the megabase range. In many cases it is possible to
      determine that an aberration is present by microscopic cytogenetics but cannot be
      characterized. We propose to use Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and supplementary FISH and
      molecular techniques to characterize these aberrations. Subjects will be seen in OP9 for a
      clinical genetics evaluation and phlebotomy for SKY. Confirmation of SKY results will be
      performed by standard FISH, genomic content mapping, and other standard techniques.
