      November 2011 at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira in Recife,
      Pernambuco, Brazil. A total of 179 women were randomly allocated to two groups: 86 to use 400
      Âµg of misoprostol vaginally four hours prior to IUD insertion and 93 to use placebo. Risk
      ratios (RR) were calculated as measures of relative risk, together with their 95% confidence
      intervals (95%CI). The number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) were
      also calculated.
