      done. The experimental device and the active comparator will be compared regarding Sound
      Quality perception and speech intelligibility in Quiet and in Noise. The experimental device
      contains direct connectivity functionality which will be investigated in terms of streamed
      Audio quality, streaming stability and Usability preferences of functions and Features which
      are related to direct connectivity. The active comparator device does not contain direct
      streaming functionality. This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono
      centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based in St√§fa (Switzerland).
