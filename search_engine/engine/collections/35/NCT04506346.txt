      unexpected difficult tracheal intubation is not rare. Difficult airway is a significant
      problem to these patients and the physicans in terms of mortality and morbidity.

      This study collects risk factors as physical examinations（including modified Mallampati
      grade, neck circumference, lateral clinical craniofacial assessment and body mass index
      ,BMI）, Stopbang scores, polysommographic parameters (including apnea-hypopnea index, AHI and
      lowest SpO2, LSpO2), and special radiographic parameters in head and neck region. By using
      statistics method, predictive model to manage risks would be established.
