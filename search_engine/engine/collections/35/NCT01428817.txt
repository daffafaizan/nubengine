      intravenous bolus dose of carbetocin following Cesarean delivery.

      Studies thus far show that carbetocin may be just as effective as oxytocin in promoting
      uterine contraction, with a similar side effect profile. In addition, patients receiving
      carbetocin may experience less blood loss, and require less additional uterotonics when
      compared with oxytocin. A dose response study conducted by Cordovani et al suggested no
      difference in efficacy of uterine contraction for doses of carbetocin between 80-120mcg.
      Additionally, hypotension was noted for all dose groups studied.

      The results of this follow-up study will define the minimum required dose of carbetocin for
      uterine contraction, thus minimizing unnecessary side effects, improving quality and safety
      of patient care. It may also contribute in establishing carbetocin as a substitute to
      oxytocin for elective cesarean section at our institution as well as others.
