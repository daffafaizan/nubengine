      of disease were obtained by reviewing the clinical records of patients. Serum sampling and
      colonoscopy were performed within 30 days.Disease Activity. The disease activity of UC and CD
      patients was evaluated by the Mayo endoscopy score and Crohn disease activity index (CDAI),
      respectively. The Mayo endoscopy score was evaluated. UC patients whose Mayo endoscopy score
      was 2 or 3 were divided into the active UC group.

      CD patients whose CDAI >150 were divided into the active CD group.
