      reported to be in the range of 2.7 to 4%. Among patients in coma, up to 9% harbored an EDH
      requiring craniotomy. The mortality in patients in all age groups and GCS scores undergoing
      surgery for evacuation of EDH is approximately 10%. The decision to operate on an acute EDH
      (AEDH) is usually based on the patient's GCS score, age, pupillary abnormalities,
      comorbidities, CT findings, associated intracranial lesions, in delayed decisions, the time
      between neurological deterioration and surgery, and intracranial pressure. An AEDH greater
      than 30 ml should be surgically evacuated regardless of the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale
      (GCS) score. There are insufficient data to support one surgical treatment method. However,
      craniotomy provides a more complete evacuation of the hematoma for patients with an AEDH that
      require an operation to remove the clot. But whether decompressive craniectomy (DC) should be
      employed still has considerable controversy. The choice of operative technique is influenced
      by the surgeon's expertise, training, and evaluation of a particular situation. The
      difference between these two procedures is that a bone flap is left out before closing the
      skin in DC. Both approaches are widely used among neurological surgeons (although the
      indications may differ), therefore there is sufficient experience in the centers to set up a
      randomized clinical trial.
