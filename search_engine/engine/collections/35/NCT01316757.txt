      I. To determine the objective response rate when erlotinib is added to combination
      carboplatin/paclitaxel/cetuximab systemic therapy in metastatic/recurrent head and neck
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Secondary endpoints will be toxicity, overall survival, and laboratory correlates to
      determine if epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is more effectively inhibited
      after the addition of erlotinib than it is after chemotherapy/cetuximab without erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive
      erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
