      antiproliferative activity.

      The mechanism of action of Everolimus is distinct from that of calcineurin inhibitors.

      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the major cause of late death in cardiac transplant
      patients.

      The different mechanisms of action of Everolimus and cyclosporine suppress immune function in
      synergistic manner. Thus it is postulated that the use of Everolimus in combination with
      cyclosporine permits a significant cyclosporine dose reduction without loss of
      immunosuppressive activity in the clinical setting.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the evolution of renal function after initiation
      of Everolimus and minimalisation of CNI dose.
