      affecting 3% of the population. AF is associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and large
      costs for society. In a considerable proportion of patients, AF symptoms (e.g., palpitations,
      fatigue, and chest pain) are not alleviated by current medical or interventional treatments.
      Psychological factors can worsen AF symptoms, and anxiety and depression are common among AF
      patients. Symptom preoccupation and avoidance of social and physical activities are likely to
      play important roles in the development of anxiety, depression, disability and healthcare
      utilization.

      The aim is to evaluate if CBT, based on behavioral activation and exposure principles,
      improves wellbeing and QoL in symptomatic AF patients more than a wait list offered treatment
      as usual.

      Method: A randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomized to internet-delivered CBT
      for 10 weeks (N=60) or to treatment as usual (N=60). The internet-delivered CBT-program will
      last for 10 weeks and include weekly therapist support, consisting of online messages and
      telephone calls. Patients on the treatment as usual wait list will be provided standardized
      written information about basic self-management in AF. The treatment as usual wait list will
      be crossed over to treatment 3 months after the treatment group has completed treatment.
