      is highly subjective, even if clinicians were to use validated questionairres. Currently,
      there are no studies that use a validated objective functional outcome measure to practically
      and efficiently assess lumbar MBB success prior to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The
      addition of a validated objective measure of functional impairment to the current standard of
      care may help us improve in identifying the patients that will benefit from lumbar RFA. It
      has the potential to minimize procedures of limited benefit with a significant impact on
      containing healthcare spending. Additionally, it may further knowledge on how to
      appropriately select patients without relying on the stringent double block diagnostic
      technique put forth by the CMS that may exclude patients who could greatly benefit from a
      lumbar RFA.

      As the objective measure the study will use a lumber motion monitor (LMM). The LMM weighs
      less than 5 pounds and fits on with a shoulder harness and belt. The LMM measures motion in
      all three directions (forward back, side to side, and twisting) just like the spine. The LMM
      testing may take up to 30 minutes depending on how many tasks can be performed by the
      participant and how many practice trials are required. The LMM testing includes bending
      forward and back to upright as fast as possible; comfortably while maintaining a twist
      position.
