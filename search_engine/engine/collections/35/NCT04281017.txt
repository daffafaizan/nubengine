    
      During the day of surgery, the anesthesiologist trained by an ophthalmologist, will measure
      each eye's Intraocular Pressure (IOP) using a tonometer for both the Trendelenburg with IV
      anesthetics (TIVA) and propofol/fentanyl/rocuronium arms of the study. (The Tono-Pen XL
      Medtronic Solan, Jacksonville, FL) The Intraocular Pressure (IOP) for both eyes will be
      measured at seven time points:

      Time 1 induction after administration of sedative and local anesthesia in the eye. Both eyes
      of the patient will anesthetized using topical proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution
      0.5%.

      Time 2 Post induction table 0 degrees Time 3 Supine after pneumoperitoneum with 14 mmHg
      pressure Time 4 After docking robot at correct Trendelenburg positioned measured by a level
      Time 5 After undocking and before moving supine Time 6 Supine and before extubation. If the
      intraocular pressure remains elevated above 19 mmHg will require a 7th measurement in PACU
      with HOB at 30 degrees and if the pressure still at or above 19 ophthalmology consult
      initiated.

      Time 7 if needed, see above

      If the patient has any increased reading at the end of the procedure, the same attending
      anesthesiologist in the post-operative recovery area prior to discharge will do a post op
      measurement. Any abnormal readings will prompt an ophthalmology consult and follow up with
      ophthalmology department.
