      Manual dexterity is important to maintain upper limb function and 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) is
      used as gold standard to assess dexterity in pwMS. There are no studies evaluating manual
      dexterity with the Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT) in pwMS. This study aims to:

        1. reporting the results of manual dexterity using the Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test and
           comparing the test results with healthy volunteers,

        2. examining the relationship between MMDT and 9HPT, ABILHAND, grip strength, pinch
           strength, fatigue.
