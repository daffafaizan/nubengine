      were treated by posterior-only correction and the remaining 215 patients received
      conservative treatment. Using pre-operative long-cassette X-ray films, all patients were
      classified based on coronal balance distance (CBD) defined as the horizontal distance between
      C7 plumb line and central sacral vertical line: Type A, CBD < 3cm; Type B, CBD > 3cm and C7PL
      shifts to the concave side of curve; Type C, CBD > 3cm and C7PL shifts to the convex side of
      curve. The prevalence of pre-operative coronal imbalance was calculated for stage I study.
      Post-operative CBD in patients who received surgery was measured to evaluate clinical
      outcomes for stage II study.
