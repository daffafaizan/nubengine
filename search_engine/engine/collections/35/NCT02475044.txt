      time of the head injury. Post concussive symptoms, along emotional distress and
      neurocognitive deficits will be examined at 2 weeks, 4 months and 9 months since the injury,
      using self report questionnaires, psychological evaluation and neuropsychological tests.
      Participants who demonstrates PPCS 4 months after the injury will be assigned either to the
      Cognitive Behavioral Treatmet group (CBT) or to the Treatment as Ususal group(TAU). The
      change in symptoms severity (PCS, emotional distress and neurocognitive deficits) will be
      compared between the two study groups in order to assess treatment efficacy.
