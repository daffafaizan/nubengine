      percent or more in response to salt-loading and have been termed "salt-sensitive" (SS).
      Limited studies of adrenergic function in response to salt-loading suggest that the response
      of SS patients may differ from that of non-salt sensitive (NSS) patients. The present studies
      were designed to examine the response of the adrenergic and dopaminergic systems to
      salt-loading in SS and NSS patients with idiopathic hypertension.
