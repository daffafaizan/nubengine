    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double blind (neither
      physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), parallel-group,
      multicenter study to determine the effectiveness and safety of two different doses of CNTO
      1275 administered subcutaneously one time or as multiple doses as compared with placebo in
      patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis (the most common type of psoriasis).
      The dose of CNTO 1275 will be 45 or 90 mg administered subcutaneously once or as four weekly
      doses. Patients who inadequately respond to their treatment may receive one additional dose.
      Patients will be monitored for the safety throughout the study.
