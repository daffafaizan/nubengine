      use (30%), HIV (27%), TB (60% of HIV+), and malnutrition (24% of infants). Unless the
      prevention programs for these epidemics are horizontally integrated, there will never be
      adequate resources to address these challenges and stigma will dramatically reduce program
      utilization. Furthermore, while clinics are the typical sites for treating each of these
      health problems, this proposal will examine a home-visiting prevention program delivered by
      neighborhood Mentor Mothers (MM) as an alternative to clinic-based interventions to reduce
      the consequences of hazardous alcohol use, HIV, TB, and poor nutrition. The intervention will
      encourage mothers to care for their own health, parent well, maintain their mental health,
      and, if the mother is living with HIV (HIV+ MAR), reduce HIV transmission and/or reduce
      alcohol use and abuse. The results begin to inform the optimal delivery strategy for next
      generation of preventive interventions in order to be feasible and sustainable for broad
      dissemination immediately following an efficacy trial.
