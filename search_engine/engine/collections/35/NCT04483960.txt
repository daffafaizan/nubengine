    
      ASCOT is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled adaptive
      platform trial. The study design will allow harmonisation with existing frameworks such as
      the Sentinel Travellers Research Preparedness Platform for Emerging Infectious Diseases
      (SETREP-ID) and the Randomised, embedded, multifactorial adaptive platform trial for
      community acquired pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) study.

      Platform trials allow multiple questions to be evaluated simultaneously and sequentially
      within the platform, and evaluate interaction between different treatment options, to achieve
      the goal of determining the optimal combination of treatments for the disease as rapidly as
      possible. The overarching objective of ASCOT-ADAPT is to identify the regimen (combination of
      interventions) associated with the highest chance of survival free of advanced respiratory
      support or vasopressor / inotropic support at 28 days after randomisation, in adults
      hospitalised with COVID-19 but not requiring ICU-level care at baseline.

      In the initial implementation of the adaptive platform, recruiting sites have the option to
      participate in one or more of three treatment domains. Consented participants will then be
      able to choose whether to be enrolled into one or more available domains concurrently.
      Participants will then be randomised to the corresponding interventions:

      Intervention domain A (antiviral):

      Participants will be randomised using response adaptive randomisation (RAR) on day 1 to
      receive either i) standard of care without nafamostat; or ii) standard of care with
      nafamostat

      Intervention domain B (antibody):

      Participants will be randomised using response adaptive randomisation (RAR) on day 1 to
      receive either i) standard of care without convalescent plasma; or ii) standard of care with
      convalescent plasma

      Intervention domain C (anticoagulation):

      Participants will be randomised using response adaptive randomisation (RAR) on day 1 to
      receive either i) standard dose thromboprophylaxis; or ii) intermediate dose
      thromboprophylaxis; or iii) standard dose thromboprophylaxis plus aspirin

      Daily data will be collected for the first 28 days or until discharge, whichever is earlier.
      There will be a core dataset collected for all patients at all sites and enhanced and
      research data and biological samples for sites with capacity. Participants will be followed
      up at Day 90.
