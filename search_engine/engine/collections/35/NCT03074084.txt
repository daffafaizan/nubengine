      Hospital Emergency department. The patients will fill in a questionaire about the symptoms
      and their duration. A urine sample will be collected for polyamine molecule analysis with an
      electronic nose. At later stage of the study, a serum sample for coeliac tests will be
      collected. Patient outcome will be obtained during the hospital stay, at one-month after
      discharge and at one year.
