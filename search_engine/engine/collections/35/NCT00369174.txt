      I. To determine the rate of clinical response of oral premalignant lesions (OPL) to 12 weeks
      of therapy with rosiglitazone (Avandia), 8 mg daily, defined as greater than or equal to 50%
      reduction in the measured product of perpendicular dimension of the target lesion, or
      improvement in the degree of dysplasia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate and degree of change of putative biomarkers of rosiglitazone
      efficacy including:

      COX-2, cyclin D1, Ki-67, p21/waf1, PPAR gamma, K1 cytokeratin, involucrin, transglutaminase
      expressions, and TUNEL.

      II. To estimate the correlation between DNA ploidy measurements in OPL with clinical response
      and or response of biomarkers to rosiglitazone therapy, and to estimate the efficacy of
      rosiglitazone therapy to normalize aberrant DNA ploidy in OPL.

      III. To thoroughly assess smoking patterns among trial participants and to examine the
      relationship of smoking to treatment response.

      IV. To assess the safety of this agent in short-term use in this population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral rosiglitazone once daily. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week.
