      I. Conduct formative research with adult Latino family dyads to assess the home environment
      and current behaviors, and identify perceived determinants of healthy eating and physical
      activity (PA) within the family context.

      II. Adapt the "Tu Salud Si Cuenta" (TSSC) intervention to focus on increasing physical
      activity (PA) and healthy eating among adult Latino family dyads (TSSC-Family).

      III. Evaluate the acceptability of intervention content, materials, and procedures with adult
      Latino family dyads.

      OUTLINE:

      FORMATIVE RESEARCH: To adapt the intervention, participants undergo immersive assessment over
      3 hours which is conducted by research staff and involves examination of the home food and PA
      environments, objective and self-reported PA, nutritional intake, demographics and relevant
      psychosocial measures. Participants are also instructed to wear an accelerometer device to
      measure physical activity for up to 7 days and participate in in-depth interviews over 1.5
      hours.

      PRE-TESTING: Participants undergo two TSSC intervention sessions delivered at participants'
      homes by trained community health workers (CHWs) over 1.5 hours.
