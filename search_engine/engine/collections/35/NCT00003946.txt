      recurrent endometrial cancer. II. Determine the nature and toxicity of danazol in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral danazol 4 times per day for at least 4 weeks. Patients with
      partial response, complete response, or stable disease continue treatment in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-56 patients will be accrued for this study within 26 months.
