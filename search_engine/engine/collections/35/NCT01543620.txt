    
      The goal of this clinical study is to advance the acceptance of new biomarkers designed to
      detect drug-induced kidney injury in clinical trials.

      The Kidney Safety Project is being conducted at four major medical centers:

        -  University of Southern California

        -  University of Minnesota

        -  MD Anderson Cancer Center

        -  Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

      Blood and urine samples will be collected from patients undergoing treatment with either
      cisplatin or aminoglycosides, which are two different drugs known to cause injuries to the
      proximal tubule of the kidney. Aminoglycosides are a common antibiotic drug taken by patients
      with cystic fibrosis. Cisplatin is a common chemotherapy drug taken by patients with head and
      neck cancer.

      The Aminoglycoside Study of the Kidney Safety Project is being conducted at the University of
      Southern California and the University of Minnesota and aims to evaluate aminoglycoside
      induced acute kidney injury in patients with cystic fibrosis.

      The companion study, the Cisplatin Study of the Kidney Safety Project, is being conducted at
      the MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and aims to evaluate
      cisplatin induced acute kidney injury in patients with head and neck cancer.

      The data from the Kidney Safety Project, from both the Aminoglycoside Study and the Cisplatin
      Study, will be combined for determination of the best biomarkers for predicting drug-induced
      acute kidney injury.
