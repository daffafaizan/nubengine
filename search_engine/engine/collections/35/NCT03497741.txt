      patients on the ICU.

      Objective: Procalcitonin is an acute phase protein. As part of the acute phase response,
      procalcitonin is produced during sepsis. Previous research shows that procalcitonin is a
      biomarker for bloodstream infection. However, there is still little known about the value of
      procalcitonin in diagnostics for micro-organism underlying a sepsis in ICU patients. In
      modern practice, blood cultures are taken when a patient is septic to determine the
      responsible micro-organism. When procalcitonin is a predictive value for bacteremia in the
      ICU, the number of blood cultures can be reduced.

      Study design: An observational cohort study intervention: for each patient in the ICU blood
      cultures were taken, the procalcitonin level was determined. During 6 months 150 patients
      will be included.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: this study will examine the predictive value of
      procalcitonin in blood cultures on the ICU.
