    
      This is a randomized, multi-center, placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid) controlled, blinded
      study of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for the prevention of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults exposed to the virus.The overarching goal of this study is to
      assess the effectiveness of HCQ PEP on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection by polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) to inform public health control strategies.This study will enroll up to
      2000 asymptomatic men and women 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive) at baseline who are close
      contacts of persons with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or clinically suspected COVID-19 and a
      pending SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to HCQ
      or ascorbic acid at the level of the household (all eligible participants in one household
      will receive the same intervention). Participants will be counseled about the preliminary in
      vitro data on HCQ activity against SARS CoV-2 and equipoise regarding efficacy in humans.The
      duration of study participation will be approximately 28 days.
