      aim of including 800 patients in 2 inclusion years, in 30 centres accross Europe and Israel.
      Inclusion will be general patients indicated for (de novo or upgrade) implantation a
      (Medtronic) CRT-pacemaker or -ICD, as according to current ESC heart failure guidelines.
      Exclusion criteria are, age below 18 years, (planning) childbearing, baseline > 5% RV-pacing,
      listing for transplantation or inotropic dependency, structural heart disease for which
      invasive therapy is pending, or inability/unwillingness to sign written informed consent. All
      QRS morphologies, with duration >/= 130ms are included because multiple LBBB definitions
      exist and excluding patients on one definition will leave room for questions about the
      definitions used. (Bio)markers that are collected are
      electrocardiographic/vectorcardiographic/echocardiographic/blood-/CMR/ and device-based
      parameters that have shown prior association to outcomes in CRT, with special attention to
      vectorcardiographic QRS area. The primary endpoint will be a hierarchal (Packer) score of
      collected heart failure related endpoints including death/LVAD/cardiac transpland/heart
      failure hospitalizations/echocardiographic remodelling and NYHA improvement. Follow-up for
      clinical endpoints will be 12 months; with echocardiographic follow-up at 6 months. Clinical
      endpoints are subject to adjudication committee assessment. Core-labs exist to assess
      electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and CMR-data.
