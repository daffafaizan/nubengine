    
      Freshman college students at Northwestern University will be cluster randomized to two groups
      based on their dorm. The intervention for one group will target smoking, physical activity,
      BMI and consumption of fruits and vegetables. The intervention in the second group will
      target traveling behavior, sexual risk behaviors, sunscreen use and hydration. Baseline
      health and lifestyle measures will be assessed for each participant prior to intervention.
      Health assessments will measure height, weight, fasting glucose, total cholesterol and carbon
      monoxide. The lifestyle measure will ask questions about physical activity, diet, alcohol and
      tobacco use, safe sex practices, driving habits, and sunscreen use. These same measures will
      be repeated during the fall of the students' sophomore and junior years.

      Participants will be given a mobile application and encouraged to track some behaviors. In
      addition, participants will be asked to answer weekly questions regarding health behaviors.
