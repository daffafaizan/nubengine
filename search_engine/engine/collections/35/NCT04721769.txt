           without the use of lateral osteotomies in regard to cranial expansion and aesthetic
           outcomes for children treated with isolated, non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis.

        -  Both arms of the study will undergo standard care throughout their participation which
           includes preoperative & postoperative measurements of cephalic index using the
           STARscannerÂ© (Orthomerica products Inc.), preoperative & postoperative photographs,
           post-operative helmeting, and standard post-operative visits.

        -  Additional research-related activities include chart review. Primary outcomes include
           degree of cranial expansion at 1 year post-operatively.

        -  Secondary outcomes include aesthetic appearance at 1 year post-operatively (using a
           5-point Likert scale) and a multitude of intraoperative clinical variables including
           estimated blood loss, instances of transfusion, instances of dural tear, instances of
           30-day readmission, and instances of needing further surgery.
