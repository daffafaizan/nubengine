    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate,
      cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride plus asparaginase (DA-EPOCH-A) in adults with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive etoposide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and vincristine sulfate intravenously
      (IV) continuously over days 1-4, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 5, and prednisone
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Patients also receive asparaginase intramuscularly
      (IM) or IV over 1-2 hours every 2-3 days, beginning day 7 of each course. Patients who are
      cluster of differentiation (CD)20 positive and Philadelphia chromosome negative also receive
      rituximab IV on day 1 or 5. Patients who are Philadelphia chromosome positive also receive
      imatinib mesylate PO on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
