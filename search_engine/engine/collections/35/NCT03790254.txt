      language reports published before December 2018 using the term "recurrent urinary tract
      infections and d mannose." We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of
      Controlled Trials since January 2010 to December 2018. Eligible studies did not include
      non-oral therapy, local (vaginal) treatment in women with RUTIs.

      Study eligibility criteria- We identified eligible original articles. The heterogeneity of
      the available studies, their different rationale and aim, the assumption of d mannose for
      prophylaxis or treatment of recurrent UTIs need to be taken into account.
