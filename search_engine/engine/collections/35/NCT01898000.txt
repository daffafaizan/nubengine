      mouthwash in reduction of plaque and gingivitis.

      Material & Methods: Ninety subjects diagnosed with chronic generalized gingivitis were
      randomly assigned into three groups: Group I: Placebo mouthwash, Group II: TRP mouthwash,
      Group III: Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash. Subjects were instructed to use mouth wash twice
      daily. The plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and oral hygiene index- simplified (OHI-S)
      and microbiological colony counts were recorded on baseline (B/L) and 7, 30 and 60 days
      respectively.

      Results: There was a gradual decrease in the PI, GI and OHI-S scores by the 7 days, 30 days
      and 60 days time interval, respectively, in all three groups. Microbial counts also showed
      significant reduction in all the groups at all the time intervals except in Group 1. There
      was a significant difference with respect to reduction in PI, GI, OHI-S and microbiological
      counts in Group I as compared to Group II and Group III. However, no significant difference
      was found between Group II and Group III for all the parameters at all-time intervals.

      Conclusion: TRP mouthwash was found to decrease the inflammatory parameters. As improvement
      in gingivitis was comparable to that of CHX mouthwash thus TRP mouthwash can be considered as
      a potential therapeutic agent in treatment of gingivitis.
