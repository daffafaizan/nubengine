      with obstructing left-sided colon cancer than in those with non-obstructing surgery.
      Retrospective study reported worse overall survival with SEMS and elective surgery than with
      emergency surgery in patients with left-sided malignant colon obstruction. In practice,
      intestinal wall edema following stent placement increases the difficulty of surgery, and this
      could be a major problem if the interval between stent insertion and surgery is short (1-2
      weeks). The patients with obstructing left-sided colon cancer received SEMS treatment, and
      the recevied neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to elective surgery.
