    
      RP1 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus that is designed to directly
      destroy tumors and to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase 1B, open label,
      multicenter, trial evaluating the safety and tolerability, biodistribution, shedding, and
      preliminary efficacy of RP1 in adult hepatic and renal transplant recipients who subsequently
      experienced advanced or metastatic CSCC. Patients will be dosed with RP1 by direct or
      ultrasound guided intra-tumoral injection into superficial, subcutaneous or nodal tumors. No
      transplanted organs will be injected.
