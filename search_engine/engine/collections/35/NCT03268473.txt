      cerebrovascular diseases such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial
      infarction, cardiac-arrhythmia, and stroke.Gender, age, smoking, obesity and diabetes, which
      are risk factors for periodontitis,It is also common in OSAS at the same time.In addition to
      common risk factors, both OSAS and periodontitis have been shown to be associated with
      increased cystic inflammation.It has been reported that elevated inflammatory markers in OSAS
      patients may be associated with periodontal inflammation, although the mechanism of OSAS to
      systemic inflammation has not yet been clarified.

      The investigators aimed to investigate whether the non-surgical periodontal treatment of
      patients with periodontitis and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects the course of
      OSAS positively with polysomnographic, serum and saliva parameters.
