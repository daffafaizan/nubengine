    
      This prospective randomized clinical trial in patients with peripheral vascular disease and
      acute or subacute arterial thrombosis will compare percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and
      simultaneous in situ thrombolysis using the Clearway balloon system with mechanical
      thrombectomy with the Angiojet system. Main endpoints are the time to successful
      revascularization, the frequency of distal embolization and the incidence of bleeding
      complications.
