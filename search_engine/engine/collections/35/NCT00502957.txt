    
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of anorectal biofeedback
      therapy for functional constipation secondary to pelvic floor dyssynergia. Participants will
      be randomized to either six sessions of anorectal biofeedback or to six sessions of
      generalized biofeedback.

      Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, at completion of randomized
      treatment(12 weeks), and six months after completion of treatment to measure change in bowel
      habits, constipation severity, constipation-related quality of life, and constipation-related
      disability. An examination of psychosocial factors will also be conducted prior to treatment
      to distinguish which ones are predictive of biofeedback success for functional constipation.
