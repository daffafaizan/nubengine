      mentor who has learned to manage their IBD well and can support them emotionally and
      socially. This study will compare two groups of teens: those who are in the iPeer2Peer
      program and those in the control group (no mentor).

      The proposed trial aims to examine the impact of the iPeer2Peer program on self-management
      skills of youth with IBD (mentees) as well as health outcomes of peer mentors in the program.
      This innovative program leverages the Internet, commonly used by youth, to improve access and
      acceptability of self-management interventions while fostering social engagement in youth
      with IBD, thereby potentially improving HRQL.
