      atracurium. isoflurane 1-2% with oxygen was used for anesthetic maintenance and 0.15 mg/kg
      intermittent doses of atracurium to maintain adequate muscle relaxation. ventilation was
      controlled to maintain end tidal CO2 at 35-40 mmHg and SaO2 between 95-100. after
      stabilization of the patient's hemodynamics and before surgical incision, quadratus lumborum
