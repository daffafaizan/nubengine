      The investigators' report has shown directly the relationship between fibrocytes, and chronic
      airflow obstruction with rapid decline in FEV1 in asthma. Asthma concomitant of obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA) may appear intermittent hypoxia and result in the frequent attack of asthma
      symptoms. In animal model, hypoxia may increase the circulating fibrocytes, thus play a role
      in pulmonary hypertension. The investigators' published paper also showed that an increased
      expression of EGFR, ETAR and Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) in
      circulating fibrocytes in chronic obstructive asthmatics. It is unknown whether circulating
      fibrocytes from asthma with OSA have the higher expression of EGFR, connective tissue growth
      factor receptor, VEGFR and ETAR compared to asthma without OSA. The investigators are also
      interested in whether proliferation and differentiation of fibrocytes are different between
      asthmatics with or without concomitant of OSA. The investigators will study the correlation
      between the percentage of circulating fibrocytes and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and
      severity of sleep apnea to clarify the role of hypoxia, which contributing to chronic asthma.
