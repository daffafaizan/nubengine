      by hypertriglyceridemia. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia increases the oxidation of
      low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and increases blood concentrations of several biomarkers of
      inï¬‚ammation. This postprandial lipemia-induced oxidative stress mediated response to a
      high-fat meal has been suggested as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of
      atherosclerosis along with other chronic disease states of diabetes and obesity. Consumption
      of foods rich in antioxidant compounds provides a defence source to compliment endogenous
      defence systems to protect against oxidative damage during pro-oxidant conditions.
