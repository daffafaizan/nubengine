      transmission and its modulatory role in reward processing. For instance, recent animal models
      have found that the angiotensin antagonist losartan reduces rewarding effects of
      methamphetamine and nicotine by modulating DA release in the striatum.The present study thus
      will investigate losartan effects on reward reinforcement learning and the underlying neural
      mechanisms. In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo-controlled design, 60 healthy male
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive single-dose losartan (50 mg) or placebo, 90
      minutes before performing a probabilistic reinforcement learning task during fMRI.
