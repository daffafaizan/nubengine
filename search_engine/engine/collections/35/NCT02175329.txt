    
      Randomized prospective controlled clinical study with three-unit posterior bridges made of
      zirconia-ceramic to compare veneering with manually layering or CAD/CAM fabricated lithium
      disilicate ceramic veneers. The hypothesis is that there is no difference in clinical
      survival of the restorations and no difference in biological or technical behaviour.
