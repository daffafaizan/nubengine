      limiting participation. For people with CP the energetic cost of walking is on average over
      two times higher than typically-developing (TD) peers. This means that for people with CP,
      walking is as tiring as jogging or climbing stairs. An energetic cost of this magnitude
      restricts activities of daily living (ADL) and causes exhaustion.

      While the investigators and many others have sought to reduce these energetic costs through
      surgical interventions, rehabilitation, orthotics, or other assistive devices, these
      strategies have failed to result in meaningful reductions in energy. To design strategies
      that successfully reduce walking costs, the investigators must first understand the
      underlying mechanisms contributing to elevated cost in people with CP. This basic-science
      research will provide the foundation to create evidence-based strategies to decrease energy
      costs, minimize fatigue, and increase quality of life for people with CP and other neurologic
      injuries.
