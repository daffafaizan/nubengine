        -  Determine the recurrence rate and disease free survival in patients with recurrent or
           refractory papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with or without
           carcinoma in situ of the bladder treated with intravesical AD 32.

        -  Evaluate the safety of administering this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of this drug, in terms of recurrence rates and disease free
           survival, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to cellular diagnosis (papillary transitional cell
      carcinoma (Ta/T1) with no carcinoma in situ (Tis) vs Tis with or without Ta/T1).

      Patients receive intravesical AD 32 once a week for 6 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.
