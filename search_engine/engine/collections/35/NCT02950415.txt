      presence and coaching of parents on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The
      primary hypothesis is virtual parental presence during induction of anesthesia is superior to
      physical parental presence during induction of anesthesia in reducing anxiety in children at
      induction of anesthesia. The secondary hypothesis is that the coaching of parents modulates
      the effect of physical or video parental presence at induction anesthesia on children's
      anxiety.
