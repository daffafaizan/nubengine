    
      Healthy Normal Volunteers will be randomized to a sequence of 4 different doses of
      Technosphere® Insulin (TI), inhaled using the Gen2C device, and one dose of subcutaneously
      injected Regular Human Insulin. A euglycemic clamp procedure will be performed at each dosing
      visit. The purpose of this study is to determine the insulin dose proportionality/linearity
      of Technosphere® Insulin (TI) Inhalation Powder based on the AUCo-180 after administration of
      the following doses using the Gen2C inhaler:

        -  10 U (one 10 U cartridge)

        -  30 U (one 10 U and one 20 U cartridge)

        -  60 U (three 20 U cartridges)

        -  80 U (four 20 U cartridges)
