      of the protocol defined inpatient rooms in the Kay Research and Care Center (KRCC) will be
      enrolled on the study. Participating patients will be asked to provide stool, nasal swab, and
      skin swab samples while inpatient. Primary caregivers and the nurse assigned to the patient's
      room will also be asked to provide nasal and skin swabs while the patient remains inpatient.
      These samples will be used to characterize the human microbiome for comparison to the
      environmental microbiome.
