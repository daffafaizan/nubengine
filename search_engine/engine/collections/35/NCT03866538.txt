    
      This study aims to evaluate patients with small intestinal diseases caused by the immune
      system (refractory celiac disease type 1, CVID enteropathy, autoimmune enteropathy, and
      collagenous enteropathy) who have had improvement in symptoms and small intestine healing
      with oral budesonide.

      Patients who meet inclusion criteria and agree to enter the study will be included for 12
      weeks or until they choose to discontinue or there are concerns for safety.

      At the beginning of the study, patients will undergo questionnaires, blood draw, urine and
      stool collections, physical exam, and an upper scope (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with
      biopsies from the small intestine. They will then be randomized to either continued therapy
      on their current dose and formulation of budesonide (medication provided by the study) or to
      withdrawal of the medication over 2 weeks and then no medication during the study. Daily
      questionnaire on symptoms will be recorded.

      Patients will be assessed in the clinical research unit monthly during the study with a
      questionnaire, physical exam, blood draw, and urine/stool collections.

      Finally, at the end of the trial (12 weeks) or at the time of withdrawal from the trial, the
      patients will complete questionnaires, physical exam, blood collection, urine/stool
      collection, and upper scope (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with small bowel biopsies.
