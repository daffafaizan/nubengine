      post-market release study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic
      performance of the Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring following Tricuspid Valve (TV)
      repair in a post-market environment. Therefore, the primary objective of the EASE Tricuspid
      Study was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of the Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty
      Ring (Contour 3D ring) in subjects with tricuspid regurgitation who had a clinical indication
      for TV repair in a post-market use. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the
      effect of TV repair with the Contour 3D ring on the right ventricular function, as well as
      the assessment of the effect of TV repair with the Contour 3D ring on the functional status
      in subjects undergoing TV repair in a post-market environment. Subjects eligible for TV
      repair and compliant with the enrollment criteria were considered by the Investigator for
      inclusion in the study. To minimize bias, enrolled subjects were followed by their own
      physician in accordance with the center's established practice for routine follow up.
      Follow-up sessions were planned at the physician's discretion. To meet the intended goals,
      appropriate clinical data were collected at baseline (pre-surgery), during the surgical
      procedure, at discharge and during the follow-up period at 6 months. Experienced
      echo-cardiologists evaluated the echos. At the time of enrollment it was not certain if the
      subject would receive a Contour 3D ring, since the surgeon might have decided during surgery
      that another treatment was more beneficial to the subject. In this case, the subject was
      terminated from the study.
