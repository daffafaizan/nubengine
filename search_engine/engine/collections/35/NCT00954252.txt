      after single oral administration to young healthy male volunteers.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CHF5074 after
      single oral administration to young healthy male volunteers. The secondary endpoint of this
      study is to verify if CHF5074 plasma levels (Cmax and AUC0-t) increase proportionally with
      the dose (dose-linearity).

      The exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of CHF5074 after
      single oral administration to young healthy male volunteers. The respective exploratory
      endpoint is to assess the relationship between individual maximum CHF5074 plasma
      concentrations and corresponding A-beta42 plasma concentrations corrected for baseline
      A-beta42 levels.
