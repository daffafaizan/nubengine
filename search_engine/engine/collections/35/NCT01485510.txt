      "implementation period". During this time we have fewer research staff, both services will
      just have started and we will only be collecting selected outcome measures. These will be the
      Principle Outcome Measure, the Infant-Toddler Social-Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), plus the
      Disturbance of Attachment Interview (DAI) and Parent-Infant Global Assessment of Functioning
      (PIR-GAS). We hope to include data from implementation period in our trial analysis, but if
      results are very different due to services "bedding in", we may not do so
