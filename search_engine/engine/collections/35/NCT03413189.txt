      quality of life and the ability for patients to return to pre-illness function is
      unfavourable. Exercise in the ICU has been proven to be safe and effective, with decreases in
      length of stay and improvements in physical and psychosocial function seen in multiple
      studies. At present, the investigators are unsure on the most effective way to exercise this
      patient group in relation to duration, type, intensity and frequency.

      The investigators aim to link the presence of delirium during an ICU admission,
      disability-free survival and quality of life obtained from telephone follow-up six months
      following ICU discharge with the amount of exercise performed during their ICU stay to
      determine a relationship. Additionally, in a small group of participants, the investigators
      will measure cognitive and physical function to ensure that the patient reported data
      accurately reflects their true functional level, while allowing patients and/or relatives,
      next of kin or carers to provide information regarding their recovery through an interview
      process.

      The measure of physical function and disability (via the WHODAS and Euro Qol Group Health
      Survey (EQ5D)) obtained during telephone interview of the 500 patients enrolled in the
      PREDICT study will be correlated with the amount of exercise they performed whilst in
      Intensive Care obtained from the medical records. The presence of delirium will also be
      obtained from the medical records and linked with the amount of exercise performed to
      determine if a link is present. A sub-set of this population (40) will be invited at the
      3-month follow up phone call of the PREDICT study to have a physiotherapist visit them to
      assess their cognitive and physical function and interview them and/or their relatives, next
      of kin or carer to determine themes of the recovery process following critical illness.
