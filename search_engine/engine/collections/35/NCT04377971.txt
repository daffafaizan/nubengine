    
      Patients undergoing Mohs Micrographic surgery for skin cancers on the lower extremities for
      the first time that are left to heal by secondary intention are randomized either to receive
      a scripted teach-back session or a standard of care wound care education. This study wishes
      to compare wound care adherence, patient experience, wound complications, and the number of
      phone calls made by patients to the office between the two cohorts

      primary objective is to determine whether study participants who have received the teach-back
      method have an increase wound care adherence at one week post-operatively, compared to those
      who received the standard of care.

      To characterize differences in the patient experience between the two interventional groups 2
      weeks after surgery.

      To determine whether the number of phone calls made post-operatively by patients will
      decrease in a 2 week follow-up time period.

      To characterize the differences in patient wound care adherence at 2 weeks after surgery.

      To determine whether there is a difference in complication incidence post-operatively
