      incorporates into tumor cell membranes and presents these xeno-transplantation epitopes to
      antigen presenting cells with that particular tumor's tumor associated antigens (TAA). Thus
      this maneuver converts any individual tumor into an in situ tumor vaccine without the need to
      isolate, purify or supply TAA exogenously. The effects in these model systems demonstrate
      both the upregulation of cytotoxic T cells which react against the particular tumor's TAA, as
      well as resolution of injected primary tumor and eradication and prevention of metastatic
      disease at distant sites. This current study was undertaken to investigate the safety and
      feasibility of such an approach in humans. The major toxicity concerns are acute allergic or
      complement activation reactions or development of autoimmunity. The primary treatment is a
      single intratumoral injection of alpha gal glycolipid. The study design is a standard dose
      escalation design and the primary endpoint is Dose limiting toxicity at one month after
      injection (grade 3 or 4. Subjects are followed until death utilizing standard clinical
      imaging and evaluation to judge overall tumor response.
