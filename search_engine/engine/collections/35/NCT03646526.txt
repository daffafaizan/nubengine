    
      This clinical study is a single-center, randomized, open clinical study divided into two
      parts, the first part is the pre-test and the second part is the formal test.

      Both pre-test and formal trials were designed using two preparations, two cycles, and a
      self-crossover controlled trial.

      Twelve subjects were enrolled in the pre-test and randomly divided into two groups. Each
      group received 25 mg of the test preparation or reference preparation in the first day of
      each cycle, before the administration (0 h) and after the administration 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 2.0 h,
      2.5 h, 3.0 h, 3.5 h, 4.0 h, 4.5 h, 5.0 h, 5.5 h, 6.0 h, 7.0 h, 8.0 h, 10.0 h, 12.0 h, 24.0 h,
      36.0 h, 48.0 h, 72.0 h, 96.0 h, 120.0 h, 144 h, 168 h, and 192 h blood samples were measured
      for plasma amitriptyline concentration for bioequivalence analysis, and the concentration of
      the active metabolite nortriptyline was determined as supportive evidence of comparable
      efficacy. The pre-test results will provide the basis for formal testing. The cleaning period
      is 21 ± 1 day.

      The formal trials were divided into fasting and postprandial trials to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of the test preparation and the reference preparation in a single dose of
      hollow and postprandial administration in healthy Chinese subjects. Fasting and postprandial
      trials were enrolled in 24 subjects and randomly divided into 2 groups. Each group received
      25 mg of the test preparation or reference preparation on the first day of each cycle, before
      the administration (0 h) and after the administration 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 2.0 h, 3.0 h, 4.0 h, 5.0
      h, 6.0 h, 7.0 h, 8.0 h, 10.0 h, 12.0 h, 24.0 h, 36.0 h, 48.0 h, 72.0 h, 96.0 h, 120.0 h and
      144 h blood samples were measured for plasma concentrations of amitriptyline for
      bioequivalence analysis， and the concentration of the active metabolite nortriptyline was
      determined as supportive evidence of comparable efficacy.. The cleaning period is 21 ± 1 day.

      Based on the results of the first part of the pre-test evaluation, the experimental design
      and sampling time and other contents of the second part of the formal test may require
      necessary modifications.

      The fasting test and the postprandial test in the formal test were carried out independently.
