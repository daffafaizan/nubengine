      electromagnetic pulses to the brain lasting twenty minutes. The field and timing parameters
      of the LFMS pulses, such as pulse timing, duration, frequency, and electric and magnetic
      field distribution and direction are different from other neurostimulation methods. LFMS
      electromagnetic fields are significantly weaker than those occurring in electroconvulsive
      therapy (ECT) and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

      LFMS was discovered at McLean Hospital and has been studied as an experimental antidepressant
      treatment at McLean. Results from the investigator's single-visit protocol (2006-P-001655)
      are encouraging, and demonstrate an immediate mood improvement from LFMS in depressed
      subjects. This indicates that LFMS continues to show potential as a treatment for depression.
      The profile of clinical response to LFMS that was observed in that study included improvement
      in symptoms of anxiety. In this current proposal the investigator's will study the effects of
      LFMS on these symptoms of depression and anxiety that are present in a population with a
      primary diagnosis of PTSD. The proposed protocol involves three treatments on consecutive
      days with follow-up ratings one week after the first treatment and follow-up by phone ratings
      in weeks three and four after the first treatment.
