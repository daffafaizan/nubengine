      evolutionary biology informed learning platform will allow an improved discovery of
      bacterially derived novel molecular entities with therapeutic potential for chronic
      constipation. This approach intends to enhance our ability to understand the gut microbiome
      and use it towards developing therapeutic solutions, in comparison to traditional collection
      methods and taxonomic-based data analysis approaches.
