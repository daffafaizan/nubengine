      signing an informed consent form, all subjects will undergo medical examination and an
      interview with a nutritionist to assess their dietary intake of Astaxanthin. They will then
      undergo 3 days of training on the cognitive testing software.

      During the first stage, while consuming an Astaxanthin free diet, the subjects will
      participate in the physiological tests:heat tolerance test (HTT), thermo-neutral test (TTT)
      and maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max) on 3 separate days.

      During the second stage, the subjects will be randomly and blindly assigned to either the
      placebo or the Astaxanthin supplementation arms, and undergo 35-40 days of supplementation.

      Physiological testing of the second stage will take place between the 31st and 35th (up to
      40th - optional) days of supplementation and will include HTT, TTT and VO2max on 3 separate
      days.
