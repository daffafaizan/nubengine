      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 44 Gy concomitant boost to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the value of PET in predicting pathological response and
      eventfree survival in stage IIIA NSCLC, and a health economic analysis of the two regimens.
      Further to compare the amount of serum DNA in patients with stage IIIA, pN2 NSCLC before
      chemotherapy, before surgery and at the second follow-up visit (i.e. four months after
      surgery or treatment failure for patients who can not be operated) in patients randomized
      into the trial SAKK 16/00 and to correlate the DNA variation with tumor response, remission
      duration and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective randomized phase III trial. Patients are stratified according
      to mediastinal bulk (5 cm or more vs less than 5 cm), weight loss in the past 6 months (5% or
      more vs less than 5%), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.
