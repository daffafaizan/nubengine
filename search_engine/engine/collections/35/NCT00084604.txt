      I. Determine the efficacy of irinotecan, cisplatin, and bevacizumab, in terms of time to
      progression, in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine other measures of efficacy, including response rate and median and 1-year
      survival, in patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate CT perfusion
      imaging results with the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of time to progression, objective
      response, and survival, in these patients.

      IV. Determine the feasibility of serial serum proteomic assays in predicting response to
      therapy, in terms of time to progression, objective response, and survival, in patients
      treated with this regimen.

      V. To bank paraffin stored tumor biopsy material for future planned immunohistochemistry
      studies to correlate with sensitivity to bevacizumab based combination chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive cisplatin
      IV over 30 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
