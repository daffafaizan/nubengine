      neurological manifestations. The associated peripheral neuropathy could be assessed by
      conventional nerve conduction studies.

      Objective: The study aims at early detection of peripheral neuropathy among patients of liver
      cirrhosis by conventional nerve conduction studies and quantitative EMG methods. In addition,
      the study aims at finding out correlation between peripheral neuropathy and severity of the
      liver cirrhosis.

      Methods: This a cross-sectional study conducted on fifty-six liver cirrhotic patients, that
      had been recruited from the Endemic medicine department/outpatient clinics and their
      age-gender matched sixty-one healthy controls. The recruited patients were clinically
      assessed .Both conventional nerve conduction studies and quantitative EMG techniques in the
      form of MUNE calculation, using modified spike -triggered technique and IPA ratio evaluation
      were performed for the allocated cirrhotic patients.
