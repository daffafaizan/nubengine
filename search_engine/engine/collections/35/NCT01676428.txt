    
      FASTRACK is a 2 -cohort, non-randomised prospective feasibility study. Anticipated total
      duration of accrual is approximately 24 months, with all patients expected to complete all
      protocol treatment and imaging within a further 3 months. The trial will close after the last
      patient has completed his/her last protocol related follow-up visit (at 12 months
      post-treatment).

      Cohort 1: patients with renal cell carcinoma within the kidney Cohort 2: patients with
      solitary adrenal metastases from non-small cell lung carcinoma The investigational treatment
      will be prescribed the covering isodose, ensuring that 99% of the PTV is covered by 100% of
      the dose (D99=100%). It is anticipated that most treatments should be highly conformal.
      Treatment must be delivered with at least six (6) non-opposing conformal megavoltage photon
      beams. It is anticipated that a typical range of beam numbers would be 8 to 12, comprising of
      at least 6 co-planar beams and 1-2 non-coplanar beams. No cytotoxic chemotherapy is allowed
      within 3 weeks or concurrently with respect to the investigational treatment. Consultation
      with the treating radiation oncologist is strongly recommended if chemotherapy is to be
      considered after the investigational treatment and before documented disease progression, to
      prevent unforeseen combined toxicities. Targeted agents (such as sunitinib) are exempt from
      this recommendation.
