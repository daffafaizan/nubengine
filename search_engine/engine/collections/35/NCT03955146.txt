    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF).

      Subjects who are not being treated with approved IPF therapies (i.e., nintedanib or
      pirfenidone) may be eligible for screening. Examples of reasons subjects may not be treated
      with approved IPF therapies include but are not limited to:

        -  Intolerant or not responsive to approved IPF therapies

        -  Ineligible to receive these therapies

        -  Subject voluntarily declines to receive approved IPF therapies after being fully
           informed of the potential benefits/risks

      NOTE: No subject should discontinue an approved IPF therapy for the purpose of enrolling in
      this study.

      Approximately 340 eligible subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to Arm A or Arm B,
      respectively:

      Arm A: pamrevlumab, 30 mg/kg IV, Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter

      Arm B: Matching placebo IV, Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter

      The study consists of the following study periods:

        -  Main (double blind, placebo-controlled) phase:

             -  Screening period: Up to 6 weeks

             -  Treatment period: 48 weeks

        -  Optional, open label extension (OLE) phase of pamrevlumab:

           o Access to pamrevlumab will be available until the last subject completes 48 weeks of
           treatment in the OLE phase, or pamrevlumab is commercially available for the indication
           of IPF, or the Sponsor decides to end the OLE phase, whichever occurs first.

        -  Follow-up period/final safety assessments:

             -  28 days after last dose

             -  60 days after last dose: follow-up phone call, for a final safety assessment

      During the treatment period, co-administration of an approved IPF therapy (i.e., pirfenidone
      or nintedanib) is acceptable if clinically indicated in the Investigator's opinion, provided
      that the Investigator assesses the potential risks/benefits of combining approved IPF
      therapies with blinded study treatment.

      Subjects who discontinue study treatment for any reason should be encouraged to remain in the
      study and be followed for all study visits and assessments.

      Subjects who complete the study will be eligible for an open-label, extension with
      pamrevlumab.
