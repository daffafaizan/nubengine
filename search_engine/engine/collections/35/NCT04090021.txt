      antibiotic resistance. In high-resistance countries where bismuth and/or tetracycline are
      unavailable (eg; Greece), non-bismuth quadruple therapies are currently recommended as
      first-line therapeutic options; however, eradication rates >95% are infrequently achieved and
      even >90% are disputed. Antimicrobial susceptibility-guided therapy is a promising
      alternative in order to maintain high therapeutic efficacy. However, traditional
      culture-based susceptibility testing methods have several shortcomings, including they are
      time-consuming and they do not 100% reflect in vivo eradication. Recent guidelines also
      recommend the use of molecular testing for evaluation of H. pylori antibiotic susceptibility.
      Nevertheless, the efficacy of genotypic resistance-guided treatment of H. pylori has been
      seldom appraised. Therefore, the investigators conducted this prospective randomized
      controlled trial aiming to investigate the efficacy of a 7-day genotypic resistance-guided
      triple therapy, compared with empirical concomitant therapy, for first-line eradication of H.
      pylori.
