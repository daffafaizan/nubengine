      and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. This will be an
      evaluation of the slope of the decline in the log parasitemia-time curve, parasite clearance
      times in patients randomized to one of two different doses of oral artesunate or
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. People with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled, screened, randomized and treated on site with either
      artesunate 2mg/kg/day, artesunate 4mg/kg/day or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine once daily
      according to weight for 3 days. The artesunate arms will immediately follow with
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine therapy for 3 days (study days 3 - 6) at the dose defined by
      national guidelines. Patients on all three arms will be monitored for 42 days. The follow-up
      will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory
      examinations. PCR analysis will be used to distinguish between true recrudescence due to
      treatment failure and reinfection.
