      after secukinumab treatment in 15 patients at weeks 2, 4, and 12 compared to baseline week 0.
      The immunologic profiles in psoriasis patients will also be compared to healthy control skin
      surgical discard specimens (n=10). The number of differentially expressed genes in each cell
      population will be quantified by RNA-seq at weeks 2, 4, 12 after secukinumab compared to
      baseline.
