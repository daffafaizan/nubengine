      animal researches. Agomelatine is a melatonin derivative drug approved for the treatment of
      depression, which is also available in our country. Depending on animal experiments, it can
      be assumed that agomelatine can decrease intraocular pressure. Demonstrating that agomelatine
      is effective to reduce eye pressure may give a concurrent treatment of depressive patients
      with glaucoma. With this it may be possible to treat both diseases at the same time with
      single drug. In this study, the researchers intended to investigate the changes in ocular
      tension in normotensive depressive patients treated with agomelatine.
