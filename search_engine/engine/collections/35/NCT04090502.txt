      these muscles may improve pain.

      The dry needling technique seems to improve the extensibility of the muscles. This technique
      seems to be more effective when is applied in the most hyperalgesic areas related to the
      participant's pain.

      In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, the investigators will check if the dry needling
      technique produces the same effects when is applied in other areas of those same muscles
