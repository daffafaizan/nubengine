      be approached to participate in the study.

      The patient will take their nifedipine as scheduled, we will attain central arterial pressure
      reading in addition to arterial waveform measurements. These will be collected:

      Before administration of the medication Every 20 minutes for 3 hours (total of 10
      measurements)

      -This timing will allow measurements through approximately 2 half lives Routine
      sphygmomanometry will also be completed at the testing times All of these measurements will
      be collected for study purposes, although the nurses will have the opportunity to record the
      routine blood pressure measurements for their charting/vital signs assessment if they desire.

      Once the patient has been monitored for 3 hours, her participation in the study is considered
      complete and no additional information will be collected. Each patient will serve as her own
      control (blood pressure prior to administration of medication), no randomization will occur.
