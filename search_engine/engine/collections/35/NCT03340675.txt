    
      This is a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study with an
      optional open-label extension to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of
      two doses of oral ifetroban in subjects with DMD. DMD patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive oral ifetroban or placebo once daily
      for 12 months. Subjects will be enrolled onto one of three treatment groups, low-dose
      ifetroban, high-dose ifetroban or placebo. Each dose level will be evaluated by eight
      subjects with early stage (LVEF > 45%) DMD-associated cardiomyopathy and eight subjects with
      more advanced stage (LVEF 35-45%) cardiac disease as there may be differences in the
      treatment effect based on cardiac involvement. Each subject treated will be evaluated for
      first-dose and steady-state exposure PK. All subjects who receive treatment will be assessed
      for safety. All subjects with at least one efficacy assessment post-baseline will be
      evaluated for efficacy. Blood and urine will be collected for standard and novel cardiac
      biomarkers.
