      network model approach provides insights regarding inter-connectivity of brain networks and
      can describe the temporal-spatial brain activation patterns applied to various types of
      data-sets including EEG, MEG and fMRI.

      In this study it is proposed that synchronization in brain activity may be disrupted in
      patients who experience frequent seizures and may correspond to functional impairments (e.g.,
      memory, processing speed). As such, BNA analysis may provide additional data that complement
      current functional assessments, inform clinical assessment and management of epilepsy, and
      identify subgroups of patients that might be at risk for poor treatment outcomes.
