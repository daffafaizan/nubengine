      disease and these patients are typically treated with transarterial chemo-embolisation (TACE)
      or transarterial embolisation (TAE).

      However, since TACE/TAE is generally a palliative therapy, it provides a potential backbone
      for the addition of effective systemic therapies with the aim of improving survival outcomes.
      Since TACE may liberate an abundance of tumour antigens and 'danger' signals, it may lend
      itself to combination with immunotherapeutic strategies.

      Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody. Nivolumab targets the programmed death-1 PD-1)
      cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative
      regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.
