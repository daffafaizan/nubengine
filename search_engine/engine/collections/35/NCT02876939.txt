      and a tungsten microelectrode inserted percutaneously into a muscle or cutaneous fascicle of
      the right common peroneal nerve at the fibular head, according to standard techniques
      employed by Prof Macefield. Neural activity will be acquired, RMS-processed (200 ms) and
      analysed on computer. The subject's head will be tightly enclosed in a standard clinical
      32-channel SENSE head coil and headphones will be provided to minimize noise and to allow
      communication with the subject. The subject will be placed in the bore of a 3T whole-body
      scanner for 60-90 minutes.
