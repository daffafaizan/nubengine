      endometrial cancer has a very high survival rate, patients more often suffer from long-term
      issues related to their weight, like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Weight loss surgery
      has been shown to help patients lose weight and also decrease their risk for obesity-related
      diseases.

      This research study is a Feasibility Study. This is the first-time investigators are studying
      both 1) the referral process of patients with endometrial cancer to the Center for Metabolic
      and Bariatric Surgery without delaying curative treatment of endometrial cancer 2) the
      combined surgery of both hysterectomy and weight loss surgery. The combined surgery of
      hysterectomy and weight loss surgery has been performed both at this institution and others
      without increased complications, but it has not been formally studied.

      Approximately 30 patients are expected to participate in this study at Brigham and Women's
      Hospital (BWH).
