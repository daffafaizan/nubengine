    
      This is an open, prospective, randomized, single center trial that will address the primary
      research question: Does an increase in ambient operating room temperature result in a lower
      rate of composite neonatal morbidities? During the 1.2 year study period, the operating room
      temperatures on labor and delivery will be adjusted to either the current standard of care
      with ambient operating room temperature of 20째C (67째F), or the maximum temperature allowable
      per hospital policy in the current operating rooms, which is 24째C (75째F), as determined by
      cluster randomization. Composite neonatal morbidities will be recorded including hypoglycemia
      necessitating treatment; need for respiratory support within the first 24 hours;
      culture-proven sepsis; and mortality. Association of outcomes with the types of passive and
      active warming performed will include these morbidities stratified by gestational age as well
      as maternal outcomes. In addition, an electronic survey will be administered to the operating
      resident physicians to assess their experience with the study conditions.
