      research efforts need to be more focused in optimizing a non-surgical approach. This concept
      is very relevant to an ageing patient population with multiple co-morbidities regularly seen
      at the Jewish General Hospital and across the province. After interim analysis on 40 patients
      of the pilot study a phase III study is proposed. We are therefore proposing a phase III
      multicentric study of 145 patients to compare the two best known radiation dose escalation
      strategies and to achieve a complete clinical response. Patients with a clinical T2-3 N0-1
      rectal cancer will be randomized to two arms (arm A: standard chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25
      with concomitant 5-FU or Xeloda chemotherapy) and an external beam boost of 9 Gy compared to
      arm B: standard chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25 with concomitant 5-FU or Xeloda chemotherapy) and
      followed by a brachytherapy boost of 30 Gy in 3 fractions). Patients that have a high risk of
      recurrence or with more advanced stages of the disease will be excluded from the study, as
      only the local disease is being treated. The primary outcome for this proposal is rectum
      preservation in treated patients.
