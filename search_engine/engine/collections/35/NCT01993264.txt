      of the unborn baby's heart in motion made by bouncing sound waves off the heart and recording
      the echo. The procedure will be very similar to the ultrasounds that the subject is already
      receiving as part of her prenatal care.

      The scans will start at week 20 of the subject's pregnancy and repeat every 3 weeks until
      week 38 of birth (whichever occurs first). The appointments will last approximately 30
      minutes each and will be performed by one of two sonographers trained specifically in fetal
      echocardiography. One additional echocardiogram will be performed on the infant after birth,
      within the first two months of life. In addition to the scans, study staff will access the
      subject's medical record to collect information such as: age, ethnicity, race, medical
      history and health insurance status.
