      specific for myocardial injury. Its widespread use has helped in the determination and
      investigation for myocardial ischemia in patients. Previous studies have shown a rise in
      creatine kinase (CK) and the more specific creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CKMB) after DC
      cardioversion. Studies on the earlier generation troponin T found that the levels don't rise
      or rise only minimally after DC cardioversion. The high sensitivity troponin T has never been
      studied in the setting of DC cardioversion.
