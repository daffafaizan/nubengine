      determinations, patients were classified according to their post-surgical hypoparathyroidism
      risk and were either immediately treated with calcium and vitamin D1-25 supplementation
      (high-risk) or assigned to clinical control and routine calcium sampling (low-risk). The
      outcomes and overall results of these therapeutical approaches were compared with those of a
      control group, started on treatment when TCa levels dropped below normal.

      In the high-risk subgroup (n=30) five patients showed hypocalcemia within the first 24 hours.
      Compared with the high-risk control subgroup, the incidence of hypocalcemia fell from 100% to
      17% (p<0.001), and the median hospitalization length from 6 to 3 days (p<0.001).

      In the low-risk subgroup (n=36) 28 patients remained normocalcemic with significantly less
      calcium sampling (p<0.001). Eight patients had hypocalcemia; 7 of them required neck
      dissection, which was the only risk factor related to post-surgical hypoparathyroidism (RR:
      2.1 [CI 95% 1.4-3.1], P<0.001).

      Compared to the control group, overall incidence of hypocalcemia was reduced by 58 %.

      This approach improved patient's safety by reducing the occurrence of hypocalcemia and the
      length of hospitalization after thyroidectomy in pediatric patients. Preventive calcium
      supplementation seems to be more beneficial in patients undergoing neck dissection.
