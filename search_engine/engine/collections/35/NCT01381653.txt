      (intervention decliners and those who only completed one session) will participate in focus
      groups to advise us on the feasibility and pragmatic specifications of an HIV prevention
      intervention received via the IM (instant messaging) function of Facebook. Focus group
      transcripts will be examined to isolate key recommendations for modifying the intervention's
      structure and procedures. Focus groups will be reconvened for additional feedback on the
      modified intervention, followed by further adjustment. During Phase II, 40 high-risk YMSM
      (ages 18-29 and Facebook users) will be enrolled in a pilot of the modified intervention. The
      intervention will span 4 weeks and contain 8 bi-weekly 30 minute Motivational Interviewing
      (MI) chat-window sessions consisting of a sequential progression of intervention approaches
      tailored to each participant's readiness to change their drug use and high risk sexual
      behavior. Data from Phase II will include pre-post intervention behavioral risk assessments,
      as well as individual interviews with all 40 intervention participants for a qualitative
      evaluation regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention's structure, and
      process. Findings from these interviews (and counselor focus group) will inform the
      fine-tuning of the intervention in preparation for a subsequent randomized control trial
      (RCT).
