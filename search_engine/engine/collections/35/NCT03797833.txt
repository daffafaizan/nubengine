      fetus is in breech position by the end of pregnancy, attempts for external cephalic version
      (ECV) are usually made. The success rate of ECV in nulliparous women is lower than in
      multiparous women. There are studies showing a higher rate of successful ECV's if the mother
      received a low dose spinal anaesthesia (SA). Overall maternal satisfaction was higher with
      SA. These studies, however, did not take parity into account.

      The primary aim of this study is to see if SA can increase the rate of successful ECV's in
      nulliparous women.

      The secondary aims are to evaluate if maternal satisfaction increases and if the rate of CS
      is decreasing using SA during ECV.
