    
      Comparison between Optimal Coherence tomography guidance and Angiography Guidance in
      percutaneous coronary intervention (COCOA) is a prospective, multicentre, randomised,
      open-label, parallel group, active-controlled, superiority trial comparing minimum stent area
      immediately after optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) with those after Angiography-guided PCI with a second generation
      drug-eluting stent.The primary endpoint of the present study was minimum stent area
      immediately after PCI. The secondary endpoint was target vessel failure (defined as a
      composite of cardiac death, target-vessel related myocardial infarction, and ischaemia-driven
      target vessel revascularisation).
