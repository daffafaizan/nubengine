      trial. Ten subjects will be allocated to three dose levels. Intermediate dose levels may be
      applied. A sentinel dosing approach (sequential dosing) will be applied. The entire
      observation period comprises 51 days starting with a 96 hours in-house stay after the first
      dose injection, where discharge is planned for Day 5, followed by one outpatient visit. For
      the second and the third injection dose a 36 hours in-house stay is planned. After the fourth
      dose injection there is also a 96 hour in-house stay where discharge is planned for Day 26,
      followed by five outpatient visits and an End of Trial Visit on Day 51. A blinded evaluation
      of each cohort will be performed by a Trial Safety Group to determine whether the trial will
      progress to the next planned dose level based on the stopping rules specified in the
      protocol.
