      represents a significant public health problem,induced by persistent infection of human
      papillomavirus (HPV). It is known that a significant percentage of CIN regresses
      spontaneously and only a minority of these lesions progress to cervical cancer. CIN-II is an
      intermediate state that can regress to CIN-I or less, or progress to CIN-III spontaneously.
      The rate of spontaneous regression and progression in follow-up studies are around 40-60% and
      10-20%, respectively. Overestimating CIN-II lesions may cause overtreatment by excisional
      treatment and increase the risk of subsequent obstetric complications.

      Patients newly diagnosed with CIN-II colposcopy-directed biopsy who agreed to follow up at
      four months intervals for at least 12 months with cervical cytology and colposcopy, were
      prospectively recruited. p16, ki-67 and NK receptors expression were analyzed in all CIN-II
      biopsies. Total regression, partial regression, persistence and progression rates of CIN-II
      were defined as a final outcome.
