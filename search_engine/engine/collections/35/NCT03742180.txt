      22. Distribution of data was first tested by Shapiro test. Data were presented as the mean
      and standard deviation (SD), median and range or numbers and percentages. For normally
      distributed data, an unpaired t-test was used to compare between mean values of both groups.
      For pain and sedation scores, Mann Whitney U test was used. Fisher's exact test was used for
      comparison of categorical data. The P value â‰¤ 0.05 was considered as the level of statistical
      significance.

      A prior G power analysis was done. Using the results obtained from previous studies (14- 18)
      and assuming an alpha error of 0.05 and beta error 0f 0.2 (power of the study 80 %), a sample
      size of 60 patients per group was calculated. A drop out 10% of cases is expected, so; 33
      cases per group will be required
