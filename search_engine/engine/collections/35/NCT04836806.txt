    
      COVID-19 is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). Patients with COVID-19 may present with a myriad of symptoms ranging from fever
      and cough to more severe symptoms such as shortness of breath. Cetirizine and famotidine are
      commonly administered medications that can be found over-the-counter. They are well tolerated
      and have low potential for drug-drug interaction. With it's anti-inflammatory properties via
      modulation of proinflammatory cytokines, cetirizine may be an effective symptomatic
      therapeutic for COVID-19. With possible antiviral properties, famotidine may have a role in
      therapy as well.

      After a positive COVID test has been confirmed, participants with be randomized to take
      cetirizine and famotidine or a placebo for 10 days and the study medication will be shipped
      to them. Participants will record their symptoms for 30 days and any serious adverse events
      will be followed for up to 60 days.
