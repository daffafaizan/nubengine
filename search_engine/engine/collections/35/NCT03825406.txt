      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by
      abnormal protein which can accumulate and impair various organs, including the heart.
      Research suggests that amyloidosis might be common among TAVR patients, but it is a condition
      that is not routinely evaluated for. We suspect that wildtype amyloidosis may be especially
      common among patients with abnormal vital signs after their TAVR procedure.
