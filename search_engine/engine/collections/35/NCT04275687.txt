      re-irradiation for locoregionally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer using hypofractionated
      technique.

        1. For peripherally located recurrent tumors, stereotactic body radiation therapy is used
           at 5000-6000 cGy in 10 fractions.

        2. For centrally located recurrent tumors, adaptive hypofractionated radiation is used:
           Patients are irradiated at 3000-4000cGy in 6-10 daily fractions in the first course.
           After a four-week interval, patients who have non-progressive disease and an adequate
           pulmonary function undergo adaptive re-planning, and are irradiated at 2400-3500cGy in
           4~7 daily fractions as a boost. Concurrent chemotherapy consists of weekly docetaxel and
           nedaplatin.
