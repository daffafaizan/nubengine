      fast rate that new novel drugs and other therapeutic approaches are required. The purpose of
      this Phase I/II study is to determine whether the intravenous administration of activated
      adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction as a single procedure is safe and efficacious in
      patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Patients will be observed over 12 months following
      the procedure, with 2 weeks, 1 month and tri-monthly diagnostics and life style
      questionaires.
