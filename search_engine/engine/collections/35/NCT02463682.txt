    
      This is a feasibility study of an artificial pancreas (AP) system with our previously
      validated Zone-MPC and Health Monitoring System (HMS) algorithms (ClinicalTraisl.gov:
      NCT01929798) integrated into the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) system. The system will be
      evaluated on 2-3 subjects per site (n=6-9 subjects) for 2 weeks at 3 different sites (William
      Sansum Diabetes Center, University of Virginia, and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Basal rates
      will be adjusted in a run-to-run manner by study physicians prior to the closed-loop phase
      for a maximum of 3 weeks. Subjects will then complete 2 weeks at home use of the Zone-MPC/HMS
      system using the DIAs platform for a closed-loop feasibility trial. The purpose of this pilot
      study is to establish that safe day-and-night use of the Zone-MPC/HMS system integrated into
      the DiAs is achievable in the home environment, to analyze and learn to improve upon the
      run-to- run optimization process, and to collect efficacy data to inform a future larger
      study.
