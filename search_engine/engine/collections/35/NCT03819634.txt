      the Lantern infusion set is worn for up to 10 days. The study is not intended for
      registration purposes or to support a 510(k) submission. The study will be conducted at one
      site: Stanford University.

      This study will enroll 24 subjects (as per FDA approval) to establish the maximum length of
      Lantern infusion set wear when 80% of sets are still functional (excluding accidental
      "pull-outs"). Each participant will place the set and wear it for 10 days or until set
      failure and data will be collected on the cause of set failure. If a set is accidentally
      pulled out, it can be replaced by the subject. Failures are based on:

        1. Presence of serum ketones with hyperglycemia

        2. Unexplained hyperglycemia

        3. Signs of infection at the infusion site

        4. Pump occlusion alarm

        5. Adhesive failure

      Since infusion set failures will occur after variable lengths of wear, regularly scheduled
      visits are unlikely to capture the day of an infusion set failure. Instead the subject will
      be taught how to insert the set, measure erythema and induration with a ruler marked in
      millimeters and to take a picture of the infusion site. Subjects will be instructed to text
      the study team when they remove their infusion set and to send a picture of the infusion site
      and measurements. If there is any evidence of an infection (â‰¥10 mm of erythema or
      induration), they will be asked to come in that day for an unscheduled visit.
