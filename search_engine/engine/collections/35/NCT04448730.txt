      homeostasis and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study is to compare the levels of serum
      betatrophin in overweight and normal weight women with PCOS.

      Material and Method: Thirty-five patients normal weight women with PCOS (BMI<25) and 38 obese
      women with PCOS (BMIâ‰¥25) were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study. Patients
      were selected according to Rotterdam criteria. Serum betatrophin levels were studied by ELISA
      method and then compared between these two groups besides the following additional parameters
      as waist circumference/hip circumference ratio, fasting blood glucose, 75 g OGTT (oral
      glucose tolerance test) results and HOMA-IR levels.
