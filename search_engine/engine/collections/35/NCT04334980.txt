    
      Protocol bacTRL-Spike-1 will be the first-in-human study of bacTRL-Spike, and the
      first-in-human use of orally delivered bacTRL. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of orally delivered bacTRL-Spike vaccine in healthy adults.

      Total anticipated enrollment is n=24. The distribution of the sample size will be as follows:

        -  Group 1 (n=3; Sentinel +2): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 1 billion colony
           forming units (cfu) of Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum);

        -  Group 2 (n=3; Sentinel +2): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 3 billion cfu of
           B. longum;

        -  Group 3 (n=3; Sentinel +2): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 10 billion cfu of
           B. longum;

        -  Group 4 (n=3): Single Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)-defined dose of
           bacTRL-Spike among subjects 56 years of age and older.

        -  Group 5 (n=12): DSMB-defined prime and boost doses of bacTRL-Spike delivered with a
           28-day intervening interval.

      The planned trial duration is 18 months.

      Each participant will remain in the trial for 12-13 months, including a screening phase of up
      to 28 days, intervention phase of 1 day and follow-up phase of 12 months.
