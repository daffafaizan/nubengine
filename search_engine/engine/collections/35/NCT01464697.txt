      (300 mg daily at bedtime) for perimenopausal women living anywhere in Canada. Using the
      self-reported maximum menstrual cycle length in the previous year, women will be stratified
      as in Early Perimenopause (<60 days) or Late Perimenopause (>=60 days). The design includes a
      28-day baseline run-in followed by 12 weeks of randomized therapy.
