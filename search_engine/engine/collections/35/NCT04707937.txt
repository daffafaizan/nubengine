      Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy used to treat patients with gynecological
      cancers. Brachytherapy delivers radiation to cancerous tissue by inserting or placing the
      radiation next to the target tissue. A common side effect that develops as a result of
      repeated brachytherapy is fibrosis, a thickening and hardening of tissue, as well as
      narrowing of the vagina, known as vaginal stenosis. To reduce the impact of vaginal stenosis,
      vaginal dilation is recommended upon discharge of brachytherapy. Vaginal dilation involves
      the insertion of a smooth plastic tube into the vagina 3 to 4 times per week. Despite the
      benefits of vaginal dilation, use of vaginal dilators is low among patients following
      brachytherapy. This poor adherence to vaginal dilator use may be due to embarrassment,
      discomfort, and lack of awareness of the benefits to patients.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the whether an online brachytherapy
      discharge education program increases patient satisfaction with education and care. Secondary
      objectives are to determine whether the online education program increases patient quality of
      life, improves vaginal dilator compliance and reduces rates of vaginal stenosis
      post-treatment.

      Methods:

      The research team will use a randomized, controlled trial study design. The impact of the
      online education program will be identified by comparing the outcomes of participants in the
      intervention arm against those patients in the control arm. Participants will be recruited
      and randomized to one of two arms that will determine whether they will receive the education
      intervention.

      Significance The results from this study will be used to improve the brachytherapy discharge
      education program.
