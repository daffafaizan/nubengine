      results of ventilator associated lung injury. Limited driving pressure and low tidal volume
      ventilation strategies show benefits decreasing mortality in acute respiratory distress
      syndrome, but there are no data in simple acute respiratory failure.

      To compare lung injury score (LIS, Murray score) after invasive mechanical ventilation 7 days
      between groups of limited driving pressure ventilation versus low tidal volume ventilation
      strategies.
