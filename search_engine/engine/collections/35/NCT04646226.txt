      access strategy on the rate of catheter-free dialysis days and access-related infections -
      costs associated with the dialysis vascular access - patient-reported satisfaction with
      different processes of vascular access care (catheter, fistula, or graft) - and the
      relationship between preoperative functional status and incidence of fistula or graft
      maturation failure
