      Cushing disease and may enable patients to avoid additional diagnostic tests such as inferior
      petrosal sinus sampling. However, detecting ACTH producing microadenoma in MRI remains as a
      diagnostic challenge due its small size with its median diameter of 5-mm. Many attempts have
      been made in order to improve the sensitivity of detecting ACTH producing microadenoma. It is
      generally accepted as standard clinical practice to perform dynamic contrast enhanced T1
      weighted image to delineate delayed enhancing microadenonoma in comparison to the background
      enhancement of the normal gland. Despite these attempts, negative MRI findings may occur in
      up to 40% of cases of ACTH producing microadenomas and there is a need to improve its
      detection rate. Theoretically, performing thin slice thickness scans should help detecting
      the lesion but this is unavoidably accompanied with increased level of noise. Deep learning
      based denoising algorithm can be applied to reduce the noise level and potentially increase
      the detection rate of ACTH producing microadenomas. The aim of the study is to evaluate if
      detection of ACTH producing microadenomas can be increased using deep learning based
      denoising MRI.
