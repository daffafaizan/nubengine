      labor or being evaluated for possible indicated delivery will receive information regarding
      the study. Those who consent to participation, if they are then determined to need a cesarean
      birth will be randomized into two groups. The first group will receive pre-operative
      counseling by the obstetrics resident who will be performing the cesarean, the second group
      will receive usual care. The counseling sheet was determined based upon the findings of a
      previous study done at this institution, and addresses four themes that were recurrent
      aspects of patient dissatisfaction after cesarean birth: poor communication, trust of
      physicians, loss of control, and fear of surgery.

      Two weeks after the cesarean section, patients participating in the study are called on the
      phone by one of the investigators. A patient satisfaction survey, using a Likert scale is
      administered. This investigator is blinded as to whether the patient has received the
      additional counseling or not. Comparison of these scores will be used to determine whether
      pre-operative counseling can reduce dissatisfaction in patients undergoing unplanned cesarean
      sections.
