      conjunction with diminished urine output. Unfortunately, deviations in these crude parameters
      of renal function are largely insensitive and late manifestations of AKI, where acute tubular
      necrosis has likely already transpired and therefore well beyond the phase where preventive
      measures may be instituted. Early phase biomarkers, insulin-like growth factor-binding
      protein 7 ("IGFBP7") and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 ("TIMP-2") are critical
      mediators of G1 cell cycle arrest of renal tubular cells during the early phase of cellular
      injury, providing a potential therapeutic window to prevent permanent damage. To date, no
      study has evaluated the efficacy of these early phase renal biomarkers for detecting AKI in
      advanced heart failure patients undergoing cardiac replacement therapies.

      Therefore, the aim of this prospective observational study will be to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the NephroCheckTM to predict AKI in patients undergoing transplant, LVAD
      implant, or TAH implant.
