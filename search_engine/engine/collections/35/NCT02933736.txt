      Phase I study for advanced solid tumor patients. The recommended dose expansion and Phase 2
      is 600mg/d for 3 weeks on and 1 week off. Due to drug pharmacokinetics, the MTD (900mg) dose
      will be used for pre-surgical dosing in order to maximize the opportunity to identify
      relevant tumor pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) endpoints.

      To assess the PK, and PD endpoints listed above, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tumor
      tissue will be collected intraoperatively (for gliomas, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor
      tissue will be collected and analyzed separately). Additionally, blood samples will be
      obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the final ribociclib dose is administered.

      Patients with tumors demonstrating positive PK and PD effects will continue treatment with
      ribociclib (21 days on, 7 days off) after surgery. This will constitute the Phase II
      component of the study. Patients will be treated until unacceptable toxicity is observed, or
      until disease progression as assessed by radiographic or clinical metrics. Preliminary rates
      of progression-free survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas
      treated with ribociclib will be measured through radiographic and clinical response metrics,
      specifically Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and investigator
      discretion. Overall survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas
      treated with ribociclib will be assessed by medical record review and survival follow up.
