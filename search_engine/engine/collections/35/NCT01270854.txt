      few hours after acute traumatic injury. Although Normal Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is
      commonly used in this setting, it causes a hyperchloremic acidosis that may exacerbate
      metabolic derangements that occur after acute injury. Plasmalyte A is a solution that more
      closely matches physiologic electrolyte levels. In this study, we will evaluate whether
      Plasmalyte A results in less disturbance of the base deficit 24 hours following traumatic
      injury than does Normal Saline.
