    
      Alemtuzumab treatment was on a fixed schedule of two treatment courses a year apart for
      participants who received RebifÂ® in one of the prior Genzyme-sponsored studies of alemtuzumab
      or on an as needed schedule (e.g. due to documented evidence of resumed Multiple Sclerosis
      [MS] activity) for participants who had already completed a fixed schedule of treatment with
      alemtuzumab in one of the prior Genzyme-sponsored studies. There was no comparison treatment
      in this study. All participants were required to return to their study site every 3 months
      for neurologic and other assessments. In addition, safety-related laboratory tests and
      surveys were performed at least monthly. Participation in the extension study was at least 48
      months from enrollment. Study duration could be extended to allow participants to remain in
      the study until a follow-up study was available in their country or through month 60 (month
      72 in USA), whichever occurred first.
