      , are prevalent and pervasive . However ,sensori-motor development and self-care activities
      such as bathing, dressing, eating and toileting, remain little explored in comparison to the
      other areas of development. Some children with ASD have difficulty mastering self-care
      skills, which we will call daily living skills .
