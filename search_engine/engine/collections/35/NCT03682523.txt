      time during a patient's stay in acute care will reduce patient's frailty levels more so than
      current standard of care. This study will use a single-center, quasi-experimental time series
      design, with a pre-intervention control group. Fifty participants will be recruited within 24
      hours of admission to a geriatric acute care unit. Both groups will be fitted with a device
      that measures sedentary and active time (accelerometer). Participants in the intervention
      group will have a daily goal for activity and will be provided with real-time feedback on
      attainment of that goal displayed on a bedside tablet. Participants in the intervention group
      who do not independently achieve their goal will be assisted in reducing their sedentary time
      in the afternoon and/or early evening to the maximum level of their ability; this level will
      be determined in consultation with the healthcare team. The primary outcome is a change in
      frailty during hospitalization, measured using a 30-item frailty index. The data collection
      phase is approximately 10 months. Data analysis will take an additional six months (16 months
      total). Knowledge-users will be involved during all stages of the project. The data generated
      from this study will enable us to scale up this intervention nationally and internationally.
      If the intervention is successful, it will warrant a study to implement the intervention as
      part of standard care. Ultimately, this study will inform guidelines to limit patients'
      sedentary behaviors in acute care.
