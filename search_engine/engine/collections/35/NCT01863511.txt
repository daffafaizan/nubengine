      different approaches to volume removal. Enrolled patients will be evaluated for target weight
      to be removed. Patients will be randomized to usual care (UC), usual care plus tolvaptan
      (UC+T) or ultrafiltration (UF), within 12 hours of presentation.

      Treatment in the UC and UC+T arms will begin with a furosemide bolus(double the home dose or
      if unavailable, 60mg) and continue with a drip(10 or 20 mg/hr). In addition the UC+T group
      will be treated with tolvaptan 30 mg orally once daily.

      Patients in the UF arm will be treated with UF administered through a brachial line or a
      catheter in the internal jugular vein. Loop and thiazide diuretics will be discontinued,
      although aldosterole antagonists will be continued.

      Urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalcin(uNGAL)levels are elevated in renal
      dysfunction and may be a sensitive biomarker to distinguish between intrinsic renal damage
      and reversible, transient prerenal azotemia.Characterizing the changes in uNGAL levels during
      the course of ADHF therapy, in comparison with patient weight, BUN and creatinine levels is
      an important step in establishing the role of this potential promising biomarker in ADHF
      treatment strategies.

      Protocol highlights for all patients include:

      Baseline labs and daily through day 4 and at discharge(BMP, BNP, CBC, urine creatinine and
      sodium, uNGAL)

        -  Daily am weights

        -  Daily volume status:total intake, urine output, ultrafiltrate volume

        -  Collect all urine and ultrafiltrate in a 24 hour collection bag, record volume,
           creatinine and Na levels

        -  length of stay

        -  hospital day 4: Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire

        -  Cost of hospitalization
