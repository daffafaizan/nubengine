        1. We hypothesize that 0.2 mg/kg of methadone will result in decreased postoperative
           hydromorphone consumption compared to hydromorphone alone in opioid na√Øve patients or
           patients who are taking less than the equivalent of 15 mg IV morphine a day undergoing
           lumbar interbody fusion.

        2. We hypothesize that the incidence of opioid related postoperative side effects will not
           be increased by the administration of methadone in the operating room.
