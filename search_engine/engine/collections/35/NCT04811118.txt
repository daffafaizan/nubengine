      compare the test drug (T, albumin-bound docetaxel) to the reference drug (R, Taxotere).
      Approximately 28 subjects will be randomized to the two treatment sequences (T-R or R-T) at
      the ratio of 1:1. Each enrolled subject will receive an intravenous infusion of the reference
      drug and the test drug in two treatment periods per the randomization schedule. The treatment
      periods will be separated by a washout period of 21 to 35 days. After completing two cycles
      of treatments, subjects may continue to receive the treatment used in the second cycle
      according to the responses (up to 1 year).
