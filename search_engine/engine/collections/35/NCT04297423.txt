      adenoma detection rate) of 1L PEG plus ascorbate versus magnesium citrate plus picosulphate
      in subjects undergoing colonoscopy in a colorectal cancer screening programme. We also will
      compare the Lesion Detection Rate, the quality of colon cleansing (Boston classification)
      overall and by segments, the tolerability and satisfaction and the rate of adverse effects
      experienced with intake of these products.

      Methodology: A comparative, parallel, randomized, single-centre, low-intervention clinical
      trial to be conducted at the CCR screening unit of Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona that will
      include 1,002 participants.

      Subjects will complete a Tolerability and Satisfaction Questionnaire after completing the
      bowel preparation. Findings (polyps, CRC, or other lesions) and quality of bowel cleansing
      will be collected from the colonoscopy report.
