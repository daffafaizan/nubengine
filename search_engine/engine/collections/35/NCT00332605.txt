      combination medication (NAC plus naltrexone) or placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that
      NAC plus naltrexone will be effective and well tolerated in patients with methamphetamine
      dependence compared to placebo. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment
      of a public health crisis that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.
