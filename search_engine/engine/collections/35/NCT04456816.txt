    
      This study is an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study
      with repeated doses of AP1189. The study population will consist of patients with idiopathic
      membranous nephropathy (iMN) who are on ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker
      treatment.

      Following a successful screening, subjects who fulfill the enrollment criteria will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio in group A and B:

        -  Group A (12 subjects): AP1189 dose 100 mg, once daily for 4 weeks (28 days) as an add-on
           to any ongoing treatment, including ACE inhibitors/ angiotensin II receptor blocker

        -  Group B (6 subjects): placebo for 4 weeks (28 days) as an add-on to any ongoing
           treatment including ACE inhibitors/ angiotensin II receptor blocker.
