      obstructive sleeep apnea syndrome, pneumonia, stimulus-induced myoclonus, cases of falls,
      mechanical ventilation, restrictive lung disease. It was also reported that patients with CLS
      had problems with eating and feeding functions. However there is no study investigating
      chewing and swallowing functions of this patient population. Therefore, the investigators
      have three main purposes:

        1. To chewing and swallowing function in a boy with CLS diagnosis who was referred due to
           coughing during eating, long-lasting wheezing, sputum and inability to intake solid food

        2. To investigate the effects of two months of chewing and swallowing training program

        3. To present long term follow-up effects on chewing and swallowing function.
