      directly re-balancing the brain's control of hunger and satiety is necessary for sustained
      and long-term therapy. n=6 patients will be recruited in this Phase 1 DBS trial. The proposed
      research will hope to improve personal health among the young adults involved in this study
      by improving quality of life and avoiding long-term cardiovascular morbidities. Furthermore,
      this study will elucidate what brain regions drive excessive hunger and develop a treatment
      that attempts to reverse these abnormalities.
