      singleton preterm infant between 24 and 28 weeks gestation will be randomized prior to
      delivery into one of two treatment arms. Common reasons for needing to be delivered at this
      early gestational age include but are not limited to: preterm labor not responding to
      tocolytic medications, incompetent cervix with cervical dilation and no contractions,
      clinical chorioamnionitis requiring delivery for maternal/fetal benefit, severe preeclampsia,
      severe growth restriction with a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. The first arm will
      include active milking of the umbilical cord toward the neonate's umbilicus prior to cord
      clamping at delivery while the second arm will not include this intervention and will have
      their respective cord immediately clamped in the usual fashion post delivery (control).
