      peripheral small fiber nerves and a quantifiable assessment of nerve abnormalities in a low
      risk, non-invasive manner. Therefore, our goal is to develop a non-invasive diagnostic
      protocol as a quantitative tool for the evaluation of DPN. The protocol and the tool we seek
      to develop could ultimately be used in large-scale clinical trials and in clinical practice
      to assess DPN severity and progression.

      We hypothesize that in vivo confocal imaging of the corneal nerve layer is a clinically
      viable method to assess and quantify systemic peripheral nerve health. We emphasize that this
      imaging method can be used in both humans and animal models to provide quantifiable,
      longitudinal data on the same live individual to advance our understanding of the development
      and progression of DPN, and to evaluate treatment effectiveness.
