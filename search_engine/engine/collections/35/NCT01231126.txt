      labor that were evaluated by the hemoglobin dosage pre and post delivery for estimate the
      blood loss at delivery. Patients were submitted to transabdominal obstetric ultrasound and
      basal cardiotocography. Procedures were taken for induced labor delivery with misoprostol
      25mcg, by vaginal rout. The pills were administered each 6 hours in a maximum number of six.
      The control group was formed by 30 patients that began an spontaneously labor and 30 patients
      that achieved caesarians electively. The study of hemoglobin before and after delivery was
      evaluated through ANOVA to repeated measures, where it was verified the time effect (pre and
      post delivery) and the effect of the group (with and without use of misoprostol).
