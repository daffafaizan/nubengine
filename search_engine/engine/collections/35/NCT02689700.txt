      HCMV-/VZV-IgG-antibodies and the concentration of neutralizing IgG-antibodies against HCMV
      and VZV in maternal blood and in fetal bloodstream. Then the investigators compare the data
      of mother and newborn. Therefore, the investigators use the following blood samples:

      Mother: Venous blood sample taken at birth (+/- three days)

      Newborn: Blood sample of umbilical cord (= fetal bloodstream) taken immediately after birth.

      The investigators assign the data of each newborn (gestational age at birth) to the data of
      their respective mother for statistical evaluation. After finishing the study the
      investigators will destroy all residual blood.
