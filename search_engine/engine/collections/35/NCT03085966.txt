      memory T cells (Tcm cells), that are able to mount an attack against cancer cells. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of patients' own
      immune cells combined with the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRH-a) for
      treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
