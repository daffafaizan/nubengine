      of SedLineÂ® sensor for neuromonitoring.

      The hypothesis is that placing the central sensors in the montage approximately 2 cm below
      the standard recommended placement, across the nasal bridge and then running under the eyes
      to the normal temporal leads placement would put the entire montage out of the operative
      field and would still have corresponding values and EEG signals.

      The primary outcome measure is to monitor and compare processed electroencephalograph (EEG)
      values (PSi- Patient State Index, SEFL- Spectral Edge Frequency Left, SEFR- Spectral Edge
      Frequency Right, SR-Suppression Ratio, EMG-Electromyography, ARTF-Artifact) and EEG
      waveforms, on both sensors (standard-Forehead and alternative-Nasal)

      Other parameters that will be measure are patient demographics (age, sex, surgery, ASA
      status, weight, height, BMI).
