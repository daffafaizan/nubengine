      have shown that this drug decreases bone formation, decreasing bone density and bone
      thickness in children. Prednisone induced osteopenia, or low bone density, can be worsened by
      the effects of the underlying disease, such as delayed growth and maturation, malnutrition,
      and increased bone resorption (removal) by inflammatory compounds. The combined effects of
      decreased bone formation and increased resorption may be particularly detrimental to the
      growing skeleton.

      Subjects will include 15 newly diagnosed NS patients, 60 patients with pre-existing NS, 90
      patients with newly diagnosed CD, 45 patients diagnosed within the last two years and 200
      healthy controls of similar age, gender and ethnicity. Participants will visit the Children's
      Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) three times over a 12-month period for assessment of bone
      mineralization and turnover, fracture history, dietary calcium intake, physical activity,
      growth, body composition, muscle strength and glucocorticoid exposure.
