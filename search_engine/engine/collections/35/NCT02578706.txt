      participants on stable ART randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to aspirin 81mg daily vs clopidogrel
      75mg daily vs placebo for 24 weeks. A subset of patients in each arm will participate in a
      sub-study to evaluate thrombogenicity, to be performed prior to the first study treatment and
      at 24 weeks of study treatment. 10 HIV uninfected control subjects will participate the study
      to evaluate baseline characteristics.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the impact of aspirin as compared to clopidogrel on
      immune activation and inflammation in HIV infected, ART treated adults. This will be
      determined by measuring the change in the clinically relevant soluble marker of inflammation
      sCD14 over 24 weeks of study drug. Secondary objectives will be to measure safety and
      tolerability, to measure the effects of study drugs on important soluble markers of
      inflammation (sCD163, IL-6, d-dimer, sTNFRI and II), by measuring monocyte subsets (CD14,
      CD16, CD69), by measuring platelet activation by light transmission aggregometry,
      monocyte-platelet aggregates, and soluble CD40L, by measuring clot formation kinetics by
      thromboelastography, and in a subset of patients, by measuring thrombogenicity by Badimon
      Chamber and cholesterol uptake by monocytes.
