      TIPN. Volunteers with a diagnosis of breast cancer and chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy, secondary to treatment with paclitaxel or docetaxel, will be enrolled. This study
      involves the administration of cannabinoids in different strength capsules. The primary
      outcome measures include measures of pain and functional impairment (non-painful symptoms).
      The scales will include: 1) Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI) for pain severity ; and 2)
      BPI pain interference subscale for functional impairment. The study outcomes will also
      include secondary measures of perception, which will be performed in the laboratory.
