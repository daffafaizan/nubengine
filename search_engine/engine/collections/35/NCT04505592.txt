      prognosis. COVID-19 has been associated with a hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state,
      leading to a range of thromboembolic complications from pulmonary embolism to ischemic
      stroke. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that the associated acute respiratory failure is,
      at least in part, due to pulmonary vascular disease caused by micro- and/or macro-emboli,
      creating pulmonary vascular shunting and dead-space ventilation. In this placebo-controlled,
      double blind, randomized, Phase II dose escalation study, we plan to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy and safety of low-dose IV bolus tenecteplase together with anticoagulation compared
      with control patients on therapeutic anticoagulation alone in hospitalized adults diagnosed
      with COVID-19 respiratory failure with elevated D-dimer. We believe these patients can be
      successfully treated without significantly increasing the risk of major bleeding while
      improving recovery rates, shorten hospitalization time, and perhaps ultimately prove to
      improve survival.
