      airway pressure (PAP) modes for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), complicated
      by CSA secondary to opioid use. Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups, utilizing a
      cross-over design to evaluate the two modes with the subject as their own control.

      Subjects will be asked to undergo two PSG studies; one with ASV titration and one with
      bi-level treatment, using the current pressure prescription. The study comprises two visits.
      Subjects will be asked to complete patient satisfaction questionnaires following their PSG
      studies. It is anticipated that total subject participation will be no longer than one month.
