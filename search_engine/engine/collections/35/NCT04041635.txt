      pain in minor procedures has not been studied in depth. There are no studies that evaluate
      the reduction of visual and auditory stimuli in a combined way.

      Impact: It is easy to incorporate the reduction of visual and auditory stimuli into nursing
      practice.

      Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of the reduction of visual and auditory stimuli on pain during
      venipuncture in premature newborns of 32-36 weeks of gestation.

      Design: Open, randomized, non-blind parallel clinical trial. Methods: Study to take place at
      the neonatal intensive care unit at the Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital in
      2019-2021. 56 recently born babies between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation will participate. The
      dependent variable is level of pain determined using the Premature Infant Pain Profile
      (PIPP). The intervention will be assigned randomly using the random.org software. Data
      analysis will be carried out using the IBM SPSS v.25 software assuming a level of
      significance of 5%.

      The results of this study could have a direct impact on clinical practice.
