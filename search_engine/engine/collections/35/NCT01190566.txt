      subsequent surgery were prospectively enrolled. DCE-MRI and FDG-PET scan were performed
      before and after the 1st cycle of chemotherapy. MR imaging parameters and SUV on PET scan
      within a tumor were analyzed. Clinicopathologic (age, clinical tumor stage, hormonal receptor
      status, and surgery type) and imaging parameters were compared according to the pathological
      response.
