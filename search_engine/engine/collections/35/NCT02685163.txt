      The study was randomized, placebo-controlled. After enrollment, 3 days before entering the
      study, all subjects performed an exercise stress test. They were then randomly allocated to
      the treatment sequence with 100 mg of natural anti-oxidant ice cream or milk chocolate
      ice-cream (control icecream) in a cross-over single-blind design. There was 1 week wash-out
      between 2 phases of the study.

      Markers of oxidative stress (D-ROMs and H2O2); serum antioxidant status (FRAP), NO
      bioavailability (NOx), the endothelium flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD and the RHI by Endopat
      2000) were evaluated in fasting condition at baseline (time 0) and 2 hours after the
      ingestion of the anti-oxidant or control ice-creams. The exercise stress test was performed
      before randomization and 2 hours after each ice-cream meal test. In both experiments, the
      ice-cream was consumed within 10 min.

      Each subject was asked to refrain from any kind of medication, diet integrators, intensive
      physical activity and to avoid consumption of polyphenols rich foods, such cocoa-containing
      products, red wine, tea within the previously 2 weeks. All participants gave written informed
      consent, and the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of La Sapienza University
      of Rome (Rif: 3727, Prot: 2325/15).
