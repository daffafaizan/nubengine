    
      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study aimed to assess long-term safety and
      efficacy of SPN-812 ER when administered alone or in conjunction with an Food and Drug
      Administration-approved Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication in the
      treatment of ADHD in pediatric subjects who have participated in a previous blinded study of
      SPN-812 ER (812P202, 812P301, 812P302, 812P303, and 812P304). All pediatric subjects who
      complete a blinded study of SPN-812 ER will have the option to participate in this study in
      which all subjects will receive SPN-812 ER at an optimized dose. After an initial dose,
      subjects will enter an dose optimization phase of up to twelve weeks. Following optimization,
      subjects will return to the clinic every 3 months for up to 72 months or until the subject
      discontinues or the availability of SPN 812 on the market, whichever occurs first.
