      inhibition in stage III and IV melanoma. This involves the addition of a treatment called
      brachytherapy to planned immunotherapy with nivolumab (also known as OpdivoÂ®). Brachytherapy
      is a form of radiation therapy where radioactive pellets are placed within a tumor to
      temporarily irradiate the tumor at a low level. This is the first time that this combination
      (immunotherapy and brachytherapy) has been used in humans.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of combining LDR with immunotherapy,
      determine safety and feasibility, generate a toxicity profile, and evaluate response.
