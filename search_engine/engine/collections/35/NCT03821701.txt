      systemic effective drugs has been applied in these patients. European Society of Cardiology
      (ESC) has recommended ARNI Sacubitril/Valsartan as first-line drugs in replacement of ACEI
      (I, B) in 2016 for these patients. While American College of Cardiology and The American
      Heart Association (ACC/AHA) made a first-line recommendation that patients with heart failure
      due to reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) could be administrated ARNI directly. Hence, we
      apply this trial to find if ARNI could replace ACEI/ARB to provide insights for better
      treatment of chronic heart failure in China. This study is a randomized controlled
      multicenter clinical trial, in which about 340 patients with newly diagnosed or prior
      diagnosed chronic heart will be recruited. Patients will be randomly divided into
      Angiotensin-Neprilysin Inhibition (ARNI) group and ACEI/ARB group. All-cause death, cardiac
      death and re-hospitalization due to heart failure will be evaluated in 1, 3, 6, 12 months
      after recruitment. Other safety assessment including left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF), 6 minutes walk test will be followed up as well.
