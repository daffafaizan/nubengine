      allows for a better understanding of the global and local activity of the cerebral neocortex.

      In 2012, following publications by Claude Berrou and Vincent Gripon's Internet, introducing
      new principles of coding information based on graphical representations in connectionist
      networks, we approached this team to test biological plausibility of this theory in vivo with
      EEG.

      The central concept is the mental information, defined as all elements of knowledge acquired
      by the long-term memory on which the reason can build to try to respond to new problems.
      According to this new theory, these elements of knowledge called qualia or features should be
      connected within cliques networks. However, we currently do not have graphs comparing methods
      to measure a good index of both spatial and topological similarity between graphs with high
      resolution electroencephalography.

      For this new study, we propose to combine the strengths of several existing methods of graph
      comparison which, on top of this, will be especially adapted to the specific context of the
      analysis of the graphs in the cerebral cortex.

      The skills used are diverse: information theory, mathematics, graph theory, computer science,
      neuropsychology, signal processing and neurology.
