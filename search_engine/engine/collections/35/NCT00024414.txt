        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate or prostate-specific antigen response,
           duration of response, and time to disease progression in patients with metastatic
           hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with DHA-paclitaxel.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive DHA-paclitaxel IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses, and off study.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
