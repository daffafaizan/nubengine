      local infiltration into surgical wounds. The formulation is designed to slowly release the
      ropivacaine over 36-72 hours. By providing local analgesia over a long time span, the need
      for systemic analgesics is expected to be reduced. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the safety and early efficacy of PRF110 in bunionectomy surgery, to measure the
      pharmacokinetic profile of PRF110 over 72 hours and evaluate the duration of analgesia
      witnessed in the surgical setting.
