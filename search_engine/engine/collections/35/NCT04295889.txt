      with an increased incidence of kidney failure and cardiovascular disease (CVD). To tackle
      this burden, screening for CKD among the general population could be beneficial to allow
      early detection and treatment. In the last decades, elevated albuminuria has increasingly
      been recognized as an early marker of generalized vascular endothelial damage, that predicts
      CKD and CVD progression.

      It has been estimated that approximately 6% of the general population has elevated
      albuminuria, and that the majority of these subjects are not known yet with this abnormality.
      Among these subjects, many have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and/or impaired kidney
      function, that often is also not known yet. Early detection of elevated albuminuria may be
      important because it gives the opportunity to invite subjects that test positive for further
      screening for CKD and CVD risk factors. Thus these risk factors for CKD and CVD progression
      could be treated in an early stage.

      Population screening for albuminuria could be justified according to the WHO criteria of
      Wilson and Jungner , because CKD has important consequences for subjects, the course of the
      disease is initially symptomless, and there are treatment methods available. However,
      implementation research to validate screening the general population for albuminuria and
      related health consequences is lacking, as are cost-effectiveness studies.

      In the current study we aim to develop a home-based screening technique for detecting
      elevated albuminuria. We will investigate two screening methods, and evaluate their yield and
      cost-effectiveness.
