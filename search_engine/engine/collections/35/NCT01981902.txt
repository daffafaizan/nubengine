      content in volunteers before and after marathon training runs to detect dehydration. Two
      slightly different devices can be used to detect dehydration. 1). diffuse optical
      spectroscopy and 2). spatial frequency domain imaging-modulated imaging The researchers can
      determined by use other methods to assess the level of dehydration status in runners. These
      methods will include taking weight and temperature before and after run, skin-fold
      measurements pre and post run, and obtaining saliva samples from before and after run. The
      researchers can determine the study use non-invasive, laser light technology measure tissue
      water concentrations, as an indicator of dehydration.
