      natural supplementary dietary product, on the immune function of prostate cancer patients and
      patients with non-cancerous conditions of the prostate. According to limited published
      scientific research and clinical studies, Reishi mushroom extract may support the body's
      immune function. According to cancer immunology research, at early stage of tumor
      development, the immune system can mount defensive actions to eliminate or inhibit tumor
      growth. This study is to examine the specific effect of Mikei® Red Reishi Essence EX on the
      immune function of prostate cancer patients and patients with non-cancerous conditions of the
      prostate.
