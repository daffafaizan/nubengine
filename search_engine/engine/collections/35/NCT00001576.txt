      1 hour hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with escalating dose melphalan.
      Postoperatively, patients will be treated with hepatic arterial infusion of floxuridine
      (FUDR), 0.2 mg/kg/day and leucovorin (LV), 15 mg/M(2)/day as a 2-week continuous infusion
      regimen. Hepatic and systemic toxicity, response to treatment, duration of response, and
      survival will be followed.
