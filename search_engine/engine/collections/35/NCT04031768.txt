      (BP) measurements obtained for screening, diagnosis and management of hypertension. This
      recommended wait time is often not adhered to and is cited as a barrier to regular screening
      due to length of time, clinic workflow and provider burden. It is unclear if BPs obtained at
      different rest intervals would provide clinically similar measurements. This study therefore
      aims to determine if BPs obtained immediately or after 2 minutes are rest are non-inferior to
      the BPs obtained after the guideline recommended 5 minutes of rest. It also aims to determine
      the time required to measure BP from start to finish, to allow for easier identification of
      other potential barriers to regular BP screening practices in busy clinical settings.
