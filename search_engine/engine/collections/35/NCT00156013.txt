      date in the clinical studies, with numerous responses observed in heavily pre-treated
      patients with relapsed/refractory ALL or AML. Dose escalation of clofarabine in patients with
      solid tumors and lymphoproliferative disorders has been limited because grade 3 and 4
      myelosuppression was considered acceptable in patients with acute leukemia, provided that
      hematologic recovery occurred within 6 weeks of therapy , and dose escalation has proceeded
      as high as 40 mg/m2 in this patient population. Furthermore, no responses were observed in a
      recent trial in which patients with relapsed CLL were treated with clofarabine 2 mg/m2, an
      indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder indicating that low doses are likely to be
      ineffective in patients with aggressive NHL. (Personal Communication with ILEX Products,

      This Phase I/II study will evaluate escalating doses of clofarabine in patients with relapsed
      and refractory diffuse large cell B-cell NHL starting at a dose of 4 mg/m2/day for 5
      consecutive days and repeated every 28 days for a maximum of 6 cycles. This dosing regimen
      should be evaluated in this patient population because there is no standard therapy at
      relapse and grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression is frequently observed with traditional NHL
      salvage. Additionally, patients will receive granulocyte colony stimulating factors at the
      discretion of the investigator. Antifungal and antibacterial prophylaxis will be administered
      to minimize the risk of infection.
