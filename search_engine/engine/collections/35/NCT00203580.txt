      heparin followed by long-term oral anticoagulant therapy. Improvements in the methods of
      clinical trials and the use of accurate objective tests to detect venous thromboembolism have
      made it possible to perform a series of randomized trials to evaluate various treatments of
      venous thromboembolism.

      The specific objectives of the Main LITE Study are:

        -  to determine if low-molecular-weight heparin, given subcutaneously once daily without
           laboratory monitoring, is more effective than adjusted oral warfarin sodium in the
           reduction of mortality rate.

        -  to determine if such a low-molecular-weight heparin therapy is more cost-effective than
           present standard care methods.

        -  to determine the incidence of Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin 20210A mutant genetic
           abnormalities.
