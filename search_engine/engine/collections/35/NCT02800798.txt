      retardation (IUGR).

      Since the gold standard diagnosis of OSA is polysomnogram which is limited by cost and
      availability. Therefore, various screening tools were proposed in order to identify high risk
      OSA patient such as Stop-bang questionnaire.

      From the previous study, Stop-bang showed a high predictive performance and the score equal
      or higher than 3 determines high risk for OSA.
