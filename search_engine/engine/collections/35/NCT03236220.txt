    
      Acute leukemia patients with complete remission, whose bone marrow endothelial cells were
      less than 0.1% detected before haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
      receive NAC (orally at dosages of 400mg 3 times per day). NAC treatment begins from 14 days
      pre-allotransplant to 2 months after-allotransplant continuously in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The effect of NAC on hematopoietic stem cells,
      megakaryocytes, immunologic subsets, and the elements of bone marrow microenvironment will be
      monitored pre- and post-allotransplant.

      Drug：N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is orally administrated at dosages of 400mg 3 times per day.
      NAC treatment begins from 14 days pre-allotransplant to 2 months after-allotransplant
      continuously in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Participant：Acute leukemia patients with CR, whose bone marrow endothelial cells were less
      than 0.1% detected before haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
