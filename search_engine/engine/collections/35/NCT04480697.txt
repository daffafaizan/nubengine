      6 cohorts (8 subjects/cohort) with dose levels of 10mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg and 150
      mg respectively. Blood samples will be collected for safety, PK and PD assessments. After the
      completion of Cohort 2 (20 mg) in SAD study, following a 7-day washout period, the same 8
      subjects will receive another single oral dose of 20 mg HPG1860 after a standard high
      fat/high calorie breakfast (the fed condition). PK blood samplings will be collected and Cmax
      and AUC will be used for assessing the food effect. In MAD study, there are 3 cohorts (8
      subjects/cohort) with dose levels of 10mg, 30mg and 90 mg, respectively and dosing regimen is
      once daily for 14 consecutive days. Blood samples will be collected for safety, PK and PD
      assessments.
