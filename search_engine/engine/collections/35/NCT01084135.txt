      Research Unit of Duke University Medical Center and at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI).
      Sixteen evaluable subjects will be enrolled at Duke and 24 evaluable subjects will be
      enrolled at KKI. The study consists of four visits, a screening visit (-4 weeks), a baseline
      visit (week 0); a safety visit at week 10, and a final/termination visit at week 20.

      The specific aims of this study are to: a) investigate efficacy of rivastigmine tartrate
      treatment; b) build upon our open-label treatment results of overall function and language
      improvement in adolescents with Down syndrome (DS) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial; and c) investigate other specific cognitive domains that may selectively
      respond to rivastigmine tartrate treatment.

      The original IRB-approved protocol included the Parent/Caregiver Rating Form of the Vineland
      Adaptive Behavior Scales- Second Edition (VABS-II) . The protocol was amended to replace the
      Parent/Caregiver Rating Form of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales- Second Edition
      (VABS-II) with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition, Survey Interview Form.
      The protocol was also amended to extend the trial from 12 weeks to 20 weeks. Due to the
      changes in the amended protocol the subject enrolled prior to the IRB amendment will not be
      included in the data analysis section.
