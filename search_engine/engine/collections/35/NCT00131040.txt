      whole-body inflammatory response in cardiac surgery patients that is linked to activation of
      circulating white blood cells. The investigators propose to use a technique to track the
      movement of white blood cells into the skin of patients during bypass surgery. The skin
      blisters will be elicited by application of the blistering agent cantharidin to the forearm
      of volunteer patients. This will allow the investigators to study the activation state of
      white blood cells that enter tissues during bypass surgery and to determine whether aprotinin
      has any beneficial effect with regards to inflammatory status of these cells.

      The investigators propose that white blood cell trafficking into the blisters will increase
      following the use of the heart-lung machine and that the effect of aprotinin will be to
      ablate this.
