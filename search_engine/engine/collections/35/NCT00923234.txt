      or del (5q) as single aberration are poor prognostic markers. Overall, the complete response
      rate for conventionally treated patients with newly-diagnosed AML with chromosome 5
      abnormalities is about 31% to 37 % and all patients rapidly relapse if not rescued by
      allogeneic HSCT. The situation is almost similar in patients with high-risk MDS.Vidaza® has
      been shown in clinical trials to achieve remission rates in about 29% (CR+PR) of the patients
      while a total of 49% achieve improvement of blood counts.Revlimid® is also able to achieve
      complete remissions in advanced MDS and even overt leukemia with or without chromosome 5
      abnormalities. Nevertheless, response rates are lower compared to low-risk MDS (IPSS
      Low/INT-1). Therefore, Revlimid® seems to be too weak as a single agent, but a promising
      compound for a combination therapy.
