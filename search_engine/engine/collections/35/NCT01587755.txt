    
      A Topical Treatment Optimisation Programme (TTOP) has been developed by the sponsor together
      with Patient Boards and an Expert Advisory Board. This tool is created to address patients'
      non-adherence in topical therapy and the resulting underperformance of such treatments in
      controlling psoriatic disease. The study addresses the effect of the relationship between the
      patient and the health care professional, one of the important factors that can affect
      treatment adherence and therapeutic efficacy. The TTOP will be compared to standardised
      regular care (called 'non-TTOP'). It is intended to clinically show the importance of an
      optimised contact between the patient and health care professional.
