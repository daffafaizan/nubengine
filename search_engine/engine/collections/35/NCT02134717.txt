      immunomodulatory effect on the granulomatous inflammation of pulmonary sarcoidosis. The
      specific aim of this proposal is the investigate the effect of CCR5 inhibition on the
      trafficking of mononuclear cells to the lung, skin, peripheral blood in subjects with active
      sarcoidosis exposed to the CCR5 inhibitor, maraviroc. A second aim will be to isolate by cell
      sorting cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+CCR5+ T cells for amplified gene expression
      profiling before and after CCR5 inhibition, experiments the investigators believe will
      elucidate genes associated with downstream activation and inhibition of CCR5 receptor
      function.
