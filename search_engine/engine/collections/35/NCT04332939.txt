      several studies, physical exercises are effective to reduce chronic pain in elderly. However,
      it seems that exercises are not effective for everyone. One of the hypotheses raised is that
      the people in whom the exercises have no effect would be those with an alteration of the
      corticospinal tract. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive
      neurostimulation technique known to facilitate the corticospinal tract when applied over the
      motor cortex.

      Elderly suffering from chronic pain will be recruited in this double-blind, parallel-group,
      randomised control trial. Participants will be randomized to receive exercises combined to
      real tDCS (5 daily sessions, 2 mA, 20 minutes) or to sham tDCS. Intervention will last 8
      weeks at a rate of 3 workouts per week.
