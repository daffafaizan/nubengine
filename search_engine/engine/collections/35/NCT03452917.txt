      cardiac arrest are unknown. A significant negative hemodynamic effect from nitrite would
      decrease the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital, increase rate of re-arrest, or
      increase the need for vasopressor support in the field. In Seattle/King County, typically 40%
      of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients attended to by paramedics have Return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and are admitted to the hospital. In this study, 1500 patients
      with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are undergoing resuscitation by paramedics will be
      randomized to receive placebo (n=500) or 45 mg IV (n=500) or 60 mg dose (n=500) of sodium
      nitrite. The study will have 80% power to detect an absolute increase in hospital admission
      rate of 8% (1-sided .05 level test for each of the two comparisons (45 mg vs placebo and 60
      mg vs placebo, no adjustment for multiple comparisons), with a hospital admission rate of 40%
      in the placebo group and with one interim analysis and stopping only for potential futility
      and/or harm). The investigators will examine the proportion of patients who survive to
      discharge as a secondary measure of efficacy.

      Patients will be eligible for this study if:

        1. Intravenous access (IV)/intraosseous access(IO)

        2. Cardiac arrest, either Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or non-VF patients receiving
           Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) by Seattle/King County paramedics.

        3. Age 18 years or older

        4. Comatose

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. Traumatic cause of cardiac arrest

        2. Prisoner, pregnancy, age less than 18 (special population/vulnerable population)

        3. Known DNAR

        4. Drowning as cause of arrest.
