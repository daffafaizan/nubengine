      PAD is associated with a major decline in walking functional status and claudication is the
      most frequent symptom. Current claudication therapies are associated with significant
      limitations. Pharmacotherapy cilostazol and supervised exercise are recommended in 2016
      AHA/ACC Guideline on the management of lower extremity PAD patients with claudication, but
      cilostazol may not achieve an ideal response rate, and supervised exercise efficacy may be
      limited by co-morbidities and medicare reimburse. Furthermore endovascular procedure may not
      be feasible, durable or cost-effective, especially in femoropopliteal arteries.

      SDT is a novel anti-inflammatory regimen to atherosclerosis with non-invasive, plaque-based,
      macrophage-targeted characteristics. We hypothesize that reducing local arterial inflammation
      of affected limb will ameliorate claudication symptom in patients with PAD. The main
      objectives of this trial are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SDT in patients with
      symptomatic femoropopliteal PAD.

      Thirty-two eligible participants will be randomly assigned to SDT or sham-control groups.
      Results of PET/CT are the prespecified primary endpoint.
