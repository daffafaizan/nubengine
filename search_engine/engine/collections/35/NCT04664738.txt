    
      This is an open label phase 1 study of PEP (a leukocyte depleted blood preparation derived
      from human U.S. sourced pooled apheresed platelets) in patients with at least two donor
      split-thickness skin graft wounds. One donor site will be treated with the standard
      post-operative dressing, while the other site will be treated with PEP or PEP+TISSEEL and
      covered with a standard dressing. TISSEEL is a commercially available fibrin sealant.
