      will be offered participation in the study. Efforts will also be made to recruit patients
      through physician or treating health care professional referral and advertisements. One
      hundred and fifty consenting women will be enrolled. Up to three additional study visits will
      be scheduled: At the enrollment, if an ultrasound-confirmed gestational age is not available
      in the woman's medical record, a transvaginal ultrasound will be performed. If the woman is
      56-63 days gestation on the day of enrollment, she will be asked to return weekly until she
      reaches 71-77 days. If the woman is 64-70 days gestation, she will be asked to return weekly
      until she reaches 78-84 days. If the woman is less than 56 days gestation, she will be asked
      to return for the three research visits at the appropriate time to provide the urine samples
      and blood draws. Women will have one visit during each of their three assigned gestational
      age weeks. At each visit, women will provide a urine sample for an MLPT and have a blood draw
      to measure serum hCG.
