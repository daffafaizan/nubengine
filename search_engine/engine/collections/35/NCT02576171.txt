      impairment in the lives of the affected. In spite of CBT being the most effective treatment,
      evidence suggests that many young people with this disorder do not have access to
      good-quality CBT. Internet-based CBT is, as numerous prior studies have shown, an effective
      method to treat psychiatric conditions in adults, but little is known about ICBT for
      adolescents and there are but a few controlled studies on ICBT for children and adolescents
      with anxiety disorders. This pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a
      blended ICBT-treatment where internet-based and group-based sessions are combined.
      Furthermore, as ICBT is a novel format in the treatment of psychological problems in young
      people, it is essential to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the technical
      solutions that carry the active treatment. The study will also include genotyping of
      participants to further our understanding of etiology of SAD and to explore the relationship
      between genetic variations and treatment outcome. Additionally, as there is little known
      about the affect of ASD symptoms on treatment outcome in face-to-face CBT in general, and in
      ICBT in particular, the association between autistic traits and treatment outcome will be
      evaluated. Lastly, the role of attentional processes in the maintenance of social anxiety has
      been scarcely studied and an aim with the current study is to further our understanding of
      the cognitive factors that underlie SAD
