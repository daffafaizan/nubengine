      adequately treated. The variation of glycemic balance can lead to cardiovascular disorders.
      The study will evaluate if Reglicem®, a nutraceutical containing Berberine, Curcumin,
      Inositol, Banaba, and Chromium Picolinate, can ameliorate glycemic status in patients with
      dysglycemia.

      The investigators will enroll patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired
      glucose tolerance (IGT), not taking other hypoglycemic compounds. Patients will be randomized
      to take Reglicem® or placebo for 3 months, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      design. Reglicem® and placebo will be self-administered once a day, 1 tablet during the
      breakfast.
