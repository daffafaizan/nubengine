    
      Theliatinib (HMPL-309) is a new constructive, high effective, high selective, EGFR tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor. Theliatinib has demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on multiple tumors
      with overexpressed EGFR or sensitive EGFR mutations. This first-in-human study is conducted
      to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), safety and
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of Theliatinib .
