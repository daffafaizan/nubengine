      of D2O provision for measuring fraction-specific (myofibrillar, mitochondrial and
      sarcoplasmic) protein synthetic rates. In addition, the analytical equipment (i.e., mass
      spectrometers) required to carry out the analysis of skeletal muscle-bound alanine are
      technically challenging, offer varying degrees of sensitivity that may drastically influence
      outcome measures and the expense of analysis differs greatly between the type of mass
      spectrometer required.Thus, this study will employ different D2O doses to assess basal and
      exercise plus protein feeding-induced rates of acute and integrated MPS in healthy young men
      and women. This will provide researchers with insight into the amount of D2O required to
      accurately assess MPS and the sensitivity of the analytical machine employed.
