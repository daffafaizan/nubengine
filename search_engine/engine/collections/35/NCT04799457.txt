      complications as placental invasion abnormalities, isthmocele or previous scar detachment
      during pregnancy (post surgical long term complications). Uterine niche is the presence of a
      hypoechoic area within the myometrium on the lower uterine segment, showing a defect of the
      myometrium at the site of a previous cesarean delivery. Some surgical techniques have been
      trying to support this area to prevent the post surgical long term complications. In this
      study the investigators have been trying to find out a new technique by applying supporting
      sutures during uterine closure in cesarean section. Three months after the surgery, the
      uterine niche measurement will be examined with ultrasonography for both study and classical
      groups and results will be compared between the groups.
