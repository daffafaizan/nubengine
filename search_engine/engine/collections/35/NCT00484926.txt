      Thrombotic Events) examined the incidence of clinical events after cessation of clopidogrel
      therapy. This study identified 746 patients who were without major adverse events 6 months
      after drug-eluting or bare-metal stent placement. All patients had stopped taking clopidogrel
      and were followed up for an additional 12 months. At 18-month follow-up, there was no
      difference between patients with a drug-eluting or bare-metal stent in cumulative rates of
      death or myocardial infarction (MI). However, after clopidogrel discontinuation patients
      receiving drug-eluting vs bare-metal stents experienced higher rates of death and MI (4.9% vs
      1.3%, respectively). These results have created uncertainty regarding the minimal necessary
      duration of antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation. Also, there remains
      widespread uncertainty regarding the risk of clinical events after the discontinuation of
      clopidogrel, particularly after DES implantation.
