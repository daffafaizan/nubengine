      mild cognitive impairment will progress to Alzheimer's disease in one year. But some people
      with MCI never get worse. Others with MCI later have test results that return to normal for
      their age and education.

      To develop a new drug for the prevention of dementia(dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or
      vascular dementia), investigators need a sensitive and specific tool for recognizing patients
      who will converse to dementia. The investigators want to establish an operational diagnostic
      criteria instead of a descriptive criteria for mild cognitive impairment.
