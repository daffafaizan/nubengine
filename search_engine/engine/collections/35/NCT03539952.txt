    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label study with an active standard-of-care
      comparator.

      Stable patients who are already considered to be stable on their standard-of-care
      penicillamine chelation therapy for at least 1 year will enroll in the study and enter a
      12-week Penicillamine Baseline Period comprising of 1 month (4 weeks) run-in period followed
      by a 2 month (8 weeks) evaluation period. During this time all patients will continue to take
      their current penicillamine under study conditions. At the end of the Penicillamine Baseline
      Period, patients who fulfill the protocol definition of being adequately controlled and
      tolerating penicillamine will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TETA 4HCl or to
      continue to receive penicillamine. There is then a 24-week Post-randomization Phase
      comprising of a 1 month (4 weeks) run-in period for both treatment arms and a 5 month (20
      weeks) evaluation period.

      Patients who successfully complete the 24-week Post-randomization Phase of the study will
      have the opportunity to enter an 18 month (72 weeks) Extension Phase. Initially they continue
      to receive their allocated TETA 4HCl or penicillamine for a further 24 weeks (i.e., up to
      Week 60 of the study). Thereafter all patients will receive TETA 4HCl for 48 weeks (i.e.,
      between Week 60 and Week 108). Study clinic visits occur every 6 months (24 weeks) for all
      patients (i.e., at Weeks 60, 84 and 108).
