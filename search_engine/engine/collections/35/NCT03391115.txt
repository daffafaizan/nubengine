      are underserved in many ways, including quality of palliative care. Specific disparities have
      been reported in palliative care for minority patients, including sub-optimal
      patient-provider communication and resulting lower QoL. A potential approach to improve
      communication is to elicit patients' personal narratives that address their cultural or
      spiritual values and beliefs, and include them in the EHR. The objective of this
      observational study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a palliative care nursing
      intervention designed to 1) identify barriers and facilitators for eliciting and recording
      relevant narratives from the perspectives of the key stakeholders: minority patients with
      LLI; 2) to conduct usability testing, applying a user-system-environment evaluation process
      to determine essential requirements for integration of the patient-centered narratives into
      the EHR; and 3) identify barriers and facilitators of integration of the patient's narrative
      into daily workflow from the perspectives of key stakeholders: acute care bedside nurse.
