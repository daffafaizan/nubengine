    
      Up to 12 healthy male volunteers, 20 to 65 years of age will participate in the study. The
      study population chosen is sufficient to examine variability in pharmacokinetic and imaging
      measurements. All male volunteer subjects will have a baseline brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) for eligibility and anatomical delineation of brain regions to be applied in
      positron emission tomography (PET) image analysis. An arterial line will be inserted on day
      the healthy volunteer arrives for the administration of study drug and PET imaging (Day 1).
      The arterial line will be placed in the opposite arm than the one being used to administer
      the single intravenous microdose of [11C]AZD1390. Blood samples will be collected after the
      administration of microdose [11C]AZD1390 bolus injection and during the PET imaging
      procedure. The arterial line will be removed at the conclusion of the PET imaging study after
      the last blood sample has been collected. Standard institutional procedures will be followed
      for arterial line removal. The study will conclude with a telephone follow-up call within 7
      business days after the PET measurement.
