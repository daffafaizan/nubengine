      development, resulting in inefficient ambulatory pattern. The use of sensory cues to
      facilitate loco-motor activity has been suggested as providing the necessary trigger to
      synchronise movement with greater beneficial outcomes observed at higher frequency
      intensities within the adult population. Thus auditory cueing could have the potential to
      alter gait parameters during a functional task.

      Aim: To explore if increasing auditory cueing frequency (AC20) affects gait during a
      functional task compared to auditory cueing at self-paced cadence (ACSC).

      Method: Nineteen children with CP levels 1 and 2 on the Gross Motor Function Classification
      Scale participated using paired analysis. Outcomes were compared to the mean values for
      temporal spatial gait data within the conditions using a cross over design. TS data was
      obtained by using the GAITRiteÂ® walkway system whilst walking holding a cup.
