      treatment involve parenteral narcotics and regional anesthesia. Several studies have looked
      at the efficacy of regional anesthesia with various combinations of local anesthetic and
      additives in different populations. However, to our knowledge there have been none that
      directly compare bupivacaine/clonidine epidural with supplemental narcotics to parenteral
      narcotics alone. Many studies substantiate the efficacy of bupivacaine and clonidine as
      effective drugs for epidural analgesia (1,2,3). Parenteral narcotic alone is associated with
      the possibility of significant side effects, overdose, and inadequate analgesia. Epidural
      analgesia has been shown to reduce postoperative pain scores more than parenteral narcotics
      (4). We believe that this study is important since the protocol allows additional parenteral
      narcotic in the epidural group if needed, and also allows for narcotic dosing prior to
      discontinuation of the epidural to compensate for rebound pain. Further, the prolongation of
      pain control shown with epidural clonidine may be beneficial during the transition (5,6).
