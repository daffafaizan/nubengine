      is widely used by radiologists to improve diagnostic yields of upper and lower GI barium
      contrast examinations. Glucagon is also routinely administered intravenously for all
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) throughout the United States to
      facilitate canulation of the duodenal papilla and sphincterotomy. Glucagon has been used at
      the dose of 1-3 mg intravenously by Dr. John Cello in over 5000 ERCP examinations. The role
      of glucagon in facilitating colonoscopy remains controversial however and is not considered
      "routine". Several studies have evaluated the effect of glucagon on colonoscopy with varying
      results. No large scale randomized controlled trial has been performed to conclusively
      establish the effect of routine glucagon administration prior to colonoscopy. The
      investigators plan to carry out a randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial that
      studies key parameters of a colonoscopy such as cecal intubation time, withdrawal time, total
      procedure time, adenoma detection rate, endoscopist's assessment of the difficulty of the
      procedure, patient comfort, and patient's willingness to undergo a repeat colonoscopy.
