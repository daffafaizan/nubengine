        -  Determine the technical feasibility and reproducibility of three-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy confined to the region of the lumpectomy cavity in women with stage I or II
           breast cancer.

        -  Determine the cosmetic results in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the complication rates in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the local control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily for 5 days beginning
      within 8 weeks after surgery.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 6.3 to
      15.3 months.
