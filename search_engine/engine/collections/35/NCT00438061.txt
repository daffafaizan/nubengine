      metabolism in abdominally obese men. LDL apoB-100 and HDL apoA-I kinetics were studied using
      a primed-constant infusion of 1-[13C]-leucine in a controlled, dietary intervention trial of
      16 weeks duration in middle-aged, obese men with the metabolic syndrome. Isotopic enrichment
      in apoB and apoA-I was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and fractional
      turnover rates estimated using multi-compartmental modelling.
