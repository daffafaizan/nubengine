      Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs about Atrial Fibrillation Survey (KABAFS), which is an
      instrument designed to tailor the delivery of the Alert for Atrial Fibrillation program. The
      proposed research will also test the feasibility of studying the effect of the Alert for
      Atrial Fibrillation program on treatment-seeking for symptoms of AF in a larger, randomized
      trial. This research is significant, because current research suggests that treatment seeking
      for AF is hindered when people do not recognize symptoms that represent AF, attribute those
      symptoms to alternative causes, or do not believe symptoms are serious enough to require
      medical evaluation. Interventions tailored to modify patient-specific knowledge, attitudes,
      and beliefs that hinder early treatment-seeking are critically needed in order to improve
      early detection of AF. The long term goal of this research is to improve health outcomes of
      those at risk for developing AF.
