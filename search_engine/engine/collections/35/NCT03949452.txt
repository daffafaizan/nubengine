      often associated with sympathetic blockade that creates hypotension and could therefore
      adversely affect the conduit. Epidural analgesia is recently replaced by other techniques
      with an improved risk benefit ratio. Pain management techniques that use peripheral nerve
      blockade are becoming more prevalent, reducing the need for an epidural. Transversus
      abdominis plane (TAP) approach is aimed to access the nerves in this neurofacial plane
      between internal oblique muscle and transversus abdominis through the lumbar triangle of
      Petit. Subcostal Transversus abdominis plane block, has been reported to provide analgesia
      for incisions extending above the umbilicus. However, there have been few clinical trials on
      the analgesic efficacy of continuous subcostal Transversus abdominis plane analgesia after
      major abdominal surgeries. It has been reported recently that supplemental magnesium has a
      role in providing perioperative analgesia, because this is a relatively harmless molecule,
      not expensive and because the biological basis for its potential antinociceptive effect is
      promising. No clinical studies have examined the effect of magnesium sulphate administered
      continuously in subcostal Transversus abdominis plane catheters as an adjunct to bupivacaine
      in postoperative analgesia.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of subcostal Transversus abdominis plane
      analgesia, to epidural analgesia in major upper abdominal surgeries.
