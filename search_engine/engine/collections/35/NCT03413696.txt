      literacy and hepatitis C knowledge and their determinants among people living with HIV/AIDS
      co-infected with hepatitis C. The observation will determine if health literacy and/or
      hepatitis C knowledge are predictors of patient willingness and intention to be treated for
      HCV in the overall cohort and stratified according to study groups as noted above.
