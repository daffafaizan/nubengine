      of ischemic stroke. The study design has two components: first, a family-based study of
      ischemic stroke pedigrees, including probands, their siblings, and their parents; second, the
      traditional matched case-control study of ischemic stroke cases and their unaffected spouses.
      Cases with confirmed ischemic stroke are included as probands; after their informed consent
      is obtained, their parents, siblings, and unaffected spouses are recruited and screened by
      using the proband-initiated contact method. Stroke status is verified at the central
      hospital, and the index stroke for each case is subtyped by medical records. Baseline
      clinical and demographic data are collected by questionnaire, and longitudinal follow-up
      visits are scheduled. Blood samples are collected from all enrolled participants through the
      three-tier prevention and health care network (village, township and county level) in the
      study area. The samples are sent to the central laboratory for processing, testing, and
      genotyping. The genotype data are then merged with the clinical, environmental, and follow-up
      data for analysis. Comprehensive statistical methods are applied to both family-based and
      case-control data to ascertain potential complex genetic and environmental factors and their
      interactions.
