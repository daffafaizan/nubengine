    
      Eighty adult patients (aged ≥18 years) scheduled to undergo primary total knee arthroplasty
      under a combination of continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB), sciatic nerve block and general
      anesthesia were randomized to CFNB using either a 3-pair micro-hole (Contiplex, BRAUN®, 20G -
      400 mm) or an end-hole (Silverstim VYGON®, 20G - 500 mm) catheter. Once the femoral catheter
      was sited, a bolus of 20 mL lidocaine 1% was injected. An electronic pump then delivered an
      automated 5 mL bolus of ropivacaine 0.2% hourly, with 10 mL self-administered patient
      controlled analgesia boluses.
