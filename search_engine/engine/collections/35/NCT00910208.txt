      treatment arms:

        1. PCA with 1.0 mg morphine demand dosing every 6 minutes,

        2. PCA with 1.5 mg demand dosing every 6 minutes and

        3. a non-PCA comparison group.

      All patients will receive a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg morphine. All patients can receive
      additional analgesics as needed, at the discretion of the provider.

      We hypothesize that morphine supplied via PCA will provide superior analgesia without a
      greater incidence of adverse events when compared to non-PCA pain management; and that PCA
      demand dosing of 1.5 mg will be superior to 1.0 mg without more adverse events.
