      combination of surgery and/or radiation and /or chemotherapy.

      Despite of therapy improvement there are only little advances in progression-free survival
      and overall survival.

      Therefore new therapy concepts are needed. The advantage of the induction chemotherapy is the
      possibility of tumor response assessment during chemotherapy and may present a selection
      criterion for organ preservation.

      In order to minimize the time between chemotherapy and surgery it is important to have an
      early answer for the tumor response. In this study response will be assessed after the first
      cycle of chemotherapy. Patients showing no tumor response will be operated at once. The other
      patients will receive further cycles of chemotherapy.

      Toxicity of the induction chemotherapy have to be moderate because surgery should not be
      delayed.

      To improve the tolerance of induction therapy the medication dose isn't given on day 1 every
      3 weeks, but is dispersed on day 1 and day 8, q3weeks.
