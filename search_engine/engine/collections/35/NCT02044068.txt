      antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected pregnant women, both in developed and in developing
      countries. Among the most often used drugs, several have dual activity, against HIV and HBV:
      lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir; they can be used as a combo, as tenofovir+emtricitabine
      for instance. Studies about vertical HBV transmission from HIV-HBV co-infected pregnant women
      are rare in developed countries. The study hypothesis is a major reduction of the risk of HBV
      vertical transmission in this context, justifying this retrospective study.
