    
      Rationale: Lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is decreased in both usual
      interstitial pneumonia-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP-IPF) and nonspecific interstitial
      pneumonia (NSIP), but is weakly related to computed tomography (CT)-determined fibrotic
      changes.

      Objectives: To determine whether measurement of lung diffusing capacity for nitric oxide
      (DLNO) better reflects fibrotic changes than DLCO.

      Methods: DLNO and DLCO were measured simultaneously in 30 patients with UIP-IPF and 30 with
      NSIP. The amount of pulmonary fibrosis was estimated by volumetric analysis of visually
      bounded areas showing reticular opacities and honeycombing. Alveolar membrane conductance
      (DMCO) and pulmonary capillary volume (Vc) were calculated.
