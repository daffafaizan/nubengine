    
      This is a randomized double-blind, controlled trial comparing two regimens of pre-abortion
      doxycycline. The aims of the study are to determine the serum levels of doxycycline when
      administered pre-operatively 4 hours or approximately 18 hours before a dilation and
      evacuation (D & E) abortion. The hypotheses being tested are that subjects who receive
      doxycycline with food the night before an abortion will have adequate serum levels, but less
      nausea and vomiting compared to women who take the doxycycline on an empty stomach on the
      morning of the abortion. Subjects will either take 200mg doxycycline on the night before and
      2 caps placebo with a sip of water on the morning of surgery or 2 caps placebo the night
      before and 200mg doxycycline on the morning of surgery with a sip of water. All capsules will
      look identical. Diaries, questionnaires and a 10cc sample of blood for doxycycline levels
      will be collected from the subjects at the time of surgery.
