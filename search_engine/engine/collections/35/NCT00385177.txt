      solid malignancies who have failed conventional therapy. SN2310 Injectable Emulsion will be
      administered intravenously every 21 days. The study is designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion; to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of SN2310 and SN-38 following intravenous administration of SN2310
      Injectable Emulsion; to evaluate side effects as a function of dose level; and, to observe
      any anti-tumor effects of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion.
