    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized study assessing the efficacy of stenting
      moderate SVG lesions (30% to 60% by visual estimation) with paclitaxel-eluting stents in the
      prevention of SVG atherosclerosis progression and cardiac events at follow-up. Patients with
      previous coronary bypass surgery with SVG implantation undergoing coronary angiography by
      clinical indication will be screened. If the patient has a moderate lesion at any level of
      the SVGs it will be includable in the study. After inclusion, the patients will be randomized
      to either stenting the moderate SVG lesion with the taxus stent or standard medical
      treatment. Following this procedure, all patients will have follow-up visits by telephone or
      clinic at 30 days, 180 days, 1 year, and yearly until the common study end date. The duration
      of the study will be approximately 4 years with a minimun of 2-year follow-up.
