      (miniaturized microfluidic device that can rapidly (within 15 minutes) measure small volumes
      of oral fluids (on the order of nanoliters of fluid) and identify biomarkers of disease such
      as mediators of inflammation (interleukins -1 and -6; C-reactive protein (CRP), and a marker
      of bone resorption (ICTP). This analysis will aid in the diagnosis of active periodontal
      (gum) disease as well as diseases involved in systemic inflammation (e.g., cardiovascular
      disease) or systemic bone loss (osteoporosis). This project will have two specific goals: 1.
      To validate the ability of the diagnostic to measure the designated mediators from oral
      fluids; and 2. Determine the ability of the multiplexed format of mediator analysis to
      predict disease activity (future bone loss) in patients at high and low risk for disease.
      This proposed feasibility study will then aid in providing the impetus for sample size and
      other design requirements for larger, more expanded human clinical trial testing and
      subsequent technology transfer.
