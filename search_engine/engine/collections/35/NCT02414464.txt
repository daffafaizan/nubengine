    
      A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted with 53 patients aged 11 to 24 years
      who were allocated to groups based on the use of the following commercial products: Whiteness
      HP - FGM® (35% hydrogen peroxide); Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM® (35% hydrogen peroxide);
      and Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM® (20% hydrogen peroxide).

      After the bleaching procedure, the visual analog scale was used to measure tooth sensitivity
      and the classic Vita® scale was used to determine changes in tooth color.

      Statistical analysis involved the Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis and Student-Newman-Keuls tests,
      with p-value ≤ 0.05 or ≤ 0.0001 considered indicative of statistical significance.
