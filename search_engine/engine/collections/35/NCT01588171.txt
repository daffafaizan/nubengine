      developed and developing world. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis are the two
      components of a single disease called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pregnancy associated with
      an average 5 to 10 fold increase in the risk of VTE compared with non-pregnant women. The
      highest incidence occurring during the post partum period. There are many researches done a
      broad on the effect of LMWH to decrease the incidence of VTE after Caesarean section using
      the two LMWH (Enoxaparin and Bemiparin) alone but not in one research comparing both of them
      alone and both together against a control group. Also according to our knowledge there are no
      published literature on thromboprophylaxis after vaginal delivery
