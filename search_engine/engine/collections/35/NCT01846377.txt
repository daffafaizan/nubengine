      for minimizing T2D and obesity risks. The proposed research will be conducted in two phases,
      covering a 3-year period: implementation and evaluation phase of 2.5 years and an analysis
      phase of 0.5 years.

      Specific Aim 1: Conduct an efficacy outcome evaluation of Diab and Nano using a randomized
      clinical trial.

      Hypothesis 1: Children will decrease fasting insulin by, at least, 2Î¼U/dl, increase FV intake
      by at least 1.0 servings/day, and increase MVPA by at least 10 min/day from baseline to up to
      3 months post baseline.

      Hypothesis 2: Diet, MVPA and fasting insulin changes will not be moderated by demographic
      characteristics (e.g. gender, age, ethnic group).

      Hypothesis 3: Fasting insulin change will be mediated by changes in diet, PA and SB.

      Hypothesis 4: Diet and PA change outcomes will be mediated by changes in child's preferences
      and intrinsic motivation for FV and PA.

      Control Intervention will be a wait list group and receive the intervention at the end of the
      5-month post assessment.

      Intervention: Children will play the games at home. Each game session should take about 45 to
      60 minutes to complete with an ability to go back and replay the non-behavior mini-games.

      Child Measures include:

        -  Fasting insulin and glucose

        -  Height, weight and waist circumference

        -  Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) BMI %

        -  Fruit, vegetable and beverage intake by food frequency, and preferences, self efficacy,
           and intrinsic motivation

        -  Physical activity (PA) by Actigraph GT3X accelerometer and PA preferences/enjoyment,
           self efficacy, intrinsic motivation and home equipment availability

        -  Transportation/immersion/liking of video games played

        -  Social desirability to reflect giving answers that are socially acceptable or expected

      Parent Measures includes:

        -  Family demographics

        -  Food and physical activity equipment availability at home

        -  Report of if their child liked and played the video games
