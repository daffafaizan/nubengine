      Hidradenitis Suppurativa, on quality of life function of patients. Patients with HS will be
      asked questions about demographics including gender, age, and ethnicity. They will also be
      asked to complete questionnaires to determine how their skin condition affects their life.
      The questionnaires include Beck Depression Inventory form, which gives us information how you
      feel about your skin condition and how it changes your mood; Dermatology Life Quality Index
      (DLQI), which gives us information about how your skin condition affects your quality of
      life; Skindex, which gives us more specific information about how your skin condition affects
      your quality of life; SF-36 health survey, which gives us information about your general
      health status; the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire- short form
      (Q-LES-Q-SF), which gives us information on your enjoyment and satisfaction of your life; and
      the Employment/Productivity Health Economic Questionnaire, which will give us more
      information on your work and school status as well as household income. Study participation
      will last for 1 day, with potential for follow-up in the future. Through potential follow up
      visits we hope to determine the longitudinal effect of treatment modalities on QoL through
      future survey performance of the patient cohort. We hope this information will help us
      improve our treatment for this skin condition.
