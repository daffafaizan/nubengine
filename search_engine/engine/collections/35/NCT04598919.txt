    
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, three-site trial. The
      trial is a biomarker-based, integrated Phase 1b/2a clinical trial involving 100 subjects. One
      group (n=50) will receive placebo, while the other group (n=50) will receive 125 mg of oral
      saracatinib once daily.

      Randomization will be stratified by center. The randomization scheme will be in random blocks
      of 2 and 4 within each stratum to maintain balance. The study is designed to have interim
      analysis of the drop-out rates when approximately 30% of the randomized patients have
      achieved the 24-week assessment. Should the drop-out rate be higher than the 20% that is
      anticipated, a new sample size calculation will be performed to make sure that the power of
      the study is maintained at 80% .

      Duration of follow-up will be 28 weeks including 24 weeks of treatment with saracatinib or
      placebo.
