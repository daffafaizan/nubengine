      a period of supplementation with commercially available nutritional supplements supportive of
      immune health. Employees, in Gig Harbor, WA; Colonial Heights, VA; Lenexa, KS, and Santa Fe
      Springs, CA, will be offered the opportunity to participate.

      The nutritional and inflammatory status will be captured via fingerstick biomarkers.
      Participants will receive in-home testing kits including instructions regarding the
      applicable fingerstick blood collections. Fingerstick testing will include 25-Hydroxy Vitamin
      D3 (25-OH D3) and high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurements at baseline, 1,
      and 2 (phase 1), or at baseline 1,2, 3, and 6 months intervals (phase 2).

      Participants will also be asked to complete applicable questionnaires (QNs) electronically
      monthly using standard software programs for questionnaire completion.

      This will include the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Short Form (SF) -36 (baseline and monthly)
      and Health Status QNs including questions on compliance, wellbeing, lifestyle (exercise,
      shifts worked, medications and supplements, and diet) (baseline and monthly).
