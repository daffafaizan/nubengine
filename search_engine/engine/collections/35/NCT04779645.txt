    
      This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study is designed to
      evaluate the effects of glucagon antagonism on insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular risk and
      ketogenesis in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes. To accomplish the specific aims proposed, a
      single clinical trial will be conducted in which a maximum of 30 subjects with T1D, who are
      otherwise healthy, will be treated with REMD-477 or matching placebo for up to 12 weeks at a
      dose of 70mg (administered subcutaneously each week) with assessments done pre- and
      post-therapy. Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the REMD-477 group or
      placebo group and all subjects will remain on their standard of care insulin therapy
      throughout the study. There will be 19 study visits as outlined below:

        1. Screening - Complete consenting process, complete medical history and physical exam,
           review of current medications, collect height/weight, vital signs, and fasting
           laboratory (blood and urine) tests.

        2. Baseline Visit 1 - Participants that meet screening criteria will complete
           cardiovascular tests including flow mediated dilation and EndoPat, complete vital signs,
           weight and laboratory tests for safety and CVD markers.

        3. Baseline Visit 2 - Participants will complete a 2-Step Hyperinsulinemic/Euglycemic clamp
           with tracer, Indirect Calorimetry, muscle and adipose tissue biopsies.

        4. Baseline Visit 3 - Insulin withdrawal challenge and injection #1 of REMD-477 or placebo.
           Participants will suspend insulin delivery and remove insulin pump. Blood sugars and
           ketones will be monitored for up to 8 hours.

        5. Visit 4 - Injection #2 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.

        6. Visit 5 - Injection #3 of REMD-477 or placebo.

        7. Visit 6 - Injection #4 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.

        8. Visit 7 - Injection #5 of REMD-477 or placebo.

        9. Visit 8 - Injection #6 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.

       10. Visit 9 - Injection #7 of REMD-477 or placebo.

       11. Visit 10 - Injection #8 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.

       12. Visit 11 - Injection #9 of REMD-477 or placebo.

       13. Visit 12 - Injection #10 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.

       14. Visit 13 - Injection #11 of REMD-477 or placebo.

       15. Visit 14 - Injection #12 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.

       16. Visit 15 - Repeat cardiovascular tests including flow mediated dilation and EndoPat,
           complete vital signs, weight and laboratory tests for safety and CVD markers.

       17. Visit 16 - Repeat 2-Step Hyperinsulinemic/Euglycemic clamp with tracer, Indirect
           Calorimetry, muscle and adipose tissue biopsies.

       18. Visit 17 - Repeat Insulin withdrawal challenge. Participants will suspend insulin
           delivery and remove insulin pump. Blood sugars and ketones will be monitored for up to 8
           hours.

       19. Visit 18 - Safety follow-up visit that includes physical exam, vitals, blood and urine
           sample collection.
