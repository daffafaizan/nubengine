    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of eltrombopag (eltrombopag olamine) for patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia (CML) or myelofibrosis (MF) who have developed thrombocytopenia during the
      course of therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as measured by recovery of platelet
      count.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of eltrombopag for patients with CML or MF who have developed
      thrombocytopenia during the course of therapy with TKI.

      II. To determine the dose intensity of TKI after start of therapy with eltrombopag.

      III. To determine response to TKI after start of therapy with eltrombopag.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
