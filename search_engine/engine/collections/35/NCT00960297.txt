      NSCLC is considered standard therapy. At least three large, prospective randomized trials
      have proven the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in improving survival in these patients
      (with a magnitude of benefit ranging from 4-12%). However, in patients who are not considered
      to be candidates for up-front complete resection, preoperative therapy may be indicated. Many
      of these patients will subsequently be eligible for resection (bimodality therapy). The
      rationale for this multicenter, Phase II trial is to examine the impact of
      carboplatin/paclitaxel with bevacizumab in the preoperative treatment of patients with stage
      IB (>4.0 cm), II, and select stage III NSCLC. This trial will be conducted by the Sarah
      Cannon Research Institute Oncology Research Consortium. If this novel regimen proves to be
      safe and active in this setting, this would provide rationale for further investigation in a
      larger, prospective, randomized setting.
