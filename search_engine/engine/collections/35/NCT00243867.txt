    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, Phase III open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin速 in
      combination with every three (3) week carboplatin compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin
      every three (3) weeks, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have
      not received cytotoxic agents for advanced disease. Patients may have been previously treated
      with immunological agents. Patients will be randomized to receive Taxoprexin速 at a dose of
      400 mg/m2 intravenously by one (1)-hour weekly infusion, 5/6 weeks followed immediately by
      carboplatin AUC = 4 on weeks one (1) and four (4) as a 30 minute intravenous infusion or
      paclitaxel 225mg/m2 as a three (3) hour intravenous infusion followed immediately by
      carboplatin AUC = 6 as a 30 minute intravenous infusion, every three (3) weeks. Patients will
      receive Taxoprexin速 and carboplatin infusions or paclitaxel and carboplatin infusions until
      progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, completion of six (6) treatment cycles of
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin or three (3) treatment cycles of Taxoprexin速 plus carboplatin,
      refusal of continued treatment by the patient, or Investigator decision.
