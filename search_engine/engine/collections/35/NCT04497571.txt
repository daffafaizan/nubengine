    
      Main goals.

      Compare the survival rate of the implants placed using the ultrasonic technique and placed
      using conventional drilling, with an immediate load on the aesthetic zone.

      Specific goals.

        -  Evaluate the marginal peri-implant bone loss after the healing period through
           radiographs, from the day of surgery, to a month, to 3 and 6 months after and a year
           after the implants insertion.

        -  Evaluate the primary stability of each individual implant the day of their insertion to
           verify their load on the moment of surgery and also compare the values of each
           preparation techniques of implant bone preparation.

        -  Evaluate the secondary stability of each individual implant and compare the values of
           each preparation techniques.

        -  Evaluate the peri-implant clinic parameters within 3 and 6 months and a year after the
           insertion of the implants through these variables: probing depth and bleeding of
           probing.
