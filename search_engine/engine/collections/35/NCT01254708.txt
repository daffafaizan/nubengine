        1. To determine the safety of once weekly Inhaled AmBisome prophylaxis in preventing the
           development of Aspergillus colonization in lung transplant recipients at one year of
           prophylaxis.

        2. To generate the preliminary data on the efficacy of Inhaled AmBisome (Astellas) loading
           dose (1mg/kg/day for four days) initially followed by q weekly dosage to complete 1 year
           in lung transplant recipients as compared to no prophylaxis by assessing the rate of
           fungal colonization/infections between the groups.
