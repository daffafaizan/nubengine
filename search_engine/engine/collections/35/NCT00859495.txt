      unsatisfactory and have not been shown to significantly prolong survival, and often lead to
      worsened pulmonary function and quality of life. We will investigate whether a prospective
      trial of trimodal (surgery, pleural chemotherapy, and pleural radiation) therapy can improve
      the overall 1 year survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The proposed
      treatment will include exploratory thoracoscopy, placement of Mediport catheters into the
      pleural space, intraoperative chemotherapy, repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and
      intrapleural instillation of radioactive P32 to radiate the pleural surfaces. In addition,
      because this study is randomized, half the patients will receive an additional three
      intravenous systemic chemotherapy treatments of cisplatin and pemetrexed (Alimta) in tandem
      with their intrapleural chemotherapy (weeks 3, 6, and 9 only).

      The potential significance of this research is that such treatment may render it less
      necessary to surgically remove the affected lungs in whole or in part, in order to achieve
      significant disease cytoreduction. We hope to alter the currently accepted paradigm that
      major lung surgery is an inescapable component of such treatment, and advance the concept
      that a combination of judicious preparative surgery, systemic chemotherapy, and locoregional
      drug treatment of the pleural surfaces may offer the best hope for prolongation of survival
      with intact lung function.
