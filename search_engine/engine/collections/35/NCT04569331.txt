      function and defecation. This dysfunction is variable in its symptoms and severity, and
      manifests itself in the form of urgency, incontinence and fragmentation of faeces, with
      repeated, incomplete or difficult evacuations. The set of these symptoms constitutes what is
      known as anterior resection syndrome (ARS), which can negatively influence the quality of
      life of the operated patients and constitutes the main objective of the study to be
      investigated.

      From this study, the investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of stimulation of the
      efferent loop prior to the closure of the ileostomy along with rehabilitation of the pelvic
      floor after the closure of the ileostomy, in the quality of life of patients who underwent
      anterior resection of the rectum. A non-pharmacological randomized clinical trial will be
      conducted, comparing a control group (usual clinical practice), with respect to the
      experimental group where stimulation of the efferent loop will be performed prior to the
      closure of the ostomy along with pelvic floor rehabilitation after the closure of the latter.
      The main dependent variable will be the quality of life evaluated according to the QLQ CR-29
      questionnaire, and secondary dependent variables will be evaluated postoperative paralytic
      ileus and the previous resection syndrome using the LARS scale.
