      bioavailability of dexlansoprazole from 30 mg and 60 mg dexlansoprazole delayed release
      capsules manufactured at TOB relative to the corresponding 30 mg and 60 mg dexlansoprazole
      delayed release capsules manufactured at TPC. The study will enroll approximately 104
      participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to 1
      of the 4 treatment sequences:

        -  Dexlansoprazole 30 mg TOB followed by Dexlansoprazole 30 mg TPC

        -  Dexlansoprazole 30 mg TPC followed by Dexlansoprazole 30 mg TOB

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg TOB followed by Dexlansoprazole 60 mg TPC

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg TPC followed by Dexlansoprazole 60 mg TOB

      All participants will be asked to take single oral dose of dexlansoprazole at the same time
      on Day 1 of each Period. This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The
      overall time to participate in this study is 18 days. Participants will visit the clinic on
      Day -1 and remained confined until Day 2 of Period 1 and 2. A washout period of minimum 5
      days will be maintained between the doses in each Period. Participants will be contacted by
      telephone 10 (+/-2) days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
