    
      To evaluate whether MRE score reflecting hepatic fibrosis can predict the recurrence of HCC
      within 2 years after RFA treatment

        -  Local recurrence/intrahepatic distant recurrence

        -  Multivariable analysis including several related factors to find whether MRE score is an
           independent predictor of HCC recurrence even after adjusting other factors (etiology of
           liver disease, size of HCC, vessel invasion, HBsAg titer, etc.)

      To find the efficacy of each indicator (MRE score, non-invasive serum markers) compared to
      the gold-standard histology score predicting hepatic fibrosis.
