      maintaining the normal function of the endocrine organs. After surgery, pituitary dysfunction
      is seen in a small proportion of patients, even in some patients resulting in severe
      consequence, i.e. adrenal insufficiency or pituitary crisis. Therefore, patients undergoing
      pituitary surgery have been usually given "stress dose" steroids whether their hypothalamus
      pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis are deficient or preserved.

      Results of several retrospective studies showed that there was no significantly increase in
      postoperative adrenal insufficiency in no supplementation (of hydrocortisone) group than in
      supplementation group. Given the considerable side effects of using steroids, whether
      hydrocortisone administration is necessary for all patients with pituitary adenomas during
      peri-operation needs to be discussed.

      For Chinese patients with pituitary adenomas except for those of Cushing's disease,
      hydrocortisone administration during the peri-operation is a routine practice. Peking Union
      Medical College Hospital is the China Pituitary Disease Registry Center. Here, the
      investigators aim to launch a single-center prospective randomized controlled trial to verify
      the hypothesis that withholding hydrocortisone during the peri-operation in patients with
      pituitary adenomas whose HPA axis are intact are safe.
