      (health knowledge and self-reported health-related skills) of young adults (aged 18-24) with
      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and their parents impact health outcomes before they transition to
      adult diabetes care. Transition of health care from pediatric to adult care systems is a
      complex process and is often a challenge for young adults. These transition barriers lead to
      gaps in healthcare, worsening of glycemic control, and increased hospitalizations/emergency
      room utilization. Initial program development efforts to prepare young adults for transition
      were developed at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) based on best
      practice recommendations in the literature. The psychosocial correlates of health outcomes in
      this population are not well studied, though. Nor is it known whether these diabetes
      education interventions impact transition to adult care over time. The investigators will
      study how psychosocial factors (e.g., self-efficacy, depression, distress, quality of life,
      adherence, and risky behaviors) impact health outcomes (e.g., glycemic control) over a one
      year period, within the context of the current diabetes education transition program at
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) for young adults with T1D and their
      parents.
