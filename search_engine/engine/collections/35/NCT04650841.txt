      Loss of close relationships is one of the most aversive life events. An unwanted romantic
      breakup leads to a 20% risk of developing depression within a month, a dramatic increase in
      depression risk. The investigators recently identified brain pathways mediating placebo
      effects on physical heat pain and the social pain associated with an unwanted breakup,
      including common involvement of dlPFC-PAG pathways and vmPFC. Other recent studies have
      identified rejection-related opioidergic activity in these circuits that may reflect
      endogenous regulatory mechanisms. This experiment probes the involvement of the opioid system
      in placebo effects on social pain, using the opioid antagonist naloxone.

      Design:

      Extending the investigator's previous design, participants who recently experienced an
      unwanted breakup will submit pictures of their ex-partners, places associated with strong
      memories of the partner, and written descriptions of memories that evoke rejection and social
      pain. Participants will 1) experience rejection-related stimuli and 2) receive painful heat
      and pressure stimuli in separate runs during fMRI scanning. FMRI scans after Control and
      Placebo treatment-nasal spray with suggestions of efficacy for emotion and pain-will be
      performed in a 2-session within-person counterbalanced design. Participants will be
      randomized into two groups that receive either (1) 4mg naloxone nasal spray or (2) saline in
      the nasal spray in both sessions, implementing a 2 x 2 (Placebo/Control x Saline/Naloxone)
      design.
