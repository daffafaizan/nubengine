      patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder(BD), major depressive disorder(MDD), and the
      pathogenesis of these three mental disorders may exist overlaps. However, it remains unclear
      whether these abnormalities can be used for the diagnosis and prediction of treatment effects
      in mental disorders. It is also unclear whether there are shared imaging biomarkers between
      these three common mental disorders. In a word, there still lacks reliable neuroimaging
      biomarkers in mental disorders. Based on the previous studies, this study aims to examine the
      whole-brain anatomical and functional abnormalities in drug-naive patients with schizophrenia
      ,drug-naive patients with BD, drug-naive patients with MDD and healthy controls by using a
      combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs, including a longitudinal study
      with 8 weeks of drugs treatment( schizophrenia patients are treated with one antipsychotic
      drug(olanzapine, risperidone; amisulpride); patients with bipolar disorder are treated with
      one mood stabilizer(lithium;valproate);patients with major depressive disorder are treated
      with paroxetine). First, neuroimaging biomarkers are definitively selected in patients with
      different mental disorders for the purpose of diagnosis by using a cross-sectional design.
      After that, a longitudinal study is conducted in patients after 8 weeks of drugs treatment to
      validate that the selected neuroimaging biomarkers can be used to predict treatment response
      of medication. The definitively selected neuroimaging biomarkers are expected to be useful
      for the diagnosis and prediction of treatment effects in these three mental disorders; and
      therefore to be helpful for understanding the pathophysiology of mental disorders.
