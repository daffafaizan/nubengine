      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial will be registered at
      Clinicaltrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. There is equipoise.
      This randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of VR in in patients with
      PTSD who have suffered combat related traumatic brain injuries. A blinded investigator that
      will not be involved in the study will perform the randomization and allocation procedure.

      We will accomplish the specific aim of our study by analyzing the difference in the Clinician
      Administered DSM-IV PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores between the two groups in our study as outcomes
      to compare the effectiveness of VR. The CAPS is considered to be the gold standard for
      diagnosing PTSD and assessing symptom severity. We expect differences in the outcomes between
      both treatments to be immediate and at follow-up over time, i.e. immediately after 3 months,
      6 months and 12 months after cessation of a 2 week treatment period. The study design will
      include one pre-treatment assessment and our post-treatment assessments (at 3 months, 6
      months and 12 months). Investigators who will be blinded for the allocated treatment will
      perform all assessments. The study will be performed at the department of Neurology of our
      Institutional Brain Center in Dallas, Texas. Patient recruitment will begin starting in
      September 2014.
