      care unit for respiratory assistance, ranging from a high flow nasal cannula to invasive
      ventilation. These patients are affected by respiratory dysfunctions and even dysfunction of
      the brain respiratory control centers. Additionally, exacerbated inflammation leads to
      endothelial and coagulation disorders that aggravate the course of the illness. No effective
      therapy has yet been found to treat forms SARS-CoV-2 bass. One of the adjunctive therapeutic
      alternatives addressed is the use of intravenously administered glucocorticoids (GC), aimed
      at reducing exacerbated peripheral inflammation. They have been used at early stages of
      infection in high doses and with controversial results. In our laboratory at the Biomedical
      Research Institute from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), we have shown
      that dexamethasone, a GC (DXM) administered intranasally, reaches the central nervous system
      through the olfactory nerve (alike various pathogens, including coronaviruses) and reduces
      neuroinflammation more effectively than when applied intravenously. Additionally,
      biodistribution studies indicate that the DXM is detectable from the first minute after its
      application, both in the central nervous system and in the respiratory system. The objective
      of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of dexamethasone in
      patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 with moderate-severe forms, with an without the
      requirement of mechanic ventilation, including syndrome of acute respiratory distress or
      pneumonia (as diagnosed by CAT) with alveolar / interstitial lung involvement.
