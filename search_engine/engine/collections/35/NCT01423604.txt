      cohort with 9 patients/cohort. This phase of the study determined the safety of the
      capecitabine/ruxolitinib combination in this patient population.

      A randomized, double-blind study with two treatment arms was conducted once the safety run-in
      results from the first part of the study showed that the capecitabine/ruxolitinib combination
      was safe and additional patients could be treated. All patients have received capecitabine
      therapy in addition to the ruxolitinib or placebo (Study Drug).

      Treatment for all patients consisted of repeating 21-day cycles. Capecitabine was
      self-administered for the first 14 days of each cycle, and the Study Drug was
      self-administered during the entire 21-day cycle. Treatment cycles continued as long as the
      regimen was tolerated and the patient did not meet any of the discontinuation criteria. In
      the event of disease progression, capecitabine therapy was discontinued but the Study Drug
      could continue to be administered. Subjects who discontinued treatment with the Study Drug
      continued to be followed to obtain information regarding subsequent treatment regimens and
      survival.
