    
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study
      to be conducted in approximately 80 sites.

      Approximately 340 male or female patients aged 18 or older suffering from hematologic
      malignancies (de novo patients or relapsing patients) at intermediate to high risk of TLS and
      scheduled for receiving the first cycle of cytotoxic chemotherapy, regardless of the line of
      treatment, will be randomized in this study. Eligible patients (as per screening visit) will
      be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to Febuxostat or Allopurinol. The double-blind treatment
      period starts two days prior to the planned beginning of chemotherapy and continues for 7 to
      9 consecutive days, according to Investigator judgment and on the basis of the actual
      duration of chemotherapy regimen administered to the patient. Along the study treatment, uric
      acid levels, creatinine levels, Laboratory TLS/Clinical TLS and Adverse Events represent the
      major clinical findings to be monitored on a daily basis. Overall the study encompasses 10 to
      11 planned visits at site, including screening, randomisation, on treatment and final follow
      up visits.
