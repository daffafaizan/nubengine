      with 6 individuals with mild dementia (IMDs) and their live-in partners (usually spouse) and
      conduct in-depth interviews with staff at community organizations (e.g., dementia caregiver
      support group staff) to develop the protocol. Information from Phase 1 will provide input to
      refine the proposed pilot intervention that will be Phase 2 of this project. The pilot oral
      health intervention will last 6 months and will be conducted with up to ten IMDs and their
      live-in partners.
