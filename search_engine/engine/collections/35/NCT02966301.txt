    
      Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is the most common long-term complication in patients who
      underwent allogeneic transplantation.

      First-line therapy for chronic GVHD is based on immunosuppressive agents (corticosteroids
      with or without cyclosporine) achieving satisfactory response in around 30% of patients.

      This is a prospective, national, multicenter, non-randomized Phase II study that will include
      a total number of 24 patients in which, trioxide d'arsenic will be administrated at
      0,15mg/kg/day.

      Clinical response will be evaluated based on the Working Group Report 2015, published by the
      National Institute of Health Consensus.

      Follow-up visits will be weekly for four weeks (ATO cycle), every two weeks from second to
      third month of ATO treatment, every month from the fourth to sixth month of ATO treatment and
      every 3 months, at 9 months and 12 months (final visit).
