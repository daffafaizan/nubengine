      of venous outflow obstruction on the IJV flow. Valsalva maneuver (forced inspiration with
      closed glottis) and /or compression of internal jugular veins (IJV) are the two commonly used
      physiological methods that can cause venous outflow obstruction. A custom made neck collar
      can be used for compression of internal jugular vein and previous investigations have used a
      similar device in a rat model to demonstrate the protective effects on slosh-mediated brain
      injury by increasing intracranial blood volume . While the collars have not yet been studied
      on people for their effectiveness at preventing concussions, many studies have looked at the
      effect of neck collars on both jugular compression and ICP..

      The purpose of this study is to measure the venous blood flow of healthy volunteers by the
      use of an ultrasound and Doppler velocimetry in sitting position. the investigators will
      measure the IJV flow on both sides in sitting position at rest and at two conditions of
      venous outflow obstruction- 1. Neck compression using a custom made collar and 2. During 30
      seconds Valsalva maneuver. This study will provide information on the cerebral venous
      drainage. This information will be very useful in planning and positioning of patients
      undergoing neurosurgical procedures and to prevent complications from the improper patient
      position.
