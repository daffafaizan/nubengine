      life, and randomly assigned to one of two groups: the first group will receive the
      interventional fluid management method, and the second (the control group) will receive the
      current standard of care for fluid management. To standardize respiratory care across all
      five study sites, a computer-based algorithm for respiratory support management based on
      objective markers of respiratory distress will guide clinician management decisions. However,
      each infant's medical team will make all final decisions on respiratory treatment and IV
      fluid management. Any study infant who experiences dehydration and/or low blood sugar during
      the course of the study will be removed from the study and be treated for the condition.
