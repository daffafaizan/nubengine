    
      ADDITIONAL RISKS TO THE PATIENT: Minimal risk, mild discomfort, involving blood collect.
      Purpose: To evaluate the influence of oxygen deficit on the cognitive performance and also
      about the architecture and sleep efficiency in volunteers subjected to mild and moderate
      exercise in a hypobaric chamber.

      SUMMARY: Participants in this study 30 healthy male volunteers, aged 20 to 40 years, regular
      physical activity, constituting three groups: 1 - without exercise-hypoxia group 10
      volunteers who not be subjected to any kind of physical exercise in hypoxia and remain all
      day of experiment, 2 - group exercise at sea level, is composed of 10 volunteers who will
      undergo a protocol exercise physical sea-level, 3 - group exercise and hypoxia - 10
      volunteers who will carry out a protocol exercise on a treadmill, being the same in condition
      of hypoxia (hypobaric chamber). All groups on the first day of the experiment will undergo
      baseline assessments, laboratory blood analysis salivary and spirometric testing. Assessments
      will be personality and neuropsychological. After baseline assessments, the last day of the
      experiment, the groups will be evaluated again 4350m above sea level the sea, by personality
      tests, neuropsychological and laboratory. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND: During exposure to
      environments with a partial reduction of oxygen, human body can undergo several physiological
      and psychological changes are not prepared for such condition. Few studies have reported that
      the elevation changes and cognitive aspects related to sleep
