      venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of the study is to determine the cumulative incidence
      of VTE in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its impact on prognosis.

      Methods Cohort study of critically ill patients due to COVID-19. A bilateral venous
      compression (CUS) ultrasound screening of the lower extremities was performed during a
      cut-off period in 2 intensive care units of university hospitals in Spain. Asymptomatic and
      symptomatic VTE were registered: pulmonary embolism (PE) (diagnosed by CT-angiography) and
      deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The characteristics of the patients, results of their blood
      tests and their evolution after 7 days of follow-up were recorded.
