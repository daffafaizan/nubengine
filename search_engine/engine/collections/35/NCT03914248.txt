      non-specific symptoms, pain and high glucocorticoid requirements. The lack of a robust
      biomarker that tracks disease activity makes disease monitoring difficult. This leads to both
      disease over-treatment, resulting in adverse effects of glucocorticoids, and under-treatment,
      with the potential for significant vascular complications. Additionally, the link between LVV
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the main cause of death in these patients, remains
      poorly characterised. An imaging tool which is capable of accurately monitoring disease
      activity over time is urgently required. Positron emission tomography with magnetic resonance
      imaging (PET/MR) and retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) have the potential to meet
      this need. PET/MR is uniquely useful for imaging CVD and utilises ~50% of the radiation dose
      of PET with computerised tomography. OCT is a novel potential biomarker of microvascular
      dysfunction, systemic inflammation and CVD risk in small vessel vasculitis. Participants with
      a new diagnosis or recent flare of LVV will undergo serial PET/MR and OCT scanning alongside
      established measures of CVD risk. Results will be compared with current clinical measures of
      disease activity and with banked control data.
