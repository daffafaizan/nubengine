    
      In dose escalation part, 9-18 patients with advanced gastric cancer will be enrolled.
      Patients meeting enrollment eligibility will receive 28-day cycles of CM082 100-200 mg qd
      combined with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2. Safety information will be collected in cycle 1 to
      determine MTD and/or RP2D of CM082 combined with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric
      cancer.

      Dose escalation study will use traditional 3+3 trial design to observe DLT and evaluate MTD.
      If there are 2 or more cases of DLT in one dose group, the group lower than this dose group
      by one level is MTD dose group. At least 6 subjects are required in MTD dose group for
      confirmation. If MTD is not achieved at the end of dose escalation and there are 6 subjects
      in the highest dose group, 200 mg qd will be determined as RP2D. Dose escalation and study in
      the next dose group can be initiated only after the first treatment cycle (DLT window
      observation period) is completed and safety and tolerability in subject is confirmed in this
      dose group (0/3 or â‰¤1/6 subjects experience DLT).

      Subjects in the original dose group will continue to receive the next cycle of treatment at
      the original dose until it meets the following discontinued treatment criteria: 1) death, 2)
      intolerable toxicity, 3) pregnancy, 4) the investigator considers the study should be
      terminated for the subject's best interests, 5) the subject or legal representative requests
      withdrawal, 6) loss to follow-up, 7) the investigator considers the subject has poor
      compliance, 8) disease progression, 9) the investigator considers the toxicity effect will be
      intensified if the study continues, 10) use other anti-tumor drugs.

      In dose-expansion part, additional patients will be treated at the RP2D established in dose
      escalation part until it meets the discontinued treatment criteria.
