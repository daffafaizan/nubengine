    
      Primary Objective Determine the ability of EKG voltage changes and pre discharge 6-minute
      walk test (6-MWT) to predict repeat heart failure hospitalization (HFH) in patients admitted
      with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Determine the ability of EKG voltage changes and pre discharge 6-MWT) to predict a
           composite of 1 year mortality and HFH in patients admitted with ADHF.

        2. Determine the ability of proportionate pulse pressure, orthostatic blood pressure
           changes and pre discharge inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter by portable ultrasound to
           predict HFH and mortality
