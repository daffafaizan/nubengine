      follow the Multiple-P approach prior to medical drug regimens and invasive procedures.
      Different methods used in the conservative management of Bruxism are known as the
      "multiple-P" approach, which consists of; physiotherapy, plates, pep talk, pills and
      psychology . Physiotherapy generally focuses on two objectives: decreasing the adverse
      effects of bruxism to the masticatory muscles and increasing self-awareness regarding this
      habit. These studies involve different intervention such as massage of the masticatory and
      cervical muscles, electrotherapy, therapeutic exercises, taping interventions or relaxation
      therapies . However, literature regarding which physiotherapy intervention is the most
      effective in bruxism is not clear. Therefore patients in this study were randomly divided
      into one of two groups; manual therapy or kinesio taping. All patients were assessed at
      baseline, received 4 weeks of treatment and were assessed following the 4 weeks.
