      gross motor function, and trunk postural control in cerebral palsy (CP). Chewing performance
      level will be determined by the chewing performance scale. The Gross Motor Function
      Classification System (GMFCS) will be used to determine gross motor function levels.
      Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) will be used to measure trunk control. The
      correlations between chewing performance level and gross motor function, and trunk postural
      control will be assessed. The Chi-square test will also be used to compare GMFCS levels and
      trunk control in children with and without chewing disorders.
