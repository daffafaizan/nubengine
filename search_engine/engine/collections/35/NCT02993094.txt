    
      The phase I part of this study uses an alternate dose escalation accelerated titration
      design. In the accelerated dose-escalation phase a single-patient cohort per dose level will
      be enrolled, until one dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or 2 moderate toxicities are observed
      during cycle 1, or until dose level 4 is reached. At this dose level the cohort is expanded
      to three patients and dose escalation reverts to a conventional 3+3 escalation design.

      DLTs are defined as inability to deliver the drug combination of ixazomib and carboplatin due
      to drug related toxicity.

      The maximum-administered dose (MAD) is defined as the dose at which DLT occur in at least two
      of six patients treated at that dose level. The dose just below the MAD is considered the
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), providing that DLT is observed in fewer than two of six treated
      patients (or fewer than one third if more than six patients will be treated) at that dose
      level. Determination of MAD and MTD is based on DLT observed during the first treatment
      cycle.

      Phase II:

      After establishing MTD in phase I, accrual continues to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      the combination. A total of 41 patients will be included (patients enrolled in the phase I
      part within the conventional dose escalation phase at the dose level considered as the MTD
      may be included).

      All subjects will continue on study drugs until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      treatment discontinuation for any other reason.
