      with metastatic cancer, treated with sunitinib or sorafenib. In our own clinical practice a
      substantial part of our patients that are treated with targeted therapies directed against
      VEGF, mention that they have problems with concentrating and that their memory function is
      decreased. Relatives sometimes point out that the behaviour of the patient is slightly
      different than before starting the VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) inhibition.
      Pre-clinical studies show that VEGF influences growth and recovery of neurons.
