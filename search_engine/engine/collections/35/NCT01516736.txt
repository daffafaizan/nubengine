    
      The Pegfilgrastim Randomized Oncology (Supportive Care) Trial to Evaluate Comparative
      Treatment (PROTECT-2) was a confirmatory efficacy and safety study designed to compare the
      proposed biosimilar LA-EP2006 with the reference pegfilgrastim in woman with early stage
      breast cancer receiving (neo)-adjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Patient received TAC
      (intravenous docetaxel 75mg/m^2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m^2, and cyclophosphamide 500mg/m^2) on
      day1 of each cycle, for six or more cycles. A total of 308 patients were randomized to
      LA-EP2006 (n=155) or reference Neulasta® (n=153). Treatment was given subcutaneously on day 2
      of each cycle. The primary end point was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) during
      Cycle 1 (defined as number of consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count <0.5 × 10^9
      cells/L). LA-EP2006 was equivalent to the reference product in DSN (difference: -0.16 days;
      95% CI [-0.40, 0.08]). Further, LA-EP2006 and the reference pegfilgrastim showed no
      clinically meaningful differences regarding efficacy and safety.
