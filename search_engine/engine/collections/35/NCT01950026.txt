      for the capital of São Paulo by newsletter Climatempo available and accessed
      http://www.climatempo.com.br/previsao-do-tempo/cidade/ Before all applications, the average
      temperature obtained in the days from the application was 21.93° Celsius.

      For obtaining of personal data and anthropometric evaluations, a data sheet prepared by the
      authors to self-fulfillment, and then calculated the BMI of subjects, if in doubt, check the
      height and body mass was performed before the application of cryotherapy. Participants were
      divided into 4 groups of different ethnicities - white, brown, black and asian; ethnicity was
