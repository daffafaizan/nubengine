      hemodynamic characteristics of COVID-19 patients have not yet been well described. Besides,
      the cardiac injury was reported in about 7-17% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in
      previous Chinese publications and is much more common in patients admitted to ICU and
      non-survivors. However, no systematic assessment, including echocardiography evaluating the
      left ventricular function of these patients has been declared. In addition, extravascular
      lung water (EVLW) and pulmonary capillary permeability are two hall markers in ARDS patient's
      management, and transpulmonary thermodilution is a validated method to provide these values
      at the bedside. However, no study has reported the characteristic profile of these variables
      during ARDS caused by SARS-Cov2. A better knowledge of these characteristics would also be
      helpful in guiding their management.
