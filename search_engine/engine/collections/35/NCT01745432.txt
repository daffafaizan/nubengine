      Laparoscopic Gynaecological surgery

      Design: Randomised controlled study to assess the safety, manageability and usability of
      ADBLOCK when used as an adjunct to laparoscopic surgery for the primary removal of ('virgin')
      myomas in women wishing to improve pregnancy outcomes.

      Use of ADBLOCK will be assessed against laparoscopic surgery alone in 30 patients (randomised
      2:1 ADBLOCK/surgery) with a pneumoperitoneum â‰¤90minutes.

      Clinical Site Locations:

        -  Oldenburg, Germany
