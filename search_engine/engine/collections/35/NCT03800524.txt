      by oral route. The randomization will be performed in a ratio one to one for the two arms.

      TUDCA will be administered orally at the dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily) for 18 months.
      Patients will be taking also riluzole at the dose of 50 mg twice daily (100 mg daily).

      Patient randomization will take place after a screening (lead-in) period of 12 weeks (3
      months) with 3 assessments at 6-week intervals. Clinical assessments during the trial phase
      will be performed every three months. This will allow measuring the progression rate before
      and after starting treatment (either active or placebo).
