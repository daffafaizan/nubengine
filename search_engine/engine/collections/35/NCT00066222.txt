        -  Determine the response rate of patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer
           treated with cisplatin and etoposide combined with accelerated high-dose thoracic
           radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of
           this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for approximately 3 weeks and
      then twice daily 5 days a week for approximately 2 weeks (a total of 9 treatment days during
      the final 2-week treatment period). Beginning on the first day of radiotherapy, patients
      receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral etoposide
      once daily on days 2 and 3. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
