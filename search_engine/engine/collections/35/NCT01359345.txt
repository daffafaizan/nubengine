      (ESRD) patients in whom Gadolinume been used as contrast agent. Skin is the main organ of
      involvement but other vital organs like myocard,lung,liver may also be involved.Gadollinum is
      known as a safe contrast in renal disease patients in comparison with conventional
      nephrotoxic radiocontrast agents,but with increasing reports of NSF with Gadollinum the use
      of this agent in renal failure patients is under question.

      We will retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of this complication in all patients with
      different degree of renal failure whom underwent MRA or MRI with Gadollinum in Tehran Heart
      Center since 2003 till now and we will describe the severity and distribution pattern of
      lesions and the relation of this complication to the severity of renal failure.
