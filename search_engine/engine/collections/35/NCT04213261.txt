    
      DEFI-RDEB is a multi-center, intra-patient randomized, controlled, open-label, Phase 3 study
      of FCX-007 for the treatment of persistent non-healing and recurrent RDEB wounds in
      approximately 24 subjects. Each subject will serve as his/her own control. Each subject's
      target wounds will be paired then randomized to receive FCX-007 (treatment wound) or remain
      untreated (control wound). Up to three target wound pairs will be identified for each
      subject.

      Subjects will receive intradermal injections of FCX-007 in each specified treatment wound in
      two or more treatment sessions. The first treatment session occurs at Day 1 and the second at
      Week 12/Month 3. Additional treatment sessions may occur at Week 24/Month 6 and Week 36/Month
      9 when unclosed treatment wounds may be re-treated, and unclosed control wounds may be
      treated. Safety and efficacy assessments will occur at scheduled intervals through Week
      48/Month 12, when the treatment period is completed, and a long-term safety follow-up period
      (through 15 years) commences for subjects who have received one or more FCX-007 injections.
