      messages on later food intake and whether any effects were sustained 24 hours after exposure
      in both low and high consumers of vegetables. There were three factors of delay (immediate
      food selection versus food selection 24 hours after exposure), message type (liking norm,
      descriptive norm, health message, food-based control, and neutral control message) and
      habitual consumption (low versus high). The buffet consisted of three raw vegetables, three
      energy-dense foods and two dips.

      In this study the investigators hypothesised that a liking norm would increase the
      consumption of vegetables (compared to a neutral control condition) and that the effect would
      persist on vegetable consumption 24 hours after intital exposure to the liking norm.
