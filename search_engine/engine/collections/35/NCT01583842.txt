      is especially critical in children with NB who will be receiving several dose of therapeutic
      131I. The accurate quantification of the isotope-labeled analog can only be achieved by using
      positron emission compounds, such as 124I. Unlike planar images, which were used to obtain
      kinetic information, and SPECT reconstruction modalities that were aimed to assess the
      spatial distribution of radioactivity, 3D PET imaging-based dosimetry is a method which
      provides a more accurate estimation of the cumulated radioactivity distribution. Because PET
      provides better quantitative accuracy, when compared to SPECT regarding the tissue absorbed
      information, we hypothesize PET would better correspond with tumor response and normal organ
      toxicity. Early studies using I-124 for dosimetry in thyroid cancer have been promising.

      Demonstration of the feasibility and accuracy of this new imaging modality, with the
      excellent prospect for more accurate dosimetry, will improve tumor localization and optimize
      therapeutic dosing with 131I-MIBG. The results of our work may potentially have also
      implications in the study of other neuroendocrine tumors. The Section of Nuclear Medicine and
      the Laboratory of Functional Imaging at the University of California, San Francisco, are
      equipped with state of the art instruments and is run by a highly skilled staff which will
      guarantee the success of the proposed research.
