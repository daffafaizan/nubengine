      quetiapine XR 100 - 300 mg (flexible dosing). Patients who consent to participate will be
      referred for an initial fMRI scanning session prior to the initiation of quetiapine XR.
      Baseline fMRI will be obtained during the index assessment prior to initiating quetiapine XR
      therapy and then will be re-acquired at the final study visit at 8 weeks (the time of
      scheduled visits). Ten demographically matched healthy subjects will receive the same fMRI
      investigations on two occasions in order to provide a healthy baseline comparison to permit
      interpretation of the patient findings (e.g., whether initial and final fMRI measures in
      patients are abnormal and to control for any adaptation to the task that may normally occur).
