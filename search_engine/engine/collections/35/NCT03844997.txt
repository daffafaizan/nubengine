      combination with CPX-351, and to evaluate the efficacy of Palbociclibin combination with
      chemotherapy as measured by overall response rate (ORR), i.e. complete response (CR) and CR
      with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) by IWG criteria.

      CPX-351 is an investigational drug that works as formulation of a fixed combination of the
      antineoplastic (acting to prevent, inhibit or halt the development of a neoplasm (a tumor))
      drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin.

      Palbociclibis an investigational drug that works to induce early G1 arrest by inhibiting
      CDK4/6, which are two types of CDKs that are overexpressed in AML cell cancer lines.

      CPX-351 and Palbociclib is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

      This is a single arm, open label study of the combination of Palbociclib with CPX-351 in
      adults with AML. The trial consists of two components: phase I to evaluate the safety with
      dose escalation of Palbociclib in combination with CPX-351 and phase II to evaluate the
      overall response rate of the combination in the targeted participant population.
