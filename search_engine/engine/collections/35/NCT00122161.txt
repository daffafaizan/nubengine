      Hypertension, the most commonly reported medical problem in veterans, is a major risk factor
      for heart disease and stroke. Lowering blood pressure decreases the risk of these adverse
      clinical outcomes. Widely promoted evidence-based clinical practice guidelines set target
      blood pressures for adequate control, yet most hypertensives, including VA patients, do not
      meet the targets. Guidelines also call for use of specific drugs depending on the patient's
      pattern of comorbid characteristics; yet, clinicians often prescribe drugs that are not
      guideline-concordant.

      Objectives:

      The long term objective of this work is to contribute to the VA's ability to respond flexibly
      to rapidly evolving medical knowledge by establishing a system guidelines that can be used
      throughout the VA nationally for implementing multiple different clinical practice. In
      collaboration with Stanford Medical Informatics we developed an automated decision support
      system for hypertension management, known as ATHENA DSS built with EON technology for
      guideline-based decision support. ATHENA DSS incorporates hundreds of knowledge rules to
      operationalize guidelines for hypertension.

      Methods:

      ATHENA DSS combines patient information from VistA with an automated knowledge base of
      hypertension to generate patient-specific recommendations for management of hypertension that
      are displayed to primary care clinicians in pop-up windows in the VA�s Computerized Patient
      Record System (CPRS) when the record for appropriate patients is opened on the day of
      scheduled primary care clinic visits. The ATHENA DSS pop-up provides advice on adequacy of
      control of blood pressure and specific recommendations for drug therapy of hypertension, a
      visual display of the patient�s medication history and concurrent blood pressures, evidence
      supporting the main recommendations, and other information. We deployed the system at three
      VA medical centers--Durham, San Francisco, and Palo Alto�and conducted a clinician-randomized
      trial. We logged data on use of the system, monitored comments entered by clinicians, and
      conducted a questionnaire survey of clinicians. We planned analyses of impact on clinician
      prescribing and patient blood pressures. We planned preparation for dissemination of the
      system to additional VA medical centers.

      Status:

      Project work is ongoing at time of preparing this report. We recently received notice of
      funding for a VISN collaborative that will use the ATHENA DSS in five medical centers in VISN
      1 (New England).
