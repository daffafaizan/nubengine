      Exercise Program to determine the success and quantifying the results of the program. The
      investigators are interested in the effectiveness of this program on multiple levels,
      individual and group, as it is the first of its kind - an exercise program targeting the
      faculty and staff at a university. Participants were regular attendees in either a 6am or
      12pm exercise program session. Data included both measures of physical health as well as
      cognitive health. Measures of physical health included the assessment of body fat using the
      skin-fold method of analysis (3-site). Cholesterol was measured via blood draw analysis. This
      was done at the Kent State University Exercise Physiology Laboratory by certified research
      staff. A 6 minute walk test was completed to measure aerobic capacity. Flexibility was
      assessed via the sit-and-reach test while anaerobic strength and endurance were assessed
      using sit-up and curl-up tests. Assessment of balance was done using a Biodex Balance System.

      Assessments of cognitive health included several questionnaires that asked questions related
      to sleep habits, stress levels, and mood. In addition, each participant was given a MOVband
      to track physical activity. The device was worn during waking hours for all days of
      participation.The data from the MOVband was auto-uploaded to a computer program for tracking
      so that no manual entry was necessary.
