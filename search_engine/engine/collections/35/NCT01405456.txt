      randomly assigned to receive either eplerenone or placebo (an inactive pill). In addition,
      all volunteers will receive counseling about healthy diet and lifestyle, and will be asked to
      follow guidelines for a healthy level of physical activity. In the second 6-months of the
      study, all volunteers will continue to receive lifestyle modification and all will receive
      eplerenone.
