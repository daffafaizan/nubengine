      therapies as adjunct immunosuppressive treatments in the context of living-donor renal
      transplantation.The clinical trial presented here (ONEnTreg13) will test autologous,
      polyclonally expanded CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ nTregs as a somatic cell-based medicinal product.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether administration of nTregs to recipients of
      living-donor kidney transplants is safe and able to polarize the immunological response of
      the recipient away from graft rejection and towards graft acceptance, allowing a reduction in
      the doses of pharmacological maintenance immunosuppression.
