    
      The primary objective of this double-arm, single-blinded, Phase II randomized study is to
      compare the area under the curve (AUC) for the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ)
      mouth and throat soreness (MTS) question 2 (Q2) score over a one-month period in subjects
      receiving the MucoLox formulation versus sodium bicarbonate rinse (as the control) for the
      prevention of severe mucositis in subjects with head/neck cancer receiving radiation ±
      chemotherapy. Secondary objectives include comparing the time to OMDQ MTS Q2 > 2 between the
      two arms; estimating and comparing opioid use defined as the average morphine equivalent
      daily dose (MEDD) at each clinic visit; assessing and comparing changes in the remaining OMDQ
      questions longitudinally throughout study; evaluating and comparing the duration of symptom
      relief in those who experience any degree of oral mucositis; evaluating and comparing the
      frequency of delays in [chemotherapy and/or radiation] therapy throughout the study period;
      and summarizing and comparing the prevalence and grade of oral mucositis at each clinic
      visit. The safety objective is to summarize the rates of potential side effects related to
      each oral formulation. A total of 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a
      1:1 fashion to one of the treatment arms. Subjects on the control arm (sodium bicarbonate)
      who experience severe mucositis will have the option to crossover to the Mucolox arm for an
      additional 7 ± 2 days or until day 29 ± 5 days, whichever is longer.
