    
      Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 5 planned dose cohorts according to a standard,
      dose escalation study design. A disease assessment will be performed at study week 5 (+/- 3
      days) by the investigator. The assessment will be based both on changes in clinical symptoms,
      and radiographic images. Subjects without evidence of disease progression may receive
      AGS-16M18 extended therapy at the dose and schedule of their assigned cohort until disease
      progression or intolerability of AGS-16M18. Disease assessments will be performed every 8
      weeks during the extended period. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last
      infusion of AGS-16M18.
