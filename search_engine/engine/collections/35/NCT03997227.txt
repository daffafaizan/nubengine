    
      Lumbar vertebra surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures. After lumbar veretebra
      surgery, patients complain of excessive pain. Postoperative pain usually occurs in the early
      postoperative period and delays patient mobilization and thus lengthens hospital stay.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this field block on postoperative pain
      and respiratory function in patients undergoing ESP with lomber vertebra surgery and with
      ultrasound guidance for postoperative analgesia.

      ASA I-III, 68 patients between 18-75 years of age were planned to be included in the study.
      34 participants were expected to be included in the control and implementation group.

      In our study, the ESP block was planned to be applied to the patients in the block group.
      Peroperative analgesia plan will be applied to all patients in the same way. In this
      protocol, intravenous paracetamol 1 gr and tramadol 1 mg / kg were determined. Then, every
      eight hours, paracetamol and contromal infusion.

      At the end of the operation, the patients will be determined by the Numeric Rating Scale
      (NRS) system at the 30th hour, 1st, 6th, 12th and 24th hours after the first hour of the
      operation. Tramadol PCA and paracetamol are administered every eight hours.

      Age, sex, weight, body mass index, application of ESP block, time of surgery, duration of
      surgery, evaluation of pain in postoperative recovery room and 24-hour follow-up will be
      recorded when the patient is mobilized and discharged.

      It is thought that the ESP block will decrease postoperative pain by providing effective pain
      control after surgery in patients undergoing lumbar vertebra surgery. In addition, it is
      thought to accelerate mobilization in the postoperative period and shorten the time of
      discharge.
