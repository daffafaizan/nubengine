      macular degeneration (AMD), which is a leading cause of blind registration in the developed
      world. The term oxidative stress refers to reversible damage to molecules, such as for
      example DNA, by reactive forms of oxygen (eg. free oxygen radicals). This damage is repaired
      is normally repaired in our body.

      AMD is classified in two forms: the dry (non-exudative) and wet (exudative) form. The
      exudative form of AMD occurs when new blood vessels form to improve the blood supply to
      retinal tissue. However, the new blood vessels are very delicate and break easily, causing
      bleeding and serious vision loss. The standardized method used to treat exudative AMD is
      photodynamic therapy (PDT). This treatment is based upon the infusion of a drug that can be
      activated by light and produces free radicals that destroy these newly formed vessels. In
      other words, these new vessels are destroyed by an iatrogenic source of oxidative stress.
      This means that the factor that originally caused the disease AMD, namely oxidative stress,
      is finally used as a form of treatment- to destroy these newly formed blood vessels.

      In the present study we would like to quantify in a first step the level of systemic
      oxidative stress in patients with non-exudative and exudative AMD and compare to healthy
      controls. In a second step we would like to test whether the treatment (PDT) for patients
      with exudative AMD additionally increases systemic oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is
      quantified in our laboratory by means of single cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay.
