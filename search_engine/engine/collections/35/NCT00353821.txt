      stem cell transplantation. We are particularly interested in identifying factors, which
      result in individual variability in outcomes. Cytokines are biological modulators of the
      immune system known to influence various phases of the immune response. Normal variations in
      the genetic material coding for cytokines (Cytokine Gene Polymorphisms or CGPs) are believed
      to account for some of the differences in the inflammatory response between individuals. In
      the future, we hope to tailor stem cell transplantation to take into account these
      immunological profiles. In order to characterize the effect of any such intervention, we
      first need to better understand the role CGPs play in immune responses in normal, healthy
      persons. This involves testing for the presence or absence of a polymorphism in healthy
      individuals, and comparing with a validated in vitro assay. None of these polymorphisms are
      associated with known clinical disease to be classifiable as a 'genetic defect'. Moreover, we
      will not correlate these polymorphisms with clinical studies to identify traits in the sample
      donors. We plan to utilize stored blood samples from stem cell transplant donors who have
      previously participated on a hematology branch protocol as well as consent future donors.
