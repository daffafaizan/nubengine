      on toxicity experienced during the first cycle of therapy. Patients with triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone resistant/HER2 negative (HRBC) metastatic disease will be
      enrolled and analyzed together during the dose escalation cohorts. Once the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined, we will enroll a small expansion cohort to further characterize safety
      and provide preliminary efficacy estimates.The expansion cohort will be limited to 14
      patients; 7 with TNBC and 7 with HRBC. The dose level selected for expansion will be based on
      the totality of the data available including toxicity during the DLT evaluation period,
      toxicity during subsequent cycles, and correlative results.
