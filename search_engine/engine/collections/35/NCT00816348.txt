      high caloric value and essential fatty acid content. However, parenteral fat emulsions
      composed of soybean oils (omega 6 fatty acids) have been implicated in predisposing patients
      to PN associated liver disease.

      It is hypothesized that by administering OmegavenÂ®, comprised of fish oil (omega 3 fatty
      acids) in place of conventional soybean fat emulsion, the progression of PN-associated
      cholestasis may be prevented or reversed.
