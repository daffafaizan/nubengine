      1 hour and will include assessment of soleus H-Reflex and 10 meter walk test on arrival and
      40 minutes after the initial assessment. Subjects will be asked to minimize their activity
      between assessments by either sitting in a chair or lying on a mat.

      Each training visit will involve either an exoskeleton intervention or a combined exoskeleton
      and tsDCS intervention. Each training visit will include assessment of soleus H-Reflex and 10
      meter walk test before and after the exoskeleton intervention or before and after the
      combined exoskeleton and tsDCS intervention.
