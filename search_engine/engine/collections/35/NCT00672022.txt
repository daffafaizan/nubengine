      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of ZAVESCAÂ®
      (miglustat, OGT918), when given as a single dose and at steady state, in infantile patients
      with GM2 gangliosidosis. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the tolerability and safety
      of single and multiple doses of miglustat and to monitor disease progression using physical
      and developmental assessments and disease-specific biomarkers.
