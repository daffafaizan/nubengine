      rejection. We propose a prospective study evaluating the efficacy of Enteric Coated
      Mycophenolate Sodium (Myfortic) in decreasing the titers of anti-HLA alloantibodies in
      patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Myfortic is an immunosuppressant that inhibits the
      proliferation of B and T cells by blocking the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. We
      will attempt to determine whether a 6-week course of Myfortic adequately decreases the
      antibody reactivity to a level compatible with transplantation.
