      I. To estimate the cytogenetic response rate of patients with CML who have had less than a
      complete hematologic response or less than major cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate
      and who have been treated after two cycles of imatinib mesylate + G3139.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response rate and duration in
      patients diagnosed with CML who have been treated after two and four cycles of imatinib
      mesylate + G3139.

      II. To estimate the toxicity of these two drugs given in combination in a cooperative group
      setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-10 and oral imatinib mesylate once or
      twice daily. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without a hematologic response after 2 courses
      go off study. Patients with complete or partial response after 4 courses may continue to
      receive oral imatinib mesylate daily.

      Patients in cohort 2 receive an escalated dose of oblimersen; if well tolerated, subsequent
      cohorts receive oblimersen at the higher dose with the original dose of imatinib mesylate. If
      oblimersen is not well tolerated in cohort 2, subsequent cohorts receive the original dose of
      oblimersen with an escalated dose of imatinib mesylate. The first 6 patients accrued continue
      to receive the original dose (dose taken prior to study) of imatinib mesylate throughout the
      study.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months for 5 years.
