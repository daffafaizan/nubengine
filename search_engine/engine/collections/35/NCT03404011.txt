      propylene glycol and glycerol intake on cardiorespiratory blood parameters is unknown. The
      investigators postulate that intake of propylene glycol and glycerol could modifiy
      cardiorespiratory blood parameters.

      Aims of this study : to test the following hypotheses :

      1) Acute intake of propylene glycol and glycerol modifies cardiorespiratory blood parameters.

      To test this hypothesis, we will perform blood samples before and after intake of propylene
      glycol and glycerol. Participants will be tobacco smoker between 18 and 70 years old, with
      multiple cardiovascular risk factors, and who will undergo a cardiac catherization. After the
      cardiac catherization, the catheter will be used to perform serial blood samples.
