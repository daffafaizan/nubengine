      the sustainable implementation of the evidence-based ALL intervention. To do so, the
      investigators will randomize 30 community health centers (CHCs) to receive 1 of 3
      implementation support strategies: Low support (toolkit only), Medium (toolkit, staff
      training), High (toolkit, training, on-site facilitation). The study aims are as follows:

      Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of the 3 strategies (low, medium, high intensity) at
      supporting CHCs' implementation of the ALL intervention, through a cluster-randomized trial.

      Hypothesis: Clinics randomized to receive more implementation support will be more likely
      than those randomized to receive less support (high>medium>low) to significantly improve the
      percent of their patients with (i) guideline-appropriate prescriptions for ACE/ARBs and
      statins, and (ii) last blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) under control).

      Aim 2: Assess how effectively the 3 strategies support intervention sustainability at 12, 24
      and 36 months post-implementation, measured as maintenance of change over time (outcomes as
      in Aim 1).

      Hypothesis: Clinics randomized to receive more implementation support will be more likely to
      maintain changes in the outcomes of interest.

      Aim 3: Identify clinic characteristics associated with the support strategies' effectiveness
      (e.g. decision-making structures, leadership support, team processes / characteristics,
      readiness and capacity for change).

      Research questions: What are the characteristics of clinics that achieve sustained change
      even with less implementation support, and of those that do not achieve change even with more
      support?
