      are randomised either in the intervention group (Gr PRORO-UL) or the control group (Gr
      CHU-CP). The assessor is blinded to the randomisation. Both groups receive their program at
      the first assessment at three months post-ACL-surgery. They are strongly encouraged to
      continue their follow-up in physiotherapy to ensure the program is suitable to their
      individual progression. The participants are assessed again at 4, 5, 6 and 9 months post
      surgery to measure their progression. A weekly journal sent by e-mail is to be filled to
      ensure the subjects train according to their program attribution. It is a randomised control
      trial with a blinded assessor.
