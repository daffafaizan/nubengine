      remote cancer symptom tracking and management to incorporate COVID-19 symptom monitoring and
      reinforce risk-reducing precautions. It is critical for cancer patients at home to monitor
      early indications of COVID-19 symptoms, to adhere to mitigation strategies, as well as to
      manage their cancer-related symptoms so that patients can decrease the need to utilize the
      emergency department or unplanned hospitalizations for symptom care, which is a common
      occurrence during cancer care. Remote monitoring adds a layer of home-based support which can
      benefit all cancer patients and is not restricted to geographic proximity to oncology
      providers or distance from a cancer center. The Symptom Care at Home (SCH) system, utilized
      for the Principal Investigator's currently funded R01CA206522 project to monitor and manage
      patient-reported (PRO) cancer symptoms, includes these necessary elements: remote PRO symptom
      monitoring, patient self-management information, and oncology provider (nurse practitioner)
      notification of symptoms exceeding pre-set thresholds. The overall purpose of this project is
      to describe the impacts of COVID-19 on cancer patients' well-being at home and evaluate,
      through a randomized clinical trial, if a systematic patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
      reporting process improves cancer care during a pandemic as compared to usual care. Specific
      Aims include: 1) describe patient-reported COVID-19 and cancer symptom trajectories over
      time, COVID-19 social distancing and hygiene practices, and COVID-19 related cancer treatment
      and daily living impacts on cancer patients receiving the SCH-COVID intervention and 2)
      compare the SCH-COVID intervention to enhanced usual care on health care utilization,
      COVID-19 diagnosis and outcomes, cancer treatment delays or changes, and patient-reported
      global health, anxiety, mood, and feelings of social isolation.
