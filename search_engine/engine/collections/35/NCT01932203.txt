      volume of white matter changes in cerebral small vessel disease.

      The secondary objectives are to compare the impact of aspirin and cilostazol on DTI
      parameters, lacune, microbleeds, brain atrophy, cognition, depression, neurologic signs,
      gait, urination, and activities of daily living.

      We also investigate risk factors associated with progression of cerebral small vessel
