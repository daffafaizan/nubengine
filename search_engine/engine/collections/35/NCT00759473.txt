      decades of intense research, efficacious pharmacotherapeutic treatments have not been
      identified. Cocaine-associated environmental cues can elicit drug craving and exposure to
      cocaine-related cues is likely to be involved in relapse. Emerging data supports the role of
      glutamate in extinction learning. D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial glutamate agonist,
      facilitates extinction of associative learning in animal models of fear-conditioning and
      clinical studies of exposure treatment for anxiety disorders. A recent study demonstrated DCS
      acceleration of extinction of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference in rats (Botreau
      et al., 2006). Exploration of DCS in facilitating extinction of response to drug-related cues
      in humans is needed. The proposed study will extend these innovative and promising findings
      from the basic science arena and anxiety disorders field in a proof of concept investigation
      of DCS facilitation of extinction of response to cocaine-related cues in a human laboratory
      paradigm. In addition, to examine the neural substrates of extinction learning, a sub-set of
      individuals that are willing and eligible will undergo fMRI scanning procedures before and
      after the extinction protocol.
