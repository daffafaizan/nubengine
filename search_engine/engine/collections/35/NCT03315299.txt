    
      This treatment protocol is being conducted in a single pediatric patient while phase 3
      ASP2215 studies are ongoing in adult subjects with FLT3-mutated AML.

      The subjects will enter the screening period up to 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment.

      The subject will be administered treatment over 28-day cycles.

      The subjects will complete visits on cycle 1 days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 days 1, 15, and day 1
      of each cycle thereafter until discontinued from the study for toxicity, disease progression,
      or lack of continued benefit in the judgement of the investigator.

      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of the
      investigation product (ASP2215), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy,
      whichever occurs earlier, followed by a 30-day follow up.
