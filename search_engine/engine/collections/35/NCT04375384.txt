    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To measure Overall Response Rate to treatment with Cetuximab as single agent following
      treatment with immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  Measure Duration of Response (DUR), Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival and
           for treatment with single agent Cetuximab after immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors in
           Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

        -  Evaluate treatment toxicity with single agent Cetuximab in this patient population.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      I. Evaluate the early positron emission tomography (PET) scan ability to predict tumor
      response.

      II. Collect quality of life (QOL) data on patient reported outcomes every six weeks and
      examine this data for overall tolerability of this treatment.

      III. Bank saliva and blood for future studies of biomarkers. IV. Correlate treatment response
      with human papillomavirus (HPV) and smoking status.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes once every week in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week and then every 6-8
      weeks thereafter.
