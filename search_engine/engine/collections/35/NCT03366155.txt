    
      Background:

        -  Nearly 60% of patients with colorectal cancers will develop liver metastases over the
           course of their disease.

        -  Of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, the liver will be the sole site of
           recurrence or the survival-limiting site of disease for 20%.

        -  Liver directed therapy, which has taken many forms over the last several decades, is a
           potential means to prolong survival for properly selected patients and delay progression
           at that site.

        -  Hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine (FUDR) via an implantable hepatic artery infusion
           pump (HAIP) induces objective clinical response rates of nearly 50% in heavily
           pretreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver.

        -  The identification of patients likely to respond to HAIP and those likely to suffer
           pumprelated adverse events is currently unknown, and has limited the wide-spread
           adoption of this otherwise well tolerated intervention.

      Objective:

      -To assess the safety of hepatic artery infusion therapy using the Medtronic pump with the

      Codman catheter.

      - To determine the response rate in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer
      treated with HAIP chemotherapy as measured by RECIST.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the
           liver.

        -  Patients with liver metastases not amenable to resection to No Evidence of Disease (NED)
           in one stage.

        -  Patients must have received systemic chemotherapy.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

      Design:

      - Single arm, phase II study of HAIP chemotherapy.
