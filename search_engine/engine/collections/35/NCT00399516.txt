      in such a way as to relieve pain while minimizing any uncomfortable sensations. This study
      will extend anecdotal reports into a prospective analysis of outcome data.

      Patients invited to participate in this study will have recently been implanted with the
      Precision system, or will be eligible for SCS therapy and will have already selected therapy
      with the Advanced Bionics Precision system, independent of possible inclusion in this study.
