    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) of cetuximab/temsirolimus combination
      cohort (Arm A) compared to temsirolimus alone (Arm B).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival (PFS) of cetuximab/temsirolimus combination group (Arm A) and
      temsirolimus control group (Arm B) compared to a historic control cohort.

      II. Subgroup analysis of myofibroblast (+) cohort (PFS). III. Overall survival (OS). IV.
      Toxicities. V. Response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST])/absolute
      tumor shrinkage (waterfall plot analysis).

      VI. Activity of combination therapy (temsirolimus/cetuximab) after failure (progressive
      disease [PD]) of temsirolimus monotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and cetuximab IV
      over 1-2 hours once weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive temsirolimus as in Arm A. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may cross
      over to Arm A.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for a minimum of 8 weeks and then
      once a year for 5 years.
