    
      Type of Study This is a single center, prospective case series

      Sample Size Since this is a feasibility study we will first include 15 patients. If we find
      the TOETVA a safe and feasible approach, we will perform the same study in more patients
      using the results of this study for a power size calculation.

      Study Population Patients (> 18 years) undergoing (para)thyroid surgery for the indication of
      a benign or indeterminate thyroid nodule, well differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma,
      well-controlled Grave's disease or a parathyroid adenoma.

      Study Design This is a single center, prospective case series designed to assess the safety
      and feasibility of TOETVA in a small cohort of patients at University Health Network Toronto.
      Included patients will undergo a TOETVA-procedure in stead of the standard open surgical
      procedure.

      Study Intervention The study intervention in this study is the TOETVA-procedure. This is an
      Transoral Endoscopic Thyroidectomy Vestibular Approach.

      Primary Objective The study objective is to assess the safety and feasibility of this
      procedure in a small cohort of patients at University Health Network Toronto, Ontario.

      Endpoints of the study The main study endpoints consist of

        1. Surgical Outcomes: rate of post-operative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, rate of
           post-operative hypocalcemia, and rate of neck incision (conversion to open), oral
           infections, neck infection, hematoma, seroma, subcutaneous emphysema, gas-induced
           embolism, surgical time, and length of stay.

        2. Quality of Life - EORTC Thyroid specific Health related quality of life

      These endpoints will be compared to historical age/indication controls for analysis.
