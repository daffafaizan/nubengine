      for breast cancer.

      Women attending a radiology clinic in the Mater Hospital, Sydney, for a mammogram will be
      invited to participate in the study. A few hairs will be cut from their head or pubic region,
      put into a coded container and sent to the sponsor for analysis by synchrotron-x-ray
      diffraction. Although an imperfect standard for a variety of reasons, mammography is the
      standard screening assay, and confirmation of the pathology of the lesions found by
      mammography is carried out by biopsy. This will be the standard to which the hair test
      results will be compared. A negative mammogram will confirm a negative hair test, but a
      negative mammogram combined with a positive hair diffraction test will need a different
      approach. In the event of a positive hair test and a negative second read of the mammogram,
      the patient will be contacted by the referring practitioner. Patients in this category will
      be offered a breast MRI. A negative breast MRI under these circumstances will be classified
      as a true negative.
