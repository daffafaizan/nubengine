      Department at SÃ¶dersjukhuset during a period of two years will be included. About 11,000
      patients will be included. Patient data including described sepsis symptoms will be drawn
      from the electronic medical record, TakeCare and Clinisoft. Logistic regression analysis will
      adjust for age, gender, comorbidity according to Charlson score, vital signs, with
      preliminary focus of infection (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, abdominal, other,
      unknown). The Surviving Sepsis guidelines for the time period are: 3-hour bundle including
      lactate measurement, obtaining blood culture, fluid treatment if hypotensive and
      administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The 6-hour bundles with administration of
      vasopressors if needed, remeasure lactate if elevated, with persistent hypotension re-asses
      volume status and tissue perfusion. Time zero is defined as the admission time to the
      emergency department. The aim is to describe the association between adherence to treatment
      guidelines, gender, incidence and mortality for patients with sepsis.
