      patients post infusion with HepaStem. Furthermore, the evolution of both the metabolic
      condition and the quality of life are followed. As much as possible, the surveillance will
      mimic the standard follow-up of the respective diseases (standard of care). The surveillance
      will end when the patient is undergoing an organ transplant or takes part in another research
      study. This surveillance will last up to a maximum of 48 months.
