      most commonly performed endovascular procedures.The ability to offer the patient an
      alternative to surgical revascularization, limited by significant morbidity and mortality,
      with a same-day outpatient percutaneous procedure underlies the popularity of the
      endovascular approach. Although surgical bypass of the SFA remains the gold standard for
      revascularization, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.Comparative data
      between cryoplasty, angioplasty or stenting of the SFA will ultimately be required to provide
      more robust evidence of the efficacy of each mode of therapy.This registry is designed to
      determine the efficacy of three different percutaneous revascularization strategies
      (Cryoplasty vs. Stent Placement vs. Atherectomy) in the treatment of lifestyle limiting lower
      extremity claudication.
