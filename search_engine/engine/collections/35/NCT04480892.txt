    
      Patients (n=100) identified by the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) suffering from a
      PE will be identified by the PI. Blood plasma samples from these patients which have been
      drawn for routine lab tests will be identified and the Sub-I who will pick the samples up
      from the clinical lab after the routine analysis has been completed. These samples will be
      de-identified by giving them a study number. These samples will be recentrifuged and
      aliquoted. Samples will be stored in a -80áµ’C freezer in the Hemostasis & Thrombosis Research
      Laboratory. When all 100 de-identified samples have been collected they will be analyzed
      blindly by the technical staff of the hemostasis laboratory for the fibrinolytic parameters
      PAI-1, Alpha-2-Antiplasmin, TAFI, tPA, D-dimer, Plasminogen, and Fibrinogen. PAI-1 and TAFI
      will be quantified with an Enzyme Linked-Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA), while A2A is measured
      using functional assay. PAI-1 is measured as ug/ml, while TAFI and A2A are measured as % of
      normal controls. Normal controls are derived from pooled normal human plasma from volunteers
      purchased from outside vendor. Results will be compiled and sent to the PERT team for
      analysis and correlation withclinical, echocardiographic, computed tomography (CT), and
      functional status outcomes.
