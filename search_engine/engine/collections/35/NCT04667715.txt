      informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients
      who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Exablate Test Arm
      and to Control Arm, respectively. The following assessments will occur:

        1. Pre-surgical planning and Post-surgical visit MRI exams with and without contrast will
           be collected for evaluation by the study core lab; Any return to surgery for additional
           resection will be captured

        2. All subjects will be seen at ~Week 2, and ~4-Weeks post resection for physical and
           neurological exams and to assess for complications or adverse events. These visits
           should coincide with standard (Neuro-oncology) care following resection.

        3. Long-term outcomes will be collected during standard of care Neuro-oncology care
           follow-up visits for up to 2 years post resection; standard of care MRIs and RANO
           assessments will be collected.
