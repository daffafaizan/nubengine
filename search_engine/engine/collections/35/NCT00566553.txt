      medical therapies have led to a decrease in breast cancer mortality. However, breast cancer
      is still the second leading cause of cancer death in women (2). Therefore, the future lies in
      not only early detection but prevention of breast cancer. Currently available chemopreventive
      agents are associated with potentially serious side effects and can be quite costly,
      especially when taken for extended periods of time. Therefore, they are usually targeted only
      to women at high risk of disease. Identification of an inexpensive, efficacious preventive
      therapy with few or no side effects would represent a major advance in reducing the morbidity
      and mortality due to breast cancer. One exciting possibility is grape seed extract. Grapes
      and grape seeds contain procyanidins, a highly active subclass of flavonoids with actions
      similar to pharmaceutical aromatase inhibitors (AIs). These procyanidin dimers have been
      found to suppress estrogen biosynthesis both in vitro and in animal models (1). Based upon
      this knowledge we proposed this dose finding pilot study.
