    
      Primary Objective:

      To determine the irRECIST* response rate of pembrolizumab with ipilimumab following initial
      progression or stable disease to anti-PD1/L1 antibody (or combination not containing
      anti-CTLA4) in subjects with advanced melanoma.

      Secondary Objective

        1. To summarize the progression-free survival (RECIST v1.1 and irRC) of the combination
           following prior treatment with anti-PD1/L1 antibody.

        2. To assess the safety of the combination following prior treatment with anti-PD1/L1
           antibody.

      Exploratory Objective:

      To evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment and other biospecimens before and after
      adding ipilimumab to pembrolizumab.
