      days post-op, and 1-4 months post-op. At each timepoint, three 8.5mL ACD (yellow top)
      vacutainer tubes will be drawn by the Biobank and Translational Research Core (BRTC), study
      personnel, or hospital phlebotomists. The blood will be processed for PBMC isolation by BRTC
      for Dr. Weinhold's laboratory and will be viable within 8 hours of draw. These timepoints for
      blood draws are at the same time as usual operative care and will not require additional
      visits on the part of the subject.

      For this study we will extensively utilize several polychromatic flow cytometry (PFC)
      platforms to follow activation, maturation, exhaustion, and proliferation patterns within
      CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of T-cells. We will also utilize an intracellular cytokine staining
      (ICS) platform in efforts to detect anti-tumor associated antigen (TAA) responses by CD4+ and
      CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as lymphocytes
      infiltrating the patient's tumor. These assays are designed to measure antigen-driven
      intracellular production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, as well as the degranulation marker
      CD107. This strategy enables us to not only document individual cytokine responses, but to
      also assess (through Boolean gating) changes in relative polyfunctionality of the responses.
