    
      This is a multi-center, open label, phase IV study to provide continued supply of pasireotide
      to patients being treated in a current Novartis-sponsored study and who are benefiting from
      treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's
      Disease and Acromegaly . Eligible patients are to be consented and can then continue
      treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's
      Disease and Acromegaly in this protocol. All patients at their scheduled visits will have
      drug dispensing information and reported adverse events and serious adverse events collected.

      A patient will reach the end of study when pasireotide treatment is permanently discontinued
      and the end of treatment visit has been performed. All patients must be followed up for
      safety evaluations for 3 months following the last dose of pasireotide LAR treatment and for
      1 month following the last dose of pasireotide s.c. treatment.

      The study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years or until such time that
      enrolled patients no longer need treatment with pasireotide or are able to obtain commercial
      supply according to local regulations for their medical condition.
