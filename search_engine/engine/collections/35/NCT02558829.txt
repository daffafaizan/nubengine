    
      Trial subjects will be assigned to groups of descending likelihood of having AGHD:

      Group A, B, C: High, intermediate, and low likelihood of GHD, respectively; Group D: Healthy
      control subjects matching Group A subjects .

      The sequential order of the GHSTs for suspected AGHD subjects (Group A-C) will be determined
      by stratified randomization; healthy control subjects (Group D) will be tested in the same
      sequence as the matched Group A subjects.

      Serum concentrations of GH will be measured at pre-defined time points before and after GHST
      with macimorelin or insulin. A peak GH value below the GHST-specific cut-off value will be
      considered 'test positive'. The ITT will be considered as comparator (non-reference standard)
      to assess positive and negative agreement of both GHSTs, based on the predefined cut-off
      values.

      The following cut-off values for simulated GH levels were used for both GHST tests to be
      compared: macimorelin-GHST: GH: 2.8 ng/mL, ITT: GH: 5.1 ng/mL.

      Amendment no. 1 (repeatability extension): had been issued for selected sites in Europe to
      obtain exploratory data on the repeatability of the MAC in a subset of subjects (planned
      N=30, 10 per Group) that had completed the core study.
