      assigned to one of the study arms, will be screened on a yearly basis for 4 consecutive
      years. Depending on which of the 4 arms a village is assigned to, people in the surroundings
      of a leprosy patient will or will not be offered Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) using
      rifampicin at 20mg/kg single dose:

        1. No Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is given to anyone

        2. PEP is given to all household contacts of incident leprosy cases

        3. PEP is given to all people who live in a 100m radius of incident leprosy cases

        4. PEP is given to all household contacts of incident leprosy cases as well as to all
           others who live within a 100m radius of an incident leprosy case and test positive in
           the UCP-LFA detecting anti-M. leprae PGL-I IgM antibodies (Ab) in fingerstick blood
           (anti-PGL-1)
