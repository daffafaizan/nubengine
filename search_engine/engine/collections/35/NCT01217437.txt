      l. To compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects receiving the combination of temozolomide
      and irinotecan with that of subjects receiving temozolomide, irinotecan (irinotecan
      hydrochloride), and bevacizumab for recurrent medulloblastoma (MB)/primitive neuroectodermal
      tumor (PNET) of childhood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate for each treatment arm amongst patients who are enrolled with
      measurable disease.

      II. To determine event-free survival (EFS) for each patient compared across regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
      minutes on days 1-5.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO and irinotecan hydrochloride IV as in arm I and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
