    
      The present protocol will address whether the effects of the TANTALUS treatment are
      complimentary to GLP-1 treatment which is only partially effective or whether it can replace
      GLP-1 treatment in individuals who cannot tolerate GLP-1 agonists because of unacceptable
      side effects.

      This investigation will be a 3 arm multicenter study which will enroll in a Run-In Period up
      to 400 with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This Run-In Period will facilitate screening the
      patients with the aim to have a maximum of 30 patients in each arm complete the Evaluation
      Period of 6 months. The study aims at evaluating the TANTALUS therapy compared to GLP-1
      receptor agonist therapy by evaluating improvement in glycemic control and weight after 6
      months of treatment in each of the 3 study groups, which are:

        -  Group A: subjects on GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy only

        -  Group B: subjects on GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy and TANTALUS therapy

        -  Group C: subjects on TANTALUS therapy only
