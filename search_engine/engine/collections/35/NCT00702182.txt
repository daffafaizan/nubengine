      in-vitro. Clinical synergism has also been described between gefitinib and vinorelbine in
      NSCLC. The use of cytotoxics in a metronomic schedule has not been well investigated in the
      clinical setting despite emerging pre-clinical data. Using an established oral cytotoxic such
      as oral vinorelbine in a metronomic dose-schedule is attractive due to the oral route of
      administration. Preclinical studies have shown that by using cytotoxics in a low-dose
      protracted manner, endothelial cells are preferentially affected via inhibition of
      proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In addition to this anti-angiogenic mechanism, an
      anti-vasculogenic process may also be involved that acts by reducing circulating endothelial
      progenitor mobilization and viability. Moreover, it has also been shown that tumours that
      were selected for high levels of acquired resistance to cytotoxics can be induced to respond
      by using metronomic doses of chemotherapy.

      Continuous administration of metronomic oral vinorelbine, given three times a week, has been
      reported as feasible and well tolerated at doses up to 180 mg total dose per week. Early
      results showed activity against refractory solid tumors such as renal cancer, NSCLC, ovarian
      cancer, prostate cancer, unknown primary and Kaposi sarcoma.

      This phase I study combines erlotinib and oral vinorelbine on two different schedules. The
      conventional schedule vinorelbine (CSV) aims to determine the MTD of conventional schedule of
      oral vinorelbine given on days 1 and 8 every 21 days plus daily erlotinib and the metronomic
      schedule vinorelbine (MSV) aims to determine the optimal metronomic dose of vinorelbine given
      3 times a week plus daily erlotinib.
