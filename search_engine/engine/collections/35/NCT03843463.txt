      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), escitalopram, on augmenting language therapy effectiveness, as
      measured by naming untrained pictures and describing pictures, in individuals with aphasia in
      the acute and subacute post stroke period (i.e., within three months post stroke). There has
      been no previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of daily SSRI in
      the first three months after stroke on improvement of language in people undergoing aphasia
      treatment. It is plausible that SSRIs, which elevate synaptic serotonin, might enhance
      recovery by augmenting synaptic plasticity.

      The investigators propose to conduct a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram for augmenting language intervention in subacute
      stroke. The investigators hypothesize that daily escitalopram for 90 days after stroke
      results in greater improvement (compared to placebo) in naming untrained pictures, as well as
      greater increase in content of picture description and greater improvement in morphosyntactic
      production, when combined with speech and language treatment (SALT). A second aim is to
      evaluate the mechanisms of language recovery in individuals who receive active medical
      treatment and those who receive placebo, using resting state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (rsfMRI) and genetic testing. The investigators hypothesize that greater improvement
      in language is associated with increased connectivity within the left hemisphere language
      network on rsfMRI in participants who receive escitalopram than in those who receive placebo,
      independently of improvement in depression. The investigators also hypothesize that the
      effects are greatest in individuals with val/val allele of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) - (consistent with previous studies showing a greater response to treatment and
      greater neuroplasticity in people with the val/val allele than those with one or more met
      alleles.
