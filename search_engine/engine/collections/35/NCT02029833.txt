      successfully operationalized COMIT I, namely, the Richardson Centre for Functional Foods and
      Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) at the University of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada), the
      L'Institut Des Nutraceutiques et des Aliments Fonctionnels (INAF) at Laval University (Quebec
      City, Quebec, Canada), the Department of Nutritional Sciences at The Pennsylvania State
      University (University Park, Pennsylvania, USA), the Risk Factor Modification Centre at St.
      Michael's Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). St. Boniface Hospital Research (Winnipeg,
      Manitoba, Canada) will be an additional clinical trial site. The proposed COMIT II research
      program will proceed as a double blind, randomized crossover study consisting of three
      treatment phases of six weeks, each separated by a 6-week washout period. Participants will
      consume a fixed composition of a precisely controlled basal, weight-maintaining diet (35%
      energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate and 15% protein) supplemented with the following treatment
      oils: (a) regular canola oil, (b) high stability/ high oleic canola oil and (c) a typical
      "Western diet" fat intake as a control treatment comprised largely of saturated fat with
      substantial levels of omega-6 linoleic acid, common to current North American intakes.
      Treatment oils will be isocalorically incorporated into fruit smoothies made with milk and
      consumed at breakfast and supper. The clinical segment of COMIT II is expected to be
      completed by the mid to end of the second year, with sample analyses to be completed by the
      end of year three.
