      the surgery for vertebral compression fractures. Patients aged 50 years or older, had
      vertebral compression fractures on spine radiograph (minimum 15% height loss) will be invited
      to take part. Patients will be randomised into 2 arms with average amount. The participants
      in the intervention arm will have percutaneous vertebroplasty ; those randomised to the
      control arm will receive current standard conservative treatment methods.

      Patients were clinically assessed at baseline (the day of surgery or treatment), and at 1
      day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year afterwards. The primary outcome will be
      the pain release , categorised according to WHO classification.
