    
      PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

      • To compare the efficacy of the following peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens for MM:
      i. High dose cyclophosphamide, VELCADE, and G-CSF ii. VELCADE and G-CSF iii. High dose
      cyclophosphamide and G-CSF

      SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

      • To evaluate biomarkers as surrogate markers of mobilization in each arm To evaluate changes
      in tumor mass as defined by standard response parameters. To evaluate the safety of each of
      the arms.

      This phase III randomized trial compares three different peripheral stem cell mobilization
      regimens for patients with multiple myeloma who have received primary induction therapy
