      people worldwide. There are multiple drugs available now that can modify the process of the
      disease. Timely making a correct diagnosis of PD is still a great challenge in many cases
      even for specialists. Correct diagnosis is the premise of administration of medicines. To
      help the clinicians to quickly and correctly make a diagnosis, the investigators aim to use
      sniffer dogs to identify PD patients from other non-PD subjects who have similar symptoms and
      signs with PD subjects. After more than one-year training of the dogs, the investigators find
      that it is feasible to use dogs to identify PD patients. Now the investigators are trying to
      know the sensitivity and specificity of sniffer dogs in identifying PD patients.

      In the multicenter study, doctors and relatives of the participants collect samples and one
      assistant blinds the samples and then send them to the test center. Both the experimenter who
      helps to place the samples into tanks and the dog handler do not know the nature of the
      samples. The doctors will be informed about the test results and compared with their record.
      The sensitivity and specificity will be calculated.
