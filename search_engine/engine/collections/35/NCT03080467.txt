    
      Investigation of the long-term outcome of 300 pediatric patients with traumatic skin
      lacerations in the head area. After primary wound repair with suture or with tissue adhesive,
      eligible patients will be enrolled on the emergency department (baseline visit). The second
      follow-up visit will take place 5-10 days after the baseline visit and the third follow-up
      visit will be completed 6-12 months after trauma. At both follow-up visits, clinical
      examination and a brief interview will be performed. Photo documentation is completed at both
      the baseline and the follow-up visit.

      Encrypted photo documentation will be evaluated by blinded external plastic surgeons. Primary
      Outcome is the cosmetic appearance using standard assessment scales, secondary outcomes are
      the occurrence of complications, cost-effectiveness and patient's satisfaction.
