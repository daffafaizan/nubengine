      measures in the study of individuals with known or suspected bone-related connective tissue
      disorders, including Osteogenesis Imperfecta and melorheostosis. It is our intent to attract
      a broad array of such individuals for the purposes indicated above. This protocol will also
      serve as a basis for permitting collaborations with other investigators regarding rare,
      illustrative, or poorly defined human diseases.
