      bladder and adjacent organs, such as prostate or ovaries. Such procedure is highly invasive
      and undesirable for some patients.

      The researchers hope to learn if chemoradiation, using chemotherapy and radiation, can be a
      good alternative therapy option. Chemoradiation therapy is also currently considered an
      acceptable clinical approach but is typically used for treatment in patients with muscle
      invasive bladder cancer who have other medical issues that might cause complications during
      or after undergoing surgery. Disease free survival at 5 years is better for those who had
      their bladder removed, but overall survival rates for chemoradiation therapy patients are
      comparable between the two approaches.
