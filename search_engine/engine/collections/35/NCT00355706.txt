      from consecutive new patients presenting with thoracic pain. One hundred patients were
      included and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups; either a local anesthetic only group
      (Group I) or a local anesthetic with steroid group (Group II), with 50 patients in each
      group. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were eligible to undergo diagnostic thoracic
      facet joint nerve blocks. Only patients positive for controlled comparative local anesthetic
      blocks met the criteria for inclusion for thoracic medial branch blocks.

      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Only patients with nonspecific mid-back or upper back pain
      without suspected disc herniation, radiculitis, thoracic fracture, stenosis, or intercostal
      neuritis were included. Further, patients suspected of disc-related pain with radicular
      symptoms were also excluded, based on radiologic testing and symptomatology involving
      radicular or chest wall pain. Patients also should have previously received conservative
      management with physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation exercises, drug therapy, and bed
      rest, and so forth, but continued to have pain.

      Further inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of thoracic facet joint pain by means of
      controlled comparative local anesthetic blocks; patients who were over 18 years of age;
      patients with a history of chronic function-limiting mid-back or upper back pain of at least
      6 months duration; and patients who where competent to understand the study protocol and
      provide voluntary, written informed consent, and participate in the outcome measurements. A
      negative or false-positive response to controlled comparative local anesthetic blocks,
      uncontrollable to heavy opioid use (morphine equivalent of 300 mg), uncontrolled
