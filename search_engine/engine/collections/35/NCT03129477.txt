    
      A prospective randomized study, with 2 branches.

      The primary endpoint is the time for appropriate adaptation and therapy efficacy, defined as
      average SatO2 to 90% in 24h oximetry.

      Patients with COPD (n=100) based in Gold 2017. Patients with stable COPD and Pa CO2 > 52 mmHg
      in blood gases. These patients might have a polygraph or polysomnographic sleep study AHI/RDI
      < 15/h

        1. 1st hospital visit - D0- Inclusion criteria Confirmation; Randomization to 2 groups (1 -
           telemonitoring group (TM group) with the equipment Lumis 150, Stellar 150 or ventilator
           Astral 150 with AirView system; 2 - conventional monitoring group (CM group); Mode and
           settings titration will be selected according to patients needs and tolerance; Education
           and adaptation of the patient to VNI and optimize ventilation.

        2. 2nd home healthcare professionals visit (D 1M)-

        3. 3th hospital visit- D 3M- Compliance and ventilation effectiveness assessment (24
           oximetry and ventilator data analysis); Settings adjustment if required;

        4. 4th hospital visit - D 6M- Compliance and ventilation effectiveness assessment (24
           oximetry and ventilator data analysis) ; Settings adjustment if required

        5. 5th hospital visit - D 12M- Compliance and ventilation effectiveness assessment (24
           oximetry and ventilator data analysis); Settings adjustment if required
