    
      The aim of this study is to analyze the real incidence of asynchronies of patients undergoing
      mechanical ventilation and to analyze what factors may have an association with their
      appearance.

      This factors includes factors related with the pulmonary mechanics of each patient and other
      factors such as the treatment administered, especially drugs with sedative and analgesic
      effect will be taken into account.

      This can help to implement strategies for the improvement of asynchronies.
