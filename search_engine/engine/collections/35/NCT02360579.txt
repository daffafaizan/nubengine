      process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with metastatic
      melanoma. The adoptive cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a
      lymphocyte depleting preconditioning regimen, prior to infusion of autologous TIL, followed
      by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
