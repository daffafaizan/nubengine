      be to obtain uniform, longitudinal (over the course of time), complete and accurate data that
      can be organized, and made available for the public to query. The collective number of
      Registry members enables investigators to enroll sufficient subjects to carry out their
      studies. The community benefits from having more research and potential therapies performed
      in their disease. Regular updates from patients will give objective data-points to measure
      the progression of disease.
