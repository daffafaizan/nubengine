      utilized teratment protocol for infertile women diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome.
      First dose increment is advised on 14th day of ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins to
      decrease multiple follicle generation and cycle cancellation rates. However, clinicians
      impatiently increase gonadotropin dose on 7th day of stimulation without strong scientific
      evidence. This randomised controlled study will be the first study which will compare safety
      and ovulation induction cyle outcomes of early and late dose increments among infertile women
      diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome.

      We will start low dose step-up ovulation induction treatment by using 50 IU recombinant FSH
      for 21-39 years old non- obese patients (BMI <30 kg/m2) diagnosed with PCOS and . We will
      perform folliculometry on 7th day of ovulation induction. In case of absence for at least one
      >10 mm dominant follicle, we will randomise these women by using blind envelope selection
      method for assignment of early or late dose incerement groups. Half of the patients will
      receive 25 IU dose increment on 7th day of ovulation induction, remaining half will receive
      dose increment on 14th day of ovulation induction. We will continue ovarian stimulation
      without any other dose increment until 35th day of stimulation as deadline time restriction.
      We will perform folliculometry and serum estradiol measurement intermittently during
      ovulation induction. We will record ovulation induction cycle outcomes and clinical pregnancy
      results of the study group following finalization for treatment cyle of each patient. We will
      compare ovulation induction cycle outcomes of these two dose increment groups.
