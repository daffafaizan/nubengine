      still shows a rising trend. In recent decade, the overall survival rate of the disease has
      entered a platform stage with little advance despite diversified methods of treatment. The
      prognosis of HCC is not so satisfying.

      Intraoperative bleeding remains a major concern during liver resection. Blood loss usually
      occurs during parenchymal transection and reperfusion after Pringle's maneuver. The amount of
      blood loss and the need for blood transfusion have a detrimental effect on the short- and
      long-term prognosis.

      Portal triad clamping is sufficient in most situations to control bleeding during
      hepatectomy. However, it does not prevent backflow bleeding from hepatic veins, which may
      become troublesome or even hazardous. This is particularly true in tumors that are large or
      that have invaded into the branches of the major hepatic veins.

      SHVE completely isolates the liver from the systemic circulation with the advantage of
      preventing backflow hemorrhage or air embolism without having to resort to caval blood flow
      interruption of THVE.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the risk factors for the recurrence and metastasis in
      HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy by SHVE and to evaluate that SHVE can improve survival in
      HCC patients or not.
