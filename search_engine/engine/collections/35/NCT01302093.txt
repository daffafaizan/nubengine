      with equal numbers of males and females (minimum of 18 of either gender). Drop-outs will not
      be replaced. The two doses of medication given in the study (a single dose in each of the two
      study periods) will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 calendar days. In each
      study period, twenty (20) blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis and, for the first 8
      male and 8 female subjects included in the study (total of 16 subjects), seven (7) blood
      samples for pharmacodynamic analysis will be taken over 24 hours. Blood samples will be
      centrifuged and concentrations of thiorphan in plasma will be measured using a validated
      chromatographic assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from plasma
      concentration data. The rate and extent of absorption of the formulations will be compared.
