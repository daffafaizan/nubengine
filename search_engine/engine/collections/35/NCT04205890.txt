    
      The present study is designed as a prospective data analysis of patient response to the use
      of ketamine to treat treatment-resistant depression. For Phase I trail, 10 patients of any
      gender with an age range of 18 to 70 who have undergone the outlined procedure will be
      recruited for inclusion. Patients will be examined by the principle investigator. All
      patients must be diagnosed with persistent treatment-resistant depression and prescribed
      ketamine. Patients will be accepted regardless of if the depression coincided with anxiety
      and/or pain. Patient status will be assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck
      Anxiety Inventory, and Brief Pain Inventory. Patients must have a Beck Depression Inventory
      score of 10 or above. These scores will be used as baseline data. Patients will be offered
      the option of participating in the study and provided informed consent for neuroimaging
      before and after the ketamine treatment.

      A week before the scheduled ketamine treatment, the patients will have fMRI scans, including
      structural T1, Arterial Spin Labeling, and Resting BOLD. The scans take around 30 minutes at
      no charge to the patients. The ketamine will be injected per the doctor's orders to achieve a
      dissociative state; dosages varies between 75mg - 1000mg depending on every individual's
      unique treatment plan. The same scans will be taken two days after treatment.
