      development in the female. An important component of this feedback is exerted by estrogen.
      Letrozole will be used to block aromatase and therefore estradiol production in normal and
      GnRH deficient females. These studies will dissect the relative roles of estradiol and
      inhibin on FSH secretion at the pituitary and hypothalamus.

      The aromatase inhibitors block aromatization of androgens to estrogens, allowing us to
      examine the relative contribution of estradiol and the inhibins to FSH regulation. The use of
      a submaximal dose of a GnRH antagonist will allow us to estimate the overall amount of GnRH
      secreted (hypothalamic contribution) with and without aromatase inhibition.

      A more thorough understanding of estrogen and inhibin feedback on FSH will improve our
      understanding of the failure of follicle development in subsets of patients with infertility,
      such as polycystic ovary syndrome, in which FSH levels are normal but follicles fail to
      develop. Study of FSH control will also help us understand the failure of negative feedback
      on FSH, which can result in multiple follicular development and multiple gestation and its
      associated costs and risks. Thus, these studies may afford new therapeutic options for
      conception in infertile patients while simultaneously providing new methods to avoid the
      risks of multiple gestations.
