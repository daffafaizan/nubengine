    
      124 eligible patients will be randomised to either Sunitinib or Dacarbazine treatment.
      Participants will then attend 3-weekly clinic visits and undergo 12-weekly tumour assessment
      (CT or MRI scan) until disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) has been identified.

      At progression, patients may crossover to the other study treatment and continue with
      3-weekly clinic visits and 12-weekly imaging until second progression.
