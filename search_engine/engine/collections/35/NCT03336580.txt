      escalation component to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and MTD of IV PRX004 when
      given as a single agent in up to 36 evaluable subjects with hATTR amyloidosis. The Expansion
      Phase is an expansion component in anticipated PRX004 RP2D cohorts selected from the Dose
      Escalation Phase (this may occur in addition to cohorts in which additional subjects were
      added due to the observation of a dose-limiting [DLT] in the Escalation Phase). The Long-term
      Extension (LTE) Phase is an extended dosing component for eligible subjects from the Dose
      Escalation or Expansion phases.

      The Dose Escalation Phase will follow a standard 3+3 design, in which cohorts of 3 to 6
      subjects with hATTR amyloidosis will be enrolled at each dose level to receive IV PRX004 once
      every 28 days, based on scheduling from Month 1-Day 1 for up to 3 doses. Each subject will
      participate in only 1 dose escalation cohort. The starting dose of PRX004 will be 0.1 mg/kg.

      Dose escalation will occur after the third evaluable subject in a cohort has completed the
      first 28 days following the first administration of PRX004. Up to 6 dose levels of PRX004 may
      be investigated (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) if tolerable. In the event the starting
      dose of 0.1 mg/kg is not tolerated, the dose escalationwill be halted and the study stopped.

      Each subject will receive a maximum of 3 infusions of PRX004 in the Dose Escalation Phase.
      Subjects who complete the Month 3-Day 22 Visit in the Dose Escalation or Expansion phases may
      be eligible to receive up to 15 additional PRX004 infusions in the LTE Phase.

      Each subject will receive a maximum of 3 infusions of PRX004 in the Dose Escalation Phase.
      Subjects who complete the Month 3-Day 22 Visit in the Dose Escalation or Expansion phases may
      be eligible to receive up to 15 additional PRX004 infusions in the LTE Phase.

      Subjects who completed the EOS Visit in the Dose Escalation Phase prior to implementation of
      Protocol Amendment 2 may re-enter the study in the LTE Phase if they meet specific
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.
