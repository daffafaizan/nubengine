      cyclophosphamide (ATC) in women with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. II.
      Determine survival, time to first response, time to progression, and duration of response in
      these patients. III. Evaluate the feasibility of administering ATC for at least 4 courses.
      IV. Evaluate the toxicity profile of ATC and its effect on cardiac function.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive intravenous doxorubicin over 15 minutes on day 0, followed by
      intravenous cyclophosphamide over 30 minutes. An hour after the end of the doxorubicin
      infusion, intravenous docetaxel is administered over 1 hour. Patients receive courses every
      21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed. When the
      maximum dose of doxorubicin is reached, treatment continues with docetaxel and
      cyclophosphamide. Patients with locally advanced breast cancer receive chemotherapy for at
      least 2 courses after documented response. Patients are followed every 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 89 patients will be accrued to this study within 14 months.
