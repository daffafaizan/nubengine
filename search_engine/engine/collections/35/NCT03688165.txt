    
      This multicenter non-randomized controlled trial aims:

        -  to investigate the efficacy of a treadmill-based robotic treatment (both end-effector
           and exoskeleton) compared to the conventional rehabilitative treatment on gait recovery
           in stroke survivors;

        -  to verify different effects of the end-effector or exoskeleton system on stroke subjects
           with different disabilities.

      All the eligible subjects (please, see the inclusion and exclusion criteria), admitted to the
      study participant centers for rehabilitation treatment, will be recorded at any stage of the
      rehabilitation program (subacute or chronic phase).

      The patient's recruitment will run following the authorization of the respective Ethics
      Committees for 12 months.

      Both experimental or control group will be undergone to 20 sessions of treatments, from 3 to
      5 times per week, each lasting 60 minutes ( for a total of 400 minutes of treatment) All
      robotic systems used in this study for the experimental group (Lokomat Pro - Hocoma AG,
      Volketswil, Switzerland; G-EO System - Rehatechnologies, Italy) are treadmill-based and do
      not provide the over-ground gait training. They are characterized by the possibility of a
      programmable load suspension, as well as speed, stride length. The patient's activity with
      the related data is always displayed and stored with a computerized control system.

      The control group will follow a traditional gait rehabilitation for the same duration as the
      experimental group.

      The clinical assessments and data analysis will be carried out blindly.
