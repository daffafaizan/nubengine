      Eligible subjects will be adults with advanced solid malignancies.

      Groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive a single dose of Oradoxel and will be followed for
      toxicity. If non linearity in PK is observed, additional subjects will receive Oradoxel as 2
      single daily doses once every three weeks. Subjects who tolerate the drug and have stable
      disease or better response will be eligible to receive ongoing treatment.
