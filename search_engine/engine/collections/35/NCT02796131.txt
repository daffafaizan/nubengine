    
      The starting doses for this study are based on the results from the multiple ascending-dose
      study performed on RDX5791 (Protocol RDX5791-101). Subjects will be screened within 3 weeks
      of check in to the CPU. Each cohort of 15 subjects (12 RDX5791, 3 placebo) will check in to
      the CPU on Day -5 before dinner. Each subject will receive a diet standardized for Na+
      content while in the CPU. Subjects will receive doses of RDX5791 with approximately 240 mL of
      non-carbonated water on Days 1 to 7 (just prior to meals, depending on QD, bid, or tid
      regimens). Subjects will be provided standardized meals within 10 minutes after dosing. Doses
      can be administered with breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
