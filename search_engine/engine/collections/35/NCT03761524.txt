      all cases of mandibular fractures. Moreover, mandibular angle fractures have the highest
      postoperative complications among all mandibular fractures, and the loosening of screws and
      fracturing of plates are main reasons for the complications.The most widely used treatment
      modality for mandibular angle fracture is the use of one miniplate fixation ,The other one
      uses two mini-plates, with a upper mini-plate fixed at the same place of previous treatment
      which corresponds to the tension band of the mandible, and the lower mini-plate fixed at the
      inferior border of the mandible which corresponds to the compression band of the mandible,
      however, based on recent experimental and clinical studies, the stability provided by the
      miniplate fixation of mandibular angle fractures has become a point of contention among
      surgeons .In order to decrease the need for plate removal, reduce the operative time and
      improve the stability of the fixation system, a customized V pattern plate design is an
      appropriate plate structure for fractured mandible using the minimum output values for stress
      of plate and displacement of bony segments to seek maximum reduction volume on an original
      plate .Patient satisfaction include: clinical parameters such are occlusion, pain, facial
      swelling, maximal mouth opening, sensory function, and surgical wound ,these should be
      evaluated postoperatively ,radio graphical evaluation is also an important parameter to
      assess adequate reduction of the fractured segments .
