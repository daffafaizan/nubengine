    
      Study 1 (tissue sample study): To investigate the changes in mitochondrial function and
      pro-inflammatory markers in human arterial atherosclerotic plaques.

      Hypothesis: Macrophages from femoral artery atherosclerotic plaques in patients with
      peripheral artery disease will display upregulation of mitochondrial fission proteins and
      features of pro-inflammatory activation.

      Study 2 (white blood cell study): To investigate the changes in mitochondrial function and
      pro-inflammatory markers in white blood cells from patients with stable and unstable coronary
      artery didease (CAD).

      Hypothesis: Monocytes from patients with unstable CAD will display upregulation of Drp1 and
      features of pro-inflammatory activation, mitochondrial fission, impaired mitochondrial
      respiratory function, and perturbed metabolism, when compared to monocytes from patients with
      stable CAD.
