      surgery under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation and need endobronchial blocker for
      unilateral lung ventilation during the operation. The standard procedures for confirming the
      position of the balloon of the endobronchial blocker, including the stethoscopic inspection
      and the fiberoptic examination, will be performed as routine practice. But in our study,
      besides the above routine practice, a microphone will be connected to the distal end of the
      stethoscope (the microphone will not contact directly with the patients) during the checking
      procedure to record the breathing sound into a digital computer as electronic files. These
      breathing sound files will be analyzed in a later time with spectral transformation and the
      characteristics are extracted. These digital signal processing results will be compared with
      the results of fibroptic exmination and the stethoscopic auscultation in the correct rate of
      diagnosing the position of the endobronchial balloon. The aim of this study is to examine the
      usefulness of the spectral parameters of the digitalized breathing sound in confirming the
      position of the endobronchial blocker balloon.
