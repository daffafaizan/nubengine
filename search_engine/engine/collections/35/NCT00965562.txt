      women at the Yale site into treatment. Participants will be screened at various collaborating
      ob-gyn centers for possible PMS symptoms, and direct referrals from the community will also
      be accepted. Subject participation length is about 7 months with 6 scheduled study visits.

      Methodology: After successfully completing the screening and qualification phase,
      participants will be randomized to treatment at Visit 1 for 5 cycles of double-blind
      treatment. Participants will be evaluated monthly during the randomization phase for adverse
      events, concurrent medication, and primary and secondary efficacy variables.
