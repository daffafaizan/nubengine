      RSV-confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in healthy infants entering their
      first RSV season. The population to be enrolled is healthy late preterm and term infants born
      35 weeks 0 days or greater gestational age (GA) who would not be eligible to receive RSV
      prophylaxis. A total of approximately 3,000 infants will be randomized 2:1 to receive either
      MEDI8897 or placebo. All subjects will be followed for approximately 510 days after dosing.
      Enrollment is planned at approximately 350 sites across the USA, Canada, Europe, Asia, and
      Southern Hemisphere.
