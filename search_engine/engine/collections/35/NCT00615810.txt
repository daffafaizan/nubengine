      assess the effect on lipid profile of switching from a stable HAART regimen of Kivexa + EFV
      to once daily Atripla in adult HIV 1 infected subjects with raised cholesterol.

      At Baseline, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment groups:

      Treatment Group 1: switch to Atripla Treatment Group 2: Continuation of previous stable HAART
      regimen of Kivexa + EFV Initiation of treatment with study drugs must take place within 24
      hours after Baseline visit. At Week 12, subjects in Treatment Group 2 (continuation of Kivexa
      and EFV regimen) will switch to Atripla. Treatment in both groups will continue through Week
      24
