        -  Determine the efficacy of adjuvant temozolomide when administered during and after
           external beam radiotherapy, in terms of survival, in patients with newly diagnosed
           glioblastoma multiforme who have undergone prior total surgical resection and placement
           of polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant (GliadelÂ® wafers).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks and concurrently
      receive oral temozolomide once daily for 6 weeks. No more than 28 days later, patients
      receive additional oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
