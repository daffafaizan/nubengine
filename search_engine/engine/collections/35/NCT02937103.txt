      with CD19-targeted CAR-T cells. However, for myeloid malignancies, which has higher
      morbidity, trials of CAR-T is few. CD123 is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is
      a ideal target for CAR-T. Some researches have revealed that CD123 is a marker of leukemia
      stem cells, which indicates that the eradication of CD123+ cells may prevent relapse of
      leukemia. This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of
      CD123-targeted CAR-T.
