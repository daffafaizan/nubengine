      300 subjects who completed the randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study NCT02357901
      (RB-US-13-0001) ('roll-over' participants), and approximately 300 subjects who did not
      participate in study RB-US-13-0001 ('de novo' participants). Following informed consent and
      completion of screening procedures, all subjects will receive SUBOXONE sublingual film,
      titrated to response.

      After 4-14 days of SUBOXONE sublingual film treatment, subjects will be evaluated for
      enrollment into the study. Eligible subjects will receive 300 mg RBP-6000 as an initial dose,
      followed by monthly injections of 100 mg or 300 mg RBP-6000, based on the medical judgment of
      the investigator.

      Subjects who participated in study RB-US-13-0001 ('roll-over' participants) will receive
      monthly injections for up to 6 months. Subjects who did not participate in study
      RB-US-13-0001 ('de novo' participants) will receive monthly injections for up to12 months.

      At all injection visits continuous electrocardiogram recordings and pulse oximetry will be
      collected prior to injection and at least 4 hours after injection. Subjects will return to
      the clinic every 1-4 weeks for laboratory tests, complete study questionnaires, adverse event
      and injection site assessments.
