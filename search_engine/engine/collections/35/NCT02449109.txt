      document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of nano drug
      interventional therapy using digital subtraction angiography（DSA）for liver cancer.

      The nano drug is made by mixing Gemzar® with Compound Glycyrrhizin Injection. The nano drug's
      size is detected by laser diffraction particle size analyzer.
