      maintained. More recently there has been interest in low glycemic index and high protien
      diets wiht some evidence that these produce better fat loss and improvement in cardiovascular
      risk factors. This trial aims to evaluate these different approaches and compare the outcomes
      over 12 weeks. Major outcomes are weigth loss, body composition change, blood lipids change,
      measures of glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, leptin and CRP.
