      present study: 1) Chinese male; 2) aged 18-30 years; and 3) overweight or obesity, defined as
      BMI ≥23 kg/m2 (classification of overweight for Hong Kong adults according to Department of
      Health, Hong Kong SAR Government) (13). Subjects were excluded if they had: 1) chronic
      medical and health condition such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurological disease,

      >140/90 mmHg); 3) contraindications to participating in physical exercise; 4) any
      pre-existing medical or physical issues that affected the experimental test; 5) physically
      active (i.e., >3 hours of moderate-intensity exercise weekly) or 6) lean overweight
      population (BMI ≥23 kg/m2, but percent body fat ≤20%) according to the BMI data corresponding
      to bioelectrical impedance estimated percent body fat cut-off value among Hong Kong Chinese
      adults.

      Of those who were screened, 103 Chinese young adults were eligible to participate in this
      study. They were provided with written and verbal information on the study protocol and the
      possible associated discomforts and risks followed by obtaining their written informed
      consent to participate in this study. The study protocol and consent form were approved by
      the Human Subjects Ethics Sub-Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (ethics
      approval reference number: HSEARS20160927005-01).

      This study was a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects were randomly assigned
      to 1) no-intervention control (CON), 2) MICT performed thrice weekly (MICTx3/wk), 3) HIIT
      performed thrice weekly (HIITx3/wk), 4) twice weekly (HIITx2/wk), and 5) once weekly
      (HIITx1/wk). All subjects were instructed to maintain their usual daily activities. Outcome
      measures including aerobic capacity, body composition, blood pressure, resting heart rate,
      endothelial function, arterial stiffness, fasting glucose, lipids markers, adipokine marker,
      and inflammatory marker were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the
      intervention.
