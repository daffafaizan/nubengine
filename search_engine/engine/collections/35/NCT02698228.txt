      whether regional anesthesia (RA), either with or without ultrasound (US) guidance, can reduce
      pain from earthquake-related lower limb injuries in a disaster setting. The proposed study is
      a blinded, randomized controlled trial among earthquake victims with serious lower extremity
      injuries in a resource-limited setting. After obtaining informed consent, study participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to either: standard care (parenteral morphine at 0.1
      mg/kg); standard care plus a landmark-guided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB); or
      standard care plus an US-guided femoral nerve block. General practice humanitarian response
      providers who have undergone a focused training in RA will perform nerve blocks with 20 ml of
      0.5% levobupivacaine. US sham activities will be used in the standard care and FICB arms and
      a normal saline injection will be given to the control group to blind both participants and
      non-research team providers. The primary outcome measure will be the summed pain intensity
      difference calculated using a standard 11-point numerical rating scale reported by patients
      over 24-hours of follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will include overall analgesic
      requirements, adverse events and participant satisfaction.
