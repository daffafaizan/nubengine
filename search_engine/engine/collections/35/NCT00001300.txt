      treatment of their primary tumor with either amputation or limb-sparing surgery and
      radiotherapy, and then be randomized to either observation or adjuvant treatment with
      doxorubicin and ifosfamide with mesna (with G-CSF) for five cycles beginning
      post-operatively. Local recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival will be
      evaluated in this randomized two-arm trial.
