      coverage with full thickness skin graft (FTSG) is a widely used procedure for this problem.
      This procedure is routinely done under tourniquet control because bloodless operative field
      is essential to visualize important neurovascular structures in hand.

      Use of tumescent technique without a tourniquet is gaining acceptance because it avoids
      complications associated with tourniquet use, maintains a blood less surgical field and
      decreases operative time. Furthermore use of tumescent anesthesia often results in better
      surgical outcomes.

      Although the benefits of tumescent technique used in wide awake hand surgery are well
      documented, epinephrine at a concentration of 1:1 000,000 has also been used as a replacement
      for pneumatic tourniquet for release of hand contracture in infants and adults under general
      anesthesia. Thus epinephrine 1:1,000,000 in saline solution can be a potential replacement
      for a tourniquet in hand surgeries done under general anesthesia.

      To the investigators' knowledge no study has so far been done to compare the outcome of
      release of post burn flexion contractures under tumescent technique with general anesthesia
      or under tourniquet control with general anesthesia.
