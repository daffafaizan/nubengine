      intensive care. Fluid therapy should be tailored to the individual needs of each patient.
      Static parameters of preload have proved to be of little predictive value, therefore dynamic
      parameters are preferred for prediction of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the cardiac output
      increases by 10% after a standardised fluid challenge. There are several methods already
      available to differentiate fluid-responsive from fluid-unresponsive patients, most notably
      the passive leg-raise. However, each of these methods has its own set of indications and
      contraindications. Also, a combination of tests could guide clinicianÂ´s decision in cases
      where the results of a single test are not entirely conclusive. Therefore, it would be
      desirable to add some less-known methods for prediction of fluid responsiveness, like the
      end-expiratory and end-inspiratory occlusion tests along with the assessment of diastolic
      properties of cardiac ventricles.

      The aims of the study are:

        -  to determine the optimal increase in LVOT VTi to reliably predict fluid responsiveness

        -  to explore the accuracy of echocardiographic LVOT VTi evaluation during end-expiratory
           and end-inspiratory occlusion tests and their combination

        -  to assess the difference in echocardiographic properties of cardiac ventricles in
           fluid-responsive and fluid-unresponsive patients

        -  to compare the prediction based on echocardiography with the response to a standardised
           fluid challenge

        -  to assess the feasibility and practicality of echocardiographic monitoring in
           anesthetised cardiac surgery patients in intensive care
