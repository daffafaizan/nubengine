      conversation about live donation. For these reasons, many transplant candidates are hesitant
      to discuss candidate's illness and are therefore reluctant to pursue live donor
      transplantation. The investigators hypothesize that utilization of social media to spread
      awareness about candidate's illness and candidate's need for a live donor will enable many
      transplant candidates to successfully identify live donors. In this study, participants will
      use a novel web-based application, called the "Donor App", to create and share candidate's
      story via Facebook and other social networks to assist in the search for a live donor.
