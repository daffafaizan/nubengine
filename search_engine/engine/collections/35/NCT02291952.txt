      development diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. This research will determine
      whether changing the feeding schedule can prevent metabolic alterations that can lead to the
      abovementioned disorders. This research will provide mechanistic insight and may provide a
      novel therapeutic approach against the increased risk for diabetes, obesity, and
      cardiovascular disease among shift workers.
