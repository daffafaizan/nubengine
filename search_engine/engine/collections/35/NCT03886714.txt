      the Montpellier University Hospital after renal transplantation, with indeterminate cause of
      renal failure or diabetic nephropathy (due to its high frequency) or secondary focal
      segmental hyalinosis (FSH).

      At the population level, the identification of cases at the Montpellier centre could then
      justify to expand this screening to other French centres. The goal is to contribute to adapt
      current guidelines of renal failure assessment, by systematically including Fabry among the
      diagnostic tests. Whether all patients with renal failure are concerned, or only those with
      indeterminate cause, is an important question this study will address.
