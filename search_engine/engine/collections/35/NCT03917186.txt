    
      Randomized Clinical Trial to evaluate the impact on renal function in patients undergoing
      endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with two anesthetics protocols (Desflurane versus
      Sevoflurane) on the first 24 hours after surgery.

      Secondary Endpoint: Among secondary endpoints we will evaluate clinical variables such
      emergence and recovery characteristics (time to extubation and time to emergence-open eyes
      and response to verbal command), the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation, the
      post-anesthesia recovery score and ICU length of stay.
