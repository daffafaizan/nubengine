      fungoides, a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, was first reported in the late 1950s, and
      provided a rationale for skin-directed chemotherapy that minimized systemic toxicity. Since
      then, multiple investigators have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of topically applied
      MCH in the treatment of mycosis fungoides. This study will evaluate the efficacy
      (non-inferiority), tolerability and safety of topical application of MCH proprietary gel
      versus a compounded ointment formulation in Aquaphor in patients with stage I or IIA MF.
