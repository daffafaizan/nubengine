      ischemic stroke patients who wake-up with their symptoms. The primary outcome of this study
      is the frequency of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation evident within 24 hours of
      treatment with IV t-PA. Clinical improvement defined as a decrease in the National Institutes
      of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24 hours, 3 days and 90 days and modified Rankin
      Scale (mRS) score at 3 and 90 days. For patients that have computed tomographic angiogram
      (CTA) and computed tomographic perfusion (CTP), the incidence of large vessel occlusion will
      be quantified.
