    
      30 long term survivors of rotationplasty patients at the IOR will be welcomed by the research
      team. They will be introduced to the aims of the research and the methodology and timing of
      the assessment.

      The two-day agenda will be communicated to perform in a coordinated manner so that each
      patient performs all the exams:

        -  X ray pelvis

        -  Physiatric, orthopedic and prosthetic examination

        -  Proprioceptive test with Delos system

        -  Psychological questionnaires
