      from thoracic discogenic pain and 60 suffering from cervical discogenic pain. In each arm 40
      study subjects will be randomized to receive hemocyte autograft, while 20 will be randomized
      to receive contrast as the control group. All subjects will have blood drawn (50 cc) from any
      access site and have it prepared for hemocyte autograft. Using a 20 gauge introducer and 25
      gauge disc needle, subjects randomized to active condition will have exactly 3 cc of hemocyte
      autograft placed in a 3 cc syringe while subjects randomized to placebo will have exactly 3
      cc of saline placed in a 3 cc syringe. The syringe barrels and tubing will be completely
      covered with opaque tape so that the injector is blinded to the contents. For both
      conditions, 1-2 cc of designated injectant (PRP for active, saline for placebo) will be
      injected into the nucleus pulposus of each identified treatment level disc for lumbar; 0.5-1
      cc for thoracic and 0.5-1 cc for cervical. Primary endpoint will be at 8 weeks after
      injection. After 8 weeks subjects who received placebo are eligible for crossover to
      treatment arm with hemocyte autograft, and subject who received treatment arm are eligible
      for surgery if not improved.
