      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-12 when given in combination with
      paclitaxel and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing
      malignancies.

      II. Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      III. Determine the anti-tumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of interleukin-12.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 of course 1. Beginning with course 2, patients receive
      trastuzumab and paclitaxel as in course 1 and interleukin-12 subcutaneously on days 2, 5, 9,
      12, 16, and 19. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-12 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.
