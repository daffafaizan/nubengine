      children aged 6-19 years. Participants will be recruited from the Children's Healthcare of
      Atlanta pediatric liver clinical practice.The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a three
      month treatment with IMM-124E (a bovine colostrum enriched with anti-LPS antibodies) in
      combination with standard of care lifestyle advice is safe and leads to greater improvement
      in hepatic inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and blood lipids in children with nonalcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD) compared to placebo with standard of care treatment.
      Investigators also seek to define the mechanism of action in response to three months of
      treatment with IMM-124E.
