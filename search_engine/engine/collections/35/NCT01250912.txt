      heart (for example after heart attacks) are at an increased risk of developing ventricular
      tachycardia. In these patients ventricular tachycardia represents an electrical wave front
      that circulates in the heart muscle using the scar in the heart. An increasing number of
      patients with ventricular tachycardia require cauterization (burning away) of the tissue to
      treat this life-threatening condition. The goal of this cauterization or ablation is to
      destroy "highways of surviving tissue" inside the scar, that allow ventricular tachycardia to
      exist. However, this can be very lengthy procedure (>5 hours) that has only a moderate
      success in the long run. Therefore, new treatment approaches are needed to make this
      procedure better.

      The purpose of this study is to assess if radio tracers showing the nerve distribution in the
      heart (cardiac innervation) can be used in addition to the current technology ("voltage
      mapping") to identify the area that needs to be ablated (burnt away) to treat
      life-threatening fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia)

      Certain patterns of nerve distribution in the heart (sympathetic cardiac innervation) have
      been shown to predict outcome for different heart diseases, like heart transplant, coronary
      artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias. One substance that allows visualization of the
      cardiac innervation is 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG), which could provide
      additional information to understand and treat ventricular tachycardia.
