      an increased mortality rate. Although metabolic surgery results in a greater weight loss when
      compared to non-surgical approaches, a low calorie diet associated with intensive maintenance
      session may be a valid alternative for weight loss. Since lifestyle interventions are safer
      and potentially more cost effective than metabolic surgery, this trial will test whether an
      intensive lifestyle intervention is as effective as metabolic surgery to induce weight loss
      and its maintenance.

      A total of 218 participants will be randomly assigned to metabolic surgery (109) or intensive
      lifestyle intervention (109).

      Clinical outcomes will be assessed at 25% reduction in Body Mass Index (BMI), at 12 months
      and 24 months.
