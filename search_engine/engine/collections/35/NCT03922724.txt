    
      Background:

        -  Mature neoplasms of T and/or natural killer cells, collectively called peripheral T-cell
           lymphomas (PTCL), are often poorly responsive to chemotherapy and therefore associated
           with significant morbidity and mortality.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure PTCL but
           the optimal approach to HCT for these diseases requires ongoing investigation

      Objectives:

        -  For subjects on the reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC arm), to estimate the
           progression free survival

        -  For subjects on the immunosuppression-only conditioning (IOC) and ATL/RIC arms, because
           they are high risk patients, to preliminarily estimate the proportion who are
           progression free at one year.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients age greater than or equal to 12 years

        -  PTCL that is relapsed or refractory to prior therapy and/or PTCL of a risk score where
           upfront allo HCT in first remission is reasonable (PIT score of intermediate-low risk or
           higher or supported by clinical practice guidelines1)

        -  At least one potentially suitable 7-8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (at HLA
           A, B, C, and DR), or an HLA-haploidentical related donor

        -  Adequate end-organ function

        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

      Design:

        -  There will be four recipient treatment arms that vary in approach, although all with the
           same backbone of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis:

             -  Immunosuppression-only conditioning (IOC) arm for high-risk subjects

             -  Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) arm for those deemed not high-risk and able to
                tolerate RIC and without adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)

             -  mRIC arm for patients eligible for the RIC arm, as a modified expansion upon
                completion of the RIC arm

             -  ATL-RIC arm for patients with a diagnosis of ATL.

        -  IOC arm: equine anti-thymocyte globulin (e-ATG) 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13,
           pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days -9 and -5, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally
           daily on days -9 through -2

           --Subjects will be assigned to the IOC arm if there is significant end-organ dysfunction
           present and it is felt that a conditioning regimen that includes busulfan would likely
           be associated with intolerable or life-threatening toxicities for the patient. Patients
           will also be assigned to the IOC arm if they possess a DNA repair defect, telomere
           maintenance defect, or familial cancer predisposition syndrome that necessitates
           limiting chemotherapy as much as possible to prevent future cancer risk.

        -  RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days
           -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally daily on days -11 through - 4;
           busulfan IV, pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2.

        -  mRIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days
           -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally daily on days -11 through -4;
           busulfan IV, pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2, G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day

      subcutaneous on days -12, -8, and -4.

        -  ATL-RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on
           days -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally daily on days -11 through
           -4; busulfan IV, pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2, G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day
           subcutaneous on days -12, -8, and -4, ruxolitinib 45 mg/day from day -12 through day -2,
           and zidovudine 300 mg orally three times a day from day -1 through day +50.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cells are the preferred graft source, although bone marrow is
           permitted

        -  GVHD prophylaxis: Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on days +3 and +4 (50
           mg/kg/day on RIC arm, mRIC, and ATL-RIC arms and 25 mg/kg/day on the IOC arm, with the
           option of 25 mg/kg/day on the RIC arm). , Ssirolimus on days +5 through +60 (RIC arm,
           mRIC arm, IOC arm). Patients with somatic mutations in the Akt/mTOR pathway may receive
           tacrolimus days +5 through +60 instead of sirolimus on the RIC, mRIC, or IOC arms.
           Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on days +5 through +25 on the RIC, IOC, and mRIC arms; MMF
           will not be given on the ATL-RIC arm. Patients on the ATL-RIC arm will receive
           tacrolimus on days +5 through +50 and ruxolitinib 1mg/day from days +5 through +35, 10
           mg/day from days +36 through +60, and 5 mg/day from days +61 through +70.
