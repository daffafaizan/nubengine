      epilepsy (PWE) do not become seizure free with anti-epileptic drugs. Some patients may be
      suitable for epilepsy surgery. Alternative established treatments include vagal nerve
      stimulation and the ketogenic diet in children. The evidence base for the use of ketogenic
      diet in adults is limited. There are a few prospective studies and no randomised control
      trial to date.

      This study is a prospective observational cohort study for adult patients with drug resistant
      epilepsy who are not suitable for resective epilepsy surgery. The intervention is a modified
      ketogenic diet. The carbohydrate load will be between 20-30gm per day. Blood ketones and
      blood sugars will be monitored. The primary outcome measure is seizure frequency at 12
      months. There are a number of secondary outcome measures including tolerability, seizure
      severity, quality of life, lipid profiles and health care utilisation.
