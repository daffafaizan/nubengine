      physical side effect of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The purpose of
      this qualitative study is to understand the experience and physical functional side effects
      of taxanes. This is the first of a two phase study. The overall goal is to identify existing
      objective physical performance measures to assess functional side effects of taxanes.
