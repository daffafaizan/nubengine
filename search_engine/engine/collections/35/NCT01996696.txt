    
      This study will examine the role of Metformin as a means to prevent increases in weight as
      well as the prevalence and severity of metabolic syndrome, with their associated morbidity,
      amongst men with locally advanced, biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (PCa) that
      are planned to receive curative intent therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the prostate.

      Males of any age with biopsy confirmed high tier intermediate risk PCa (Gleason score 7 and
      PSA 10-20) or high risk PCa (any T3; and/or Gleason Score ≥ 8.0; and/or PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL) ECOG
      0 to 1, non-diabetic with no evidence of metastatic PCa will be randomized to either:

      Group A: Metformin 500mg PO TID x 30-36 months total, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT
      x18-36 months and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes (optional); plus prostate boost to
      78 Gy/39# or brachytherapy boost (110-115 Gy) or hypofractionated equivalent

      OR

      Group B: Identical placebo TID x 20-36 months total, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT x18-36
      months and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes (optional); plus prostate boost to 78
      Gy/39# or brachytherapy boost (110-115 Gy) or hypofractionated equivalent

      A planned sample size of 104 patients will provide 97% power for a 2-tailed α of 0.05 to
      detect 4 kg difference in weight at 12 months of follow-up.
