      treated and untreated individuals worldwide. In its severe forms, depression is the most
      common diagnosis associated with suicide. Esketamine (S-ketamine) is the S-enantiomer of
      ketamine. Ketamine profoundly affects fast excitatory glutamate transmission, increases
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor release, and stimulates synaptogenesis, in contrast to
      conventional antidepressants (ADs) which are modulatory transmitters. The goal of any new
      antidepressant (AD) treatment would be the rapid and long-lasting relief of depressive
      symptoms. The study includes screening phase (2 weeks, with possible extension up to 4
      weeks), Induction phase (Week 1 to Week 4), Maintenance once-weekly phase (Week 5 to Week 8),
      Maintenance flexible-frequency phase (Week 9 to Week 32) and Follow-up phase (2 Weeks
      Duration). Total duration of study will be approximately up to 36 weeks. The safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
