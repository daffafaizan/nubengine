      I. To determine the overall response (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) rate
      and the complete response (CR) rate to bortezomib + lenalidomide therapy in patients with
      relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time to progression after therapy with bortezomib + lenalidomide in
      patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

      II. To determine the disease-free survival and overall survival after therapy with bortezomib
      + lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds
      on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or partial response as best response
      after completion of induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising bortezomib IV on
      days 1 and 8 and lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.
