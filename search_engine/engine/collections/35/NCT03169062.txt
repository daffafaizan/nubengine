      evaluating coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) in individuals with coronary artery disease.
      Using the Cardiac Gated Stationary Chest Tomosynthesis (CG-SDCT) system the imaging dose for
      a a full tomosynthesis scan is expected to be only 10% of that from a low-dose CT. The
      targeted imaging time of 25-30 seconds is 1/2 of that from a current commercial DCT system at
      the same imaging dose. As with current commercial DCT systems, our s-DCT system will expose
      patients to less radiation and deliver comparable data for CACS. CG-SDCT will likely result
      in accurate CAC scoring and allow for a more complete patient risk assessment as compared to
      Framingham risk scoring alone.
