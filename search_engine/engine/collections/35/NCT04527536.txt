      feasibility and practical value of diagnostic markers in infants with BMJ.

      According to the admission criteria, 100 cases of early-onset BMJ, 100 late-onset BMJ and 100
      healthy controls will be selected. Their feces, peripheral venous blood and mothers' breast
      milk were collected for further testing. Compare the detection results of fecal miRNA and
      intestinal flora of the two groups of BMJ children and healthy controls, draw the ROC curve
      of the joint diagnosis, conduct research on the combined diagnostic value of fecal miRNA and
      intestinal flora analysis.

      This study is to find the objective and reliable laboratory indicators to diagnose BMJ.
