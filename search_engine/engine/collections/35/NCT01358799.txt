      protocol were not tested per protocol using the Gen-Probe APTIMA(R) CT (Chlamydia
      trachomatis) Assay. Instead, testing was conducted and results were generated with the
      Gen-Probe APTIMA(R) Combo 2 Assay (for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae). See
      Protocol Identification AC2PS-US11-001 (NCT01733069) for results. This action was recommended
      by the RRS team per their email to me on 8 February 2013.
