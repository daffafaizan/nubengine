      commonest primary liver cancer. However only a few patients are suitable for surgical
      resection and therefore endoscopic biliary drainage is the most used palliative treatment
      modality for malignant hilar stricture. However, whether one or two stents can benefit the
      patients most is still to be defined. Numerous retrospective case series reached different
      conclusion, till now, only one randomized trial compared the effect of unilateral versus
      bilateral stenting in patients with malignant hilar obstruction, nonetheless, nearly one
      third of the patients had Bismuth Type I stricture, and one stent is enough for drainage in
      this situation, therefore, the best drainage strategy for patients with Bismuth Type II or
      Bismuth Type III malignant hilar obstruction is unknown. The aim of the present study was to
      compare the effect of unilateral versus bilateral stenting in patients with Bismuth Type II
      or III malignant hilar obstruction.
