      peak reproductive years. In addition, gastroenterologists frequently advise and manage
      patients with CD who desire to conceive. Enteral nutrition therapy is effective for induction
      and maintenance of remission in reproductive age men with CD. However, there is no available
      data on the effects of enteral nutrition therapy on semen quality. The purpose of this study
      is to investigate the impact of enteral nutrition therapy on sperm quality of patients with
      CD.
