      Children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy occasionally have episodes of respiratory
      obstruction in the recovery room following administration of opioids.

      As dexmedetomidine provides some analgesia without respiratory depression,an intra-operative
      dose of dexmedetomidine may provide adequate analgesia without significant side effects
      thereby allowing for quick post operative recovery.
