      leukocytes counts, c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactate level will be
      performed, as well as arterial blood gas analysis.

      After admission to the intensive care unit, all patients will receive 100 mg of tramadol
      intravenously every 6 hours. Pain will be assessed before and half an hour after tramadol
      administration by verbal Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Pain score will be compared between
      patients with and without systemic inflammation. Systemic inflammation is defined as
      fulfilling at least two of the following major criteria: fever > 38 oC or hypothermia < 36
      oC, tachycardia > 90 beats/minute, pCO2 in arterial blood < 4.3 kPa and leukocytes >
      12.000/mm3 or < 4.000/mm3. Also, preoperative values of CRP > 50 mg/L and PCT > 0.5 ng/ml was
      also considered systemic inflammation.
