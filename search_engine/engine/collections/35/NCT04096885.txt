      and genetic signature that is associated with surgical site infections. Secondary aims and
      outcomes include the influence of metabolome on response to anesthetic drugs and acute and
      chronic pain, surgery- and anesthesia-factors related to short- and long-term oncological
      outcome, metabolic response effect on infectious complications and rejection after
      transplantation, bacteria-specific immune responses to major surgery after 2-4 weeks after
      surgery, metabolomics and macrobiotic markers for postoperative ileus or anastomotic leakage,
      and the effect of the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria on surgical outcome. All
      patients undergoing surgery in the investigators' clinic and who gave informed consent will
      be included. A blood sample will be taken before surgery, on the first postoperative day and
      after 3-8 weeks. A Urine sample will be taken after surgery and after 3-8 weeks. Sink and
      rectal swabs will be acquired before surgery. The samples will be stored in a Biobank.
      Additionally, all data routinely captured during the treatment of the patient from the
      different data collection systems in use in the investigators' hospital will be coded and
      centralized in a single, cohort database
