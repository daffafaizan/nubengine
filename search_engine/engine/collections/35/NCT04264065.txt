      included and followed for 90 days after admission. This observational study will allow us to
      collect and analyze data in order to design a quality interventional trial evaluating the
      value of albumin in the initial management of the severely burned patient.

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the incidence of a combined endpoint of
      mortality, severe acute renal failure (stage 3) and severe acute respiratory distress
      syndrome in severely burned patients.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Describe the prognosis of patients with severe burns, with particular emphasis on the
           impact of albumin on the prognosis of patients with severe burns.

        2. Describe how albumin is administered (i.e. doses, duration of treatment, continuous vs.
           bolus administration, hyperoncotic vs. hypooncotic solutions, etc.).
