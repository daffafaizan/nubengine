    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, safety
      study of the effects of ciclesonide nasal aerosol (74 mcg) on the HPA axis when administered
      once daily to male and premenarchal female subjects 6 to 11 years of age with a diagnosis of
      PAR.

      The study requires that subjects be domiciled during two 24- to 36-hour time periods for
      sample collection for serum and urinary free cortisol measurements, as well as PK evaluations
      (single [predose] time point during the first domiciled period, and 24-hour sampling during
      the second domiciled period).
