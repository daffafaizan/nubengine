      array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) for PGT-A in the Reproductive Medicine
      Center of Peking University Third Hospital from 2012 to 2016. If a couple underwent multiple
      stimulation cycles during the research period, only the first cycle was included. All
      patients underwent adequate clinical and genetic consultations before undergoing PGT-A, and
      all voluntarily chose PGT-A after fully understanding its risks and benefits. All patients
      signed the informed consent document of PGT-A. All included stimulation cycles involved
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection insemination. After successfully fertilized embryos formed
      blastocysts on Day 5-7, trophoblasts were biopsied to determine embryonic karyotypes. The
      blastocysts with normal/balanced test results were cryopreserved, whereas abnormal
      blastocysts were discarded after notifying the patients. All normal blastocysts from a
      patient were thawed and transferred singly, and the outcomes of all subsequent frozen-thawed
      embryo transfer cycles were followed-up until January 2020.

      Clinical outcomes included the blastocyst formation rate, the proportion of blastocysts with
      normal karyotypes, and the clinical pregnancy, live birth, and cumulative live birth rates.
      The factors that affected these clinical outcomes were analyzed to predict outcomes and guide
      treatment in women with uRM.
