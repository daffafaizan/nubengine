      responsible for the development of hyperglycemia. With continuous presence of insulin
      resistance, progressive loss of ß-cell function is the crucial defect. Hyperglycemia has
      deleterious effect on β-cell function, which is partially reversible by adequate glycemic
      control. In newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with severe hyperglycemia, 2 weeks
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) can induce adequate glycemic control with
      improvement of β-cell function. Nearly half of the patients can maintain euglycemia longer
      than 12 months by transient CSII. The improvement of β-cell function, especially the
      restoration of the first-phase insulin response is related to sustained euglycemia in the
      newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. But it is unclear whether any other interventions
      (such as oral hypoglycemic agents and multiple daily injections) inducing optimal glycemic
      control in a short period of time can have the same effect. As a multicenter, open-label,
      randomized, parallel-group study will be needed to further prove and clarify the findings.
