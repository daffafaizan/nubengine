      successful in restoration of life role participation for stroke survivors and a comparable
      schema used for cognitive training for TBI patients. The subject assessment and decision
      schema will be used to identify for each subject, the optimal array of impairment
      interventions. The proposed treatment will optimize outcome by customizing the intervention
      and use of technologies, while ensuring the application of the array of impairment
      interventions required to produce restoration of function and life role participation. The
      investigators will target an array of impairments preventing participation in life role
      activities, which will include dyscoordination and weakness of upper limb, impaired balance,
      gait deficits, and impaired attention and executive function. In treatment, the investigators
      will use a dual-task paradigm combining motor and cognitive training, with treatment
      extending to the every day environment. Treatment will be up to 5 times/wk, 5hrs/day for 12
      weeks.
