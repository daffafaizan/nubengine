      and occurs without sexual stimulation. It occurs when blood in the penis becomes trapped and
      is unable to drain properly. If it is not treated immediately, it can lead to scarring and
      permanent erectile dysfunction. Many cases of priapism are the result of sickle cell disease;
      approximately 42% of all adults with sickle cell disease will eventually develop priapism.
      Current treatments include medication, ice packs, or surgery. More research is needed to
      better understand the demographic and clinical characteristics of priapism. The purpose of
      this study is to collect information and further characterize priapism by conducting
      interviews with men with sickle cell disease. In turn, these findings may guide future
      priapism clinical trials.

      This study will consist of two standardized questionnaires that will be administered to 1,650
      men with sickle cell disease. Participants will complete an initial five-item questionnaire
      about priapism. If a participant indicates past experience with priapism on this initial
      questionnaire, he will be asked to complete a second questionnaire. This questionnaire will
      ask in-depth questions to further characterize the participant's episodes of priapism. If
      health issues such as drug use, harmful sexual behaviors, or impotence are identified upon
      reviewing the questionnaire, clinic staff will suggest care options and provide appropriate
      referrals to the participants. All participants will receive an educational brochure about
      priapism and compensation for completing the questionnaires.
