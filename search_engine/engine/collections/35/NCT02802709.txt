      injections of corticosteroids or viscosupplements such as hyaluronic acid. SB-061 is
      anticipated to relieve osteoarthritis pain by reinforcing the cartilage matrix and providing
      a lubricating coating of the cartilage. Subjects will receive 2 intra-articular injections of
      either SB-061 or placebo and be followed for 3 months to evaluate pain amelioration. Subjects
      and Investigators are blinded to treatment allocation.
