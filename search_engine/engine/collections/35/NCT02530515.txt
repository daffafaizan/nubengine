      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of infusion of autologous activated T-cells (ex
      vivo-activated autologous lymph node lymphocytes) in patients with chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study immune reconstitution following infusion of activated T-cells in patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      II. To study the incidence of infections for up to 1 year following activated T cell
      infusion.

      III. To study the overall response rates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive infusion of ex vivo-activated autologous lymph node lymphocytes
      intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on day 0.

      Patients who have been previously treated on study, and subsequently need additional
      infusions, may be retreated with previously cryopreserved expanded cells at the same or lower
      dose level 6-12 months after the first infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1.5 years and then every 6
      months for up to 5 years.
