      I. Graft failure/rejection and secondary graft failure.

      II. Day -200 non-relapse mortality.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Platelet engraftment by six months.

      II. Grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day 100 and one year.

      III. Chronic GVHD.

      IV. Clinically significant infections.

      V. Overall survival.

      VI. Relapse or disease progression.

      VII. Immune reconstitution (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center [FHCRC] only).

      VIII. Emergence of a dominant unit (FHCRC only).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (low risk for graft failure): Patients receive a conditioning regimen comprising
      fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once daily (QD) on days -6 to -2 and
      treosulfan IV over 120 minutes on days - 6 to -4. Patients undergo TBI on day -1. Patients
      then undergo donor UCBT on day 0. Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine
      IV over 1 hour or orally (PO) 2-3 times daily on days -3 to 100, followed by a taper in the
      absence of GVHD. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV 3 times daily on days 0 to
      40, followed by a taper in the absence of GVHD.

      ARM II (high risk for graft failure): Patients receive a conditioning regimen, TBI, donor
      UCBT, GVHD prophylaxis, and mycophenolate mofetil as in Arm I.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and 1 and 2
      years.
