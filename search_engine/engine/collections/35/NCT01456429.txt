      subsequently undergo surgical staging. Patients without tissue proof of mediastinal nodal
      disease at surgical staging will undergo a thoracotomy with systematic lymph node dissection.
      Provided mediastinal lymph node metastases are proven by echoendoscopy, the patient goes off
      study protocol and can further be assessed/treated according to local clinical practice.
