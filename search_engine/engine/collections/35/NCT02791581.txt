    
      840 women aged ≥18 years old scheduled to receive chemotherapy for Stage I-III breast cancer
      and a comparison population of 160 women without cancer (1,000 total). Equal numbers of women
      will be recruited aged < 52 vs. > 52. At baseline, innovative MRI measures of CV function (LV
      and aorta); measurements of submaximal (6-minute walk) and, on 45% of the cohort, maximal
      (peak VO2) exercise capacity; questionnaire data to assess fatigue and behavioral and
      psychosocial risk factors; and biomarkers will be collected.

      Measurements will be repeated at 3±1, 12±2 and 24±2 months. This study will assess the
      relevance of pre-existing factors such as age, black/white race, hypertension, smoking
      (yes/no), diabetes, coronary artery disease, menopause status, CV medications, and physical
      activity on the study outcomes. Also, this study will assess dynamic change in modifiable CV
      risk factors (including BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, serum glucose, physical activity,
      psychosocial factors, lifestyle behaviors), and the cancer treatment including chemotherapy,
      radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery.
