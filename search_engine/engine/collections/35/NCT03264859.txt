      in conditions like acute kidney injury and myocardial infarction. When a coronary artery is
      occluded, detrimental changes occur in myocardial vessels. After relief of the occlusion,
      blood flow to the heart may still be impeded, a phenomenon known as "no-reflow". Data is
      lacking on factors associated with early detection of patients at risk for this phenomenon,
      and early stratification of this group seems vital since the no-reflow phenomenon is
      associated with worse outcomes. The investigators hypothesized that there might be an
      association between higher NGAL levels and the occurrence of no-flow findings, and that NGAL
      might serve as a marker of worse prognosis in this population. The investigators also
      hypothesized that NGAL levels might serve as a marker of early acute kidney injury and that
      there might be specific patterns of NGAL levels over time in different subsets of patients.
      The aim of the study is to determine the association between NGAL levels at admission and
      during the first days after a ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the occurrence of the
      no-reflow phenomenon, the extent of myocardial damage ascertained by cardiac imaging
      techniques (echocardiography and cardiac resonance imaging). Data regarding patients'
      clinical, laboratory, electrocardiogram, coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary
      intervention, in-hospital and 30-day follow-up after discharge will be recorded.
