    
      Twenty healthy subjects will be allocated 4:1 to either the crossover study groups (16
      subjects) or to the 0.25 mg tablet single dose treatment (4 subjects). Subjects allocated to
      the crossover study groups will be randomized 1:1 to 0.5 mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects) or
      1.0 mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects).

      Within the crossover study groups, subjects will be further randomized to receive a single
      dose of KBP-5074 (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) in either capsule or tablet formulation in a 2-period
      crossover design with a 2-week washout period. The study duration for subjects in the
      crossover study groups will be approximately 7 weeks, which includes a 3-week screening
      period, and the 2 crossover single dose periods, which will be followed by a 2-week
      washout/follow-up period, respectively.

      Subjects allocated to the 0.25 mg dose cohort (n=4) will receive a single dose of 0.25 mg in
      tablet formulation only. The 0.25 mg tablet cohort will provide additional data for the
      evaluation of dose exposure for the tablet formulation. The study duration for the single
      dose arm will be 5 weeks, which includes a 3-week screening period, and the single dose which
      will be followed by a 2 week washout period.
