      have increased risk for perioperative stent thrombosis, especially when antiplatelet therapy
      discontinuation is required. Perioperative administration of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
      inhibitor may decrease the stent thrombosis risk, but it is cumbersome and carries high cost.
      Stents that have been endothelialized by optical coherence tomography (OCT) are likely to
      have low risk for perioperative stent thrombosis and therefore intensive management
      strategies, such as "bridging with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor" would not be required.
      The current study will assess whether OCT utilization can help optimize the preoperative
      management of DES patients requiring major non-cardiac surgery.

      The specific aim of this proposal is to examine the impact of OCT and IVUS-guided management
      of patients with prior DES implantation who need major non-cardiac surgery and
      discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy on the perioperative (1 week prior to surgery
      until 30 days post surgery) incidence of major adverse cardiac events.

      The hypothesis is that OCT and IVUS-guided treatment will have low incidence (≤10%) of
      perioperative major adverse cardiac events.
