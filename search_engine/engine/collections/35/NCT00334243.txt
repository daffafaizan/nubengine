      randomized to one of three different protocols in their upcoming IVF cycle. Each of the
      protocols will be performed as is the standard of care with the addition of serum evaluation
      during the course of the stimulation as well as follicular fluid analysis which is obtained
      as a byproduct of the oocyte retrieval. Chart review will be performed to collect background
      characteristics (including age, ethnicity, previous fertility treatment), treatment response
      (such as oocyte number, embryo grade, embryo quality), and pregnancy outcome (such as
      miscarriage, singleton pregnancy, or higher-order multiple pregnancy). Statistical analysis
      will be performed to determine if one protocol leads to higher pregnancy rates and
      multivariate analysis will be performed to determine potential etiologic variables.
