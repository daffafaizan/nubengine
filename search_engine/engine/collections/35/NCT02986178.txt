    
      This is a Phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in adult patients
      with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma. The objective of
      this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy (anti-tumor response and survival) of
      PVSRIPO in recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma.

      Patients will be administered PVSRIPO intratumorally via convection-enhanced delivery (CED)
      using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Retreatment
      with PVSRIPO is allowed, provided retreatment eligibility criteria are met.

      All patients who receive PVSRIPO treatment will be included in efficacy and safety analyses.
