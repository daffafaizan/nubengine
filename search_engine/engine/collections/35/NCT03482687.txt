      a classroom- and computer-based healthy relationships and dating violence prevention
      curriculum for 6th grade students, in a large, urban public school district in Southeast
      Texas. This curriculum was adapted from an existing effective sex education and relationship
      curriculum, It's Your Gameâ€¦Keep it Real (IYG), which was enhanced to more explicitly address
      teen dating violence (TDV) and encompass multiple levels of the social-ecological model
      (e.g., youth, family, school staff). A randomized two-arm, nested design was conducted among
      6th grade students, where students receiving the curriculum were compared to students
      receiving usual care. Ten middle schools participated in the study, five schools were
      randomly assigned to receive the curriculum and five to receive usual care. Outcomes were
      assessed at baseline, immediately following the intervention, and 12 months after baseline.
      Parental permission and student assent were obtained prior to administration of the surveys.
      The primary hypothesis is that students who receive the curriculum will have significantly
      lower TDV perpetration than those who do not receive the curriculum.
