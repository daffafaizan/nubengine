      interval [PFI] â‰¥6 mo.) and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [PROC] (PFI <6 mo.) subtypes.
      Prognosis for the latter group is dismal and current guidelines recommend treating these
      patients with non-platinum based chemotherapy. However, the evidence behind this is quite
      unconvincing and according to recent data patients with non-platinum refractory
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer could derive benefit from platinum rechallenge. This trial
      is designed for head-to-head comparison of platinum and non-platinum therapy efficacy in
      treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
