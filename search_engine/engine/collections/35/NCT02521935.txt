      wash-out period is flawed for this study, and its weakness is the potential for a carryover
      effect (benefits or risks associated with treatment A carry over to treatment B). A wash-out
      period is not feasible for this study because it would require the patient-subjects to
      suspend use of their dentures for the duration of the wash-out period.

      The Investigators have decided to conduct the study using the ABB/BAA crossover design, which
      does not require a wash-out period and will permit testing and discounting of a possible
      carryover effect. In addition, this design is more appropriate for a small sample size than
      the AB/BA design.

      The investigators are adding to the scant literature on digital dentures, information that
      has never before been studied - the retention, aesthetics, and stability of digital dentures
      compared to conventional dentures. Additionally, the investigators will have longitudinal
      data on these characteristics regarding digital dentures.

      If the Functional Assessment of Dentures (FAD) and the patient evaluation show positive
      results for the digital dentures, this could lead to increased use of the Computer -Aided
      Design/ Computer -Aided Manufacturing (CADCAM) fabrication method which, in turn, would allow
      greater numbers of people to benefit from the advantages of the digital dentures as described
      earlier in this application (e.g., a better fit, fewer visits with less time in the chair,
      less biofilm formation, etc.)
