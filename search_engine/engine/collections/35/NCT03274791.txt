    
      40 COPD patients (21 smokers and 19 never smokers) and 28 healthy never smokers were included
      in the present study. Information about respiratory symptoms and comorbidities were
      collected. Subjects underwent pulmonary function tests and COPD was defined according to
      Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive lung Disease spirometric criteria. Induced sputum
      was collected to determine total and differential inflammatory cells counts as well as
      inflammatory mediators (Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)). The
      Mann-Whitney U and the χ2 tests were used for results comparisons. Correlations between
      symptoms, spirometric parameters, cytokines levels, inflammatory cells and risk factors of
      COPD were examined with Spearman's rank correlation test.
