      progression to lipo-lymphedema, lipedema is conservatively treated with physiotherapy, manual
      lymph drainage and compression, also known as complex decongestive physiotherapy.
      Furthermore, the consensus of the International Society of Lymphology has stated that
      intermittent pneumatic compression is an optional treatment which may be applied as an
      adjuvant therapy to complex decongestive physiotherapy. All participants included in the
      study were included in a treatment protocol consisting of complex decongestive physiotherapy
      and intermittent pneumatic compression. The Perometer was used in the measurement of upper
      extremity volume and circumference before and after treatment.
