      receive a specific diagnosis, leaving the majority of patients diagnosed with non specific
      low back pain(NSLBP). Classification systems can help to guide the treatment of NSLBP.This
      project will recruit patients , classified with a "flexion pattern" according to the
      classification system proposed by Peter OÂ´Sullivan. When classified with a flexion pattern
      the patients will be randomized into either of two treatment arms. Manual therapy
      (manipulation and soft tissue treatment)and exercises by a chiropractor or to a
      classification based biopsychosocial intervention done by a physiotherapist, (a
      cognitive/functional approach) as described by Peter O'Sullivan

      This pilot study has three specific aims:

      (i) To determine the mean and standard deviation on the numerical rating scale of
      participants in this setting who have a motor control flexion pattern, so that sample size
      calculations for a fully powered randomized controlled trial could be performed.

      (ii) To test the logistical and practical procedures that will be required to perform a fully
      powered randomized controlled trial using these two treatments.

      (iii) To gain a preliminary estimate of any difference in the effect of these two treatments,
      so as to determine if the results of a fully powered randomized controlled trial might be
      clinically important and therefore worthwhile undertaking
