    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) treated with combination
      of ixazomib with gemcitabine and doxorubicin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of
      response (DOR) and safety of the combination of ixazomib with gemcitabine and doxorubicin in
      patients with RMC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers, such as tumor tissue protein disulfide isomerase (PDI),
      binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), and phosphorylated eIF2a (eIF2aP), as well as serum
      levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), for patient stratification, and as pharmacodynamics measures
      of treatment response.

      II. To determine, via the molecular profiling of biopsy and blood speciments, the mechanisms
      of resistance to the trial therapy (ixazomib + gemcitabine + doxorubicin).

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO), gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 90
      minutes, and doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for
      up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ixazomib PO and gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes. Cycles repeat
      every 14 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 3
      months thereafter.
