      disease) such as stroke and heart attack. Clinical trials have shown that lowering blood
      pressure in patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) reduces the number of
      cardiovascular events.

      Many people still have untreated hypertension. There are many reasons why target blood
      pressure is not reached. One is that most patients need more than one antihypertensive drug
      in order to lower high blood pressure. Other reasons include poor patient compliance with
      taking their drugs.

      Combining drugs that lower high blood pressure and have similar ways of working in the body
      may help high blood pressure and lower the risk for medication-related side effects. One of
      several drug combinations recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure is an
      angiotensin receptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic. Guidelines also note that combination
      tablets may improve patient compliance with taking their drugs.

      Candesartan is an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic with
      blood pressure-lowering effect. This study will combine both of these drugs in one pill and
      see how it works in people taking part in this study.
