    
      Up to 80 adolescents aged 12-18 years who have experienced adversity (childhood maltreatment
      and other forms of broader victimisation experiences) from India and Nepal will be randomly
      allocated to receive a 5-session cognitive bias modification training (with attention and
      interpretation bias modification modules) or a control condition over a 2-week period.

      Pre and post-assessment measures include measures of attention and interpretation biases and
      symptoms of internalising and externalising psychopathology. In addition, in a subset of
      adolescents, brain activity data acquired using EEG will be acquired either during resting or
      viewing emotional face stimuli. Data from these measures will be used to generate effect
      sizes of changes for each group as well as being used in a limited number of
      significance-testing analysis. All adolescents will complete a feedback form, upon which
      acceptability of the intervention will be assessed.
