             -  The patients will be admitted to laminar air flow room.

             -  The patients will have triple lumen Hickman central venous catheter (CVC) placed.
                Vancomycin 1 gm IV immediately prior to CVC placement and 1 gm q 12 hours for 3
                doses. Chest X-ray should be taken after CVC placement to confirm the location of
                CVC and absence of pneumothorax.

             -  Lumbar puncture will be done and intrathecal preservative free methotrexate 10 ㎎/㎡
                (not to exceed 12 ㎎ total) will be given. Folinic acid 15 ㎎ will be given po or IV
                24 hours after intrathecal methotrexate and q 6 hours for a total of 4 doses.

             -  Menstruating women will be given norethindrone (Norlutate) 10 ㎎ po daily.

        2. The preparatory regimen is as follows:

             -  Conditioning therapy will start on day -7 in patients who are randomized to receive
                intravenous busulfan (Busulfex®; Orphan Medical, Minnetonka, MN) plus
                cyclophosphamide. Busulfex 3.2 ㎎/㎏ will be administered once daily for 4 days (days
                -7 to -4) followed by cyclophosphamide 60 ㎎/㎏ in D5W 200 ㎖ i.v. over 1-2 hours on
                days -3 and -2. Busulfex will be diluted in normal saline 500 ㎖ and infused over 3
                hours by pump through a central venous catheter The doses of Busulfex and
                cyclophosphamide will be calculated using following guideline: 1) if actual body
                weight (ABW) of the patient is less or equal to ideal body weight (IBW), ABW will
                be used. 2) if ABW is greater than IBW but by less than 20%, then IBW will be used.
                3) if ABW is greater than IBW by more or equal to 20 %, then the dose will be based
                on; IBW + 25 % (ABW-IBW). IBW is calculated as follows: 50 ㎏ + 2.3 ㎏ (Height in
                inch - 60) in male, and 45.5 ㎏ +2.3 ㎏ (Height in inch -60) (1 inch= 2.54 ㎝).

             -  Conditioning therapy will start on day -7 in patients who are randomized to receive
                Busulfex plus fludarabine (Fludara®, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). Busulfex 3.2
                ㎎/㎏ will be administered once daily for 4 days (days -7 to -4) and fludarabine 30
                ㎎/㎡ will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes in D5W 100 ㎖ for 5 consecutive
                days (days -6 to -2). The dose of Busulfex will be calculated using above-mentioned
                guideline (see 5.5.1). The dose of fludarabine will be calculated using ABW.

             -  Cyclosporine dose will be decreased by 10 % every month starting day 60 of BMT
                provided that there is no clinical evidence of GVHD.

             -  In addition to cyclosporine, methotrexate 15 ㎎/㎡ will be given intravenously on day
