      Primary

        -  Determine the 1-year progression-free survival of patients with limited-stage small cell
           lung cancer treated with bevacizumab, cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day
      1 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During course 1, patients
      also undergo thoracic radiotherapy twice daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19.

      Patients achieving a complete or partial response or stable disease after the first 4 courses
      of chemotherapy continue to receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      with bevacizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Within 4-6 weeks after blood counts recover from the first 4 courses of chemotherapy,
      patients achieving a complete or partial response also undergo prophylactic cranial
      irradiation (PCI) in 10 fractions over 3 weeks.*

      NOTE: *Bevacizumab should not be given for 3 weeks prior to or during PCI, but resumed 1 week
      after completion of PCI.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 79 patients will be accrued for this study.
