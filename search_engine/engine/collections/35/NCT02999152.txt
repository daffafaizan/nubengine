      an accident, it is primordial to define the biologic dosimetry. The dose and distribution
      knowledge is crucial for the medical care. Indeed, Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Partial
      Body Irradiation (PBI) do not have the same clinical outcome. A Total Body Irradiation
      induces an acute radiation syndrome with a Medullary Aplasia. A quick diagnostic would allow
      the optimization of the medical care.

      Nowadays, the analyse of the chromosome with two centromeres is the current norm to estimate
      the radiation dose, but this technique is time consuming, and not adapted to an emergency
      situation, and to a large population.

      The new genetic techniques could permit the quick radiation dosimetry diagnosis. The research
      of early exposition bio-markers seems to be of a major interest. These bio-markers would
      allow to rapidly define the radiations perceived by an exposed subject, before the apparition
      of the symptoms, and by the way, to conduct to a therapeutic strategy more adapted to the
      patient.

      In this purpose, the present study will need blood and urines samples of patients totally or
      partially exposed to radiations, according to their usual medical care.
