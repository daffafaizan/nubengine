      over time. Dramatic increases in disease activity are considered flare. This study will
      follow patients with increased risk for flare prospectively for one year. Serial
      questionnaires and disease activity scores will be compared to blood samples to better
      understand the molecular phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis flares.
