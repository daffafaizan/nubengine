    
      The primary aims of this study are to 1) investigate the effects of auricular transcutaneous
      vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) on brain-gut signaling using a liquid meal test in functional
      dyspepsia (FD) and gastroparesis (GP) patients using combined gastric, autonomic and
      neuroimaging measures, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of taVNS on FD and GP symptoms.

      A total of 25 FD and 25 GP patients will be enrolled in this study, both females and males,
      ranging between 18 and 65 years of age. There will be multiple study visits consisting of a
      screening, baseline testing, consumption of a liquid meal, and fMRI brain and gut imaging
      sessions. Visits will include active and inactive taVNS delivered to the outer ear at a
      moderate, non-painful level.
