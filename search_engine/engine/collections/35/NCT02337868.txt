      escalation phase 1 trial, evaluating dosages of 1 mcg and 4 mcg of HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine
      given intramuscularly on Day 1 and Day 29 in up to 50 healthy adults > /=18 and < 50 years of
      age at a single site. The study will consist of two dosing groups of HydroVax-001 vaccine to
      be enrolled sequentially. Each dose group will consist of 20 individuals who receive
      HydroVax-001 and 5 who receive placebo. Controls will receive sterile 0.9 percent NaCl
      placebo intramuscularly at days 1 and 29. The study duration is approximately 25 months (12
      month enrollment, 13 month follow up) and subject participation duration of approximately 14
      months. The primary objective is to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of
      the HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine administered intramuscularly in a two-dose series on Days 1 and
      29 at a dose of 1 mcg or a dose of 4 mcg. The secondary objective is to assess WNV-specific
      plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) responses after a first dose and after a second
      dose of HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine given at doses of 1 mcg and 4 mcg. This study aims to
      recruit up to 50 men and women between the ages of 18 and 50. The study duration is
      approximately 25 months at a single site and subject participation duration is approximately
      14 months.
