      use authorized PCR test result. The intent is to show the rapid test device is comparable to
      a currently marketed device. The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is an in vitro lateral flow immunoassay
      intended for qualitative detection of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human fingerstick
      whole blood at the Point of Care (POC); i.e. in patient care settings operating under a CLIA
      Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation; and at
      home.

      The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an
      adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection. At this time,
      it is unknown for how long antibodies persist following infection and if the presence of
      antibodies confers protective immunity. Testing of human fingerstick whole blood is intended
      to be conducted in a home-like setting of a facility authorized to perform CLIA waived tests.
