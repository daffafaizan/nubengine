      In the last years, the management of Fallopian tubes in benign surgery has drawn a lot of
      attention due to rising evidence showing that some aggressive forms of ovarian cancer may
      originate from the distal Fallopian tubes. Concerns were raised about the implications of
      salpingectomy to surgical outcome and function of the ovaries. The SALSTER study attempts to
      evaluate the effect of salpingectomy, in regards to surgical outcomes and ovarian function,
      in women seeking permanent contraception with tubal ligation.

      The SALSTER study is a register-based randomized clinical trial (R-RCT) that examines if
      laparoscopic salpingectomy instead of tubal ligation, as a contraceptive method, has no
      increased risk for complications and has no negative impact on ovarian function.
      Complications will be assessed primarily at eight weeks post-surgery according to the
      Clavien-Dindo classification and the existing complications questionnaires in the Swedish
      National Quality Register of Gynecological Surgery (GynOp). Ovarian function will be
      primarily assessed by determining the age of natural menopause, measured through
      questionnaires on bleeding pattern in GynOp every other year. Approximately 900 patients will
      be recruited.

      In a subset of patients, the difference in Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone (AMH) levels from the time
      of surgery and 1-year after surgery will be compared between the groups. Approximately 180
      patients will be recruited.

      The study is expected to start in the beginning of 2019 and the first results are expected in
      2021.
