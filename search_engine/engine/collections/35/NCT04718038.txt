      reintroduction of chemotherapy regimens to patients with nonresectable mCRC, multiline
      treatment strategy of continuing bevacizumab after progression to first-line bevacizumab plus
      chemotherapy demonstrated optimal clinical benefits in prolonging progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) . Continuing cetuximab after progression to first-line
      cetuximab is also a promising strategy. The underlying hypothesis is that a sustained
      inhibition of EGFR signaling with cetuximab would continuously eliminate sensitive clones of
      RAS wild-type tumor. The present phase 2 clinical trial evaluated standard
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy combined with cetuximab among patients with wild-type
      KRAS, NRAS and BRAF V600E mCRC who had progressed after cetuximab plus standard chemotherapy
      in the first-line setting.
