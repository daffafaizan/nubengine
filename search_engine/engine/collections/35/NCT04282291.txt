      especially in procedures that generate a severe postoperative pain2, as media laparotomy or
      subcostal incision. The purpose is to not retard the patients' recovery and to avoid
      complications. The thoracic epidural analgesia is still the reference analgesic technique in
      open abdominal surgery7, although it is not exempt of limitations and complications. That is
      why, since the introduction of thoracic and abdominal fascial blocks, they have been part of
      the analgesic strategy, being an alternative to considerer instead the epidural.
