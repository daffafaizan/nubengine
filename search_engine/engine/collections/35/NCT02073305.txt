      population, and may participate to the increased cardiovascular mortality observed in this
      group of patients. Despite a significant increase in knowledge about the harmful effects of
      obstructive sleep apnea in the general population, the prognostic impact of sleep apnea in
      the end stage renal disease population has not yet been investigated.

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the hypothesis that moderate to severe sleep
      apnea increase the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with end stage renal
      disease.

      The severity of sleep apnea is measured at inclusion and the patients are followed during 3
      years to assess the cardiovascular end-points. The result of the sleep study is communicated
      to the treating physician and the decision whether to treat or not sleep apnea is left to the
      treating physician, independently of the study protocol. The comparison will include three
      groups: patients without sleep apnea, untreated patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea
      and treated patients with sleep apnea.
