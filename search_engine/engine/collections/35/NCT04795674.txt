      engagement in n=62 ADHD diagnosed adolescents randomized to a 'sham training' placebo or to
      train 4 times each week using 4 different EWM exercises that have been combined into the
      format of a typical cognitive training intervention. Exercise difficulty levels in the active
      intervention will increase across 5 weeks to continually challenge EWM ability. EWM training
      will use a novel, remotely-supervised 'at home' computerized training approach. If R61 EWM
      training target engagement milestones are met, a 3-year R33 phase will begin. The R33 will
      replicate target engagement in another randomized placebo-controlled trial of n=90 new ADHD
      adolescents and attempt to establish a convincing link between the hypothesized targets and
      ADHD symptom expression. It also will characterize ADHD brain activity or EWM ability changes
      relative to typical levels seen in an n=40 non-ADHD control group.
