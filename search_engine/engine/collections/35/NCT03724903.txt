      Among them, periductal mastitis and idiopathic granulomatous mastitis(IGM) are the most
      commonly encountered in clinical practice. IGM can be diagnosed when all possible causes of
      granulomatous diseases (known mycobacterial or fungal infection, Wegener granulomatosis,
      sarcoidosis, etc.) are excluded. There is no consensus on the standard treatment of IGM
      patients. Surgery, oral corticosteroids, topical steroids, immunosuppressive therapy, and
      observation alone were all proposed as the treatment for IGM patients. However, all of the
      evidences are derived from retrospective studies. In a previous study, the investigators
      conducted a single-arm, proof-of-concept trial that showed the safety and efficacy of ductal
      lavage as a treatment for IGM patients. Ductal lavage is possible to spare the patients from
      corticosteroids therapy and or surgery. To further address this issue, the investigators are
      going to conduct this multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, non-inferior trial, to compare
      the efficacy and safety of ductal lavage and corticosteroids therapy. The aim of this study
      is to provide evidence for the management of IGM patients.
