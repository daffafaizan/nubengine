      with radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the
      intratumoral pharmacology and quantitative pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium. Patients
      receive a loading dose regimen comprising motexafin gadolinium IV over 10-15 minutes on days
      1-5 or days 1-5 and 8-12 (cohort 7). After the loading dose regimen, patients receive a
      maintenance regimen comprising motexafin gadolinium IV 3 times weekly for a maximum of 6.5
      weeks. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6.5 weeks. Cohorts
      of 3-6 patients receive an escalating number of doses of motexafin gadolinium until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and
      then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
