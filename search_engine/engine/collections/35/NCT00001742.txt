      substances that act on the underlying smooth muscle. This regulatory activity of the
      endothelium is dysfunctional in a number of cardiovascular conditions, including essential
      hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies from our group have implicated a
      decreased action of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) as the mechanism responsible for
      this abnormality. Whether this reduced bioactivity of NO is related to vasoactive prostanoids
      remains uncertain.

      We propose to test the hypothesis that an increased production of vasoactive prostanoids by
      the cyclooxygenase (COX) system is responsible for the reduced bioactivity of NO in essential
      hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. We will investigate the effect of COX inhibition by
      aspirin (ASA) on resting vascular tone, and on both endothelium-dependent and independent
      vasodilation in normal subjects, hypertensive patients, and hypercholesterolemic patients.

      For this purpose, we propose to analyze the regional vascular responses to acetylcholine
      (ACH) and to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) before and after the administration of ASA. We will
      also analyze the basal forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to increasing doses of ASA
      infusion. We will employ infusion of drugs into the brachial artery and we will measure the
      responses of the forearm vasculature by means of strain gauge plethysmography.
