      United States. Each year, more than 750,000 Americans suffer a symptomatic stroke.

      Currently, tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved treatment for acute
      ischemic stroke; however, its usefulness is limited because most patients cannot reach
      medical attention within the necessary 3-hour time window. In addition, rt-PA cannot be given
      in the field because it is contraindicated for treatment of patients with brain hemorrhage.

      The purpose of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial is to demonstrate that
      paramedic initiation of the neuroprotective agent magnesium sulfate in the field is an
      effective and safe treatment for acute stroke. This study will analyze magnesium sulfate, an
      experimental therapy for stroke, versus placebo among ambulance-transported patients with
      acute stroke. This trial will also demonstrate that paramedics can safely, effectively, and
      rapidly start neuroprotective therapies for stroke.
