      have renal insufficiency Busulfan introduces cytopenia much slower than melphalan while the
      time to recover after transplantation is the same. The duration of cytopenia with busulfan
      should therefore be shorter. Busulfan given in myeloma patients with renal failure has proven
      to be effective.

      The initial proposed dose level in our study will be 3.2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for
      3 days. The next levels will be 3.2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 4 days, 4.3 mg/kg of
      body weight over 6 hours for 3 days, 5.6 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days, and
      6.4 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days. Three patients per group will be entered at
      the first level. Further enrollment will be dependent upon toxicities observed. All dose
      escalations will be initiated after the PI has reviewed the toxicity data available on the
      prior dose levels and confirms that it is safe to proceed to subsequent dose level(s).
      Maximum tolerated dose will defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at
      which â‰¥ 2 of 6 patients experiences a grade 4 non-hematological toxicity that is unexpected,
      related, and serious, and it will be evaluated separately for patients > 65 years of age or
      in patients with renal insufficiency.
