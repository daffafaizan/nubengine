    
      Relevant patients due to come to clinic or the programmed investigation unit will be offered
      the opportunity to participate in the study.

      Up to 100 consenting individuals will

        -  have an additional 15 mls of supplementary research bloods taken

        -  receive a single tablet of ferrous sulphate 200mg

        -  fill in questionnaires that formally evaluate their nosebleed losses and dietary iron
           intake in the preceding 12 months

        -  have a second blood sample later that day (20 mls of blood)

      The primary outcome measure is the change in serum iron levels post iron tablet.

      Other outcome measures will include:

        -  Haematinic indices indicating whether their iron requirements have been met previously.

        -  Additional predicted iron intake requirements to adjust for haemorrhagic iron losses
