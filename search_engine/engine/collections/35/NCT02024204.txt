      symptoms in patients in the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center. Patients in the
      WTC EHC with uncontrolled LRS at visit 1 will be identified and placed on high-dose inhaled
      corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists for three months. Adherence will be assessed at
      monthly visits. Patients will perform spirometry and oscillometry at baseline and after 3
      months of treatment. They will also be assessed for markers of airway inflammation, bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness and co-morbid conditions including depression,anxiety,post-traumatic
      stress disorder, gastroesophageal reflux, paradoxical vocal cord motion and rhinosinusitis.
