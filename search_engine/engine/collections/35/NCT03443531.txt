      hospitalization rate and mortality, poor quality of life and heavy financial burden. The main
      clinical manifestations are persistent or recurrent cough, expectoration, sometimes
      accompanied by hemoptysis, which can cause respiratory dysfunction and chronic pulmonary
      heart disease. There are some randomized controlled trials of TCM for bronchiectasis, and
      have the effect in the treatment of bronchiectasis, reducing the number of acute aggravation
      and alleviating dyspnea. However, some TCM interventions lack comprehensive syndrome
      differentiation and the placebo control.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to compare the efficacy to
      evaluate the effectiveness of TCM on patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis. 216
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one therapies (TCM treatments based on syndrome
      differentiation) and the other therapy (placebo of TCM treatment) for 24 weeks. After the
      treatment period, the subjects will be followed up for 24 weeks. The primary outcomes include
      the frequency of bronchiectasis exacerbation, and the secondary outcomes include quality of
      life (SGRQ, LCQ, QOL-B), pulmonary function, safety observation index.
