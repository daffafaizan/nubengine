      I. Decrease the incidence of relapse to < 15% at 6 month post transplant in patients with
      high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transplanted from
      related or unrelated donors, without unacceptably increasing toxicity (10% non-relapse
      mortality [NRM] at 6 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the incidence of NRM at 180 days and 1 year after hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT).

      II. Evaluate overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). III. Incidence of grades
      II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). IV. Incidence of chronic GVHD. V. Donor
      chimerism on days +28 and +100.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days -6 to day -2 and treosulfan IV over 2 hours on days -6 to day -4. Patients
      also undergo total-body irradiation on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation or
      bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) on days -1 to 56, followed by a taper until day 180 in the absence of GVHD. Patients
      also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
