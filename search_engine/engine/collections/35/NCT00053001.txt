        -  Determine whether the combination of epoetin alfa and thalidomide improves the anemia
           and/or decreases the need for red cell transfusion in patients with low- or
           intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine whether this regimen improves the bone marrow morphology and cytogenetics,
           alters the natural history of the disease, and reduces the frequency of leukemic
           transformation in these patients.

        -  Evaluate whether this regimen improves pathophysiologic parameters (e.g., apoptosis,
           tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration, microvessel density, vascular endothelial
           growth factor, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes) in the bone marrow of these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 8 weeks. After 8
      weeks, patients unresponsive to epoetin alfa alone receive oral thalidomide once daily in
      addition to epoetin alfa SC once weekly for a maximum of 24 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years..
