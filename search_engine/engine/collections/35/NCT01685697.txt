      (FP) (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) 'round' neonatal resuscitation mask.
      The two point top hold for Laerdal 'round' mask and the rim hold for the Fisher & Paykel
      mask.

      A Respiratory Function Monitor will be placed between the face mask and the ventilation
      device. It uses a small (dead space 1 mL) flow sensor to measure gas flow in and out of a
      face mask. This signal is automatically integrated to provide inspired and expired tidal
      volume. The difference equals the leak from the face mask. It also calculates respiratory
      rate and minute ventilation, measures spontaneous inspirations and ventilation pressures. The
      signals of airway flow, tidal volumes, airway pressure, inspired oxygen concentration,
      temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate will be digitised and recorded at
      200Hz using the Spectra physiological recording program (a customised neonatal respiratory
      physiology program).

      We will compare the % of mask leak within the two face masks.
