      or more on the visual analog pain scale, since less than 24 hours, in the limbs, spine or
      thorax are randomized in a control arm or an interventional arm.

      The patients in the control arm will receive the institution's classical analgetic protocol
      level 1 and 3, the patients in the intervention arm are given classical level 1 medication as
      well as intranasal Sufentanil.

      Pain is then measured using the Visual Analogue Pail Scale at 15-20 minutes and at 60
      minutes. At both these time points, adverse effects and vitals are also assessed.
