    
      Total 300 treatment-na√Øve chronic hepatitis C patients will be enrolled. The prevalence of
      NIDDM, IGT and IR will be explored in this hospital-based study among the clinically defined
      chronic hepatitis C Taiwanese. The clinical manifestations of chronic hepatitis C in the
      biochemical, virological and histopathological aspects will be evaluated. Liver enzymes will
      be measured on a multichannel autoanalyzer. Virological markers for HCV including serum HCV
      RNA detected using a standardized automated qualitative PCR assay, HCV RNA genotypes
      determined for genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and 3a and serum HCV RNA levels measured by using the
      branched DNA assay. The liver histology will be assessed for scoring the disease activity
      grade quantitatively according to the histological activity index (HAI). Patients are
      assigned a diagnosis of DM if there was documented use of oral hypoglycemic medication or
      insulin, random glucose in excess of 200 mg/dL, or fasting glucose greater than 126 mg/dL on
      two occasions. A standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed. In addition
      to an OGTT, a history of diabetes mellitus by chart review and/or questionnaire will be also
      obtained. Standard antiviral therapy will be carried out with PEG-IFN, given subcutaneously
      weekly plus 1,000-1,200 mg of oral ribavirin daily. Patients will receive another 24 week of
      follow-up period to determine the virological response.
