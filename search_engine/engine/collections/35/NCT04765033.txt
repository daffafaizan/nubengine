      To determine the efficacy of nebulized 5% hypertonic saline on cough severity and quality of
      life, in children with non-CF CSLD.

      Here the investigators will be using validated pediatric cough questionnaires to asses this.
      Patients will answer these questionnaires at first recruitment ( -1 mth), at randomization (0
      month) and after 3 mths of use of the nebulized study drug (+ 3 mths)

      Secondary Aims:

      To determine the:

        1. Efficacy of nebulized 5% hypertonic saline on the airway microbiome, pulmonary
           exacerbation rate, healthcare utilization, and rescue antibiotics.

           Here the investigators will be taking history on the exacerbations, use of antibiotics
           and healthcare utilization before and after use of the hypertonic saline. Furthermore,
           Nasopharyngeal swabs will be done to review possible changes in microbiota, again before
           and after use of the 5% HS.

        2. Efficacy of nebulized 5% hypertonic saline on lung function. Here is investigators will
           be doing portable spirometry ( pre and post bronchodilator).

           Patients will perform at randomization (0 month) and after 3 mths of use of the
           nebulized study drug (+ 3 mths)

        3. Adverse effects of nebulized 5% hypertonic saline in children HS has been associated
           with side-effects. The investigators will monitor this. We will asses presence of these
           symptoms at randomization (0 month) and after 3 mths of use of the nebulized study drug
           (+ 3 mths) to ensure these are from the nebulizer.
