      semi-rural Johnston County, NC. Teachers will complete a screening form on each child.
      Controls will be randomly selected. Mothers of potential cases and controls will be
      interviewed by telephone about their child's symptoms of ADHD and exposure history, their
      family history of ADHD, and their reproductive and exposure history. Children's shed baby
      teeth will be analyzed for lead. Mothers will complete brief parenting scales and the Child
      Behavior Checklist. School records will be collected. The study goals are to identify risk
      factors for ADHD including preterm delivery and childhood lead exposure.
