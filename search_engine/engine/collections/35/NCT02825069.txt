      first health nurse visit (at or before 1 month of age) in the local primary care child health
      clinics. Families in the intervention group will get an instruction booklet including
      information on early systematic introduction of solid foods starting at the age of 4 months,
      with foodstuff from all major groups in diet by the age of 6 months (vegetables and fruits,
      wheat and other grains, meat, fish, egg, dairy products). Furthermore, the booklet includes
      information and instructions on food related symptoms and atopic eczema. Babies with mild
      symptoms are encouraged to continue the symptom-eliciting food. All families fill out monthly
      internet-based questionnaires on food diary, symptoms, diagnoses and health care visits until
      the age of 1 year.
