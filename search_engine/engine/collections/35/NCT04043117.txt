      These two variables are the most affected in patients with the oncological disease.

      The consequences of a visible difference may have a significant impact on behaviour and mood,
      causing relevant impairments in individuals well-being and quality of life. Among different
      personal attributes, self-esteem may be the one with the greatest impact on body image (Cash,
      2002). Indeed previous studies have investigated different features of body image and
      self-esteem (Webster & Tiggemann, 2003), showing that they have a significant influence on
      the overall well-being (Cash & Fleming, 2002), and that those aspects are also significantly
      influenced by age and gender. The patients are evaluated at T0 (within the first week of
      hospitalization after diagnosis), T1 (within 3 months after diagnosis), T2 (within 6 months
      after diagnosis), T3 (within 12 months after diagnosis, at the end of cancer treatment),
      according to a follow-up study design. Data analysis: r Pearson's correlation, repeated
      measure ANOVA and regression analysis will be carried out to investigate relations between
      studied variables and eventual changes over time. Analyses are performed using SPSS software
      (Chicago, S. P. S. S. SPSS Inc; 2008. SPSS Statistics, 17.)
