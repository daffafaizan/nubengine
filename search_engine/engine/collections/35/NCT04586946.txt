      scarring (called fibrosis) within the lung. This causes failure of the lung and patients
      become progressively more breathless over time. The commonest of these diseases is idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis and this is a devastating condition with a survival of 3-5 years.

      Many people with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases have disrupted sleep as well as low
      oxygen levels at night or obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA - pauses in breathing at night time
      due to obstruction of the upper airway).

      Patients with low oxygen levels at night have a worse quality of life, with fatigue during
      the day and survive for less long.

      102 patients from specialist clinics at Guy's and St Thomas' and the Royal Brompton and
      Harefield NHS Foundation Trusts will be recruited. This research is funded by a grant from
      the British Lung Foundation. The investigators aim to compare patients with and without low
      oxygen levels at night by observing how their disease and quality of life changes over a
      year.

      Patients will be asked to complete a two-night home sleep study which will involve wearing a
      probe over the finger connected to a sensor on the wrist. Patients will also be provided with
      a home spirometer to measure their breathing at home daily during the study.

      Lung function testing (which is part of normal clinical practice), a six-minute walk test and
      quality of life questionnaires will be performed at the beginning of the study. These
      investigations will be repeated at six and twelve months and this will tell us how night time
      oxygen levels affect the progression of the disease, quality of life, exercise tolerance,
      hospitalisation frequency and survival of these patients.
