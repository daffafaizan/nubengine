      conventional, simplified, and modified papilla preservation techniques. The drawback of these
      techniques is the post-surgical gingival recession.

      In order to overcome this drawback, the "entire papilla preservation" technique has been
      proposed, by preserving the whole integrity of the defect associated papilla providing a
      tunnel-like undermining incision. Recently a novel surgical procedure, termed nonincised
      papillae surgical approach (NIPSA), was designed to maintain the integrity of the interdental
      soft tissues covering intrabony defects. This would prevent biomaterial exposure associated
      with loss of papillary height, increase the amount of space for hard and soft tissue
      regeneration, and minimize gingival recession.
