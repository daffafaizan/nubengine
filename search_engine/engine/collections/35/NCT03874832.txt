      healthy subjects. Part 1 was designed to identify a dose level of STS101 for administration
      in Part 2. Subjects in Part 1 received 3 ascending doses of STS101 in a 3-period crossover
      manner. During Part 2, subjects received the dose of STS101 selected from Part 1, 1.0 mg DHE
      mesylate IM injection, and 2 mg DHE mesylate nasal spray in a randomized, 3 period crossover
      manner.
