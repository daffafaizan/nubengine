      months after the start of HD. After determining initial rHuEPO dosage, we followed the
      patients for 3 years, and examined an association between rHuEPO dose, serum ADPN, and
      all-cause mortality.

      We could follow totally 74 out of 85 patients for 3 years; 59 patients were survived, but 15
      patients expired. Dosage of rHuEPO was significantly and negatively correlated with body mass
      index (BMI) (r=-0.44, p<0.01) and positively with serum ADPN (r=0.29, p<0.02), but not with
      leptin. Cox-hazards regression analysis adjusted by age, sex and underlying kidney disease
      revealed that rHuEPO dose and serum ADPN, as well as nutritional parameter such as protein
      catabolic rate became significant determinants of 3-year mortality. There was a 12.7% risk
      increase for 10U/kg/week increase in rHuEPO dose and 1.3% increase for 1µg/ml increment of
      serum ADPN for the 3-year of follow-up.
