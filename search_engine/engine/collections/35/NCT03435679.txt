      infected knee arthroplasty, but promising results have been reported after a one-stage
      approach from single-centre studies.

      The potential benefits for the patients treated with a one-stage approach are many as they
      only have to go through surgery and rehabilitation once with shorter total length of hospital
      stay. However, no randomized controlled trials comparing outcome after the procedures have
      been performed so far.
