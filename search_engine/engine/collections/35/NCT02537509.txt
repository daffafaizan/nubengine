      disease activity (LTC), for which the current TAT-based pro-active strategy does not meet all
      the needs.

      Phototherapy is a good candidate: it is widely used as a second-line treatment in AD with
      demonstrated efficacy. However, only short-term control has been evaluated; and only 2-3
      times a week intensive schedules have been tested and are used in current practice. A novel
      phototherapy regimen would be required for disease LTC, allowing a trade-off between disease
      control, UV-induced risks, and patient adherence.

      Vitamin D supplementation is another good candidate: several studies have shown lower serum
      levels of vitamin D to be correlated with more severe AD; and three short-term, low-power
      low-quality, placebo-controlled randomised trials testing vitamin D supplementation yielded
      conflicting results, leaving its therapeutic efficacy undecided for short-term control, and
      unknown for LTC.
