      and propofol. For remifentanil, concentrations will be targeted at 0, 2, 4 and 6 ng/ml. After
      an equilibration period, anesthesia will be induced in all patients using propofol in order
      to reach and maintain a BIS value of 70, 50 or 30. After an equilibration period(from start
      of propofol infusion), OAA/S will be measured in all patient. All patients will receive a
      standard pain stimulus (30 seconds, 50 mA) in order to observe the influence of the
      effect-site concentration of propofol and remifentanil on the CVI. A time window of 5 minutes
      after the stimulus will be respected to observe the changes in both BIS and CVI. After this
      period, the study will be terminated and classical maintenance of anesthesia will be
      provided.
