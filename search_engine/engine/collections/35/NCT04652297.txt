    
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD)
      and multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of HS-10356 oral formulation in Chinese healthy adult volunteers.

      Approximately five sequential dose panels (single oral doses of 2,6,15,30,45mg HS-10356) will
      be evaluated in SAD. To protect the safety of volunteers, two sentinel volunteers were first
      enrolled in the first dose panel (2mg panel) and randomly assigned to HS-10356 or placebo in
      a 1:1 ratio. After the sentinel volunteers were given the dose for at least 24 hours and
      confirmed that they were safe, the remaining 6 volunteers were randomly assigned to HS-10356
      or placebo in a ratio of 5:1. For the follow-up panels of SAD, volunteers were randomly
      assigned to either the experimental group or the placebo group (6 cases in HS-10356 and 2
      cases in placebo) in a 3:1 ratio using block randomization method. Approximately three
      sequential dose panels (14 consecutive days for respectively daily oral doses of 6,15,30mg
      HS-10356, QD) will be evaluated in MAD. Volunteers were randomly assigned to either the
      experimental group or the placebo group (9 cases in the HS-10356 and 3 cases in the placebo)
      in a ratio of 3:1 using block randomization method. Each subject will receive only one
      regimen in this study. Safety data up to Day12 (±2) in SAD and up to Day25 (±2) in MAD will
      be reviewed prior to dose escalation. Cohorts of SAD and MAD will be added or removed
      depending on the assessment results of SRC.
