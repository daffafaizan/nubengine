      medical center (Lotung Poh-Ai Hospital, Taiwan). Patients with tissue diagnosis of head and
      neck cancer are enrolled. Endoscopy screening for esophageal lesions is first performed by
      using the conventional white light system. Suspicious lesions are recorded. Then the entire
      esophagus is examined under the NBI system by another endoscopist, who is blinded to the
      result of the conventional endoscopy. After the endoscopic inspection completed, all
      suspicious lesions are biopsied. Before each procedure, which one of the two participating
      endoscopists applies the conventional or NBI system is randomized. The diagnostic rate of
      esophageal neoplasm by the conventional white light system and that of the NBI system are
      compared.

      The endpoint is the neoplastic lesion detected on endoscopic biopsy. We considered invasive
      cancer, carcinoma in-situ, and high-grade dysplasia (which usually cannot be distinguished
      from carcinoma in situ) as the primary points. Any dysplastic lesions were considered as
      secondary points.
