      repository according to the data manual and procedures. A separate IRB was approved to review
      outcomes from participants in the CCC to evaluate the effectiveness of the clinic. All
      participants participated in an informed consent process to provide the option to have their
      data stored in a data repository for aggregate review. If any participate chooses not to have
      their data stored, it will not be stored or outcomes reviewed. However, participants are
      still provided services through the CCC. Researchers anticipate up to 200 participants
      participating in the registry over five years. All data will be data checked by a member of
      the research team to limit errors and identification of missing data recorded. Statistical
      analysis methods are to be determined upon completion of the study.
