      with exaggerated and uncoordinated movements of the pelvis by applying force fields to
      correct the movement of the pelvis. The focus will be on correcting hip hiking (i.e.
      exaggerated unilateral upward movements of one side of the pelvis) in post-stroke patients.
      The human-robot interface will be based on impedance control techniques so that the
      force-field actuators generate smooth virtual spring/damper restitution forces at the
      patient's pelvic area.

      As part of the study we will determine whether the force fields applied by the actuated
      components of the device can effect an acute change in gait biomechanics, primarily pelvis
      motion during stance and swing phases, in healthy subjects and patients with stroke during
      ambulation. The investigators will also evaluate the usability of the orthosis in terms of
      donning & doffing, user confidence, and comfort.
