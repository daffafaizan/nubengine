      B: gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin plus nivolumab. Randomization will be stratified on the
      metastasis status (lymph node only vs. the rest). Patients on both treatment arms will
      receive up to 6 cycles of combination therapy in the absence of prohibitive adverse effects
      or disease progression. Patients with at least stable disease at the completion of 6 cycles
      of treatment may continue "maintenance" single agent nivolumab for up to 24 cycles. Patients
      who require discontinuation of chemotherapy (i.e., gemcitabine plus carboplatin or
      gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin) prior to Cycle 6, but who have at least stable disease, may be
      considered for ongoing treatment with single-agent nivolumab on the "maintenance" phase after
      discussion with the sponsor-investigator.
