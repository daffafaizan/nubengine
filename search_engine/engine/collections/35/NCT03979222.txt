      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe acute respiratory failure that have not
      responded to conventional measures.

      In 2011, NHS England commissioned a national service to provide ECMO for severe respiratory
      failure at six centres across the country. Patients with severe respiratory failure are
      referred to the network if conventional measures are unsuccessful, and if accepted are
      transferred to an ECMO centre for specialist care. The criteria for admission is at the
      discretion of clinicians at each centre.

      The NHS ECMO registry has been created by cross-referencing data submitted to the
      Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with a tracker
      document identifying patients treated within the network. Analysis has been undertaken from
      December 2018 to March 2019.
