      Safety will be assessed through adverse events, hemorrhagic complications and the development
      of ventriculostomy-related infections.

      The volume and clearance of intracranial blood will be determined (in ml) using computerized
      software, as well as validated semi-quantitative ordinal scales (SAH Sum Score, Modified
      Graeb Score). The amount of IVH and SAH will be assessed at baseline (day 0), 72 hours after
      treatment onset, and on post-SAH day 8.

      Additional secondary outcomes will include:

        1. The occurrence of vasospasm, as determined using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography

        2. The occurrence of radiographic vasospasm, using CT angiography.

        3. The occurrence of "clinical" (symptomatic) vasospasm

        4. The rate of catheter-related central nervous system infections

        5. Levels of cytokines, endothelin and matrix metalloproteases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
           and plasma

        6. Levels of fibrin-derived products (FDP), TPA and plasminogen-activator inhibitor in CSF

        7. Levels of S100Î² and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in CSF and serum

        8. Intracranial pressure

        9. Volume of CSF drainage

       10. Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, modified Rankin scale, EuroQOL at 6 months post-SAH

       11. Duration that ventriculostomy is required; need for permanent shunt

       12. Fever burden
