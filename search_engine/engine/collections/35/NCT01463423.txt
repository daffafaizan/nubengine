    
      Primary Objective: Evaluate local tumor control with individually optimized lung tumor SABR.
      Tumor control will be assessed by CT, PET-CT, and if appropriate, biopsy. The trial will
      focus on three cohorts: 1) patients with limited primary NSCLCs (T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0, T2aN0M0,
      T2bN0M0, or T3N0M0) non-small cell lung cancer; 2) patients with a history of NSCLC who have
      new limited primary NSCLC lesion(s); and 3) patients with more advanced lung cancer or lung
      metastases from a variety of different cancers.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of individually optimized lung tumor SABR. Pulmonary, esophageal,
           chest wall, skin, vascular, cardiac/pericardial, and neurologic (brachial
           plexus/recurrent laryngeal/myelitis) toxicity will be scored by the CTCAE 4.0 criteria.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of anatomically optimized audio-visual biofeedback
           (AVB)-coached breath-hold technique assisted by fast delivery using gated RapidArc with
           flattening free filter mode (FFF) in a subset of patients. Feasibility will be assessed
           based on: i) The proportion of patients able to reproduce an anatomically-optimized
           breath-hold with AVB-coaching during treatment. ii) The reduction in treatment delivery
           time compared to gated free-breathing treatment.

        -  Determine progression free, metastasis free, and overall survival in patients treated
           with individually optimized lung tumor SABR.

        -  Examine new biomarkers in lung tumor SABR patients.
