      outcome of the pregnancy. When choosing whether or not to have invasive prenatal testing they
      are faced with a complex decision, set in the unique context of a pregnancy that they often
      perceive as exceptionally precious. The proposed study aims to explore the invasive prenatal
      testing decision-making experiences of women who are pregnant after infertility. A
      cross-sectional design will be used to investigate relationships between the infertility
      experience and decisional conflict associated with deciding whether or not to have invasive
      prenatal testing. Women who are pregnant after infertility will be recruited from online
      support groups and websites for pregnancy after infertility. Participants will be asked to
      complete a questionnaire that measures infertility and decision-making variables and elicits
      their perceptions of the impact of infertility on their IPT decision-making experience. The
      main outcome measure is decisional conflict.
