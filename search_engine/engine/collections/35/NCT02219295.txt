      intervention. We use substances as for instance glucose, sucrose,saccharin and lactisol in
      the sweet part, and substances from cabbage, beer or red endive in the bitter part. For umami
      we take glutamate.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and 6 times thereafter up to 3hours, to analyse the
      incretins GLP-1(glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP(gastrointestinal polypeptide) and other
      peptide hormones as insulin and PYY(peptide tyrosin trosin) in human beings.

      Gastrointestinal mucosa is taken by gastroscopy from the lower duodenum from study subjects
      for analysis for the presence or absence of functional taste receptors in gastrointestinal
      tissues.
