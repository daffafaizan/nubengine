      modes in the support of burn patients with respiratory failure. Burn patients who develop the
      need for mechanical ventilation present a variety of challenges that call for innovative
      therapeutic options. Even in the absence of smoke inhalation injury,decreased chest wall
      compliance from full thickness burns as well as massive fluid requirements are just a few
      variables that make it difficult to achieve gas exchange goals when attempting to apply
      conventional lung protective strategies recommended by the ARDS Net investigators.
