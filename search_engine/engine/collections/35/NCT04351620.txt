      outpatient adult participants with mild COVID-19. In vitro studies have shown antiviral
      effects of HCQ against SARS Cov-2, but the clinical outcomes in the disease have been
      variable. Our hypothesis is that targeting high risk patients earlier in the disease course
      and with a higher dose regimen are both required to see improvement in disease outcome
      measures in COVID-19. This study aims to prove the tolerability of high dose HCQ in this
      setting.

      Patients are selected based on the identification of risk factors associated with more severe
      disease outcomes. Investigators will enroll twenty patients and perform a detailed
      Tele-health interview to ensure they meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent.
      1200 mg hydroxychloroquine daily will be prescribed, in divided doses.The subjects will be
      required to monitor their temperatures twice daily and a daily telephone call with an
      investigatory will review symptoms of disease and potential side effects of the drug.
      Subjects can discontinue the medication after five days if they no longer have fever, or take
      the medication for up to ten days if required for fever resolution.
