    
      This is a 2-stage, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, multi-center phase 2 study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of UB-621 given at 2.5 or 5 mg/kg in adult
      subjects with recurrent genital HSV-2 infection. The study consists of 2 stages of
      enrollments, in which 40 subjects will be enrolled in the first stage and randomly assigned
      to receive placebo or UB-621 at 2.5 mg/kg in a 1:3 ratio into Cohort 1 at Bv6 (Day B57), and
      another 40 subjects will be enrolled in the second stage and randomly assigned to receive
      placebo or UB-621 at 5 mg/kg in a 1:3 ratio into Cohort 2 at Bv6 (Day B57) after review by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMC will review safety data after all
      subjects of Cohort 1 complete the visit Fv6 (Day F28) and make the recommendation whether to
      proceed with enrollment for Cohort 2.
