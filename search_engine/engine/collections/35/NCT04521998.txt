      Chinese medicine or Western medicine clinics in China Medical University Hospital and Dalin
      Tzu-Chi Hospital. These patients will be randomized to receive electroacupuncture (40
      participants) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (40 participants) treatment two
      sessions per week and for 10 treatments in total.

      The investigators expect that electroacupuncture or transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation can reduce the severity of pain in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The
      effectiveness of electroacupuncture or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation can be
      detected by visual analogue scale, simplified disease activity index, and disease activity
      score and be used to improve the clinical symptoms and quality of life.
