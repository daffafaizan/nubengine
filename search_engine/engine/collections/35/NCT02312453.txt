      which is a cord-level block of the brachial plexus for surgical procedures below mid-humerus.
      The brachial plexus at this level runs deeper compared to its course proximally, giving rise
      to impaired needle visualisation due to the steep angle of needle insertion with the current
      ultrasound-guided approach (lateral para-sagittal in-plane technique).1

      A new ultrasound-guided posterior approach parasagittal in-plane infraclavicular block was
      introduced to improve needle visibility.2 However no further follow up study was done.

      Therefore, we performed a case series of 18 patients with a cadaveric dissection, to assess
      the feasibility of this approach.

      Methods After obtaining ethics committee approval from the Medical Ethics Committee,
      University Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Chairperson Professor Dr. Looi Lai
      Meng; IRB reference no. 949.14 dated 17 October 2012, amendment no.1038.76 dated 19 December
      2013) and written informed consent, 18 patients undergoing surgery of the elbow, forearm,
      wrist, or hand were prospectively recruited based on the criteria below.
