      day-time blood pressure. However, 20-40% of middle-aged adults do not demonstrate a decrease
      in blood pressure. Abnormal blood pressure patterns are linked to sleep disturbances,
      hypertension, and associated with elevated cardiovascular risk and mortality. Additionally,
      abnormal diurnal blood pressure patterns are associated with impaired neurovascular control
      of the circulation, contributing to an increased risk of hypertension, stroke, and
      cardiovascular disease. Importantly, midlife is the critical period for implementing
      interventions to prevent or delay future cardiovascular disease. Recent data demonstrates
      that time-restricted feeding may normalize blood pressure patterns. The overall goal of this
      study is to determine if time-restricted feeding normalizes blood pressure patterns and
      improves neurovascular control.

      The research aims are:

        1. To determine the effect of meal timing on blood pressure patterns in middle-aged adults.

        2. To determine the effect of meal timing on neurovascular control in middle-aged adults.
