      The goal of this protocol is to understand how the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS)
      relates to its evolution over time as observed through neuroradiological, clinical, and
      biological data collection in vivo.

      Study population:

      This study will enroll up to 100 individuals with MS, targeting 50 study completers, across
      various ages and stages of the disease, as well as 50 appropriate disease and
      non-neurological control participants, for a total of 150 participants.

      Design:

      This is a longitudinal cohort study in which participants will be seen approximately annually
      at the NIH Clinical Center. Most visits will extend over several days. Participants will
      receive ongoing care by their outside clinician. They may also concurrently participate in
      additional research protocols at the NIH or elsewhere, and data may be shared between those
      protocols and the current one. At the time of death, the central nervous system (CNS) (brain,
      spinal cord, retinas, and cerebrospinal fluid), as well as lymph nodes and possibly other
      lymphoid tissue, will be harvested.

      Outcome measures:

      Outcome measures include data derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and
      spinal cord, optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinas, clinical examination, and
      disability scales; radiological and pathological examination of CNS tissue; and the
      correlation between in vivo and postmortem measures. Particular attention will be paid to the
      extent to which longitudinal in vivo changes predict postmortem findings.
