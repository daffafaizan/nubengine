      tattoo removal in allowing multiple passes within a single treatment session. One half of the
      tattoo will be randomly assigned laser treatment utilizing the Device (the "Device half");
      the other half will receive laser treatment without the Device and serve as the control (the
      "Control half"). Based on statistical analysis sample size calculations, 30 subjects will be
      enrolled. The tattoo must be no larger than approximately 2 ½" x 6" or 3" x 5" in size, such
      that ½ of the tattoo can be covered with a single patch. Each subject will receive a single
      Treatment Session consisting of 5 minutes. Investigators will administer the standard laser
      treatment to both the Device and Control sites using well-established tattoo-removal
      treatment parameters for the laser used. Subjects will return for follow up approximately one
      month post-treatment. The presence of side effects and adverse events will be assessed and
      recorded for both Device and Control sites immediately after treatment and at the 1-month
      follow-up visit.
