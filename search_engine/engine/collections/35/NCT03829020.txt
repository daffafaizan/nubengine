    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of administering metformin hydrochloride
      (metformin) and nelfinavir mesylate (nelfinavir) in combination with bortezomib in patients
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of metformin and nelfinavir in combination with
      bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To assess the best hematological response of the combination of metformin, nelfinavir and
      bortezomib within 6 cycles of initiating therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess clinical biomarkers predictive of response to the combination of metformin,
      nelfinavir and bortezomib such as bioenergetic profiles of the myeloma cells, GLUT4
      expression on myeloma cells, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways and metabolomics-based
      profiling.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of metformin hydrochloride and nelfinavir mesylate.

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1-14, nelfinavir mesylate PO
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, and bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
