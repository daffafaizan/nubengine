    
      RA is a debilitating disease characterized by inflammation of the joints, leading to chronic
      pain, loss of function, and disability. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
      treatments are being used with increased frequency by patients with chronic pain and
      rheumatic diseases to relieve their symptoms. While patients find these treatments helpful,
      there is limited scientific evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions. This study
      will compare relaxation therapy (a commonly used treatment for RA) to tai chi chih (a
      combination of slow, deliberate movements and meditation) in treating the symptoms of RA.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of either relaxation therapy or
      tai chi chih. At study entry and Weeks 6 and 12, participants will complete questionnaires
      about their RA symptoms, health functioning, overall quality of life, and complete a brief
      medical exam.
