      through which exercise could make cancer less likely to occur are not known. Some research in
      animals has shown that exercise can slow the growth of breast cancer cells and may increase
      the body's own defense mechanisms by stimulating the immune system. Very little is known
      about the effects of exercise on breast tissue in people. Understanding what changes occur in
      breast tissue and related markers in blood when a woman begins to exercise could provide more
      information about the ways in which exercise could prevent breast cancer.

      The study is designed to look at the changes that occur in markers found in breast tissue and
      blood in women with dense breast tissue who take part in an exercise program. Density of
      breast tissue is a measure of how much of the breast tissue is made up of cells rather than
      fat. Breast density on mammogram has been linked to the risk of developing breast cancer,
      with women with higher degrees of breast density having a higher risk of developing breast
      cancer compared to women whose breasts are less dense.

      Since the investigators do not know if these blood or breast tissue tests have any
      relationship to the development of breast cancer, the investigators do not plan to share the
      results of these tests with the participant or its physician. The investigators will give the
      participants the option of receiving the overall study results when the trial is completed,
      if the participant would like to receive them.
