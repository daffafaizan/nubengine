      safety record when used at doses ranging from 200 to 600 mg daily.

      Itraconazole has been shown in cellular and animal models to be a potent angiogenesis
      inhibitor as well as a Hedgehog pathway antagonist; both pathways are considered important in
      prostate cancer. Itraconazole has not previously been tested as an antineoplastic agent, but
      given its well-established safety profile, the gap between further preclinical studies and
      human clinical trials can be narrowed to accelerate development of this agent as a putative
      anticancer drug. The investigators hypothesize that itraconazole will prevent PSA progression
      in a significant proportion of men with metastatic CRPC and that it will have an acceptable
      safety profile at both doses. Itraconazole may ultimately delay the need for chemotherapy in
      these men.
