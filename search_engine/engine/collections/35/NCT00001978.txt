      glomerular filtration rate and/or effective renal plasma flow employing inulin or
      non-radioactive iothalamate and/or para aminohippurate (PAH), respectively.

      Selected patients with proteinuria will be asked to participate in studies of glomerular
      capillary wall permselectivity calculated from the fractional clearances of the endogenous
      proteins, albumin and IgG and from the fractional clearances of polydisperse neutral dextran
      with effective molecular radii ranging from 20-60 angstroms. To achieve this, low molecular
      weight dextran will be administered by slow IV injection immediately following the inulin or
      iothalamate and/or PAH priming doses.

      Glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow and/or glomerular permselectivity can
      be measured simultaneously during a standard hydrated urinary clearance study. Timed urine
      and blood collections will be obtained, typically requiring a total of 60 to 90 minutes. The
      total test time, including pre-test hydration, is 4 to 5 hours.

      Alternatively, glomerular filtration rate can be measured by one of two plasma clearance
      methods that do not require urine collections. For one method, a steady-state plasma
      concentration of iothalamate will be achieved in ambulatory patients by a 24-hour
      subcutaneous infusion of iothalamate using an insulin pump. For the second method, the
      decline in plasma concentration of iothalamate will be measured after an intravenous dose of
      iothalamate.
