      involves prescription of recommended medicines by the physician, but also implies correct use
      of the prescribed medication by the patient (ie, good drug adherence and correct inhalation
      technique). Community pharmacists could help to improve the latter aspect, by delivering
      pharmaceutical care. The present randomised controlled trial will study the hypothesis that a
      pharmaceutical care intervention would result in an improved drug adherence and inhalation
      technique in COPD patients over a 3 month-period.
