      associations between smoking, brain activity, dopamine genes, and attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Four groups of young adults were recruited: (1) smokers with
      ADHD; (2) nonsmokers with ADHD; (3) normative control smokers; and (4) normative control
      nonsmokers. Smoking was assessed via questionnaires and salivary cotinine levels. Brain
      activity was examined via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Each nonsmoker
      underwent an fMRI scan during an experimental task consisting of mathematical problems.
      Smokers underwent two fMRI scans during similar experimental tasks under the following two
      conditions: (1) after smoking a cigarette and (2) after overnight abstinence. The association
      between the DRD4-7 repeat allele and smoking was explored.
