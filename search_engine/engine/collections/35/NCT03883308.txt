    
      This multilevel study will be comprised of a placebo controlled randomized controlled trial
      to test the effect of long-term (6 months), multi-domain, computerized cognitive training on
      large-scale structural and functional brain networks in individuals with MCI (age >= 65
      years). Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data before and after intervention will be
      evaluated within and between groups to elucidate the trajectory of neuronal network
      improvements associated with training compared to typical MCI development. We will compare
      the outcomes between participants with MCI who receive structured cognitive training
      (treatment group: TG) with those who receive nonspecific computerized training activities
      (active controls: AC). The duration of intervention is 6 months. The focus of the study will
      be on individuals with amnestic MCI (single- or multi- domain). The study includes 30 MCI
      subjects in a treatment group (TG) and 30 matched MCI subjects in active control (AC) group.
      TG and AC participants will be evaluated at two time points: 1) baseline and 2) 6-month
      (post-training).
