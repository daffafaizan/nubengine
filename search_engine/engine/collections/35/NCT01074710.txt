    
      The C13-URA Breath Test Kit is intended to be used as a diagnostic tool to identify rapid
      and/or delayed gastric emptying in patients who have upper GI symptoms such as stomach pain,
      fullness, early satiety, vomiting, etc., and who have suspected gastric emptying
      abnormalities such as gastroparesis or dumping syndrome.

      This study will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period safety and PK study of
      13C-uracil administered as a single oral dose of 50 mg at step 1 (Period 1), 100 mg at step 2
      (Period 2), and 200 mg at step 3 (Period 3) in the form of a semi-solid meal to subjects
      following at least a 10-hour fast from food and 2-hour fast from water. Dosing will be
      followed by a 6-hour fast from food and a 4-hour fast from water. There will be a washout of
      at least 7 days between doses.

      The objectives of this study are as follows;

      1)to evaluate the safety of 13C-uracil in a semi-solid meal in healthy volunteers, 2)to
      establish the pharmacokinetic profile of 13C-uracil in a semi-solid meal in healthy
      volunteers, 3)to assess the correlation between plasma concentration of 13C-uracil and
      urinary excretion of 13C-uracil, 4)to evaluate the reproducibility (intra/inter-individual
      variance) of the breath test, 5)to determine the dose for 13C-uracil that facilitates
      adequate Î”13C in breath expired by healthy volunteers
