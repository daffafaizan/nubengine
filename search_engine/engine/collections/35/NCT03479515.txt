      Specific Aim 1: Validate ultrasound as a method to measure whole body fat mass and fat-free
      mass in toddlers. Body composition will be assessed using ultrasound measurements and the
      validated method of air displacement plethysmography (ADP).

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of a handheld Force-Measuring Ultrasound Probe on intra-
      and inter-observer variability in ultrasound measurements. A device which measures the force
      applied to the ultrasound probe will be used to obtain measurements of muscle and adipose
      tissue thickness (biceps, abdomen, and quadriceps) in toddlers.
