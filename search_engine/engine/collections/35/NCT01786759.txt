      for more than 40 years, the most serious and significant life-threatening complication today
      continues to be parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis(PNAC). Parenteral
      nutrition-associated cholestasis is indeed the most worrisome complication because it is
      difficult to treat and may progress to eventual cirrhosis and liver failure namely parenteral
      nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD).

      Two types of lipid emulsions are currently used for adult as well as pediatric patients: one
      lipid emulsions prepared from soybean oil that are composed of long-chain triacylglycerols
      (LCTs), and the other lipid emulsions composed of 50% medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs)
      and 50% LCT soybean oil. A new lipid emulsion prepared from a mixture of soybean oil and
      olive oil contains only LCTs and has a lower proportion (20%) of polyunsaturated fatty
      acids(PUFAs)and 60% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). So we compare the different fat
      emulsion, and want to see if the olive oil lipid emulsions can improve hepatic tolerance in
      preterm infant.
