    
      A) Risk Classification

      Newly diagnosed patients are hierarchically clustered into very high, high and standard risk
      cases (VHR, HR, SR) using international risk criteria modified according to NILG:

      A1) VHR (any criterium): B-precursor: WBC count >100x109/L; adverse cytogenetics/molecular
      biology such as t(9;22)/BCR-ABL, t(4;11)/MLL rearrangement at 11q23, +8, -7, del6q, t(8;14),
      low hypodiploidy with 30-39 chromosomes, near triploidy with 60-78 chromosomes, complex with
      >5 unrelated anomalies. T-precursor: WBC count >100x109/L; early/late non-cortical
      immunophenotype (CD1a-); adverse cytogenetics/molecular biology (as above).

      A2) HR (any criterium, VHR excluded): B-precursor: WBC count >30x109/L; pro-B
      immunophenotype; complete remission after cycle 2. T-precursor: complete remission after
      cycle 2.

      A3) SR (all criteria, VHR/HR excluded): B-precursor: WBC count <30x109/L; T-precursor: WBC
      count <100x109/L; cortical immunophenotype (CD1a+).

      B) CNS Prophylaxis Stratification before randomisation

        1. by immunophenotype, i.e. B-precursor vs. T-precursor

        2. by risk class, i.e. SR vs. non-SR (using only known factors) Randomisation: intrathecal
           (IT) CNS prophylaxis with standard triple therapy (TIT, 12 total injections) vs.
           DepoCyte (6-8 total injections by disease subset). Cranial irradiation is omitted in
           both arms, and all patients receive the same chemotherapy program including CNS-crossing
           agents.

      C)Induction/Early Consolidation and MRD Study

      Randomised patients receive homogeneous induction/early consolidation chemotherapy, including
      subset-specific elements for B-precursor ALL (3x targeted-infusion methotrexate 2.5 g/m2),
      T-precursor ALL (3x targeted-infusion methotrexate 5 g/m2), age >55 years (methotrexate
      reduced to 1.5 g/m2), Ph/BCR-ABL+ ALL (imatinib, reduced-intensity chemotherapy), radiation
      therapy (LL). Patients not in CR after cycles 1-2 are off study. For CR evaluation bone
      marrow is checked on days 28 and/or 56. Consolidation cycles are administered at 21-28 day
      intervals Concurrent MRD analysis is performed at four timepoints (weeks 4, 10, 16 and 22 of
      induction/consolidation), to optimize risk classification and support risk/MRD-oriented
      therapy:

      C1) MRD negative (M-NEG): negative MRD study (<10-4 at timepoints #2 and #3, and negative at
      timepoint #4) C2) MRD positive (M-POS): positive MRD study (>10-4 at timepoints #2 or #3, or
      positive at timepoint #4)

      D)MRD/Risk-Oriented Final Therapy D1) VHR patients are candidate to an early allogeneic SCT
      (related/unrelated donor/cord blood; ablative/non-ablative conditioning according to current
      protocols/guidelines) after CR, regardless MRD study results.

      D2) M-POS as well as HR patients with unknown MRD are allocated to allogeneic SCT after MRD
      timepoint 2 (M-POS >10-4) or MRD timepoint 4 (others). When an allogeneic SCT is not
      possible, patients complete consolidation and receive autologous-type SCT followed by
      maintenance.

      D3) M-NEG as well as SR patients with unknown MRD are allocated to maintenance therapy.

      Age-limited therapeutic procedures: Patients aged >55 years are treated with age-adapted
      therapy, and when indicated will be included in SCT programs whenever possible and according
      to performance status and comorbidity.
