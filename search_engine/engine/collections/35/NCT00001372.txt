      their relatives to study the pathogenesis and natural history of the disease and the
      mechanisms leading to enhanced organ damage. Patients will be evaluated by a history and
      physical examination and routine laboratory studies will be obtained as needed to assess
      disease activity or complications of the disease and to monitor for drug-related toxicities.
      Blood, skin or urine specimens may be requested for research purposes, including genetic
      studies. In addition, a subset of these patients will undergo several tests to understand the
      pathogenic changes affecting their blood vessels. Patients who are eligible for other
      research protocols will be offered the opportunity to participate in these studies by signed
      informed consent. Any medical care recommended or provided to the patient will be consistent
      with routine standards of practice and provided in consultation with the patient s referring
      physician. Blood and urine samples and cardiovascular testing will also be collected or
      performed on healthy volunteers for research purposes and to support the identification and
      validation of new biomarker candidates.
