    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether patients with HER-2 negative, hormone receptor positive, metastatic
      breast cancer who are monitored with serum tumor marker directed disease monitoring (STMDDM)
      have non-inferior overall survival compared to patients monitored with usual care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare cumulative direct healthcare costs through 48 weeks among patients monitored
      with STMDDM versus those monitored with usual care in this patient population.

      II. To assess whether the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of anxiety and quality of life
      (QOL) are different among patients who are monitored with STMDDM compared with patients who
      are monitored with usual care in this patient population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess modality and frequency of disease monitoring testing in the usual care cohort.

      II. To assess the association of PROs and patient preferences for disease monitoring testing.

      III. To evaluate predictors of physician preferences for disease monitoring testing.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo imaging studies at a minimum frequency of every 12 weeks and continue
      with usual care disease monitoring for up to 312 weeks in the absence of disease progression.

      ARM II: Patients undergo disease specific serum tumor marker (STM) evaluation every 4-8
      weeks. Patients with elevated STM, undergo imaging evaluation. Patients continue with STMDDM
      for up to 312 weeks in the absence of disease progression.
