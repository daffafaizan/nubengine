    
      This is a single-arm, single-center study in healthy volunteers. The study is designed to
      evaluate the safe use of the single-use autoinjector with a 25G × 1" needle in subjects of
      varying body mass indices (BMIs). Because this is a safety study of the injector, the
      injections contain Avonex excipients only; no active IFNβ-1a will be administered.

      During the study, each subject will self-administer 4 IM injections using single-use
      autoinjectors.

      Subjects will self-administer the first 2 injections (1 in each thigh) and then repeat the
      process approximately 60 to 90 minutes later. A Trainer/Observer will prepare the
      autoinjector for each injection, monitor each injection, and assess the subject for AEs
      during the injection process and up to the time of discharge from the unit. The
      Trainer/Observer will also visually inspect the needle pre- and post-injection and record
      their findings. The Investigator or designee (physician or nurse) will assess injection sites
      for erythema, induration, tenderness, or warmth.
