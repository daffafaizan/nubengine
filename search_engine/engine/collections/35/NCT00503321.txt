      unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma and recurrent gastric carcinoma in Japan and the
      response rate of TS-1 against gastric carcinoma was reported to be excellent at 46.5% in a
      phase II study. However, since adverse drug reactions tend to occur in patients treated with
      standard regimen of TS-1, drug reduction or discontinuation is often required, which is one
      drawback of this drug. On the other hand, although Krestin (PSK) has been reported to show
      survival effects in postoperative immunochemotherapy against gastric carcinoma, the efficacy
      of PSK has not been established in patients with unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma and
      recurrent gastric carcinoma. Since the main effect of PSK was to recover physiological
      functions, including immune function of the host, it was expected that PSK would improve the
      compliance of TS-1 by alleviating adverse drug reactions of TS-1 therapy and the concomitant
      use of TS-1 with PSK would result in the improvement of treatment results. Therefore, we
      decided to conduct a randomized phase II study on patients with unresectable advanced gastric
      carcinoma and recurrent gastric carcinoma to compare TS-1 therapy with TS-1+PSK therapy.
