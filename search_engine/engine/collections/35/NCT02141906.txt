      microspheres chemoemobilization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The study will also describe the overall response rates of lesions with
      Oncozene-DEB-TACE(Trans-arterial chemoemobilization) per modified RECIST criteria (Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).

      Determine progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following
      Oncozene-DEB-TACE (Trans-arterial chemoemobilization)
