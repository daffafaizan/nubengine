      patients received treatment at their randomized dose) and an expansion phase (after
      adjustment of dose/regimen to achieve an optimal balance of efficacy and safety). During the
      dose-ranging phase, patients in each disease group (PV or ET) were randomly assigned in a
      1:1:1 ratio independent of each other to receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens with Ruxolitinib,
      10 mg twice daily (bid), 25 mg bid, or 50 mg once daily (qd). After patients completed 2
      cycles of treatment with Ruxolitinib at the randomized dose, Investigators were permitted to
      adjust the dose/regimen on an individual basis using their discretion in order to achieve an
      optimal balance of efficacy and safety. During the expansion phase (ie, after optimization of
      dose), additional patients with PV or ET were enrolled to receive Ruxolitinib at the dose
      that was selected upon review of data from the dose-ranging phase. Treatment continued until
      a patient met a withdrawal criterion, had intolerable toxicity, progression of disease, or
      withdrew consent.
