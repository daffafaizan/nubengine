      decreases glucose excursions following an OGTT. Doses of 30 mg, 60 mg and 90 mg DXM were
      chosen. Since DXM 60 mg was effective in the previous study in increasing insulin secretion,
      this dose will be kept. A lower dose (30 mg) will be given to see whether effects on insulin
      secretion are present also at lower doses and then translate into a BG lowering action. A
      higher dose (90 mg) will be added to see whether this way an effect on glucose excursion
      reduction occurs following an OGTT, (like previously demonstrated with 270 mg DXM) that can
      be related to an increase of insulin secretion.
