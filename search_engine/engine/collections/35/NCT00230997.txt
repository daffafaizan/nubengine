        1. Rationale

           In a previously published study of DLB treated with rivastigmine, efficacy was seen to
           be maximized at 20 weeks in multiple parameters compared to placebo. The efficacy was
           seen in the NPI - 4 as well as the NPI -10, MMSE and a Computerized Cognitive Assessment
           Systems Score5. There was no change in UPDRS score. The efficacy of rivastigmine for
           patients with DLB responding greater than 30 percent in behavioral measures was equal to
           or better than most studies of antipsychotic medications used for behavioral
           abnormalities in DLB and AD patients.

           Since the titration for galantamine involves less time than the titration for
           rivastigmine, an interim analysis may show efficacy at 12 weeks. However, for complete
           efficacy and safety evaluations, a 24-week treatment for galantamine is preferable.
           Since the cholinergic deficits in DLB patients is more profound than that for AD
           patients, the dose range of 16 8 to 24 mg/day for DLB patients should be sufficient to
           show efficacy. Since galantamine has previously been shown to be efficacious in the
           domains of behavior, cognition, ADL's and global assessment in AD patients, we expect
           efficacy to be shown similarly and perhaps to a greater extent in DLB patients.

           TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS

           There will be seven visits in this 24-week treatment trial with galantamine for DLB. For
           all visits a time window of +/- 3 days relative to baseline visit V2 is applicable.

           Screen: Visit 1 (-4 week - 0)

           At visit 1 (V1) subjects will be evaluated for their suitability for enrollment. It is
           acceptable for this visit to be conducted on more than one day, although it should not
           be done over longer than a week. Prior to the conduct of any trial related procedures a
           complete explanation (both verbally and written) of the nature and purpose of the trial
           will be given by the Investigator (or designee). The subject will be requested to sign
           and date the IRB/IEC approved Informed Consent. Subject's eligibility for the trial will
           be determined on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and from the results of
           the following pre-treatment assessments:

             -  Medical history

             -  Complete neurological examination

             -  Complete physical examination

             -  CT Scan/MRI

             -  Vital signs (blood pressure/heart rate)

             -  ECG

             -  Complete chemistry panel, hematology, B12, folate, RPR, thyroid panels including
                TSH (if not done within the last 3 months)

             -  Urine pregnancy test (if applicable)

             -  Concomitant medications

             -  Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)

                  -  NPI-12

             -  PSQI

             -  Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS)

           Baseline: Visit 2 (Week 0)

           At the beginning of this visit the Investigator should review all test results from
           Visit 1, this will include the completion of eligibility criteria. If patient is
           eligible to continue in the trial, the following assessments will be carried out:

           • Brief physical examination

             -  Vital signs (blood pressure/heart rate)
