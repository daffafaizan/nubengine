    
      The APA12/PANTER study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      intervention study of 3 weeks in 72 healthy adults. The study will include 2 arms; PTM202 and
      placebo. Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual pattern of physical activity and
      their habitual food intake, but to standardize their dietary calcium intake. After an
      overnight fast, subjects will be orally infected with a live, but attenuated, diarrheagenic
      E. coli (strain E1392-75-2A; collection NIZO food research; dose 1E10 CFU (at study day 14).

      At study day 14, 15 and 16 subjects will receive either placebo or PTM202, a dietary formula
      containing dried bovine colostrum and dried whole egg.

      Before and after the diarrheagenic E. coli challenge an online diary will be kept to record
      information on stool consistency, frequency, severity of symptoms and mediation intake. At
      various time points before and after diarrheagenic E. coli challenge stool samples will be
      collected. The main study parameters are Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale reported by
      the subjects in the online diary, and Percentage of fecal wet weight (% determined by
      freeze-drying).

      Secondary study parameters are: Stool frequency (Stools per day reported by the subjects in
      the online diary), Total fecal wet weight (fecal weight in g/day), and the incidence and
      severity of Gastro-intestinal symptoms (Gastro-intestinal Symptom Rating Scale reported by
      the subjects in the online diary).
