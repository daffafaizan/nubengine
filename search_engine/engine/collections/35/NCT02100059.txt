      and central sensitization of nociceptive pathways in individuals with a history of
      arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compared to healthy controls. Our central hypothesis is
      that quadriceps weakness following partial meniscectomy is due to higher levels of
      corticospinal excitability and central sensitization of nociceptive pathways, which can be
      modified with therapeutic interventions.
