    
      Participants currently receiving ACH-0144471 (danicopan) in Study ACH471-101 (NCT03472885) or
      Study ACH471-103 (NCT03181633) are eligible to participate in this study (ACH228-110). In
      addition, newly identified participants with PNH currently untreated with an approved C5
      inhibitor, and participants with PNH on a background therapy with an approved C5 inhibitor,
      may be eligible to participate in this study.

      After signing the informed consent form, participants will enter the screening period. During
      the screening period, eligibility and screening assessments will be performed. Screening
      assessments may be spread over more than one visit if necessary. At the baseline visit,
      screened participants who continue to meet eligibility criteria will enter the treatment
      period.

      Blood will be collected to assess the efficacy endpoints, such as, change in hemoglobin
      (Hgb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and other measures of hemolysis. Safety and transfusion
      requirements will also be assessed.

      Participants will continue on treatment past 12 weeks in a long-term extension portion of the
      trial. Participants may choose to discontinue at any time.
