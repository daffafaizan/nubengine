      agent like bevacizumab in breast cancer is caused in a fraction of patients by an immune
      reprogramming. The immune reprogramming can be detected by elevated counts of Tregs in
      peripheral blood, aberrant pattern of cytokines, and elevated concentrations of kynurenine
      and immunosuppressive/vasodilator prostaglandins. The addition of DURVALUMAB to a
      bevacizumab-based treatment would delay or abrogate these changes and be of therapeutic
      interest in this scenario.
