    
      The objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with
      Pirfenidone vs SoC in COVID-19 induced severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
      requiring mechanical ventilation.

      Following initial diagnosis of COVID-19, severe ARDS patient will be admitted to a dedicated
      intensive care unit (ICU) at Soroka University Medical Center (Day 0). Upon admission,
      patients will be randomized according to 1:1 ratio to one of the trial arms and receive
      either Pirfenidone 2,403mg administered through nasogastric tube as 801mg TID (intervention
      arm) plus SoC or only SoC treatment (control arm).

      Patients' vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate per minute, breath rate per
      minute, oxygen saturation) urine output, ventilation settings, and respiratory parameters
      will be monitored according to SoC. Symptom will be captured daily from patients as well as
      adverse events (AEs) assessment and recording of the need for any supportive care during the
      period of ICU admission.
