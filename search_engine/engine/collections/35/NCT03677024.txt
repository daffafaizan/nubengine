      of the most varied practices worldwide, as it may include no nodal assessment, sentinel node
      mapping, and complete pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy up to the renal vessels. Since
      lymphadenectomy is significantly associated with longer operating time, higher surgical
      costs, greater rate of infection, as well as the occurrence of lymphocysts and lymphedema,
      gynecologists agree that pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy should be routinely performed in
      high-risk patients (grade 3, deep myometrial invasion, type 2 cancer). However, whether
      lymphadenectomy is required in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancers of grade 1 or 2
      and with less than 50% myometrial invasion is controversial. Then, the investigators
      conducted this prospective cohort study to investigate the efficacy of sentinel lymph node
      policy in patients with intermediate-risk endometrial carcinomas (grade 1 or 2, < 50%
      myometrial invasion, and a tumor diameter â‰¥ 2 cm) as well as their outcomes.

      Surgery should be performed within a maximum of 4 weeks from the patient's first
      consultation.
