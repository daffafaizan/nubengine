      dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days until the completion of radiation therapy in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 2, patients also undergo standard of
      care radiation therapy for 5-6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for
      up to 1 year, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
