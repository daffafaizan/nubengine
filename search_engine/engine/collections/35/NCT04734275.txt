        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;

        -  3 treatment periods during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the
           day before dosing with AZD5718 (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after dosing (Day 3),
           with discharge on the morning of Day 3 of each treatment period; and

        -  A final visit within 5 to 7 days after the last administration of AZD5718.

      Subjects will receive single doses of AZD5718 on 3 occasions, separated by at least 7 days
      washout, under fasted and fed conditions. Two different formulations (Test Formulation and
      Reference Formulation) will be given in a randomised order:

        -  Treatment A (Test Formulation): AZD5718 Dose A, fasted

        -  Treatment B (Test Formulation): AZD5718 Dose A, fed

        -  Treatment C (Reference Formulation): AZD5718 Dose A, fasted
