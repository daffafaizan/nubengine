      and patients intended to be blind to the intervention status. The staff members performing
      the assessment were not involved in implementing any aspect of the intervention. 108 patients
      were randomized to accept curving introducer Günther Tulip Filter and transcatheter
      thrombolysis or straight introducer Günther Tulip Filter and transcatheter thrombolysis. The
      assessments include the tilting angle between the axes of inferior vena cava and Günther
      Tulip Filter after implantation; the tilting angle between the axes of inferior vena cava and
      Günther Tulip Filter before retrieval; the fluoroscopy time of Günther Tulip Filter
      retrieval; the rate of retrieval hook adhering vascular wall; the success rate of retrieval.
