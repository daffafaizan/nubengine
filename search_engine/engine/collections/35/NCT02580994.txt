      investigating the activity of pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy in
      ED-SCLC.

      Extended stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) patients will be registered, after signing the
      informed consent, and then centrally randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm (Arm A) and the
      control arm (Arm B).

      Cross-over at the time of disease progression will be allowed for arm B only.
