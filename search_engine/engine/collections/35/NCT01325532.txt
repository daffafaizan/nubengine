      a fixed setting in subjects with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Thirty
      subjects with MDD and inadequate response to standard antidepressants were randomized to 3
      weeks of treatment with CES (15/500/15000 Hz, symmetrical rectangular biphasic current of 1-4
      mAmp, 40 Volts) or sham CES (device off) for 20 minutes, 5 days per week. The primary outcome
      measure was improvement in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17). Adverse
      effects (AEs) were assessed using the Patient Related Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE). We
      hypothesized that subjects who received active as opposed to sham CES would have a
      significantly greater improvement in their depression symptoms. Due to the small sample, we
      could not hypothesize an effect size, but would calculate one to determine signal strength to
      guide the design of a larger, more rigorous study. As an exploratory aim, we also examined
      whether CES would benefit sleep.
