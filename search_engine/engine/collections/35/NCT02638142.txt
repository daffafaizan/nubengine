      heart failure (ADHF); significant concerns have been raised regarding risks and benefits of
      loop diuretics, particularly about dosage and administration regimen.

      Recent guidelines recommend the use of these drugs to reduce left ventricular filling
      pressure, avoid pulmonary edema, and alleviate peripheral fluid retention.

      Some studies have provided guidelines for the administration of these drugs in clinical
      practice, but data interpretation remains challenging due to the frequent exclusion of
      patients with kidney disease from major ADHF clinical trials. Therefore, it is not clear if
      continuous infusion is better than intermittent boluses in terms of decongestion, maintenance
      of renal filtration function and prognosis.

      On the other hand, continuous administration should provide a more constant delivery of the
      drug into the tubule, potentially reducing these phenomena.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the better loop diuretic intravenous administration in
      terms of renal function, congestion signs, BNP and outcome.
