      risk factors associated with painful colonoscopy by using a step-wise multivariate regression
      model. Furthermore we developed a novel point score to predict whether the patients at high
      risk for painful colonoscopy and targeted offer an appropriate method of colonoscopy or with
      the aid of special techniques to help the completion of procedure.
