      and increasing risk of accidents and mortality. Treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs has
      limited effectiveness and further increases the risk of accidents and falls. Yoga has been
      shown to increase well-being in the elderly.

      Hypotheses

        1. Integrated yoga style practice can improve sleep quality/quantity

        2. Integrated yoga style practice can improve quality of life.

      Objectives:

        1. Examine effectiveness of yoga for insomnia and reduction in use of hypnotics/relaxants
           in the elderly;

        2. Determine whether yoga enhances quality of life in the elderly; and 3. Determine whether
           yoga is suitable for elderly in western culture(s).

      Methods:

      A mixed design crossover controlled trial (n =74, age range 60-87, M = 74.4, SD = 7.1) with 2
      weekly classes incorporating physical and meditative yoga, and daily home practice of
      meditative yoga for 12 weeks. Measures included self-reported assessment of sleep quality
      (Sleep Logs, KSS, ESS, PSQI, MAPS), mood states (DASS, POMS), general health (SF-36) and
      mobile objective home sleep studies.
