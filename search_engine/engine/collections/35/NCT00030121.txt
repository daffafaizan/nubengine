    
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury. ARDS is
      characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability resulting from a
      non-cardiogenic cause, leading to an increased vascular water volume, pulmonary inflammation,
      and severe hypoxemia. Conventional therapy for ARDS is primarily respiratory management by
      mechanical ventilation using positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Mechanical ventilation
      is the major management concern in patients with ARDS, due to its higher risk of infections
      and morbidity. Treatment with Carperitide may reduce time on the ventilator by reducing
      pulmonary edema and by improving gas exchange. The results of Carperitide studies in animals
      and humans support the idea that the hormone will be effective in managing the acute
      pulmonary complications and hypoxemia seen in ARDS.
