      function of the heart's ventricles. The number of patients with VADs is expected to increase
      in an exponential manner in the years to come as device technology improves and continues to
      show a survival benefit. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of a
      proactive palliative care intervention for patients with VADs and their caregivers. Patients
      randomized to palliative care will receive ongoing counseling and symptom assessment as well
      as clarification and documentation of goals of care, starting before implantation and
      continuing throughout the course of the study. The intervention is delivered primarily in the
      outpatient setting by a palliative care nurse practitioner. Intervention patients will also
      be followed by the inpatient palliative care consultation service when hospitalized for their
      initial VAD implantation and during any subsequent hospitalizations as needed. Control
      patients will receive usual care as provided by the VAD clinical team. Data collection will
      be performed by a research assistant at Mount Sinai (blinded to randomization) who conducts
      baseline assessments in person, and then follow-up assessments over the phone. The primary
      aim of the study is to provide "proof of concept" to demonstrate that patients and caregivers
      are willing to be enrolled in a randomized trial of palliative care and that such a study is
      feasible. Secondary aims include demonstrating improvement in symptoms (physical and
      psychological) for intervention patients and their caregivers as compared to control patients
      and caregivers.
