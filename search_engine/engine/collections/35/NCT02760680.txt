    
      Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF<45%) and predicted sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) receive a diagnostic device
      (WatchPAT 200 (TM)) and polysomnography (PSG) simultaneously during on night in a hospital
      sleep lab.

      The WatchPAT 200 (TM) is a wrist worn diagnostic device for detecting SDB. Its main part is
      the measurement of the peripheral arterial tone (PAT) via a plethysmographic based
      finger-mounted probe. It can measure the level of sympathetic activation of the autonomic
      nervous system. Pulse rate, oxygen saturation and snoring/body position levels are
      calculated, too. A software program (zzzPAT (TM)) with a special algorithm analyzes the raw
      data and creates a sleep report. Therefore the property of the WatchPAT 200 (TM) proclaims
      that the WatchPAT 200 (TM) can detect sleep events and SDB.

      The PSG is scored by sleep lab physicians/technicians blinded to the zzzPAT (TM)-software
      results using current American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines.

      Both results will be compared and the results of the device will be validated and evaluated
      against the results of the "Gold Standard" polysomnography.
