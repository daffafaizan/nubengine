      vessels under the macula. Experimental studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) is centrally involved in this process. Current treatment options have up
      until now been limited to photodynamic therapy (PDT) where a photosensitizing agent in
      combination with laser is used to occlude the pathologic vessels. Anti-VEGF agents have
      recently become available making them a potentially attractive treatment alternative for
      neovascular AMD. We will compare the effect intravitreally administered bevacizumab with
      conventional PDT in a prospective, randomized and controlled trial including 100 patients (50
      patients receiving either treatment regimen). Non-treated patients will receive either
      sham-injection or sham-PDT. The primary endpoint of the study is the amount of patients
      losing less than 15 letters on the ETDRS visual acuity chart. The study will go on for 2
      years with an interim report after 1 year.
