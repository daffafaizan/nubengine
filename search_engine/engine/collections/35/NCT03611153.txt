      for evaluation of breathlessness or shortness of breath. Perform safety lab sampling,
      echocardiography, arterial tonometry for pulse wave analysis, and assessment of endothelial
      function prior to administration of study drug. During the catheterization researchers will
      perform blood draws, assess baseline exercise capacity at rest and during exercise.
      Researchers will also do an echocardiogram to take measurements of the heart. Subjects will
      be randomized to one of two groups, Oral Myeloperoxidase Inhibitor or placebo group. Study
      drug or placebo will be administered followed by a repeat of the baseline catheterization
      assessments. At the conclusion of the second exercise test the subject will be moved to a
      room and monitored overnight for safety. Repeat blood draws, echocardiogram, endothelial
      function test, and heart monitoring will be completed. The subject will be asked to follow up
      with the researchers between 9-14 days after the study drug dosage. The subjects history and
      blood work will be completed at that visit.
