      function in patients at risk for Alzheimer's Disease by using APOE ε4 as a marker for disease
      risk. The activation Blood Oxygen Level Dependency (BOLD) signal will be compared to both
      resting and activation perfusion signals to assess the variability of cerebral blood flow as
      it relates to the BOLD signal. Each participant will be imaged on a 3T MRI scanner while
      performing an associate episodic memory task.

      A total of 90 individuals will be recruited for this study. Participants will be
      non-demented, right handed, adults with or without at least one APOE ε4 allele. Groups will
      be split as follows: A) ages 25-39: non-ε4 (n=15); B) ages 25-39: +ε4 (n=15); C) ages 40-49:
      non-ε4 (n=15); D) ages 40-49: +ε4 (n=15);.E) ages 50-65: non-ε4: F) ages 50-65: +ε4 (n=15).
      These groups will be matched for mean age, mean years of education, gender distribution, as
      well as the presence or absence of a family history of AD in a first degree relative.

      There will be 2 scanning sessions for each participant. Scan session #1 and Scan session #2
      will be acquired within 2 weeks of each other and will take approximately one hour each.
