      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy, of imatinib mesylate, in terms of achieving a therapeutic
           tumor:plasma concentration ratio, in patients with primary malignant glioma.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate tumor grade (low vs high) and/or tumor enhancement on MRI with tumor
           concentration of this drug in these patients.,

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for 7-12 days. Patients then
      undergo surgical resection.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at the time of surgery and analyzed for imatinib
      mesylate concentration.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 7 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
