      that can be accomplished in the office with minimal side effects. It is currently carried out
      by stimulating one of the posterior tibial nerves unilaterally. The aim of this study is to
      determine whether bilateral percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is more effective than
      unilateral stimulation. Patients with a diagnosis of overactive bladder who have previously
      failed lifestyle changes and/or pharmacologic therapy will be offered percutaneous tibial
      nerve stimulation. Enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups. The control group
      will receive the traditional unilateral treatment of PTNS. The intervention group will
      receive bilateral PTNS treatment. Intervention success will be measured by improvement in
      overactive bladder symptoms assessed by improvement in the scores on the overactive bladder
      questionnaire symptoms bother and decrease in number of voids, nocturia episodes and
      incontinence episodes as reported in the voiding diary
