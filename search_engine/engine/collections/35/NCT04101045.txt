      in this in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of the study is to test the
      hypothesis that an enhanced rate of DNL largely contributes to dyslipidemia occurring in
      youth with poorly-controlled T1D. According to this hypothesis, youth with poorly-regulated
      T1D experience a state of persistent insulin independent, highly variable fluctuations of
      glucose, and other sugars, through the glycolytic pathway that result in an enhancement of
      hepatic DNL and an increased production of triglycerides (TG). Newly-formed TG are packaged
      into large-VLDL that are secreted into the circulation contributing to an increase in plasma
      TG. When the TG concentration in the hepatocytes exceeds the ability of the liver to secrete
      TG, the latter start accumulating leading to hepatic steatosis.
