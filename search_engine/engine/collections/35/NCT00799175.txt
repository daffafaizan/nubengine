      infiltration analgesia (LIA) technique was developed by Drs Kerr and Kohan in Sydney,
      Australia. With this LIA-technique, a long-acting local anesthetic (ropivacaine), a
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac), and epinephrine are infiltrated
      intraoperatively and via an intraarticular catheter postoperatively. We ahve completed a
      study on unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and the present study is investigating total knee
      arthroplasties.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if intra- and postoperative administration of
      ropivacaine, ketorolac and epinephrine into the operating field would affect morphine
      consumption. Secondary end-points are hospital stay, pain intensity and side effects. In an
      attempt to assess the safety of this technique, knee function and patient satisfaction scores
      are assessed up to 3 months after surgery.
