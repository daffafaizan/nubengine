      To compare the number of passes required for obtaining adequate cell block material during
      EUS-guided FNA of solid pancreatic mass lesions.

      Primary Research Hypothesis:

      More specimen is required to obtain definitive diagnosis on cell block. This translates to
      less need for repeat procedures (due to nondiagnostic index procedure due to inadequate FNA
      passes), prompt treatment to patients and better use of health care resources. Therefore, we
      will be comparing 2 versus 4 FNA passes to determine which number of FNA pases will yield an
      adequate diagnostic cell block.

      Secondary Aims:

      To compare the rate of complications when performing 2 versus 4 EUS-FNA passes of solid
      pancreatic mass lesions.

      Secondary Research Hypothesis:

      EUS-guided FNA is a safe procedure with a complication rate of < 1%. By performing more
      (four) NA passes one is likely to yield a better quality cell block while at the same time
      without compromising patient safety.
