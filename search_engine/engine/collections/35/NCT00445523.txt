      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Once the patient is enrolled, and baseline tests have
      been completed, the patient will start treatment.

      Trovax® alone arm:

      Trovax will be given as an intramuscular injection every two weeks for the first two months,
      then once a month for the next 2 months, and then once every 2 months for up to a year.

      Trovax® plus IFN-α:

      Trovax® schedule will be the same as the Trovax® alone arm. IFN will be given on the first,
      third and fifth day of the week for a total of twelve weeks.

      At every office visit vital signs will be taken. Every eight weeks a medical history,
      physical exam, performance status evaluation, chest x-ray or CT scan, abdomen/pelvis CT scan
      or MRI will be done. A blood sample (about 8-10 tablespoons) will be taken to test the
      immunological response to TroVax® on the same days that the patient receives TroVax®
      injections.
