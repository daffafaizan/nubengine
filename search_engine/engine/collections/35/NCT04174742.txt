      following each dose of pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution). At the end of that week,
      blood will be drawn from each subject to directly measure the WBC/ANC, which can then be
      compared to self-reported pain and evaluated for any correlation. Finally, subjects will be
      divided into two groups by age: 45 years or younger, and over 45 to look for any differences
      in pain or WBC/ANC measurements based on age.
