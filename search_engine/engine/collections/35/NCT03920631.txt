    
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase 1 study to assess the safety of nivolumab
      (OPDIVO™, also referred to as BMS-936558, MDX1106, and ONO-4538) in combination with
      microtransplantation (MST) in patients ≥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory B cell
      lymphomas. A conventional cohorts-of-3 dose-escalation phase I design will be used to
      determine the optimal dosing strategy of nivolumab in combination with MST. The safety of
      microtransplantation without nivolumab will be evaluated at the first dose level. If
      significant, unexpected toxicity is observed at Dose Levels 2 or 3, subsequent cohorts will
      switch to the alternate dosing schedule to evaluate the safety of dose-reduced nivolumab.
      After determination of the maximum tolerated dose level, patients will be recruited into an
      expansion cohort at that level.
