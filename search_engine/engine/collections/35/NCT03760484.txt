    
      In this prospective, open -label, multi--center feasibility study, the investigators aim to
      determine the efficacy and safety of using combined serial FMT by enema plus fidaxomicin to
      treat patients who have severe or fulminant CDI not responding to maximal medical therapy.
      The hypothesis is the combination of FMT plus fidaxomicin can reduce the number of FMT
      required and/or hospital length of stay compared to FMT plus vancomycin.

      Participants will receive FMT by enemas over 3 days which constitutes a single cycle with
      concurrent treatment with oral fidaxomicin. If participants do not show improvement
      biochemically or clinically, then a repeat FMT cycle will be administered to a maximum of 4
      cycles.
