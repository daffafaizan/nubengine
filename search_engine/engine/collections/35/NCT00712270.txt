      predicting differential antipsychotic drug treatment response in patients with schizophrenia.
      In particular, we will examine differential response to two antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole
      and risperidone, that have contrasting pharmacologic activity at D2-type dopamine receptors,
      i.e., partial agonism vs. antagonism, respectively. A number of candidate predictors will be
      examined, including neuroimaging parameters (regional neuroanatomical and metabolic
      variations, fallypride binding to D2-like receptors), neuropsychological testing, clinical
      features, laboratory measures, and genetic studies.

      Secondary objectives include: (1) extension of our previous efforts to characterize
      abnormalities in cortico-striato-thalamic circuits in unmedicated schizophrenics using PET
      and MR imaging; and, (2) examination of the role of omega-3 fatty acid activity in
      schizophrenics as a predictor of dopaminergic activity.
