      un-addressed:

        -  How the 3'RR alleles are linked to IgG allotypes and corresponding IgH haplotypes?

        -  Is there a physiological link between 3'RR alleles and production of the various Ig
           classes and sub-classes?

        -  Is the 3'RR polymorphism connected with the risk of more severe forms of allergic
           diseases?

        -  Is the 3'RR polymorphism connected with the risk of occurrence and/or severe evolution
           of HSP?

        -  Is the oncogenicity of translocations affecting the IgH locus connected to the strength
           of the 3'RR allelic variants?
