    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of R2-miniCHOP (Sub-cutaneous
      Rituximab-miniCHOP + lenalidomide) and R-miniCHOP (Sub-cutaneous Rituximab-miniCHOP) in
      patients aged 80 years old or more with not previously treated cluster of differentiation
      antigen 20 positive (CD20+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as measured by the overall survival
      (OS).

      Primary endpoint of the study is to compare the efficacy of R2-miniCHOP (Sub-cutaneous
      Rituximab-miniCHOP + lenalidomide) and R-miniCHOP ((Sub-cutaneous Rituximab-miniCHOP) in
      patients of 80 years old or more with not previously treated CD20+ diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma as measured by the overall survival (OS).

      Secondary endpoints are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy and the safety of R2-miniCHOP as measured by the PFS
           (Progression Free Survival), EFS (Event Free Survival), the DoR (duration of response),
           the DFS (disease free survival), response rate at the end of the treatment, the
           additional toxicities

        -  To evaluate the simplified scale prognostic impact (IADL, MNA, G8, CIRS-G)

        -  To assess the quality of life before and after treatment This study is a multicentric,
           phase III, open-label, randomized (1:1) trial evaluating the efficacy of R2-miniCHOP in
           patients aged of 80 years or more with non-previously treated CD20+ diffuse large B-cell
           lymphoma (age-adjusted IPI= 0 to 3), Ann Arbor stage II to IV with a performance status
           ECOG from 0 to 2.

      This study includes a run in phase to assess feasibility, safety and tolerance of
      subcutaneous rituximab injections and oral lenalidomide (10 mg D1-D14) in combination with
      dose-reduced intensity CHOP regimen.
