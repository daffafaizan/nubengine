      with worse outcome. The RenalGuard system was developed to prevent AKI by a controlled
      furosemide-induced diuresis with matched isotonic intravenous hydration. It is based on the
      theory, that a high urinary output prevents contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN).

      The present study is a prospective, randomized trial to investigate wether a matched
      intravenous hydration using the RenalGuard system is superior to standard pre- and
      postprocedural intravenous hydration in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis and
      chronic kidney disease undergoing TAVI. Primary endpoint is the occurrence of AKI after TAVI.
