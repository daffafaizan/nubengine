    
      Beginning in December 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory
      distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused an international outbreak of respiratory
      illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although the clinical manifestations of
      COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients show severe kidney
      abnormalities. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is reported to occur in 0.5-9% of SARS-CoV-2
      positive patients and AKI has been identified as an independent risk factor for in-hospital
      mortality. The present study aims to investigate the incidence of of renal outcome of
      in-hospital patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
