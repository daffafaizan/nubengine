      several advantages, however randomised studies testing the clinical efficacy are scarce. A
      prospective, randomised study comparing the efficacy of transfusions with platelets stored in
      Platelet Additive Solution II (PAS II) versus plasma showed that CCIs after transfusion with
      platelets stored in PAS II were significantly lower (1). Major drawbacks of this study were
      the exclusion of patients with clinical factors known to increase platelet consumption and a
      limited number of patients. A multicenter, randomised study to investigate clinical efficacy
      of platelets stored in PAS II versus plasma, also including patients with factors of
      increased platelet consumption, was performed. Methods: After consent patients > 18 years,
      without HLA- and/or HPA-alloantibodies, were randomised to receive pooled platelet
      concentrates (PC) suspended in either plasma or PAS II, leucoreduced, and stored up to 5
      days. 1- and 24-hour CCI were the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were transfusion
      interval, adverse reactions and bleeding complications. An inclusion-period was defined as a
      maximum of 8 transfusions or 30 days after the first transfusion.
