    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, blind, randomized and controlled trial, in which patients
      are of essential hypertension, but in the absence of antihypertensive medications. The
      patients will be informed, consent and get into a screening process. After at least two weeks
      of drug elution period HPLC-MS/MS urinary antihypertensive drugs detection will be given till
      the negative result, or one extra week of drug elution period will be given for the second
      urinary drugs analysis. Then Office systolic blood pressure (SBP) is still ≥ 150mmHg, <
      180mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90mmHg, and 24-hour mean SBP of ambulatory blood
      pressure measurement (ABPM) is ≥130mmHg, or day-time mean SBP ≥135mmHg, or night-time mean
      SBP ≥120mmHg, and all SBP of ABMP record <170mmHg.

      These patients will conduct renal angiography, and the meet inclusion criteria individuals
      will be allocated to either renal nerve stimulation, mapping and denervation group (RDN
      group) or renal artery angiography group (Sham group) by a randomizing system in a 1:1 ratio
      (80 patients, 40 pairs). Physicians who perform post-procedure patient management and
      physicians who perform renal denervation procedures are blinded to each other.

      Patients will be followed at the 2nd day, the 7th day after the procedure or at discharge
      from hospital, 1st month, 2nd month, 3rd month. Urine samples will be collected for drug
      tests to determine drug compliance of a patient.

      Data collecting/management/statistical analysis and laboratory tests will be performed by
      independent, qualified organizations. Independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board/Clinical
      Events Committee (DSMB/CEC) are formed and responsible for assessments of protocol deviations
      and natures of serious adverse events (SAEs).
