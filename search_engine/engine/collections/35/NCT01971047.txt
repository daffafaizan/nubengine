      2 diabetes,having an out patient surgical procedure, meeting inclusion criteria to receive
      corrective doses of IV regular insulin (Group I) or SC humalog insulin (Group II). The dosing
      formula is per Emory University Outpatient Surgical Center protocol for treating
      hyperglycemia and is the same for both groups. All patients with diabetes will undergo a
      blood sugar measurement upon arrival to the ASC using the Accuchek blood glucose meter. An
      admission blood sugar of >180 in a patient with diabetes qualifies the patient for study
      screening. Subjects will be approached after confirmation of eligibility for the study.
      Randomization, then treatment, will occur immediately following written informed consent.
      Demographic data will be recorded.A medical history with detailed history of diabetes will be
      obtained and surgical and anesthesia details and length of stay recorded. Blood sugar levels
      will be checked hourly until the patient is ready for discharge. Subsequent treatment will
      follow the hyperglycemia protocol. All blood sugar results and doses of insulin will be
      recorded. The subject's participation will end at the time of discharge from the Ambulatory
      Surgical Center.
