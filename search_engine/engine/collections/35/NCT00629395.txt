      databases for each clinic (n = approximately 50 survivors in each clinic). A letter
      explaining the purpose of the study will then be sent to the parents of these patients.
      Interested parents will be invited to contact study personnel by phone or email for a
      thorough review of the study and to schedule a screening appointment.

      After obtaining written informed consent and assent (from parents and child, respectively),
      screening procedures will include administration of an abbreviated intellectual test battery,
      two working memory tasks, and a computerized attention measure to the survivor. Parents will
      complete questionnaire measures regarding their child's adaptive, behavioral, emotional, and
      attentional functioning; follow-up interviewing will be conducted to clarify any potential
      problems identified on the questionnaires. The entire screening procedure is estimated to
      take approximately 60 minutes for the survivor and 30-45 minutes for parents. To maximize
      efficiency, a research assistant will complete testing with the child and a psychologist will
      explain the questionnaire measures to the parent and conduct any follow-up interviewing.
