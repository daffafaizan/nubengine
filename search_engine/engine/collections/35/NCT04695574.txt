      programs as they take place in daily life as functional movements. Therefore, it becomes
      important to evaluate closed kinetic chain activity. The aim of this study is to develop and
      to determine the test-retest, intra- and interreliability, and validity of the Closed Kinetic
      Chain Lower Extremity Stability Test (CKCLEST). Three-blinded, cross-sectional,
      repeated-measures clinical measurement reliability trial. To assess the reliability of
      CKCLEST, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM),
      minimal detectable change (MDC), and Bland-Altman plot will be used. For concurrent validity
      of CKCLEST will be applied Spearman correlation analysis with Vertical Jump Test, Isokinetic
      Dynamometer Test, Single Leg Hop Test, and Prone Bridge Test. All analyses were made for both
      the best score and the average score. This test allows the evaluation of functional lower
      extremity stability, static/dynamic control of the lower extremity (knee/hip) or trunk, and
      simultaneous activation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles / such coactivation.
