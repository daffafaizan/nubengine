      diabetes or prediabetes and chronic HF without previous pharmacological treatment (T2D+HF+),
      20 subjects with HF without T2D (HF+T2D-), 20 subjects with T2D alone (HF-T2D+) and 20
      healthy control volunteers (HF-T2D-).

      All examinations will be done during a short admission at Diabetes Center (CD) in Institute
      for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM), always under comparable circumstances. All
      participants will undergo standardized selection of metabolic and cardiovascular tests.

      Oxidative stress markers, selected cytokines, peptides and metabolites in blood and
      subcutaneous adipose tissue will be analyzed. Investigators assume that this project will
      bring new knowledge which will contribute to discovery of the mechanisms implicated in the
      development of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.
