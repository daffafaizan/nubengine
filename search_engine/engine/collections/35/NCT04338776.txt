      receive a catheter between post-procedure and prior to discharge, will return to office to
      complete a voiding assessment.

      All subjects will be expected to complete questionnaires and assessments, as part of SOC
      (varies by institution), at day 3, day 7, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 12 months
      post-procedure.
