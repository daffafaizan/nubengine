      Information System (PROMIS) network has developed over 20 pediatric instruments, both
      child-report and parent-proxy editions. Cross-sectional evaluations of the validity of the
      instruments have established that they are ready for integration into clinical research and
      practice. The next step in their ongoing evaluation is to assess their prospective clinical
      validity in a variety of health conditions. This study addresses the clinical evaluation of
      the measures in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      Through baseline surveys and six follow-up surveys over a two-year period, Investigators are
      collecting self-report (child) and parent-proxy report of 11 pediatric PROMIS measures. Each
      of these PROMIS measures is described in the Main Outcome Measures section. Investigators are
      also collecting assessments of disease activity from clinical data. The selection of
      self-report and parent proxy patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures were determined through
      qualitative content validation. The analytic goal of this project is to evaluate baseline
      (cross-sectional) and longitudinal associations between PROMIS pediatric outcome measures and
      changes in the clinical status of patients with CKD. Our primary hypothesis is that as kidney
      function declines, self-reported health will worsen.
