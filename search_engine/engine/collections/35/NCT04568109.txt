      with PD by applying a highly standardized hyperventilation task (provoking panic-related body
      symptoms) prior to and after a manualized CBT or a waiting period. Activation of the brain's
      fear network (defensive activation) is indexed by the potentiation of the startle eyeblink
      response.
