    
      This study has been designed to determine whether the use of a regimen based exclusively on
      NTRI, containing tenofovir, zidovudine and lamivudine, is able to preserve immunological
      status in patients with detectable viral load for whom an efficacious salvage regimen cannot
      be designed, slowing the progression of the viral load and reducing antiretroviral
      treatment-associated toxicity. In order to complete the salvage regimen without increasing
      the number of tablets too much, Trizivir plus tenofovir as investigational treatment will be
      used.
