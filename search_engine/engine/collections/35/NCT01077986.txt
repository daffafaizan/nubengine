      Part I is dose finding, whereby dose escalations will be performed for everolimus and
      capecitabine. Part II is the efficacy study. At the MTD doses in part II biomarker studies
      will be performed in blood and tumor tissue. Study design phase I part: The first week
      patients will be treated with everolimus alone. Capecitabine will be administered for 14 days
      in a 3 weekly cycle, starting on day 8. Cetuximab will be administered weekly, starting at
      day 8. The dose is fixed for cetuximab during study treatment, whereas the doses of
      everolimus and capecitabine will differ per dose level. First dose level: Everolimus 5 mg
      daily continuously, Capecitabine 600 mg/m2 bid for 2 weeks every 3 weeks, Cetuximab 400mg/m2
      (120 min infusion) first dose, thereafter 250 mg/m2 (60 min infusion) weekly. Second dose
      level: Everolimus 10 mg daily continuously, Capecitabine 600 mg/m2 bid for 2 weeks every 3
      weeks, Cetuximab 400mg/m2 (120 min infusion) first dose, thereafter 250 mg/m2 (60 min
      infusion) weekly. Third dose level: Everolimus 10 mg daily continuously, Capecitabine 800
      mg/m2 bid for 2 weeks every 3 weeks, Cetuximab 400mg/m2 (120 min infusion) first dose,
      thereafter 250 mg/m2 (60 min infusion) weekly. Study design phase II part At the MTD 14-25
      patients with pancreatic cancer will be included. In the phase II part, everolimus will be
      administered during one week before start of cetuximab. At day 8 the first dose of cetuximab
      will be administered. Capecitabine will be started one week thereafter. This enables us to
      perform pharmacodynamic studies to assess biomarker changes during the different phases of
      treatment. Everolimus will be administered continuously in a dose of 5 or 10 mg orally once
      daily (dependent on MTD from part 1). Capecitabine will be administered orally in a dose of
      400 - 800 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by one week rest (dependent on MTD from part
      1). Patients will receive cetuximab infusions via an infusion pump, with an initial dose of
      400 mg/m² (over 120 min) and subsequent weekly infusions of 250 mg/m² (over 60 min), starting
      day 8.
