      therapy improves cognitive functioning in college undergraduates. The secondary goal is to
      investigate neurophysiological, cognitive, and psychosocial mechanisms of change. The
      investigators will compare cognitive remediation therapy to computer games. The active
      control condition will allow the investigators to determine whether targeted cognitive
      training, as an adjunct to academic skills training provided by CSU TILT, provides
      significant improvement over computer games alone (which is also thought to provide some
      value as "brain training"). Participants who agree to enroll in the study will be randomized
      to one of two intervention arms: cognitive remediation (CR) or active control (AC). In the CR
      arm, participants will complete 20 hours of targeted cognitive training, in 30-min session, 5
      days per week, over 8 weeks. The AC Arm will follow the same schedule, except that
      participants will complete video games (e.g., pong). All participants will repeat assessments
      at randomly determined midpoint, as well as after the 8 weeks of training have been
      completed.
