      allows objective and precise analysis of movements with its wearable inertial sensor. It also
      enables 3D kinematic analysis of the pelvis, providing a functional analysis of disorders in
      gait caused by neuromuscular diseases The device is placed on an elastic belt and worn on the
      waist of the person being evaluated, with the center of the device at the fifth lumbar
      vertebrae. To ensure correct placement of the device, the L4-L5 intervertebral space was
      palpated via the posterior superior iliac spines (SIPS).

      After the accelerometer was placed, the children were asked to walk calmly at normal speed,
      on a 10 m track, whose boundaries were determined with colored lines and to return to the
      starting position.

      The values and gait characteristics of acceleration in the anteroposterior (AP) and
      mediolateral (ML) axes were transferred to the computer software program.

      The tilt of the pelvis in the sagittal plane in the flexion-extension direction, the oblique
      displacement in the coronal plane, the angles of the rotation of movement in the transverse
      plane and the symmetry values of the right and left sides are obtained. While the symmetry
      index ranges from 0 to 100, a value closer to 100 indicates that the gait is more symmetrical
