      center study of safety and efficacy of oral idebenone in adults 18 years of age or older with
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Following IRB approval and written informed consent, 45
      participants will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:2 ratio on REDCap data
      capturing software. Participants will be randomized to two groups and receive the following
      tablets: placebo, idebenone at escalating doses of 200mg by mouth (P.O.) once a day for 2
      weeks, then 200 mg twice a day for 2 weeks, then 3 times per day for the remainder of the
      study (up to 48 weeks). Monitoring and safety evaluation will continue for 12 weeks after the
      final dose. The study will investigate the safety and tolerability as primary end point and
      assess target engagement and fibrosis improvement as secondary end points.
