      changes in OTCD using 1H MRS, DTI, volumetric averaging and fMRI with cognitive testing of
      executive function measures to validate biomarkers for the effect of HA and its treatment on
      the brain.

      The investigators will measure gln and mI in blood and brain (using 1H MRS) in affected
      participants, and mI in brain in controls, fractional anisotropy as a measure of white matter
      microstructural damage (by DTI) and brain activation pathways alterations with tasks probing
      working memory (fMRI). As a secondary outcome measure, the investigators will correlate the
      findings from neuroimaging with cognitive functioning. This protocol is based on the previous
      5104 protocol, now includes children to evaluate the age and stage of disease on these
      indices in a cohort that is undergoing important developmental events against an age matched
      typically developing cohort.
