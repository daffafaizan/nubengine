    
      This is a single-site, phase IIa, double-blind, within-subject, cross-over, human laboratory
      study. Subjects will be healthy, treatment-seeking female and male adult smokers, ages 18 to
      65 years old. Subjects deemed eligible for participation after an Intake Visit (~Day -7) will
      complete baseline assessments and receive period 1 medication (ABT-089 or placebo) at the
      Baseline Visit (Day 0). Subjects will take 40mg of ABT-089 or placebo, based on random
      assignment, every day for two identical 10-day study treatment periods.

      Subjects will begin period 1 study medication on Day 1. On Days 3 and 5, subjects will
      complete in-clinic medication run-up and monitoring assessments. On Day 5, subjects will
      begin a ~24-hour period of mandatory abstinence from smoking. Day 6 is conducted in two
      parts. Part 1 will consist of confirmation of smoking abstinence, testing for
      abstinence-induced cognitive deficits and the collection of subjective assessments. Part 2
      will begin with a programmed smoking lapse, after which the subjective rewarding value of the
      programmed lapse cigarette will be assessed. Before leaving the clinic on Day 6, subjects
      will receive brief cessation counseling and be instructed to try to remain abstinent from
      10pm that evening until after the final Observation Visit on Day 10.

      During the ~4-day monitored abstinence/observation phase, subjects will complete in-clinic
      observation visits (subjective assessments, medication adherence, etc.) on Days 7, 8, and 10.

      After a ~3-week medication washout period and Period 2 Medication Pick-up Visit on ~Day 31,
      subjects will begin study medication (either ABT-089 or placebo; but will always be the
      opposite of the assigned study medication in period 1) and participate in period 2 of the
      study following the same procedures as period 1.
