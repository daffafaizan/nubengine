      for adolescents and young adults. The intervention, MoodHelper.org already exists and has
      been tested in two pilots. In this third pilot, we plan to use an enriched minority sampling
      frame to mail 3,000 to 6,000 invitational brochures to KPNW members aged 14 to 24, with a
      enrollment target of 150. Interested members will go to the study Internet site, and if they
      choose to participate, complete the online consent and assessment battery (used in the
      previous pilots). Participants will be randomly assigned by the site's software to one of two
      conditions: (1) the "Intervention" condition, with complete access to the SADhelper.org web
      site or (2) the "Usual Care" condition, with access to all Internet sites and KPNW health
      care, but with no access to the therapeutic portion of the SADhelper site. All participants
      (those with and without access to the research intervention) will be reminded by e-mail and,
      if necessary, by telephone to return to the web site and complete follow-up questionnaires
      four, eight, sixteen, and thirty-two weeks after enrolling in the study.
