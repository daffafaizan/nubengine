      and ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (ICE) chemotherapy in patients with advanced sarcoma.
      II. Assess the efficacy of this combination of therapy. III. Assess the clinical toxicity of
      WBH and ICE in these patients. IV. Obtain pilot data on the effect of WBH and ICE on cytokine
      induction in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Treatment of whole body hyperthermia (WBH) and ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide
      (ICE) is given every 3-4 weeks. On day 1 of the treatment, ifosfamide is administered
      intravenously over 60 minutes at the beginning of hyperthermia. Carboplatin is administered
      intravenously over 20 minutes while at the maximum temperature. Etoposide is administered
      intravenously over 60 minutes while receiving hyperthermia and on day 2 and 3 after
      hyperthermia. Patient disease status is reevaluated after 2 courses. If there is no disease
      progression, treatment continues for a maximum of 4 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 17-34 patients will be accrued for this study.
