      rate, time to progression, and overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory
      myeloma.Clarithromycin is an antibiotic that has shown efficacy in association with steroids
      and lenalidomide.Clarithromycin, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (BiRd) in newly diagnosed MM
      has yielded an overall response rates (ORR) of 93% and a progression-free survival (PFS) of
      43 months.No prospective study of BiRd to treat relapsed or refractory myeloma has been
      reported so far.The goal of this phase 2 clinical trial was to assess the response rate and
      toxicity of a combination regimen of clarithromycin (Biaxin), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and
      dexamethasone (BiRD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM.
