      Marfan's syndrome whereby a gene mutation is suspected to have affected major blood vessel of
      their heart or have a Fontan procedure that was carried out to re-direct blood flow in their
      heart. This study will recruit 30 subjects from National Heart Centre Singapore over a period
      of 1 year.

      For clinically diagnosed Marfan disease, a genetic test in a gene called FBN1 will be carried
      out to confirm the presence of gene mutation that is suspected to cause the disease. It is
      important for them to know that any research finding that indicates the presence of this gene
      mutation may only suggest a pre-disposition to Marfan disease, but it does not definitely
      ascertain that gene has caused the disease or predict that they will develop the disease.
      Further independent clinical genetic testing may be made available, should they so desire
      after consulting their doctor or genetic counsellor.

      The skin obtained during the course of this study will be used for this study only and will
      be stored and analysed for the purposes of this study only, for a period not exceeding 5
      years for research studies and experimental transplant studies, and will be destroyed after
      completion of the study, unless they agree to donate the samples to National Heart Centre
      Singapore for continuous storage for future studies that are approved by Institutional review
      board. The blood will however be stored indefinitely in National Heart Centre for future
      research on molecular, imaging and outcome studies of cardiovascular health and disease.
