      prescription medications, thereby increasing the risk of drug-herb interactions. Ginkgo
      biloba extract is a popular dietary supplement that is ingested by the general population to
      enhance mental focus and by the elderly to delay onset of age-acquired loss of cognitive
      function. In subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba
      may decrease efficacy of the hypoglycemic agents and increase whole body insulin resistance.
      Because aging is a significant risk factor for the development of NIDDM as a result of a
      progressive decline in pancreatic function, and because the elderly chronically take multiple
      prescription medications, the increased use of Ginkgo biloba in this population may increase
      drug-herb interactions. Therefore, we shall examine the effect of Ginkgo biloba on the
      pancreatic function in the elderly to determine whether it may produce pancreatic dysfunction
      and a potential for the development of insulinopenia. The results of this study should
      provide valuable information for designing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of
      diseases in the insulin resistance syndrome.
