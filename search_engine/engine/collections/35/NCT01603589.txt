      Extracorporeal Circulation (MiECC) offers advantage over conventional CPB (CECC). In order to
      draw an evidence-based conclusion, the investigators aim to evaluate perfusion
      characteristics during coronary surgery with MECC and associated remote end-organ function.
      Improved end-organ protection translates into improved clinical outcome which greatly affects
      quality of life. This is the first study in the literature adequately powered to analyse
      organ pathophysiology during surgery with MECC and at the same time correlating common
      clinical variables with a detailed quality of life evaluation. Superiority of MECC could
      provide firm evidence towards widespread use of MECC in coronary surgery as standard of care.
