      universal efficacy. Use of combination therapies with different pharmacological basis is
      likely to bring down rates of PONV. (6) Intravenous dexamethasone (8-10mg) reduces the
      incidence of PONV, minimizing activity of phospholipase A2 and blocking the expression of
      cyclooxygenase (COX)2 mRNA that reduce production of prostaglandin and control the release of
      endorphins.

      Aprepitant has demonstrated powerful additive effects when combined with dexamethasone and a
      5-HT3 to prevent both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and
      in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) The use of mirtazapine in the
      management of nausea and vomiting has been reported for both treatment and premedication
