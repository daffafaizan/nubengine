      of 50. The prognosis for rectal cancer has improved over the last decades2. Almost 60% of all
      patients survive more than five years, and because of advances in early detection and
      treatment, this number is expected to increase in the future1. Treatment of rectal cancer
      varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. For some patients, operation is
      the only treatment. For others, surgery is combined with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both.
      The two most common operative procedures are the sphincter-preserving anterior resection (AR)
      and the abdominoperineal resection (APR) - the latter results in a permanent colostomy.
      Patients with generalised disease at diagnosis receive palliative treatment, which may
      include chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as surgery.

      Rectal cancer comes with a high risk of local recurrence, i.e. return of the tumour within
      the pelvis after a presumed curative resection. Local recurrence is difficult to treat and
      often very painful and distressing for the patient. Some local recurrences will be candidates
      for second line surgery, as is also true for some distant metastases.

      The aim of the QoLiRECT study is to increase the knowledge about symptoms, functional
      impairments, quality of life (QoL) and psychological and socioeconomic burden in an
      unselected population of rectal cancer patients. Symptoms such as incontinence, pain, fatigue
      and impaired sexual function3 are common with this disease. Bodily changes, caused by the
      treatment or the disease itself, may lead to functional impairments and psychological,
      social, emotional and economical restraints. Conventional outcome measures such as morbidity
      and survival reveal little about these things.
