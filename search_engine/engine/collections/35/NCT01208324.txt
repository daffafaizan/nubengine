      interactive effects of the hormone estrogen and the neurotransmitter serotonin on certain
      aspects of cognition and brain activation in menopausal women ages 48 to 60 years. Women will
      undergo cognitive testing and fMRI sessions both before and after 6 weeks of either estrogen
      or placebo administration. We will recruit women who are across the first 10 years since
      their last menstrual period so that the investigators can gather information regarding the
      potential impact of time since menopause on our outcomes of interest. We anticipate that
      findings from this study will help scientist and clinicians to refine their use of estrogen
      therapy in menopausal women. In addition, should the role of serotonin be of utmost
      importance for maintenance of healthy cognition, these data aid future drug development to
      preserve health cognition and/or to treat dementias in which serotonin is an important
      factor. This proposal is both novel and timely as results from this study are likely to
      provide information critical to the on-going discussion regarding the risks and benefits of
      ET use in menopausal women.
