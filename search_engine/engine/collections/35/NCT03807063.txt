      Each subject may receive up to 3 doses of rivogenlecleucel intravenously (IV), at intervals
      of no less than 28 days. Subjects meeting protocol-specified severity criteria for acute
      GVHD, chronic GVHD, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), prolonged aplasia, or encephalopathy
      will be treated with rimiducid infusion(s).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and
      then annually for 10 years.
