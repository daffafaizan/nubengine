      failure.A similar benefit may be seen after MI, with an improvement in functional capacity
      averaging 20 percent. More important, however, is the possible effect on survival. In a
      meta-analysis of 24 trials examining the effect of cardiac rehabilitation after MI, there was
      a significant reduction in mortality with rehabilitation (odds ratio 0.81).

      Previous studies focused on the effect of rehabilitation comes from the improvement of oxygen
      utilization in skeletal muscle. The effects on cardiac morphology and perfusion status were
      rather little to be addressed.

      In this study, we will collect the questionaires, blood sampling for assay of stem cell
      factors, maximal O2 consumption, and cardiac MRI before and after cardiac
      rehabilitation.SDF-1 (stromal cell derived factor-1), SCF(stem cell factor), and VEGF
      (vasculoendothelial growth factor) will be measured by ELISA. Cardiac MRI will provide the
      information about (1) LV function, (2) scar size, and (3) perfusion status (dipyridamole
      stress MRI).
