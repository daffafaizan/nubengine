    
      ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that possesses
      anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity in animal models of human cancer. ASONEP™ binds
      sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid signaling molecule that possesses potent
      pro-growth effects.

      Preclinical studies with ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) and LT1002 (murine homolog of LT1009),
      demonstrate the potential of an anti-S1P treatment to reduce tumor volumes and metastatic
      potential, likely as a result of inhibiting new blood vessel formation needed to support
      tumor growth.

      Lpath is developing ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) for the following therapeutic indication:

      ASONEP™ [parenteral sonepcizumab (LT1009) for the treatment of cancer] is indicated for use
      in combination with TBD cytotoxic agents and other anti-angiogenic agents as second-line
      therapy to treat patients with an unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic TBD
      cancer.
