      at the time of open chest surgery in patients who are likely to benefit from a CRT system
      following their surgery; b) compare differences between patients who receive LV leads using
      the transvenous approach and those patients who receive LV leads using the epicardial
      approach; and c) assess the cost effectiveness of placing the LV lead via the transvenous
      versus the epicardial approaches.
