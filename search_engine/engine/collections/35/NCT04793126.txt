    
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent problem that affects women's quality of life women
      with POP may present with a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

      For POP patients with concomitant urinary symptoms, urodynamic (UDN) testing is proposed for
      proper evaluation of cases and identification of the pathophysiologic events in each case
      individually.

      In this prospective study, the investigators aim to describe the urinary symptoms and
      urodynamic findings concomitant with POP before and after surgical treatment of POP. We also
      aimed at defining the role of UDN in decision-making regarding the treatment of POP when
      associated with LUTS.
