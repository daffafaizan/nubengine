      Primary

        -  Determine the acute and chronic changes in INR in patients with advanced solid tumors
           treated with low-dose warfarin and vatalanib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) phase: Patients receive oral low-dose warfarin once daily on days
           1-14 and oral vatalanib once daily, 1 hour before warfarin administration, on days 2-14
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Continuation phase: Patients not experiencing a drug interaction in the PK phase
           continue to receive oral vatalanib and oral low-dose warfarin once daily. Patients
           experiencing a drug interaction (INR > 2.0) in the PK phase receive oral vatalanib alone
           once daily. Continuation therapy continues indefinitely in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
