      artificial pancreas (AP) prototype identified as eDAPT (electronic Diabetes Artificial
      Pancreas Training). This e-learning training program is to prepare people with diabetes and
      their physicians on the use of UVA's Artificial Pancreas prototype -- Diabetes Assistant
      (DiAs), a software platform for the development and outpatient testing of smart phone based
      systems for Closed Loop Control of diabetes. The e-learning training program will be used in
      adjunct to in-person training with study staff at the onset of a clinical trial. It will be
      especially important as the number of clinical sites that use DiAs continue to grow both in
      the United States and internationally. It is also a critical step in moving the DiAs closer
      to a commercial product. A validated training program is required to proceed with the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for both pivotal clinical trials and commercial approval of the
      AP.
