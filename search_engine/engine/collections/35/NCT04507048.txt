      by physicians. Then, it appears imperative to promote public campaigns in order to increase
      the awareness of laypersons on the most important rules for early identification of atypical
      skin lesions. The two main clinical rules are:

        1. ABCD rule. According to this rule, lesions characterized by one of more of the following
           features: Asymmetry, irregular Borders, Color variegation and Diameter larger than 6 mm,
           should be considered at risk for malignancy. In order to evaluate Evolution, monitoring
           strategies have been implemented;

        2. "ugly duckling" sign. According to this rule, a suspicious lesion tends to be different
           from the general nevus pattern of a given patient.

      The passive intervention will consist in the administration of a booklet containing the
      explanation of this two previous clinical rules for early detection of atypical melanocytic
      lesions. In the active intervention a standardized explanation will be given to the patient
      by a dermatologist, together with the administration of the booklet.

      Efficacy will be evaluated through the completion of a specific test before, immediately
      after and after one month the administration of the educational intervention.
