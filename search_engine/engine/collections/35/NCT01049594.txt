      will assess whether it makes parents more or less anxious about their babies, and whether
      they seek more or less help in the first couple of years after birth,and see if the total
      cost to the NHS is increased by using MRI. It will also check up if there is a better way to
      do ultrasound examinations, and do a survey to see how much MRI is used in the United Kingdon
      (UK) and whether hospitals think they could provide it.

      The core of the project is a study of preterm babies who will be referred to a specialist
      centre to have both ultrasound and MRI scans. Half the parents will be told the results of
      the MRI and half the parents the ultrasound. The programme will then ask them to fill in
      questionnaires or be interviewed about their stress levels and the amount of support they
      seek for their children until they are two years old, when the babies will be examined to see
      if MRI predicted their outcome accurately.
