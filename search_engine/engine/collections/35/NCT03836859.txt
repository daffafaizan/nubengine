    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled eye drops administration
      study of rhNGF in healthy male and female subjects of Japanese Ethnicity to evaluate the
      Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant Human Nerve Growth Factor Eye Drops
      (rhNGF 20 μg/mL -formulation containing L-methionine as excipient) versus vehicle (vehicle
      control containing L-methionine as excipient) in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers of
      Japanese Ethnicity. The IMP was administered in the study Eye with the following scheme:

      Day 1: One drop instilled into study eye (35 μL, corresponding to 0.70 μg of rhNGF).

      Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: One drop six times a day (every 2h) into study eye (210 μL, corresponding
      to 4.20 μg of rhNGF).

      Total dose in the study eye will be 31 drops (1085 μL, equivalent to 21.7 μg rhNGF) over 6
      days.

      The reference product (vehicle) was administered in the study eye with the following scheme:

      Day 1: One drop instilled into study eye (35 μL, corresponding to 0 μg of rhNGF].

      Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: One drop six times a day (every 2h) into study eye (210 μL, corresponding
      to 0 μg of rhNGF).

      A total dose of placebo vehicle in the study eye will be 31 drops (1085 μL, 0 μg rhNGF) over
      6 days.

      For the Fellow (Non-Study) Eye for all subjects, the scheme was the following:

      Day 1: One drop instilled into a fellow eye (35 μL, corresponding to 0 μg of rhNGF).

      Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: One drop six times a day (every 2h) into a fellow eye (210 μL,
      corresponding to 0 μg of rhNGF).

      A total dose of placebo vehicle in the fellow eye will be 31 drops (1085 μL, 0 μg rhNGF) over
      6 days.
