      patients and has adverse effects on recovery from outpatient procedures, contributing
      significantly to delays in discharge from recovery. A know major contributor to the
      occurrence of post-operative nausea and vomiting is the use of opiate medications which are
      the cornerstone of post-operative pain management. The investigators hypothesize that the
      occurrence of this side-effect is different between patients prescribed oxycodone and those
      receiving hydromorphone for acute pain management after total hip replacement surgery. This
      investigation is a randomized, double-blind, head-to-head comparison to equipotent
      administration of oxycodone vs. hydromorphone to determine whether such a difference exists.
