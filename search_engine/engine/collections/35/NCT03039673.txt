      To validate a new phase-II study design to improve the efficiency of drug development in ALS
      with early determination of drug response using established biomarkers (BMs).

      The aims of this new trial design are:

      (i) To shorten future trials duration in ALS using an early drug responding surrogate marker
      of disease activity; (ii) To establish the proof of mechanism (PoM) of the tested drugs;
      (iii) To identify drug responder status.

      Additional exploratory objectives are:

      (i) Deep immune & inflammatory phenotyping (ii) Brain biomarkers (iii) Genomics and
      Transcriptomics
