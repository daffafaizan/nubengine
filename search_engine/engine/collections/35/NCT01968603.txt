    
      Morbid obesity, intractable weight gain due to hypothalamic damage, is a common and troubling
      complication in patients undergoing surgery for craniopharyngioma combined or not with
      radiotherapy, with an incidence of 23~62% in pediatric patients. It has a major negative
      impact on metabolic and cardiovascular health and quality of life in long-term survivors.
      Identifying patients at higher risks for developing postoperative weight gain is of great
      importance in preventing obesity and taking early actions in this population. Though a lot of
      previous studies have been made in pediatric patients and several factors, such as
      hypothalamic involvement, higher body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) at
      diagnosis, age at diagnosis and hydrocephalus requiring a shunt, have been identified as risk
      factors for postoperative weight gain, data on this important morbidity in adult-onset
      patients are sparse, especially in Chinese population. Therefore, the investigators are going
      to undertake a retrospective evaluation of postoperative weight change in adult-onset
      patients undergoing surgery for craniopharyngioma and identify preoperative factors
      associated with it.
