    
      This is a prospective, Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study on ErbituxÂ® (Cetuximab) in
      patients with locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the
      head and neck in Korea

      This prospective study will collect safety information from more than 300 subjects treated
      with Erbitux as final evaluable cases. During the PMS period, subject background, subject's
      medical (surgery, anti-cancer treatment) history, Erbitux treatment status, concurrent
      medication, response evaluation, status and reason of discontinuation, all adverse events
      (AEs; regardless of the causal relationship to Erbitux), and abnormal results of laboratory
      tests will be collected for the study purpose.

      The PMS is based on all cases treated with Erbitux at least once. The PMS will be done within
      6 years from the approval date of the new indication. This PMS is requested by the Korean
      Regulatory Authorities. After approval of new indication in Korea, it is further required to
      investigate more than 300 subjects during 6 years according to local regulations to continue
      monitoring and provide further information about safety and toxicity in clinical practice.
