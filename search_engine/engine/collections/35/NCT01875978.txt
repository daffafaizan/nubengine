      risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue secrete adipocytes
      accumulate in the liver result in fatty liver. Excess fat become low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C) from liver. Oxidized- LDL-C adherence in the vessel result in
      atherosclerosis via inflammation and immune response.

      Phytosterols are present in the nuts, plant oil, broccoli and so on. The structure of
      phytosterols are similar with cholesterols. After the competition, the smaller absorption of
      cholesterols. Studies showed the average consumptions of phytosterols were 200mg daily but
      the enough amount for cardiovascular protection of phytosterols were 2000mg daily.

      Daily 2000mg phytosterols inhibit the absorption of intestine, reduce the LDL-C about 7-10%.
      Besides, phytosterols have the effect of anti-inflammation and anti-immune response. The
      anti-inflammation effect obvious inhibit the monocyte to transform to macrophage, inhibit the
      formation of foam cell.

      Clinical studies divided into two groups: 20/20 patients and 4 weeks follow up with
      cross-over test.First group A: Phytosterols 1800mg/day for 4 weeks ,washout 2 weeks, then
      placebo 4 weeks. Another group B: placebo 4 weeks, washout 2 weeks, then phytosterols 4
      weeks.Cross-over, double blind study was designed.

      Investigators check the possible benefits of LDL-C, Total -cholesterol,anti-oxidant
      capacity,C reactive protein,insulin-like growth factor-1, endothelial progenitor cells ; the
      possible side effect including liver function,muscle enzyme .
