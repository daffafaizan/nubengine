    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study to
      evaluate the safety of repeated application of three concentrations of NF-kappaB Decoy in
      approximately 75 subjects with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. The face, hands, feet,
      scalp, or groin may NOT be treated.

      Other treatment agents are currently available for atopic dermatitis but present significant
      potential side effects (topical steroids) or are potent immunosuppressives (topical
      calcineurin inhibitors) with pending longer-term safety data.

      NF-kappaB Decoy is a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligodeoxynucleotide that
      mimics the NF-kappaB binding sequence on the chromosomal DNA, thereby inhibiting the
      production of the inflammatory response triggered by NF-kappaB. This mechanism of action
      presents a unique treatment modality.

      A comprehensive series of nonclinical data have produced promising results.
