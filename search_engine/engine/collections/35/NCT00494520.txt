      stroke. This study will compare two cognitive therapies for the treatment of acquired word
      finding difficulties. The therapies use different types of cues. All participants will
      receive both therapies. Participants in this study will undergo a comprehensive and detailed
      assessment of language and other cognitive skills. The two treatments will be compared for
      their efficacy.
