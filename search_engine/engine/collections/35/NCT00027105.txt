      of morbidities in a population of approximately 160 patients diagnosed with breast cancer
      before and after medical and surgical treatment. Subjects will be followed for one-year with
      quarterly examinations (baseline [pre-medical treatment] and at 1, 3 months, 6 months, 9
      months and 12 months after treatment). In order for cancer survivors to understand the risk
      of impairment and functional limitations, and disability; and for health care providers to
      determine the risk of physical impairment, functional limitations, and loss of independence
      (morbidity) in patients with breast cancer; it is necessary to study these patients from the
      point of diagnosis (before surgery) to a reasonable period following the completion of the
      primary treatment program (1 year after medical treatment). Although pain, numbness, fatigue,
      lymphedema and diminished physical function are described as prevalent and debilitating
      conditions, remarkably few clinical studies are published describing the associated physical
      impairments, functional limitations or on methods for their control with measures prior to
      medical intervention and long-term follow-up. While several past reports have identified the
      impact of medical and surgical intervention on symptom distress and functional capacity of
      these patients, these studies do not provide sufficient evidence to identify the: 1) level of
      physical impairment that predicts morbidity in these patients, 2) individual factors that are
      specific predictors of morbidity in these patients, or 3) time period in which these
      morbidities occur. The majority of previous studies investigating morbidity of patients with
      breast cancer following medical and surgical intervention are cross-sectional, case series,
      retrospective analysis without a comparison/control group and without baseline measures prior
      to intervention. The proposed outcome study will include: 1) a retrospective review of
      specific medical record information such as staging conference information and the standard
      clinical quarterly examination during a one year period, and 2) administration of a follow-up
      outcome questionnaire, a physical activity questionnaire and a quality of life questionnaire
      at the 6 and 12 months time points. The outcome survey is an upper limb disability
      questionnaire developed as an outcome measure for this project. Data available in these
      measurement domains will allow the researchers to determine the: 1) frequency and severity
      of: a) symptom distress (fatigue, pain including chronic pain, aching, weakness, burning,
      tingling, numbness, anxiety, and depression) and pathological conditions (adhesive
      capsulitis, weakness and atrophy, neuropathy, scar/skin adhesions, lymphedema), b) physical
      impairments (diminished upper extremity and trunk range of motion/flexibility, strength,
      coordination and increased girth), and c) functional imitations and disabilities during the
      course of the medical treatment (loss of independence in or ability to perform routine
      activities of daily living i.e., grooming, bathing, dressing, driving an automobile, and in
      some cases, return to their regular work, recreational and social activities). 2) level of
      impairment at which these patients have lost independence in function and identity those
      patients at higher risk for the loss of independence in function (e.g., ADL's).
