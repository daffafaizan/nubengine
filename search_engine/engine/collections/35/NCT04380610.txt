      at one year. On the same day, participants will undergo clinical and laboratory variables
      important for developing an eGFR equation. From baseline data, the investigators will perform
      a training and validation cohort of biologically relevant predictor variables to develop a
      novel equation. Then the investigators will compare the novel SCA eGFR equation to the
      established eGFR equation. From one year data, the investigators will determine the
      longitudinal concordance between pediatric and adult novel and standard eGFR equations with
      mGFR and variables that may alter longitudinal inferences.

      In a subset of 30 adult participants, the investigators will also evaluate the correlation
      between mGFR using iohexol and a novel measure of mGFR that is more time efficient
