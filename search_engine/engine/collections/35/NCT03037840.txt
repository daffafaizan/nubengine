      patient will be already diagnosed with cancer. The doctor and the operator are responsible
      for the detecting. When cancer patients are exposure to the RF electromagnetic fields, the
      radial pulse amplitude, blood pressure, skin electrical resistance and breath will be
      monitored. Biofeedback parameters will be recorded at different modulation frequencies and
      analyzed in order to find the variation and tumor specific frequencies.
