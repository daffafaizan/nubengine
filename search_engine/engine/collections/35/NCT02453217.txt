    
      This pilot study will use a non-blinded parallel group clustered randomised controlled trial
      design.

      The study will be carried out by CPNs with community-dwelling people aged 18-65 who have a
      psychiatric diagnosis of SMI (i.e. schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, other psychotic
      disorder or bipolar affective disorder) and at the point of recruitment are being treated in
      the community. It will investigate the potential clinical impact of the use of the CHIP tool
      when used by CPNs with this patient group. Because the CHIP is designed to be used as both an
      enhanced physical health risk screening tool and as an instrument to direct appropriate
      clinical interventions the investigators will ask the patients' allocated CPNs to recruit
      consenting patients , collect outcome measure data and where appropriate use the CHIP tool
      with patients that they work with within their routine clinical practice.

      Primary objective:

      To test the potential efficacy and acceptability of the CHIP intervention compared to
      treatment as usual on patients' physical well- being over a 12 month period.

      Secondary objectives:

      To measure and compare changes in perceived mental well-being between the groups as measured
      at baseline, and at 6 months and 12 months after the start of the intervention.

      To establish differences in the objective physical health state of patients between the
      groups at 12 months as indicated by data routinely recorded in medical/outpatient/nursing
      notes during the duration of study.

      To establish changes in health behaviours and physical indicators of cardiovascular risk
      within the intervention group between baseline and 12 months after the start of the
      intervention.
