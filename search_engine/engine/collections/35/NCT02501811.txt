    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the feasibility,
      safety, and effect of Combo, MSCs alone, and c-kit+ cells alone compared with placebo as well
      as each other in subjects with heart failure of ischemic etiology. Following a successful
      lead-in phase, a total of one hundred forty-four (144) subjects will be randomized (1:1:1:1)
      to receive Combo, MSCs, c-kit+ cells, or placebo. After randomization, baseline imaging,
      relevant harvest procedures, and study product injection, subjects will be followed up at 1
      day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study product injection. All
      subjects will receive study product injection (cells or placebo) using the NOGA® XP Mapping
      and Navigation System. Subjects will have delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DEMRI)
      scans to assess scar size and LV function and structure at baseline and at 6 and 12 months
      post study product administration. All endpoints will be assessed at the 6 and 12 month
      visits which will occur 180 ±30 days and 365 ±30 days respectively from the day of study
      product injection (Day 0). For the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations,
      the Investigators will utilize an "intention-to-treat" study population, however an as
      treated analysis will also be conducted.
