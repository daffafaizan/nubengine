      different instruments mentioned above. The Resaflex wich use Quantum Molecular Resonance,
      through combination of different frequencies in the range of the radio-frequency, emit
      quantum in resonance and produce lesion and coagulation; The objective is to reach the
      ligamentum flavum doing lesions to diminish the stenosis caused by hypertrophic ligamentum
      over all in the recess area near the radicular nerve.

      To increase the security of the procedure the investigators introduce for the first time ,
      neurophysiological monitoring.
