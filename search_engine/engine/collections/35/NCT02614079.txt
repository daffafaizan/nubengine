      leads will be checked for proper positioning. Leads will be tested for appropriate
      paresthesia coverage of the patient's painful area(s), using multiple electrode
      configurations and lead positions (dependent on the location of the pain). After the leads
      are secured, the patient will be sent to the recovery room where the DSSEP test will be
      performed. A technologist will glue/tape recording electrodes to the patient's head, neck,
      back or legs. One or two stimulating electrodes are also placed on the patient's leg. Each
      electrode is checked with a meter to ensure proper functioning. Pulsing stimulus will start
      in one of the stimulating electrodes. Each time a different area is tested, the pulsing will
      be started again. Each area tested will take 10-15 minutes. The painful dermatomal
      distribution area, specific to each patient will be used for dermatomal SSEP stimulation.
      Placement will be correlated with nerve roots involved with the corresponding dermatomes.
      Measurements will be obtained to determine collision criteria.
