    
      VP4896 is a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that binds to and inactivates GnRH
      receptors on the pituitary gland. This decreases the amount of luteinizing hormone released
      by the pituitary. The hypothesis upon which this trial is designed is that luteinizing
      hormone is the cause of Alzheimer's disease. VP4896 decreases the amount of luteinizing
      hormone in the body and, therefore, may decrease or halt the progression of Alzheimer's
      disease.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, study designed to assess the safety and efficacy
      of VP4896 (a novel formulation of leuprolide acetate) in the treatment of subjects with
      mild-to-moderate AD. The study duration is 56 weeks. Approximately 555 participants will be
      recruited from approximately 80 sites in the United States, Canada, and South America.

      The study drug will be administered every eight weeks over a 48 week period. Male subjects
      randomized to active treatment will also receive testosterone replacement gel.

      The change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (cognitive test) score at Week 50 and ADCS-CGIC (global
      cognitive and behavioral measure) at Week 50 will be the primary efficacy endpoints. Safety
      will be assessed at all visits and by phone at Week 1.
