    
      Primary endpoint:

      To demonstrate in a prospective cohort study the feasibility (specimen extraction through
      rectum possible to perform or not), safety (complications graded according to Clavien-Dindo)
      and postoperative outcome (gastrointestinal quality of life questionnaire and anal sphincter
      manometry) of routine hybrid-NOTES transrectal anterior resection for benign indication in
      men and women.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  quality of life 6 months after surgery

        -  continence 6 months after surgery

        -  pain postoperative

        -  complication rate

        -  duration of procedure

        -  lengh of stay

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators expect specimen extraction through the rectum to be feasible in 80% of
      cases (in the others an alternative mini-laparotomy has to be performed).

      study design: This is an open cohort study on 60 patients. The patients are included before
      surgery and baseline parameters are put in a registry. There are clinical controls 6 weeks, 3
      and 6 months postoperative. 3 and 6 months postoperative as well as preoperative a anorectal
      manometry is performed.

      Inclusion criteria:

      - benign indication for left sided colectomy.

      exclusion criteria:

        -  age <18 years

        -  patient unable to understand informed consent or missing informed consent

        -  emergency surgery

      power calculation: A feasibility of 80% with a precision of 15% is estimated. Given a 5% drop
      out rate 36 patients are to be included in the study.
