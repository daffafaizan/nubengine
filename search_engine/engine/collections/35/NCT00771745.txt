      pre-transplantation in renal allograft recipients. Patients receiving pre-transplant
      Thymoglobulin will be evaluated for acute rejection (Banff '97 criteria), survival, and
      safety at 6 months. Overall the use of Thymoglobulin induction pre-transplantation will be
      safe and effective.
