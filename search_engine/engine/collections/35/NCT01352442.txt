      the well-established concept of small-aperture optics. In cameras, depth of focus is
      controlled by reducing the aperture through which light enters; the smaller the aperture, the
      greater the depth of focus. This concept also applies to the human eye. In the eye of an
      emmetropic presbyope, the natural lens cannot fully accommodate to focus the light rays from
      a near object onto a single point on the retina. Thus, a point object is imaged as a blur
      circle on the retina, and images of extended objects are degraded as well. If an opaque disc
      with a small aperture in the center is placed in front of the eye, the peripheral rays will
      be obscured while the central rays pass unaffected. Since peripheral rays enter the eye at a
      larger angle, they create a larger blur circle at the retinal image plane. Eliminating these
      peripheral rays reduces the size of the blur circle, improving image resolution.

      When the inlay is implanted in one eye, the increased depth of focus provides near and
      intermediate visual acuity while having a minimal effect on distance acuity. Under binocular
      conditions, the effect of having an inlay eye with a range of vision from distance to near
      combined with the uncorrected vision in the fellow presbyopic eye, which will essentially
      have good distance acuity with reduced near acuity, is similar to the contact lens modality
      known as "modified monovision."

      The ACI is expected to provide presbyopic patients with improvement in near and intermediate
      vision.
