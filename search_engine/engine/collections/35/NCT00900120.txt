        -  To establish a repository for long-term storage of DNA obtained from patients treated at
           the Cancer Institute of New Jersey.

        -  To establish a mechanism whereby investigators can analyze correlations between genetic
           polymorphisms and clinical outcomes (e.g., response to treatment).

      OUTLINE: Additional blood samples are collected for banking from patients while they are
      scheduled for routine blood draw as a part of their normal care. Samples are stored in a
      secure place under the control of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey Tissue Retrieval
      service. The samples may be used for DNA, RNA, or protein extraction and analyses, as well as
      generation of cell lines.

      Demographic data (ethnicity, race, age, and sex), diagnosis, family history, and previous
      treatments (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery) are recorded on the case report form and
      kept in a secure location in the Office of Human Research Services (OHRS).

      Patients may have their samples removed and destroyed at any time.
