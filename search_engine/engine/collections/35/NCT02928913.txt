      which is generally regarded as having deleterious effects on health. However, far less is
      known about its specific effects on bone health. Exercise has been proposed as a method of
      improving bone health, as impact forces generated as the foot contacts the ground during
      physical activity have the potential to aid bone maintenance and development.

      The properties of bone are regulated through the amount mechanical loading, frequency of
      loading and duration of loading endured, which can create an osteogenic effect. These
      variables can be quantified via accelerometry which records the magnitude, rate and duration
      of accelerations experienced at the site on the body where the accelerometer is worn.
      Although there is a vast amount of literature where accelerometers have been used to monitor
      physical activity, there is a lack of studies that use accelerometers to determine the most
      effective exercise for bone, especially in relation to the lumbar spine. Exploring the bone
      health and loading characteristics of sedentary and low and highly active non-sedentary
      individuals will provide evidence upon which to base future interventions that are likely to
      be of benefit for bone health in sedentary populations.
