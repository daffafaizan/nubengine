    
      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo- (inactive
      substance identical in appearance to study drug) and active-comparator-controlled (use of an
      approved drug to compare with study drug) study of guselkumab in participants with moderate
      to severe plaque-type psoriasis (scaly skin rash). The active comparator study drug is
      adalimumab, an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
      Participants who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in a
      2:1:2 ratio to one of three treatment groups (arms): Group I (guselkumab 100 mg dose
      regimen), Group II (placebo then crossover to guselkumab at Week 16), or Group III
      (adalimumab at standard psoriasis dosing). All participants will receive guselkumab every 8
      weeks (q8w) from Week 52 through Week 252 (open label treatment period).The end of the study
      is defined as the time the last participant completes the Week 264 visit. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 and
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 16. The total duration of the
      study will be approximately 268 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants will
      be monitored for safety throughout the study.
