      and malignant tumors are the main chronic diseases, which have been the most important cause
      of human death, consuming most health resources. In China, patients with cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular diseases account for more than 40% of all causes of death. After half a
      century of research, we have a thorough understanding of risk factors of cardiovascular
      disease, including genetics, aging, ethnicity, physical activity decreases, unbalanced
      nutrition and calorie intake, smoking, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and glucose
      abnormalities, etc. Many factors can be corrected through health education, indicating that
      the occurrence of chronic diseases can be prevented through lifestyle changes and the control
      of risk factors.

      This project collects risk factors of cardiovascular disease and establishes a real and
      reliable health database by conducting a cross-sectional survey of chronic diseases among
      residents of Tian Tong Yuan District (there are hundreds of thousands of people).On this
      basis, community health management network was established with internet technology.
      Meanwhile, prospective, open, community randomized and controlled lifestyle intervention
      studies were carried out. Intervention was conducted on risk factors of cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular diseases, such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, lipid metabolism disorder,
      and hyperglycemia. For patients with chronic diseases, lifestyle intervention and health
      education should be carried out to improve the diagnosis rate and control rate. The project
      focuses on the impact of lifestyle interventions and health education on risk factor control,
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, diabetes and all-cause death.
