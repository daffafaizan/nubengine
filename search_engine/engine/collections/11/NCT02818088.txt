      in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms and neuropsychological deficits in patients with
      OCD. Two groups (OCD and control) will be recruited. Both groups will undergo an intervention
      consisting of 8 weeks of cognitive training. Working memory, neuropsychological functioning
      and OCD symptomatology will be assessed pre and post-treatment, in both groups. Furthermore
      neuroimaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be conducted at baseline
      as well as at the end of the 8 week period in both groups. The scan will serve to show any
      structural or functional changes in the frontostriatal area involved with working memory. To
      our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to date to examine whether cognitive training
      improves symptoms in OCD.
