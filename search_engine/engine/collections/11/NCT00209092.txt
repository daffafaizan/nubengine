      response rates and to find out if the combination of docetaxel and capecitabine can shrink
      the size of breast tumors and preserve the breast.

      Induction chemotherapy offers the possibility of less surgery and determines tumor
      sensitivity in vivo. Previous trials have demonstrated that complete pathologic response in
      the breast at surgery corresponds with improved outcome. Additionally, we will correlate
      specific molecular markers in the breast tumors before and after chemotherapy, with response
      to treatment. Expression of these molecular markets may be used in the future to predict the
      likelihood of response to chemotherapy given post-operatively.
