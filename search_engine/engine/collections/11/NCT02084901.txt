      response of the arterial wall, facilitating re-endothelialization and minimizing the risk of
      thrombus formation and late restenosis. In the study, we are going to two biodegradable
      polymer stents, Orsiro and BioMatrix, especially regarding the stent strut coverage by
      optical coherence tomography at 3 months after stent implantation.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that Orsiro is non-inferior to
      Biomatrix in terms of stent strut coverage by optical coherence tomography at 3 months. The
      secondary endpoint is clinical outcomes up to 1 year.
