      replacement (TAVR) and has been linked to higher rates of morbidity and mortality.
      Supra-annular self-expanding valves have been linked to lower gradients and lower rates of
      patient prosthesis mismatch versus annular valves but they have not been directly compared.
      Patients with small annuli are particularly vulnerable to PPM, therefore, the aprior
      hypothesis is that implantation of supra-annular valves for small annuli may show differences
      in PPM rates and outcomes when compared to annular valves.
