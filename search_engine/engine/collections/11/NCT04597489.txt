      angiography-guided treatment strategies in a large, real-world patient cohort, including
      patients with different stages of coronary artery disease as well as patients with acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS). All patients were followed for a period of 3 years after the index
      date. The analysis period extended from the individual index date to the date of death or the
      end of the 3-year follow-up period. Patients were matched for sex, presence of acute coronary
      syndrome, age Â± 5 years, and propensity scores estimated with logistic regression based on 72
      variables , with each FFR patient matched to the closest angiography-only patient
