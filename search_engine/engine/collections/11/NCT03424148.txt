      to 65 years who desire laser treatment for the improvement of rhytides, lentigines,
      pigmentation, erythema, telangiectasia, pore size and skin texture. Subjects may undergo a

      period per Investigator discretion. Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments, spaced 6
      weeks (± 4 weeks) apart. Subjects will be contacted by phone 7 days (± 2 days) after their
      first treatment for follow-up. Subjects will return to the site after final study treatment
