      number of admissions (about 120.000) in France. It mainly affects young adults and is
      associated to fewer complications and to a short length of stay. The notion of outpatient
      refers to a shorter hospital length to stay i.e. less than 12 hours without an overnight
      hospitalization. This notion came from 3 learned society recommendations' (SFCD, ACHBT, and
      AFCA) and has been considered as a national priority.

      There is no consensus about appendectomy in an outpatient setting.
