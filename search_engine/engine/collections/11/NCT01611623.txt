      effects in cells in in vitro studies of SNX-5422, supporting inhibition of Hsp90 as the
      mechanism of action for this compound. SNX-5422 has demonstrated significant antitumor
      activity in mouse xenograft models of human tumors, including breast (BT474, MX-1), colon
      (HT29), prostate (PC3), and melanoma (A375) with multiple oral dosing regimens. This study
      will employ critical risk management features including the use of the NCI Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, which provides a scale for consistently
      grading the severity of AEs, toxicity criteria analyses for dose escalation, frequent
      laboratory and clinical observations, correlation of AEs with plasma concentrations of drug,
      monitoring of the QTc interval at appropriate time points, and a conservative dose-escalation
      scheme.
