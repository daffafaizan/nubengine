      surfactant either through the ECALMIST or the InSurE methods. The attending neonatologist or
      neonatal team will have full discretion to decide when to intubate and when to extubate or
      wean the infant off the ventilator or NCPAP.

      General guidelines for reintubation include persistent pH<7.20, PaCO2 > 65 mmHg, very
      frequent apnea (>2-3/hour of apneic or bradycardic spells not responsive to corrective
      therapy), frequent desaturations >3/hour not responding to increase in FiO2 or increase in
      FiO2 to 100%), or apneas requiring prolonged PPV. For the purpose of the study a successful
      outcome for the primary objective will have occurred if the infant has not been reintubated
      and ventilated during the initial 3 days of life.
