      prospective study. Before PCI and at 24 month follow up fasting blood will be collected for
      glucose, HbA1c, C peptide, lipid profile assessment. Patients' baseline demographic
      characteristics, medical history, and procedural data will be collected during the index
      hospitalization and at 24 month follow up. Patients will be divided in groups according to
      HbA1c - control group (HbA1c<5.7) and prediabetic patients (HbA1c 5.7-6.4). PCI will be
      performed in accordance with the guidelines. After successful treatment of the culprit lesion
      IVUS will be done. Following PCI and IVUS patients with prediabetes will be randomly assigned
      in groups either receiving metformin at a dose of 2000 mg once daily plus standard lifestyle
      recommendations or standard lifestyle recommendations only. Intravascular ultrasound analysis
      will be repeated 24 months after the initial PCI.
