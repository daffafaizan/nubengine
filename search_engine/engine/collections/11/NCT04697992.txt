      groups; 30 each. clinical grading according to sheth et al.,2014 , dermoscopic evaluation,
      visual analogue score (VAS) and DLQI were done at week 0. Group A one side was treated with
      vit.c 20% + microneedling, other side saline+ microneedling (placebo). group B one side was
      treated with tranexamic acid 5mg/ml + microneedling, other side saline+ microneedling
      (placebo). A total of 4 sessions were done 2 weeks apart and follow up was one month after
      the last session (week 10) at which patient was evaluated using above mentioned parameters in
      addition to evaluation by 2 blinded investigators. At week 10 there was significant
      improvement of clinical grading and as evaluated by blinded investigators, VAS, DLQI,
      significant dermoscopic improvement in both vascular and pigmentary components of dark halos
      in sides treated with vit c and tranexamic acid compared to placebo but there was no
      statistically significant difference between both groups. The study concluded that tranexamic
      acid is a new safe effective modality in treatment of periorbital hyperpigmentation with
      results comparable to vitamin C.
