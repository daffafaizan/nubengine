      people information about health topics.

      Eligibility:

      Design:

        -  Before the study visit, participants will answer some questions online about themselves,
           their experiences, and their thoughts about their weight.

        -  During the study visit, participants will watch a short scene from a movie, and then
           answer questions about it.

        -  Participants will have a simulated doctor visit with a computerized, virtual reality
           doctor. They will answer more questions about themselves, their experiences, and their
           thoughts about their weight. Then they will answer questions with researchers.
