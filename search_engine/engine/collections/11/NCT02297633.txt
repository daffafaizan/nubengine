      the total reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) content in blood so as to evaluate the overall
      level of oxidative stress in the human body .Our previous studies have established the method
      of detecting ROMs which is suitable for fully automatic biochemical analyser.Our study
      through the long-term observation followed up for 2 years to find the change of the COPD
      patients blood ROMs, systematically evaluate the relationship between ROMs and the severity
      of COPD. Evaluate the differences of prognosis between the different oxidative stress level
      (according to the level of ROMs are divided into higher and normal phenotype). Explore the
      new oxidative stress evaluation index ROMs application value in COPD.
