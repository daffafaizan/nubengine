      are committed to taking their medications as prescribed (medication adherence). For maximum
      benefit, researchers found that patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat HIV
      infection and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection have need consistent,
      high levels of adherence for maximum benefit. However, some patients struggle to take their
      HIV-related medications regularly and that can lead to losing on the benefits the medication
      can provide - either suppressing the HIV infection so people do not get sick from it or
      transmit it, or failing to prevent infection when someone is exposed.

      Objectives: Conduct an evaluation of USE-MI to assess accuracy, robustness, acceptability of
      the system.

      All subjects will continue to take their ART or PrEP medication as prescribed by their
      regular doctor. The USE-MI system is being developed as a behavioral intervention to enhance
      medication adherence. In the pilot phase, the investigators plan to enroll 10 subjects to use
      the USE-MI system for 1 month to get initial feedback about the system. In the second phase,
      up to 50 subjects will begin using the USE-MI for up to 6 months to assess accuracy,
      robustness and acceptability of the system.
