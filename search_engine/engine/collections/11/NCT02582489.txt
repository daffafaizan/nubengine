      improvements in subjective, patient reported outcomes in patients with existing knee OA.
      Unfortunately these studies were largely uncontrolled, underpowered, and/or retrospective in
      nature. Additionally, a recent prospective, randomized clinical study of allograft
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected at a separate time point post surgical intervention
      has highlighted the ability of MSCs to increase meniscal volume and improve knee pain
      following injection.

      This will be the first study to examine the effects of autograft BMAC intra-articular
      injection in a single-stage procedure and in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion.
      The results of this study, if the null hypothesis is rejected, will have far-reaching
      implications for the standard of care in meniscal treatment and on OA progression in the
      knee. Additionally, if the results of this study are favorable in reduction of OA progression
      this study will change the surgical approach to all axial, synovial joints including the
      shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, and ankle.
