      hemoglobin-the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People with thalassemia often
      experience fatigue, shortness of breath, and pain. There have been no previous research
      studies that have fully examined pain levels in people with thalassemia, and as a result, the
      sources of pain remain unknown. This study is a substudy of the Assessment of Pain study,
      which is a Thalassemia Clinical Research Network (TCRN) study that is examining the
      prevalence and severity of pain in people with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and
      non-transfusion-dependant thalassemia. This study will enroll a subset of participants from
      the Assessment of Pain study who have transfusion-dependant thalassemia. The purpose of this
      study is to examine whether pain varies during the blood transfusion cycle and whether the
      length of the transfusion cycle affects pain levels in people with transfusion-dependent
      thalassemia.

      Participants will complete daily questionnaires through an automated telephone system to
      assess pain levels during three blood transfusion cycles. Each transfusion cycle will last
      between 2 to 4 weeks, depending on the individual needs of the participant, and the cycles
      will be separated by at least 3 months but no more than 4 months. Prior to each transfusion
      cycle, study researchers will review participants' medical records for certain blood level
      measurements.
