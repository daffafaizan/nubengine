      RFs during resting and forceful respiration. Investigators applied either the CCO rib splint
      or the ER splint to the RF subjects in a randomized order. At 30 minutes after splint
      application, investigators repeated the VAS assessments during resting and forceful
      respiration. Subsequently, additional pain control was provided via intravascular drug
      injection.
