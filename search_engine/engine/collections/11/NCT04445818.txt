    
      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three arms: More Appreciation
      (MA), Less Criticism and Fruit and Vegetable (FV) group. Clusters, mostly schools, are the
      unit of random allocation to one of the three arms. Participants from all three arms will be
      assessed a total of four times, i.e. baseline (before the intervention workshop; (T1),
      immediate post-workshop (T2), 2-week post-workshop (T3) and 6-week post-workshop (T4).

      "Fruit and vegetable consumption" is a subsidiary study to the More Appreciation and Less
      Criticism (MALC) Project. The study will take advantage of the cluster RCT design adopted by
      the MALC study, and aims at testing the active HAPA-based intervention (increasing fruit and
      vegetable intervention) delivered to the MALC control group. The fruit and vegetable group
      will serve as the intervention arm, and the groups that received interventions regarding
      increasing appreciation or decreasing criticism, served as the control arms.
