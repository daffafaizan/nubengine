      completed to establish safety and efficacy data prior to proceeding with a phase III study.
      The phase II trial will enroll 110 patients that are undergoing elective ERCP as outpatients.
      Following the phase II portion, if the data suggests that the intervention arm (high volume
      group) is safe, the investigators will begin enrolling patients who are undergoing ERCP in a
      more urgent setting as inpatients.

      We plan on enrolling 1,400 consecutive high risk patients undergoing ERCP. We are assuming a
      baseline PEP risk of 9.2%. Fluid administration will be based on Ideal Body Weight (IBW) in
      order to standardize the aggressive fluid administration across all body weights and reduce
      the potential for adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes.

      All participants will be monitored for 90 minutes following their procedure to assess the
      development of any adverse symptoms. Analysis by a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will
      take place throughout the study. The DSMB is comprised of a panel of experts independent of
      NorthShore University HealthSystem.
