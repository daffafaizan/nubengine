      reduction forceps in the reduction of isolated mandibular fractures.

      10 patients complaining of isolated mandibular fractures in need of open reduction and
      internal fixation underwent reduction using bone reduction forceps.

      The patients followed up clinically after 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.
      Radiographic evaluation will be performed by computed tomography (CT) preoperatively, and
      cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) will be done after 3 and 6 months
