    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Tumor size and number are confirmed prior to
      randomization. Patients are stratified by participating institution.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. One group is treated with
      fractionated whole-brain irradiation using megavoltage equipment.

      The second group receives stereotactic radiosurgery plus fractionated whole-brain
      radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery involves irradiation of all tumors to the margins on
      stereotactic computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Either treatment may be
      administered first; the second treatment begins within 1 month of the first.

      Concurrent anticonvulsants and steroids are allowed. Patients are followed for change in size
      and number of tumors at 1, 3, and 6 months; follow-up clinical exams are performed at least
      every 2 months.
