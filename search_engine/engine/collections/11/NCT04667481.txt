      INTERVENTION GROUPS: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 interventional arms.

      ARM I: Patients participate in aerobic exercise (AE) sessions 3 times per week for 12 weeks.
      After 12-weeks, non-responders participate in combined AE and resistance exercise (RE)
      sessions for an additional 12 weeks, while responders continue participating in the AE
      sessions alone for an additional 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients participate in RE sessions 3 times per week for 12 weeks. After 12-weeks,
      non-responders may participate in a further 12-weeks of combined AE and RE sessions, while
      responders continue participating in the RE sessions alone for an additional 12 weeks.

      CONTROL GROUP: After 24 weeks, patients receive a digital copy of the 12-week AE sessions and
      12-week RE sessions and an outline of sessions for 24 weeks.
