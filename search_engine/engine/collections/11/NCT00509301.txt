    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To confirm the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
           131I-chTNT-1/B MAb (Cotara®) when given as a single 25 hour interstitial infusion in
           patients with recurrent GBM

        -  To characterize the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of Cotara®

      OUTLINE:

      This is an open-label, dose escalation study of Cotara®.

      All patients will receive 3 mCi of Cotara® for biodistribution and radiation dosimetry
      purposes. In addition, patients will receive escalating therapeutic dose levels of Cotara®
      for confirmation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed for a minimum of 12 weeks and until disease progression.
