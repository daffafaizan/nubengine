      on socioeco- nomic factors and age. in the context of a decreased trend in H. pylori
      prevalence, at least 50% of the world's hu-man population are carriers of the microorganism,
      with a prevalence much higher in developing countries than in developed countries. H. pylori
      infection was evaluated in 286 Egyptian school children, and the overall prevalence was >
      72%. Acquisition of the infection occurs mostly in early childhood; therefore, a better
      understanding of the epidemiology and the risk factors associated with H. pylori infection in
      the pediatric population is important to clarify the natural history and complications of the
      infection and programming eradication strategies.

      Currently, little data exist regarding the epidemiology of H. pylori associated infection in
      our region., especially in children. Therefore, this study aims to determine the prevalence
      of H. pylori among children.
