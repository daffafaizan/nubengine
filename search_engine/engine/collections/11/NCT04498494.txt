      visible on electrocardiograms (ECGs). The aim were to investigate ECG findings in acute
      myocarditis, ECG findings associated with fulminant myocarditis (FM), and the characteristics
      of ST elevation at admission. A retrospective analysis of 1814 ECGs was conducted from 274
      consecutive patients with acute myocarditis aged â‰¥13 years, who were hospitalized in two
      centres between August 2007 and November 2019. All ECG obtained during the hospital course
      were evaluated by 2 electrophysiologists. A chi-square test was used to evaluate and compare
      the abnormal ECG findings between the FM and non-FM groups, and multivariate logistic
      regression analysis was performed to further evaluate ECG findings associated with FM. The
      Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the duration of cardiac symptoms before admission for
      ST elevation at admission.
