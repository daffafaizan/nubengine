      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
      arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, as a treatment for active TED. In vitro data have
      shown that transformation of orbital fibroblasts into adipocytes is mediated by
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and a case report suggests that COX-2 inhibition can improve TED in
      the acute phase. Thus, the investigators intend to evaluate the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition
      in the treatment of active TED and its ability to improve both the acute inflammatory signs
      and more permanent fibrotic changes of quiescent disease. The investigators will enroll
      patients with active TED and treat them for 3 months (a characteristic period of disease
      activity) and compare this to standard treatments for mild active TED (observation, with over
      the counter interventions such as lubrication with artificial tears) to assess efficacy.
