      replacing the molecular analyses on tumour tissue obtained by biopsy (for example the search
      for somatic mutations of cancer) by a simple blood test (liquid biopsy). The other current
      important challenge is to have an idea of the interest to analyse the kinetics of blood
      markers, in particular in answer to a clinical "event", either through the chemotherapy, a
      biopsy and / or surgery. There is almost no data in the literature on this aspect. It is very
      likely that the liberation in the blood of the blood tumoral markers is strongly dependent on
      medical interventions on the tumour.

      The study ALCINA 2 rests exactly on the principle of small cohorts, which correspond each to
      a clinical situation and/or a technique of different implemented detection, so as to generate
      data of feasibility and proof of concept. In case of success, statistical hypotheses will be
      necessary for the implementation of wider studies (being then the object of a specific
      approval by competent authorities).
