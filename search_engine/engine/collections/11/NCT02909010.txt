      sedatives to ensure comfort and proper adaptation to mechanical ventilation. An important
      requirement for an adequate sedation is frequent and proper assessment of its depth.
      Inadequate sedation can lead to problems of over-sedation, under-sedation and/or delirium in
      ICU, especially in elderly patients. The main objective od the study is To compare the total
      dose of sedative use and the rate of over-sedation in patients over 65 years admitted to the
      ICU, adjusting sedation by monitoring with BISÂ® versus monitoring with the exclusive use of
      sedation scales. METHODS. A randomized, clinical trial including patients over 65 years who
      were admitted to the ICU affected with medical or surgical pathology of non neurological
      etiology who required sedation for more than 24 hours to maintain adaptation to mechanical
      ventilation. Patients were randomized into two groups: the intervention group using BIS
      monitoring to adjust sedation in order to maintain values between 50-60 and; the control
      group in which sedation was adjusted with the exclusive use of Richmond Agitation-Sedation
      Scale (RASS) to maintain RASS -2. The study was approved by the institution's Research Ethics
      Committee.
