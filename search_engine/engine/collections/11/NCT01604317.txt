      preterm/low birth weight infants randomized to receive WHO thermoregulation care and a
      plastic bag (without drying) covering the torso and lower extremities (control group) or WHO
      thermoregulation care and a plastic bag (without drying) covering the torso, upper and lower
      extremities, and a portion of their head (intervention group). The axillary temperature of
      each infant will be taken initially within 15 minutes of birth and later at 1 hour after
      birth as the infant is removed from the plastic bag. Seizures, hyperthermia, room
      temperature, and death will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With
      an estimated baseline hypothermia rate of 41% and a 21% absolute risk reduction (51% relative
      risk reduction), a sample size of 182 will be used to have a power of 80% and a confidence
      interval of 95%.
