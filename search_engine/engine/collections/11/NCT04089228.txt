      were treated with Integrated neuromuscular inhibition technique (Muscle energy Technique,
      sustain pressure, Strain counter-strain) while Kinesio tape was applied after INIT in only
      experimental group. Study duration was of 6 months. Individuals having age between 20-40
      years, upper trapezius active or latent trigger points, limited side bending were included in
