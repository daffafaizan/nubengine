      or intratumor injection, followed by Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy starting 24 hours
      later (day 2), and up to completion of 7 weeks, i.e. 70 Grays, 2Grays/fraction. Patients
      whose tumor has completely shrunk will be followed for the post-radiotherapy evaluation up to
      the End of Treatment visit. Those patients whose tumor has not shrunk more than 50% of the
      baseline size, will stop the radiotherapy and may have a salvage tumor surgery. Then, all
      patients will be followed every 8 weeks, for the safety evaluation and cancer disease status
      until the end of the study.
