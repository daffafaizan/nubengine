      but also of non systemic therapy like topical therapy.

      The normalcy of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA axis) of patients with chronic skin
      diseases like atopic dermatitis, pemphigus or psoriasis which are treated with topical
      steroids, will be assessed with the low dose (1mcg) adrenocortocotropin ( ACTH) stimulation
      test. During this test serum cortisol levels are measured before, 30 and 60 mn after
      intravenous administration of 1mcg of ACTH (synacthen).The results will be compared with age
      and sex matched subjects with normal HPA axis as assessed by low dose ACTH stimulation test.
