      which is accompanied by hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, lower HDL cholesterol and
      hypertriglyceridemia.(Ford, et al., 2003,Grundy, 1999)_ENREF_4 MetS increases the risk of
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease by 1.7- and 5-folds, respectively.(Alberti,
      et al., 2009,Ford, et al., 2003,Galassi, et al., 2006) MetS is heritable and polygenic.(Maes,
      et al., 1997) Genetic variability contributes to 16%-85% of changes in Body Mass Index
      (BMI)(Yang, et al., 2007) and 37%-81% in waist circumference (WC) (e.g.(Ochs-Balcom, et al.,
      2011)). MetS is a major public health concern, increasing all-cause mortality rates,
      disability and health care costs.(Appels and Vandenbroucke, 2006,Bender, et al.,
      2006,Colditz, 1999,Doig, 2004,Ferrucci and Alley, 2007,Hill, et al., 2004,Solomon and Manson,
      1997,Stevens, 2000,Wolf and Colditz, 1998) Obesity is implicated in the etiology of vitamin D
      deficiency. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration correlates inversely with
      adiposity.(Beydoun, et al., 2010,Dorjgochoo, et al., 2012) Conversely, vitamin D3 may play a
      role in obesity by modulating intracellular calcium homeostasis, because higher intracellular
      calcium triggers lipogenesis and suppresses lipolysis.(Zemel, 2003) Many organs express
      vitamin D receptor (VDR), a part of the nuclear hormone receptor super-family. The
      VDR-1,25(OH)2D3 complex modulates transcription of vitamin D responsive genes(Kato, 2000) and
      influences adipocyte differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.(Wood, 2008) Epidemiological
      studies have shown associations of VDR gene polymorphisms with adiposity and related
      metabolic disorders.(Filus, et al., 2008,Grundberg, et al., 2004,Gu, et al.,
      2009,Ochs-Balcom, et al., 2011,Oh and Barrett-Connor, 2002,Ortlepp, et al., 2001,Ortlepp, et
      al., 2003,Speer, et al., 2001,Ye, et al., 2001) However, studies specifically examining
      adiposity outcomes either had small sample sizes (<400), (e.g.(Filus, et al., 2008,Grundberg,
      et al., 2004,Speer, et al., 2001)) or were restricted to one sex, (e.g. (Grundberg, et al.,
      2004,Ochs-Balcom, et al., 2011)) but more importantly were all cross-sectional or
      case-control by design.(Filus, et al., 2008,Grundberg, et al., 2004,Gu, et al.,
      2009,Ochs-Balcom, et al., 2011,Oh and Barrett-Connor, 2002,Ortlepp, et al., 2001,Ortlepp, et
      al., 2003,Speer, et al., 2001,Ye, et al., 2001) MEGALIN (aka low-density lipoprotein
      receptor-related protein-2 [LRP-2]), is the endocytic vitamin D-binding protein receptor
      which allows vitamin D entry into cells and whose expression is directly regulated by both
      vitamin D (Gressner, et al., 2008)) and vitamin A.(Liu, et al., 1998) MEGALIN may influences
      obesity by mediating leptin transport through the blood-brain barrier and modulating leptin
      signaling,(Dietrich, et al., 2008) or by facilitating transcytosis of its precursor hormone
      thyroglobulin.(Lisi, et al., 2005) Collectively, leptin and thyroid hormones affect adiposity
      through energy metabolism regulation.(Beydoun, et al., 2011) MEGALIN acting also as the
      receptor for sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) may play a role in the interaction between
      estrogen, vitamin D and intracellular calcium in adipocytes, resulting in sex-specific
      effects of MEGALIN polymorphisms on obesity phenotypes.(Ding, et al., 2008) In this study, it
      is hypothesized that selected polymorphisms in VDR and MEGALIN genes have sex-specific
      associations with several key metabolic disturbances in a longitudinal study of
      African-American urban adults.
