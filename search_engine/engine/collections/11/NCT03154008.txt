      regulation of mood-congruent, sad stimuli will be assessed in a sample of adolescents with
      depression prior to group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT will follow the Adolescent
      Coping with Depression Course, an established 16-session group treatment protocol, and
      consist of behavioral activation, relaxation skills, cognitive therapy, social skills,
      problem solving, and relapse prevention. Changes in symptoms will be monitored through
      biweekly self-report and clinician ratings to examine prediction of change in symptoms across
      CBT. Baseline individual differences in reward responsiveness and emotion regulation will be
      evaluated as predictors of change in self-reported symptoms and clinician-rated improvement
      following CBT.
