      (ASCVD). The National Cholesterol Education Program estimates that 65 million Americans with
      hypercholesterolemia could be treated with diet and exercise alone. Flaxseed is a potential
      component of cholesterol-reducing diet regimens. Flaxseed contains significant amounts of
      soluble fiber and is a rich source of both alpha-linolenic acid and phytoestrogenic ligands,
      which have been implicated in the prevention of ASCVD. However, flaxseed's phytoestrogenic
      ligands may have undesirable hormonal effects. This study will systematically evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of ground flaxseed ingestion in both men and women with
      hypercholesterolemia.

      Participants will be randomized to receive flaxseed or a matching wheat bran control. The
      test dose of flaxseed will be 40 grams administered in baked products (muffins, bread, or
      bars). The first 6 study weeks are a diet stabilization phase, followed by a 10-week study
      phase in which participants are expected to eat two servings of the test food daily. Blood
      and urine are collected for analysis, which will include measurement of low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), post-prandial triglycerides, and urinary isoprostane
      secretion.
