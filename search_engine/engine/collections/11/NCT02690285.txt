      energy failure with the life of expectancy of affected children severely truncated. Treatment
      of PDCD remains a serious, unmet challenge. Dichloroacetate (DCA) represents the first
      targeted therapy for PDCD by stimulating residual PDC activity. Cumulative experience with
      DCA has revealed dose accumulation in a subset of the population. This can be abated through
      personalized dosing of DCA, assigned by haplotype variation in the gene encoding glutathione
      transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), which biotransforms DCA to glyoxylate. Haplotype variations in
      GSTZ1 influence the kinetics and dynamics of chronically administered DCA. A single dose of
      DCA has a bioavailability approaching unity and is widely distributed throughout the body.
      The plasma half-life (t ½) is ~1 hr in drug-naïve subjects. Gender does not influence DCA
      kinetics or metabolism. The major route of biotransformation is via dehalogenation to
      glyoxylate by glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1). DCA is a mechanism-based inhibitor of
      GSTZ1, so repeated administration results in increased plasma t ½ and decreased clearance.
