      enrolled and assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months later. Non ambulant patients will be
      assessed using the modified version of the Hammersmith Motor Functional Scale while ambulant
      patients will be assessed using the extended module of the Hammersmith Motor Functional Scale
      and timed items, the 6 minute walk and a step activity monitor. All patients will also be
      assessed using the Motor Function Measure (MFM), that covers the whole range of activities
      for both ambulant and non ambulant patients. All measures will undergo a process of
      validation including inter observer reliability. This information will be most valuable for
      any future trial and will make the groups involved ready to participate to future
      collaborative studies saving a lot of time on the preliminary aspects (validation,
      reliability, training) that will be fulfilled by the present study. The study will also
      provide natural history data for a 12 month period on patients with SMA II and III.
