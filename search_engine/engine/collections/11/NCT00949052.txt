      Primary

        -  Determine whether genetic susceptibility (e.g., inherited differences in radiation
           sensitivity to normal tissue or genes of xenobiotic metabolism, nucleotide provision, or
           DNA repair) to the carcinogenic effects of radiotherapy, tobacco, and UV light modifies
           the risk of second malignant neoplasms (SMN) in patients with cancer treated with
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      Secondary

        -  Measure inherent sensitivity to radiotherapy via G_2 chromosome radiation sensitivity
           assay using B-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from pre-HSCT cryopreserved
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with and without SMN.

        -  Measure the frequency of allelic variants of genes involved in xenobiotics metabolism,
           DNA repair, and provision of nucleotide pool and compare the frequencies among patients
           with and without SMN, determine the transmission of specific alleles of these genes from
           parents to patients, and correlate allelic variants of DNA repair and nucleotide
           provision in genes with in vitro radiation sensitivity.

        -  Evaluate the role of potentially carcinogenic environmental exposures (tobacco and sun
           light) pre- or post-HSCT in the risk of SMN and examine the association of these
           exposures with SMN and the interaction of these exposures with allelic variants of genes
           involved in xenobiotic metabolism, nucleotide provision, and DNA repair.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete self-reported questionnaires and medical records are reviewed to
      collect information on UV light and tobacco exposure pre- and post-transplantation.
      Information is analyzed for association with second malignancy neoplasms.

      Blood samples are collected from patients pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and
      from their parents (when available) or other first-degree relatives for genetic biomarkers of
      susceptibility to second malignancies, DNA repair and provision nucleotide, genetic
      susceptibility to toxicity from combined cancer therapies, and environmental carcinogens.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients (800 patients without second malignant neoplasms
      [SMN] and 200 patients with SMN) will be accrued for this study.
