      fatigue, and mood disturbances. Mobile health exercise interventions are promising strategy
      to prevent physical function decline and improve fatigue and mood disturbances, but older
      patients with myeloid neoplasms receiving hypomethylating agents are understudied. The
      proposed study will evaluate a novel mobile health exercise intervention that is adapted to
      older patients with myeloid neoplasms receiving outpatient hypomethylating agents and
      investigate whether and how exercise can prevent physical function decline, improve fatigue
      and mood disturbances, and prevent worsening quality of life.
