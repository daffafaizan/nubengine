    
      The absence of clear PD subtypes defining a common path and rate of disease progression,
      combined with the absence of validated biomarkers indicative of disease progression and a
      strong placebo effect, constitute a challenge for clinical trials assessing new potential
      disease-modifying therapies in PD.

      The present cohort would constitute a well-defined population of patients, with individual
      progression assessment, suitable to evaluate new disease-modifying therapies in a subsequent
      Phase1/2 clinical trial.
