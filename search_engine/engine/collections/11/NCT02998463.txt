      This has been demonstrated to reduce neonatal morbidity, mortality, and inpatient stays for
      low birth weight and preterm infants (Charpak and Ruiz 2016).

      This study examines the effect a facilitating garment, the SnubyÂ® has on neonatal health
      outcomes associated with skin-to-skin contact, such as neonatal thermoregulation,
      breastfeeding status, and self-reported mother-infant bonding. It uses a mixed methods
      approach to address quantitative and qualitative outcomes including participant's
      perspectives, and measurable health markers.
