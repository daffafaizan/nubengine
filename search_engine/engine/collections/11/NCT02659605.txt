      above vs. below the perineum, in infants who are born via pre-term spontaneous vaginal
      deliveries that are vigorous at delivery. Delayed cord clamping below the perineum is an
      accepted clinical practice in obstetrics and gynecology; however, delayed cord clamping above
      the perineum has not yet been studied in preterm infants. Delayed cord clamping above the
      perineum will provide the benefit of immediate skin-to-skin contact between the mother and
      her newborn.

      Patients will have delayed cord clamping performed for 60-75 seconds either below the
      maternal perineum or while the infant is placed on the mother's abdomen. At approximately 24
      hours after delivery (at the time of infant heel stick for routine, state-mandated screening
      tests), a small additional amount of blood will be collected to evaluate newborn hematocrit.
