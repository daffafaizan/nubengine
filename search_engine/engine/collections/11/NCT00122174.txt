      stress-busting program (SBP) for caregivers of patients with chronic neurological diseases
      including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Specific
      research objectives include: 1) Prospectively determine the effects of a SBP compared to a
      standard support group (SSG) on quality of life and immune response in caregivers of patients
      with chronic neurological diseases. Subjects will be tested at baseline, at completion of 4
      and 8 weeks of SBP or SSG, and at 2- and 4-month follow up sessions. 2) Determine subjects'
      relaxation response as well as their response to acute laboratory stressors using
      bioinstrumentation. Muscle tension, electrodermal response, skin temperature, blood volume
      pulse, and heart rate will be measured. Subjects will be tested at baseline, at completion of
      4 and 8 weeks of a SBP or SSG, and at 2- and 4-month follow up sessions. 3) Compare the
      effectiveness of SBP or SSG for adult children caregivers as compared to spousal caregivers
      based on quality of life measurements, immune parameters, and relaxation response. The
      proposed multimodal SBP will focus on a variety of approaches based on cognitive behavioral
      and relaxation response theories. SBP will consist of a 8-week program with 1ï¿½-hour sessions
      per week. The setting will be an educational support group with topics related to stress,
      stress and challenges of caregiving, depression, coping strategies, positive thinking, and
      taking time for oneself. In addition, subjects will be taught simple relaxation strategies
      that they can practice at home. Outcomes will be measured using psychosocial instruments as
      well as state-of-the science technology including bioinstrumentation and immune parameters to
      measure biological responses. Follow up testing will be done 2 and 4 months after the end of
      the SBP or SSG to determine the long-term effectiveness of the intervention.
