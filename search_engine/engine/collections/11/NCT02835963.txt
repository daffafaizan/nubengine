      management of the acute heart failure in the emergency department.

      The present study hypothesizes that identifying anamnestic and clinical criteria of AHF in
      patients admitted to emergency department for acute dyspnea would optimize the management of
      these patients upon arrival to the emergency department and to implement rapidly the
      appropriate therapeutic strategies.

      All patients admitted for dyspnea will be enrolled by the emergency physicians (after
      verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria) in the 3 participating centers.

      Then, all files will be analyzed retrospectively from information collected by a committee of
      experts cardiologists and emergency physicians of each center.

      The primary objective is the evaluation of diagnostic predictive value of different
      anamnestic and clinical signs for the diagnosis of AHF in emergency department for the
      construction of a clinical prediction score of acute heart failure. The secondary objective
      is the description of the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients admitted to the
      emergency for acute dyspnea.
