      sedated during electroencephalography (EEG). However, various sedatives and hypnotics affect
      the outcome of the review and is not shown. Chloral hydrate (CH) is widely used in children,
      but in this patients it is less effective.Recently, dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been tested
      because preliminary data suggests that this drug does not affect the EEG. The aim of the
      present work was to compare the electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern during CH or DEX sedation,
      to test the hypothesis that both drugs exert similar effects in EEG.Seventeen patients were
      evaluated during sedation with DEX or CH on separate occasions.The EEG was subjected to
      qualitative and quantitative analysis. Clinical variables were also compared.
