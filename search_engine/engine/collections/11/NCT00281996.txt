      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate and gemcitabine hydrochloride
           in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent pancreatic cancer.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 6-month and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate response with expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF
           receptor in tumor tissue from patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-14 and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8*. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
           up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 or 3 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      NOTE: *The first cohort receives gemcitabine hydrochloride on days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Phase II: Patients receive imatinib mesylate and gemcitabine hydrochloride at the MTD
           determined in phase I in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
