      therapeutic approach for hematologic neoplasms. After HSCT, patients have a compromised GI
      mucosal barrier and an altered microbiota, also called dysbiosis. The later could be due to
      conditioning or use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and could be accentuate by stress
      encountered by patients during their therapy management. Recent data have shown that
      alterations in the intestinal flora are associated with bad outcome, particularly with
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bacteremia, and reduced overall survival
      post-transplantation. How intestinal bacteria can modulate the risk of relapse after HSCT is
      yet unknown. The scientists hypothesize that the variation of some bacterial taxa may
      influence post-transplant immune reconstitution, particularly invariant Natural Killer T
      cells.
