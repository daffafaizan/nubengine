      treated and may be severe. Not only did perineal pain negatively affect the physical and
      mental functioning of the woman, but also it might decrease the success of breastfeeding and
      reduced her ability to care for her child. The methods of relieving perineal pain included
      medication and non-medication. When the perineal pain was mild, the most common analgesic
      used was acetaminophen. Whereas the perineal pain was more severe, other drugs had been
      chosen such as opioid, non-opioid, and a combination of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics
