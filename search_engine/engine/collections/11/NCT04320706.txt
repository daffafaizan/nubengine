      intranasally administered oxytocin, although it is unclear whether functional effects are
      mediated by the peptide directly entering the brain or indirectly via raising peripheral
      concentrations. The investigators hypothesize that one method of producing a similar pattern
      of increased peripheral oxytocin concentrations but without the possibility of direct entry
      into the brain would be to administer the peptide lingually. In the current double-blind,
      between-subject, placebo controlled study 80 healthy male subjects will be recruited and
      receive either oxytocin (24IU) or placebo control administered orally (lingual). 45 minutes
      after treatment subjects will be required to complete both face emotion and emotional scene
      processing tasks during fMRI scanning. After the tasks, subjects will be required to rate
      their valence, intensity and arousal response to the same emotional face and scene stimuli
      which were presented during MRI acquisition. Blood samples will be taken before and 30 min
      after the oral treatment interventions to assess oxytocin blood concentrations. All subjects
      will be asked to complete a range of questionnaires before treatment to control for possible
      pre-treatment confounders in terms of personality traits and mood: Beck Depression Inventory
      II (BDI), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Second Version of Social
      Responsiveness Scale(SRS-2), and Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).
