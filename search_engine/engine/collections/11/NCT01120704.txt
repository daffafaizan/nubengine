      cessation failure. However, little is presently known about how to improve adherence and
      whether improved adherence will actually boost cessation success (i.e., its causal role is
      unknown). This research represents groundbreaking integration of 1) basic theory and data on
      tobacco dependence, adherence, and intervention mechanisms with 2) the state-of-the-art
      Intervention Optimization Cycle methodology. This methodology uses factorial designs to
      efficiently engineer and evaluate intervention components, and to develop an optimal
      comprehensive treatment package. Participants in Project 3 will be smokers (N = 544) visiting
      primary care clinics for a regular outpatient visit who, when asked, express an interest in
      quitting and agree to participate in a smoking cessation research study. The experiment will
      comprise five experimental factors (2X2X2X2X2), and participants will have a 50% chance of
      being assigned one of the levels of each factor. The five factors include one medication
      factor (medication duration: 8 vs. 26 weeks), one counseling factor (maintenance counseling
      vs. no maintenance counseling), and three adherence factors: 1) Cognitive Medication
      Adherence Counseling (C-MAC); C-MAC vs. no C-MAC; 2) electronic medication monitoring device
      (the Helping Hand) + Feedback vs. the medication monitoring device alone; and 3) automated
      adherence prompting phone calls vs. no prompting.
