      I. To assess the initial effectiveness of the JeffQuit program on smoking cessation in cancer
      patients.

      II. To assess the quality of life improvements related to the JeffQuit smoking cessation
      program in cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo three, 1-hour group therapy sessions held by a JeffQuit practitioner over a
      1-month period. Patients receive strategies for managing the psychological, habitual, and
      physiological components of smoking and help with developing a planned quit date. Patients
      are also provided with advice on how to switch to cigarette brands with less nicotine and
      then how to substitute the nicotine patch and gum for cigarettes. The JeffQuit counselor is
      available for additional individual support as needed.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months.
