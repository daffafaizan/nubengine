    
      Chest pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department (ED). Cardiac testing
      in low-risk patients poses unnecessary costs and resource utilisation, which may in part be
      due to clinicians adopting a very-low-risk threshold for discharge without testing.

      The Chest Pain Choice (CPC) decision aid is a visual aid that was developed to facilitate
      shared decision-making between physicians and patients who present to the emergency
      department with chest pain, and has shown to be effective in increasing patient knowledge and
      decreasing the rate of admission to an observation unit for cardiac testing, among patients
      with chest pain who are at low risk for acute coronary syndromes. Shared decision making with
      the use of this visual aid has been shown in other centres to be associated with greater
      patient knowledge, greater patient involvement in decision making and less frequent
      admissions, with no increase in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) due to the intervention.

      The visual aid includes a brief description of what tests have been done thus far to assess
      the patient's risk of MACE, a graphic representation of the risk as calculated based on the
      HEART score, as well as the evaluation options available. The visual aid has been modified
      from its original form for the local context in terms of viable options for further
      evaluation.

      This study aims to assess if using a visual decision aid for shared decision making between
      physician and patient can safely help to decrease unnecessary admissions to the ED
      observation unit, as well as its impact on patient knowledge, satisfaction, as well as 30-day
      and 60-day Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE).
