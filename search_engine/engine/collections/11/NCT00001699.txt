      among adolescents (11-21 years) with HIV and 2) to obtain information about the adolescents
      and mothers' health beliefs and examine their relationship to the adolescents' adherence
      levels. This pilot study is designed to gather preliminary data about the feasibility of
      using several new measures with this population. To achieve these aims, a convenience sample
      of approximately 45 adolescents with HIV will be recruited. The adolescents and their mothers
      will complete a brief questionnaire about their health beliefs. A 24-hour recall interview
      format will be used to assess the adolescents' treatment adherence to prescribed oral
      medication. The adolescent will complete recall interviews on three random days over a two
      week period. Data analysis will be primarily descriptive, but will be used to generate more
      specific hypotheses for future research studies. The long-term goal of this research is to
      better identify adolescents with HIV at risk for non-adherence and design empirically derived
      interventions to improve their adherence levels. The health beliefs measure may also be
      useful in identifying irrational beliefs about the illness or treatment that can then be
      targeted for cognitive restructing in psychological interventions.
