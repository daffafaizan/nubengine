        1. Whether polymer-based markers can be adequately visualized on daily stereoscopic imaging
           compared to gold seed markers.

        2. Whether polymer-based markers are visible on ultrasound imaging.

        3. To determine if the polymer-based marker produces fewer artifacts on treatment planning
           CT scans than gold markers.
