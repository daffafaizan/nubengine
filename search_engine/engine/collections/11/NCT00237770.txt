      individuals with tetraplegia are generally able to be seated in an upright position for long
      periods of time without developing symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. It must be
      appreciated however, that orthostatic hypotension may occur unpredictably in persons with
      chronic tetraplegia. This may result in a range of symptoms due to cerebral hypoperfusion
      from mild reduction in mental acuity to loss of consciousness. Nitric oxide (NO) is the most
      potent endogenous vasodilator which is synthesized by the enzyme NO synthase (NOS) and may be
      largely responsible for orthostatic hypotension in individuals with immobilizing conditions.
      Recent evidence suggests an up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthases (NOS) activity
      with prolonged exposure to hind limb suspension. The effects of NOS inhibition during
      orthostasis on blood pressure regulation in those with chronic tetraplegia may provide
      insight into effective pharmacological therapy to reduce or prevent pathologic orthostatic
      changes. Treatment with a NOS inhibitor may facilitate the process of mobilization in those
      with acute higher cord lesions.
