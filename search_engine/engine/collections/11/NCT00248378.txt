      been small, generally not properly controlled, with results controversial, and difficult to
      interpret. Recently, investigators in the UK and US tested the ability of cannabinoids to
      control spasticity and tremor symptoms of the MS-like disease, experimental allergic
      encephalomyelitis, in mice (Baker et al, 2000). The authors found that four different
      cannabinoids quantitatively ameliorated both tremor and spasticity in diseased mice; thus
      providing rationale for patients' reports of the therapeutic effects of cannabis in the
      control of their MS symptoms.

      The present study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design of 30 patients
      who will be assessed before and after treatment for 3 consecutive days (Phase I), undergo
      washout-out for a total of 11 days, and then cross over to either the placebo or active
      treatment phase (Phase II), depending on what they received during Phase I. At each study
      visit, patients will utilize a controlled puff procedure to help ensure stable intake (Levin
      et al, 1989).

      Comparisons: A single dose of 4% THC marijuana cigarette each day for 3 days will be compared
      to a placebo administered under the same dosing conditions for the relief of spasticity, drug
      tolerability, and changes in global functioning and quality of life indices.
