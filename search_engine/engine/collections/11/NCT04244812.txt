    
      The Lung and Heart meridians are chosen as two specific studied meridians. Participants of
      chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) and healthy volunteers will be enrolled.

      120 participants will be included and divided into the healthy control group, chronic stable
      angina pectoris (CSAP) group and healthy intervention group. Laser doppler flowmetry (LDF)
      will be used to assess the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomena for the
      Heart and Lung meridians. The site specificity for the meridian-visceral association will be
      investigated by comparing the microcirculatory difference between the Heart and Lung
      meridians in the healthy control group and CSAP group. Besides, participants in the healthy
      intervention group will receive two sessions of moxibustion in the Heart meridian and Lung
      meridian respectively to explore the site specificity for the surface-surface association.
