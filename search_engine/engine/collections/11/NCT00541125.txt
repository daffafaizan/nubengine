      Primary

        -  Determine if primary prophylaxis comprising filgrastim (G-CSF) makes it possible to
           obtain neutropenia lower than grade 4 or a 30% decrease in fever in patients with
           metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line FOLFIRI and bevacizumab and who are
           homozygous for allele UGT1A1*28 (genotype 7/7), a promoter of the gene coding for enzyme
           UGT1A1.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the objective response rate at 6 months of treatment with FOLFIRI and
           bevacizumab according to RECIST criteria.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity (excluding neutropenia) of FOLFIRI and bevacizumab according to
           NCI-CTC v. 2.0.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
      minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1.
      Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 5-11. Treatment repeats every
      2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2-3 months for up to 5 years.
