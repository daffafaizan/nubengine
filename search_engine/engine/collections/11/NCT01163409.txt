      characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain or painful specific sites, usually accompanied
      by sleep disorders, fatigue, morning stiffness, chronic headaches, mental disorders and
      functional bowel. The diagnosis is essentially clinical, with no abnormal laboratory and
      radiological features Physical exercises are part of the treatment of fibromyalgia, but does
      not report studies in children. In general children with fibromyalgia are encouraged to a
      multidisciplinary treatment including medication, family education and child graduated
      aerobic exercise, psychotherapy, interventions to reduce pain, stress and improve sleep
      quality. To date no studies in medical literature with the use of acupuncture and supervised
      physical activity in juvenile fibromyalgia.

      The significant sample of this disease, our recent publications in this research and the lack
      of systematic study of physical activity and acupuncture have stimulated this research.
      Assess pain reduction and improvement in quality of life in children and adolescents with
      juvenile fibromyalgia.
