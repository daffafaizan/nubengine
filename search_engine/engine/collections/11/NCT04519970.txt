      providers routine labs are collected, including CMP, CD4, VL, and HIV resistance testing when
      indicated, healthcare benefits are reassessed, and the most recent ART regimen is restarted
      if the patient agrees to treatment. There may be characteristics of these regimens that may
      present barriers to sufficient adherence, or perform suboptimally in patients with certain
      immunologic and/or viral factors, which may impact virologic suppression, including multiple
      pills, drug-drug interactions, variable tolerability, low CD4, high VL, or low thresholds for
      resistance. Biktarvy is a Single Tablet Regimen (STR) with high potency and good tolerability
      that can be safely used in multiple patient groups, with features, including activity in
      patients with a history of multi-class resistance, that may facilitate immediate ART
      reinitiation among a broad population of patients reengaging in care in order to promote
      rapid virologic suppression. Addressing this important patient population with poor retention
      with support mechanisms to reengage in care and reinitiate effective ART immediately may
      improve retention in care and accelerate virologic suppression as likewise derived in
      immediate ART models in treatment-na√Øve patients, and represent a touchstone to drive
      sustainability in preventing new HIV transmissions in a high burden area to meet the goals of
      reducing HIV as a public health threat over the next 10 years.
