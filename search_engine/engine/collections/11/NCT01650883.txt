      protocols. USF clinic patients seen in the Rheumatology clinic, who meet criteria and have a
      baseline vitamin 25 OH D level of less than or equal to 32 mg/dL, will be randomized to two
      treatment arms. A Vitamin 25 OH D level of less than 32 mg/dL but above 20 mg/dL will be
      defined as insufficient. Similarly, a vitamin 25 OH D level of less than or equal to 20 mg/dL
      will be defined as deficient.

      Patients in arm one will be repleted with Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) at 5000 IU orally
      daily for 40 days. Arm two of this treatment protocol will consist of 50,000 IU
      cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) orally every 10 days starting on day 1 for 40 days. All subjects
      in both groups will receive a total dose of 200,000 IU of Vitamin D3 after 40 days of
      treatment. Each patient will also receive oral supplementation of 1200 mg daily calcium
      carbonate. Patients will return to clinic on day 40 (+/- 3 days) for a follow up serum
      vitamin 25 OH D and Calcium level. Compliance will be checked at that time with a pill count.

      Clinical Significance: This trial asks the question as to whether one oral repletion therapy
      is superior to another in a 40 day time period. Given that current standard of care is based
      on individual practitioner experience, it may be beneficial for a standard protocol.
