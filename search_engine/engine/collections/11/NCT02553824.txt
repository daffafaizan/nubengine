    
      Bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are serious mental disorders associated
      with adverse psychological and physical consequences. Treatment options to date offer limited
      success, leaving at least 50-70% of patients still symptomatic after treatment. The purpose
      of the study is to evaluate whether phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia), a medication currently
      FDA approved for the treatment of obesity, will demonstrate efficacy-compared to placebo-
      when re-purposed for patients with bulimia and binge eating.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two conditions: qsymia or Placebo. One condition
      will receive 3 months of phentermine-topiramate, a 2 week washout, then 3 months of placebo.
      The other condition will receive 3 months of Placebo, a 2 week washout, then 3 months of
      phentermine-topiramate. Participants will receive a total of 6 months of treatment and then
      have a 2 month follow-up off of medications.
