      high dose carboplatin, ifosfamide, and thiotepa with autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC) support and consolidation radiotherapy to sites of pretreatment bulk disease in
      patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer. II. Assess the toxicity of high dose
      chemotherapy in these patients. III. Compare the effectiveness of PBSC mobilization with high
      dose cyclophosphamide and filgrastim (G-CSF) vs G-CSF alone in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization
      groups at the discretion of the attending physician: Group 1: Patients receive high dose
      cyclophosphamide IV over 6 hours and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) daily beginning
      24 hours after completion of cyclophosphamide and continuing until 3 days after blood counts
      have recovered and until PBSC are harvested. Group 2: Patients receive G-CSF SQ daily alone
      until PBSC are harvested. Both groups: PBSC are harvested on days 15-19 after
      cyclophosphamide infusion or when blood counts recover. Patients receive high dose
      carboplatin IV continuously, ifosfamide IV over 4 hours, and thiotepa IV over 1 hour on days
      -5 to -3. PBSC are reinfused beginning 48 hours after completion of combination chemotherapy.
      Patients receive G-CSF SQ beginning on day 0 and continuing until 3 days after blood counts
      have recovered. Sites of pretransplantation metastases greater than 3 cm are irradiated
      beginning after transplantation and after blood counts recover. Patients are followed every
      month for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
