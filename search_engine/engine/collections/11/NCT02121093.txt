      peripheral afferents and cortical projections therapy, which are important in motor control.
      This study aims to determine the effects of different parameters on cortical frequency
      electric potential and electric potential muscle in healthy young adults. Will participate in
      the study 80 volunteers, these randomly divided into four groups for the experimental
      procedures. The methodological approach consists of an electroencephalographic and
      electromyographic evaluation before and after 15 minutes of application of vibration through
      a digital vibrating pad.
