      represents a spectrum of liver diseases. NAFLD is a major health problem in the US because of
      its high prevalence and causal relationship with serious liver abnormalities. However, the
      mechanism(s)responsible for developing NAFLD in obese persons and the effects on liver
      function are not known. This gap in knowledge has made it difficult to identify effective
      therapy. The results from these studies will lay the groundwork for the development of novel
      therapeutic interventions for NAFLD in obese patients.
