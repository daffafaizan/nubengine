    
      Between January 2018 and February 2022, the Brain Changes in Sleep Apnea Study will recruit
      80 adults with newly diagnosed severe sleep apnea attending the sleep clinics at Sunnybrook
      Health Sciences Centre (n=40) or the University of Edinburgh (n=40). Participants will
      undergo home-based assessment with 3 wearable devices (24 hours of ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring, 8 nights of actigraphy to assess sleep duration and fragmentation, and 1 night of
      finger-probe peripheral arterial tonometry and oximetry to assess cardiorespiratory
      physiology including sleep apnea), completion of a sleep and health questionnaire, 24-hour
      collection of urine for assessing sympathetic nervous system activity, blood banking for
      endothelial biomarkers, cognitive evaluation, pulse wave velocity test, and an MRI of the
      brain, at 2 time points: 1) after initial polysomnographic diagnosis of sleep apnea but
      before the initiation of CPAP, and 2) after 4 months of CPAP treatment.
