    
      The purpose of this double blinded Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of human
      umbilical cord tissue-derived mesencymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC), administered in two
      different dosing strategies, in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

      This study will be enrolling children with ASD, aging 4-11 years of age. Qualifying subjects
      will undergo neuropsychological evaluation, EEG testing, eye tracking, CVA assessments, and
      infusion of study product. Subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms; 1) a single
      infusion of 6.0x106 cells/Kg at baseline, followed by a blinded placebo infusion at six
      months or, 2) Placebo infusion at baseline, followed by an intravenous dose of 6x106 cells/Kg
      at six months.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the change in social communication skill from baseline
      to six months. The potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the
      product (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling
      around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and
      HLA sensitization.
