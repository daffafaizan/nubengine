      (31.9% in the USA in 2018), the World Health Organization recognizes that where cesarean
      rates are higher than 10%, there is no increase in beneficial maternal and newborn outcomes.
      some researchers noted that in countries where cesarean rates are above 15%, populations
      experience higher maternal, infant, and neonatal mortality rates. infants born by cesarean
      delivery are more likely to require NICU care and have greater respiratory complications, and
      higher odds for childhood asthma, and obesity(5).

      Preterm is defined as babies born alive before completing 37 weeks of pregnancy.

      Preventing Preterm birth is a global priority due to increased risk for neonatal morbidity
      and mortality(6).

      this study a aims to determine The Assessment of Cervical Length and Depth of Uterine Niche
      as predictors for preterm labor in a patient with previous cesarean section The increased
      risk of spontaneous PTB might be attributable to the presence of the cesarean scar, abnormal
      placental implantation, changed uterine microenvironment with or without increased
      inflammation, disruption or dehiscence of tissue, affected cervical function due to cervical
      damage during the prior CS, stasis of fluid or blood in the lower uterine segment that might
      induce the cascade leading to preterm birth. For instance, in women with prior CS, the
      incidence of scar dehiscence (in the absence of uterine scar rupture) has been reported to be
      3.2% and is associated with preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy(3).
