      tissue and a necrosis of underlying prostatic tissue which corresponds to a postoperative
      inflammatory area.

      One of the side effects of this technique is the irritative syndrome which may involve
      urinary frequency, urgency or burning urination in approximately 10 to 20% at 1 month.

      The current literature does report neither the analysis of the underlying inflammatory
      necrotic area in prostatic vaporized tissue, nor the analysis of the urinary irritative signs
      post-laser PVP.

      Progresses in the field of functional ultrasound imaging allow us to consider a study of
      evolution of the underlying necrotic area devoid of micro-vascularisation under effect of PVP
      laser. The parallel with results of MRI (radiological technique most referenced) during the
      same period would help to support the experimental results of prostatic contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound.
