      disorder and to track each person's course of illness in order to study the long-term course
      of illness and to elucidate possible clinical and biological predictors of acute and
      sustained treatment response. As a part of this protocol, subjects will: systematically be
      administered psychiatric rating scales such as the life-chart method (LCM) for daily
      assessment of mood, sleep, and behavior; be asked to participate in non-invasive research
      procedures, such as blood drawing for measurement of thyroid antibodies and intracellular
      calcium; and be medicated as is clinically appropriate. This protocol also serves as a
      stepping stone to other protocols such as the comparative acute and long-term efficacy of
      three antidepressants (#95-M-0129), and the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids (#00-M-0004), for
      which separate written informed consents are obtained. Patients in this study are
      participants in the larger NIMH-Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network (SFBN), which involves six
      academic sites focused on better understanding the long-term course and treatment of the
      illness. The current protocol thus serves as an entry point for individuals with bipolar
      disorder for screening and detailed longitudinal assessment both prior to and in between more
      formal blind randomized IRB approved treatment protocols.
