      (RT) for prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility, safety
      and efficacy of inexpensive, non-toxic herbal supplement, Saw Palmetto (SP), in treating
      these distressing symptoms.

      The study consisted of two phases: Dose Finding phase (DFP), and Exploratory Randomized
      Controlled Trail (RCT) phase. In the 12 week DFP, participants were given one of three doses
      (SP 320 mg, SP 640mg, and SP 960 mg) using the Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method to
      determine the maximum therapeutic dose (MTD). Once the MTD was determined the RCT phase was
      begun, participants were allocated to receive either the predetermined MTD (960 mg) in the
      DFP or a placebo to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of SP on LUTS.

      Safety data consisted of the Common Terminology for Adverse Events criteria for nausea,
      gastritis, and anorexia. Efficacy of the MTD was evaluated by weekly symptom data and voiding
      diary. A pill diary was used to ensure the intervention fidelity.
