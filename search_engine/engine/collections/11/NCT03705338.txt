      Is it possible to use the alpha wave as an indicator of loss and recovery of consciousness in
      anesthesia with propofol in children?

      Hypothesis:

      The appearance and disappearance of frontal alpha wave is a good indicator of loss and
      recovery of consciousness in anesthesia with propofol in children.
