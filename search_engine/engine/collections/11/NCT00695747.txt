    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a Two-Site Technique for the Combined
      Procedure for subjects with coexisting visually significant glaucoma & cataracts will result
      in an improvement in IOP control in both the immediate and longer term postoperative period
      as compared with the currently Standard One Site surgical technique for both glaucoma and
      cataracts.

      Research and data indicate that the success rate of the glaucoma part of this operation may
      be improved if the incision for the cataract part of the operation is separated from the
      drainage hole created for the glaucoma part, the constant drainage through this hole is what
      lowers the intraocular pressure after surgery. Using the Two-Site Combined procedure the
      glaucoma incision(drainage hole) will still be created superiorly, under the upper lid. The
      cataract incision will be moved to the temporal side of the eye ball, away from the drainage
      hole for the glaucoma.
