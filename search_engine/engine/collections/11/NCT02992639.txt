      subjects with high VFA. The participants divided into two groups: 12-week mild calorie
      restriction (a 300 kcal/day intake reduction, n=40) or no treatment (control, n=40). The
      randomization was according to computer-generated block randomization (placebo:test = 1:1).
      Before and after intervention period, venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects,
      and biochemical parameters including circulating liver enzymes were measured.
