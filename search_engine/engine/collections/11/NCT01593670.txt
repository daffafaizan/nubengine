      the large scale CliniMacs device (Miltenyi) and activated by overnight incubation with IL-2.
      After washing, the final NK cell product will be divided in two, with half given fresh on day
      17 of course #1 and half stored frozen until day 17 of course #2.

      Clinical response will be formally assessed 4-6 weeks after the start of 2nd course based on
      International Working Group (IWG) criteria; however, bone marrow evaluations will be
      completed to assess for any sign of significant disease progression between cycle 1 and 2.
