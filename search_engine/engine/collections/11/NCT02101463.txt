      of these aneurysms requires more extensive dissection, aortic clamping above the renal or
      mesenteric arteries, and possible reconstruction of aortic branches. Recovery time tends to
      be longer, including more hospital days, than for endovascular repair, and there is a greater
      potential for complications. Many high-risk patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta
      (AAA), including thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), and significant co-morbidities
      will be denied elective open surgery because of heightened risks associated with open repair
      of complex aneurysms, and therefore, the potential benefit of an endovascular option
      increases as well.

      Endovascular aneurysm repair has been shown to be an effective alternative in treating
      uncomplicated infrarenal and thoracic aneurysms in both the elective and urgent setting, yet
      there is limited experience with this technology in complex conditions. Fenestrated grafts
      have been developed as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with complex aortic
      aneurysms who are unfit for traditional open surgery.

      Surgeon-modified fenestrated-branch stent grafts (sm-FBSG) with branches for the visceral
      vessels are custom-made by a qualified vascular surgeon for patients with complex aortic
      conditions. It is expected that they will minimize surgical risks and promote quicker
      recovery, and they could represent a therapeutic option for high-risk patients unfit for open
      surgery.
