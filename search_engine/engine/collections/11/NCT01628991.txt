      with stress urinary incontinence were randomly divided in two groups by blocked randomization
      method; behavioral intervention program (n=30) and insertion vaginal device,vaginal cones
      (n=30). Women in behavioral intervention group were instructed for pelvic floor exercise and
      bladder control strategies. Other group was allocated to use vaginal cones. They were treated
      for 12 weeks and followed up every 2 weeks. The subjective changes in severity of SUI were
      measured using a Detection SUI Severity Questionnaire and leakage index and 3-day urinary
      dairy. The objective changes were measured by pad test. These two groups were then compared
      according to the scores of special questionnaires for quality of life, strength of pelvic
      floor muscles, capability to participate in social activities, severity of urinary
      incontinence, and the number of involuntary urine passage, taken before, and after 1 and 3
      months after finishing interventions. Data analysis will be done through descriptive and
      perceptive statistical methods by using SPSS.
