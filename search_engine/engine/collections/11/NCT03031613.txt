      increase ICP and IOP, which has been debated for decades. Moreover, Trendelenburg position
      and pneumoperitoneum, which are mandatory for RALRP, may augment elevation of ICP and IOP.
      This study aims to investigate the effects of PEEP on the ICP and IOP in patients undergoing
      RALRP.
