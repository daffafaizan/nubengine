    
      Primary Outcome: evaluate the effect of tDCS on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women
      treated at a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil.

      Secondary Outcome: compare the effect of tDCS with sham-tDCS in postmenopausal women on
      vasomotor symptoms, FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) levels, salivary cortisol, BDNF
      (Brains derived neurotrophic factor)levels,depressive symptoms and quality of life.

      Interventions:

        -  Application of tDCS for a period of 10 consecutive days.

        -  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS):

      Active stimulation: the anode electrode is placed in the area of the motor cortex M1 C3 or C4
      position of the dominant hemisphere (International 10-20 EEG System). The cathode electrode
      is placed over the contralateral supraorbital region to the anode electrode. Treatment time
      and intensity of the stimulus: 2 mili Ampere, 20min, 10 days.

      Placebo-sham: appliance off during the entire period without active stimulation, with the
      position of the electrodes in the same sites of active stimulation.

      The placebo group do not receive pharmacological treatment or other during the research.

      After treatment, patients will be reassessed in a week, a month and three months with new
      application of questionnaires and sample collection.
