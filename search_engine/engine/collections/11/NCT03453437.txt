        1. At baseline, low levels of maladaptive perfectionism, and lower levels of depression,
           anxiety and body appreciation - reversed, will be related to greater self-compassion.
           The investigators expect high level of maladaptive perfectionism to be related to lower
           baseline self-compassion, higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of
           body appreciation.

        2. The intervention, a five session self-compassion intervention, will be sufficient to
           induce positive changes in perfectionism and psychological symptoms of anxiety,
           depression and body-appreciation- reversed.

        3. Changes in self-compassion will co-vary with changes in maladaptive perfectionism and
           body appreciation.

        4. Higher baseline levels of maladaptive perfectionism will predict greater gains from the
           intervention, because perfectionistic students will have greater need for a
           self-compassion intervention.
