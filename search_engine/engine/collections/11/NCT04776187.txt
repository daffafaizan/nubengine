      insufficiency were enrolled. Gadodiamide and Gadoteric acid meglumine salt were used for
      enhanced MRI. Observe the adverse reactions within 60 minutes of using the gadolinium
      contrast agents; follow up by telephone at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the inspection. The
      primary endpoint is the incidence of the various adverse events, and the secondary endpoints
      are changes of serum creatinine and inflammatory factors (TNF-Î±, hs-CRP, IL-6) before and
      after CE-MRI, patient skin examination and evaluation (evaluation of relevant indicators of
      skin biopsy).
