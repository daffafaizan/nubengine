    
      This is an open-label, non-comparative study for subjects with Fabry disease who have an
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the Modification of Diet in Renal
      Disease (eGFRMDRD) value of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Subjects may have previously participated in
      or be withdrawing from another migalastat study. Subjects withdrawing from a current
      (ongoing) study are to enter this study immediately, in order to maintain the continuity of
      treatment.

      Subjects entering into this study who are not currently on migalastat treatment, or who were
      previously on migalastat but discontinued treatment over 30 days before enrolling into this
      study, will undergo screening (Visit 1) to confirm enrollment eligibility. Subjects who meet
      eligibility criteria will have a Baseline Visit (Visit 2) within 30 days of screening.

      Subjects will be enrolled in approximately even numbers into 1 of 2 treatment regimens (150
      mg migalastat HCl once every 4 days [Q4D] or once every 7 days [Q7D], based on eGFR at Visit
      1. After approximately 4 to 8 weeks of dosing with either regimen, subjects will undergo
      blood and urine sampling for plasma migalastat determinations at steady state. An end of
      treatment visit (Visit 4) will be scheduled at Week 12. For subjects who do not enroll in
      another migalastat study, a follow-up visit (Visit 5) will be scheduled approximately 14 days
      after the last dose of migalastat.
