      history of non-life threatening allergic reaction to penicillin is well-tolerated
      irrespective of skin-testing results long after the event occurred.

      Methods: In this prospective, open-label, controlled, multi-clinical trial, 8702 individuals
      from primary care clinics were screened for penicillin allergy. 169 patients with a history
      of non-life threatening allergic reaction to penicillin, dating back at least 3 years, were
      recruited for study. Regardless of the response to penicillin skin testing, patients received
      the recommended daily dosage of penicillin and amoxicillin on two separate occasions. 2-6
      years later a follow-up was conducted to assess the outcomes of further penicillin
      administration.

      Results: 92.9% of the patients had an allergic reaction 6 years or longer before enrollment
      in the study. Of 272 challenges, 137 were skin-test positive with mild rash in 9 patients
      (6.6%), and 135 were skin-test negative with similar allergic reaction in 5 (3.7%) (P =.29).
      At follow-up, 3 of 55 patients (5.5%) who were given a full treatment course of penicillin
      developed mild skin eruption.

      Conclusions: A positive penicillin skin testing of patients with a history of non-life
      threatening allergic reaction to penicillin occurring 3 years or longer from the event was
      not associated with a greater prevalence of adverse reactions to oral challenge with
      penicillin than a negative one. It is of importance to determine whether oral challenge can
      serve as a diagnostic procedure for this particular group of patients, thereby saving the
      need for prior penicillin skin testing.
