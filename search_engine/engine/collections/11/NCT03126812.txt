      and has not significantly improved over the last decades. Standard treatment consists of
      debulking surgery and six courses of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Nevertheless, the disease
      recurs in >90% of women, usually within two years.

      Since early observations that the presence of infiltrating T cells is associated with
      improved outcome, ovarian cancer is linked to a potential benefit of immunotherapy.10 More
      recently, T cell checkpoint blockade with anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 have shown promising
      activity in platinum resistant ovarian cancer with objective and durable responses in 10-20%
      of patients. This finding raises the question whether anti-PD1 could also play a role in
      first line treatment of ovarian cancer.

      To fully use the power of T cell checkpoint inhibition, sufficient TCR stimulation is
      required. Importantly, the amount of antigen that can provide this signal will correlate with
      tumor load, and because of this adjuvant immunotherapy may work most efficiently, when
      initiated prior to surgery. In addition, we postulate that antigen retrieval will increase
      after induction treatment with cytotoxic therapy.

      To address these questions, we propose a feasibility study in patients with FIGO stage IV
      serous ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer in which we evaluate pembrolizumab added
      to standard treatment for its capacity to induce and broaden T cell responses against
      neo-antigens.
