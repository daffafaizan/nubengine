      antagonist in prevention of thienopyridine-related peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding
      in patients with an ulcer history. We plan to enroll 236 thienopyridine (clopidogrel or
      ticlopidine) users with a peptic ulcer history who don't have baseline gastroduodenal ulcers
      at initial endoscopy . The patients will be randomly assigned to receive either (1)
      famotidine (40 mg qd) plus thienopyridine used previously or (2) placebo plus thienopyridine
      treatment alone for 6 months. The ulcer recurrence rate between the treatment gruops will be
      compared.
