      Two tiers:

        1. Recruit 88 student volunteers from two university buildings and collect their morning
           one-spot urine specimens for 3 consecutive days (44 students in each building (Building
           A and Building B)

        2. Select appropriate study subjects with high excretion of urinary melamine and with
           consuming melamine tableware containing hot water or hot soup by questionnaire in the
           past 3 days for intervention.

      Study protocol:

      This is a cluster randomized crossover intervention. We will conduct this study for 9 days
      and each experimental step lasts for 3 days. We randomly assign one building with 8
      appropriate study subjects to a serial of control-intervention-intervention steps and another
      building with also 8 appropriate study subjects to a serial of control-control-intervention
      steps. Intervention step means study subjects will carry one big bag containing two stainless
      containers, one stainless spoon, and one stainless chopstick and use them for each meal
      during the trial (Some subjects will need to take pictures randomly and email back before the
      meal). Control means study subjects will carry one big bag without those stainless container,
      spoon, and chopstick and only use the containers provided by vendors for each meal during the
      trial (Some subjects will need to take pictures randomly and email back before the meal to
      check their adherence). Collect 24-hr urine samples for 9 days for melamine levels.

      Inclusion criteria: 20-30 healthy students Exclusion criteria: Subjects with cancer,
      hypertension, diabetes, chronic hepatic or renal diseases, including urinary tract infection,
