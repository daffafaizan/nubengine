    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm,
      multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study to assess the PK of bortezomib and to
      provide expanded access to bortezomib for 14 Taiwanese participants with multiple myeloma who
      have received at least 2 previous lines of therapy (medicine or medical care given to a
      participant for a disease or condition) and are refractory (not responding to treatment) to
      or have relapsed (the return of a medical problem) after their last therapy. Eligible
      participants will receive bortezomib 1.3 milligram (mg) per meter square (m^2) on Days 1, 4,
      8, and 11 of each 3-week cycle for up to 8 cycles. Blood samples for PK assessment will be
      collected on specified time points of Day 1, Day 8, and Day 11 of Cycle 1. Efficacy of the
      participants will primarily be evaluated by recording 'response to treatment' and 'Karnofsky
      Performance Status'. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
