      fixation left ventricular lead with quadripolar passive left ventricular leads. The left
      ventricular segment with latest mechanical activation was identified as target segment by
      radial strain speckle-tracking echocardiography.The leads were compared in order to identify
      differences in the electrical performance, the ability to achieve a stable proximal position
      in a coronary vein located concordant to target segment and clinical outcome. The clinical
      outcomes were assessed by echocardiography, change in New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      functional class and Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). The patients
      were followed up for 12 months.
