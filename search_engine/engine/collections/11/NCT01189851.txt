      estimated to measure â‰¤ 3.0 centimeters maximum dimension by mammogram, ultrasound, and CE-MRI
      and is thought to be resectable with WLE and clear surgical margins, with clinically staged
      N0M0 disease, minimum age of 48, and histology of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma of the
      breast. The lesion size determined by imaging will be compared with lesion size and surgical
      margin status obtained from the surgical pathology specimen to evaluate the ability of
      mammography combined with ultrasound and CE-MRI to identify suitable candidates for immediate
      IORT.
