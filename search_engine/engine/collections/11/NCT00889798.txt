      information on the antineoplastic treatment of lymphatic neoplasms in Germany. The registry
      will follow patients for up to five years. It will identify common therapeutic sequences and
      changes in the treatment of the disease. At inclusion, data in patient characteristics,
      comorbidities, tumor characteristics and previous treatments are collected. During the course
      of observation data on all systemic treatments, radiotherapies, surgeries, and outcome are
      documented.

      The impact of nutrition (LyNut) and physical activity (LyNut) on the course of the adjuvant
      disease will be examined in patients with indolent and aggressive Non-Hodgin Lymphoma, as
      well as long-term effects of systemic treatment (LyTox) and quality of life (LyLife) in
      patients with multiple myeloma.
