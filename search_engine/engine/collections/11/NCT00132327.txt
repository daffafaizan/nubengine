      In an attempt to better understand the pathology of erythema migrans (EM), we will use a
      variety of techniques to characterize patterns in skin biopsies from individuals with a
      diagnosis of EM and compared those to the patterns seen in biopsies from unaffected
      individuals. Biopsies from patients may also be evaluated for B. burgdorferi. Patients
      diagnosed with erythema migrans will have between 2 and 4 punch skin biopsies of affected
      area, and will return for 4 follow up visits in the course of a year. Therapy for Lyme
      disease will be offered. Healthy volunteers will have a screening visit, a visit for the skin
      biopsies and a follow up visit. Patients and healthy volunteers will be compensated for their
      time and inconvenience.
