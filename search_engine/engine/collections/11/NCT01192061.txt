      patients will be underwent eye examination (medical history, best corrected visual acuity,
      slit-lamp and stereo optic disc evaluation, Goldmann applanation tonometry, central corneal
      thickness measurement , Humphrey central 24-2 threshold perimetry test and optical coherence
      tomography of the optic nerve head, retinal nerve fibre layer and macula. CDI examination of
      the retrobulbar vessels will be performed. 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram and blood
      pressure monitoring will be performed simultaneously. Time- and frequency-domain measures of
      HRV will be calculated. BP will be measured in 20 minutes intervals during the day and 30
      minutes intervals at night. The occlusive provocative test and finger hyperemia will be
