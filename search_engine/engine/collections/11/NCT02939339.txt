      smoking. The present study will examine whether a five-day regimen of theta-burst
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reduces cigarette smoking outside of the lab
      (examined through self-report and physiological measures) and motivation to smoke inside the
      lab (examined through behavioral tasks and functional MRI).
