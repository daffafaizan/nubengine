    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two fixed doses of galantamine (16 and 24 milligrams per day [mg/day])
      in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and to investigate the dose-response. The study
      consists of a 4-week screening period during which all patients will receive placebo, and a
      22-week double-blind treatment period during which patients will receive placebo, galantamine
      16 mg/day, or galantamine 24 mg/day. For patients receiving galantamine treatment, the
      starting dose is 8 mg/day and increases at 4-week intervals in increments of 8 mg/day. The
      primary measures of effectiveness are the change from baseline to the end of the study (week
      22) in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Japan cognitive subscale (ADAS-J cog) and
      the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus - Japan (CIBIC plus-J). Safety
      assessments include the incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination findings. The study hypothesis is that
      galantamine will be more effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease than placebo.
      Study drug taken orally twice a day. 4-week screening period: All patients receive placebo.
      22-week treatment period: Patients receive placebo, galantamine 16 mg/day, or 24 mg/day. For
      galantamine treatment, the starting dose is 8 mg/day and increases at 4-week intervals in
      increments of 8 mg/day.
