      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 28 days,
      eligible subjects will receive treatment beginning on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle for
      pembrolizumab.

      Treatment with pembrolizumab or paclitaxel will continue until documented disease
      progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), undercurrent illness that prevents further
      administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject
      withdraw consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment o procedure
      requirements, subject receives 24 months of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons
      requiring cessation of treatment. After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed
      for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events and events of clinical
      interest will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of
      treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier).

      Subjects within the pembrolizumab arm who discontinue after 24 months of therapy for reasons
      other than disease progression or intolerability or who discontinue after attaining a CR may
      be eligible for up to one year of retreatment after they have experienced radiographic
      disease progression.

      Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will have post-treatment
      follow-up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer
      treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.

      All subjects will be followed by telephone for overall survival until death, withdrawal of
      consent, or the end of the study.
