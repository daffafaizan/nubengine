      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of E7389 and cisplatin in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. To determine
      the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      Outline: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV
      over 5 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 8 weeks.
