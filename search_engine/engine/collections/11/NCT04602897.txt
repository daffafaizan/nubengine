      at Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt, from May 2018 to March 2020. Our hospital research
      ethics committee approved this study. We obtained informed consent from all participants
      before initiating any study procedures. CONSORT guidelines were observed and completed.

      We recruited non pregnant women (aged 18-45 years) requesting copper T380A IUD insertion for
      contraception. Eligible women had no prior vaginal delivery or pregnancy termination beyond
      12 weeks, gestation (as patulous cervical os may affect VAS score), any previous deliveries
      had been by cesarean section, they were immediately postmenstrual or 1 week after pregnancy
      termination and they were willing to complete the study questionnaires. All women had to be
      alert, oriented, and cooperative to respond easily to VAS.

      Exclusion criteria were current pregnancy, prior vaginal delivery, history of cervical
      stenosis, current pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine anomalies, undiagnosed abnormal
      uterine bleeding, fibroids distorting the uterine cavity, and patients using chronic NSAIDs
      or on chronic pain medication.

      We randomized participants in a 1:1 ratio to cough and control groups. A statistician not
      directly involved in the study prepared a computer generated randomization list and placed
      the allocation information in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes that were opened
      according to the attendance of the subjects after signing the informed consent.
