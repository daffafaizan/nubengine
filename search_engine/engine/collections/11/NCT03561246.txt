      training of walking recovery after stroke based on how different biomechanical patterns of
      walking illustrate distinct motor control deficits. Each participant will complete 12
      sessions (three times a week for four weeks) of either INCLINE, DECLINE, or CONTROL training.
      Clinical and biomechanical outcome measures will be collected pre- and post-training and
      after a one-month follow-up period. In addition, the investigators will collect a battery of
      clinical outcome measures before and after training. Spatiotemporal variables (including
      SSWS) will be collected before and after each session. All clinical and biomechanical
      assessments will be conducted by an evaluator blinded to training group allocation.
