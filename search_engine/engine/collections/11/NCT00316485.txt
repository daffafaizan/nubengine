    
      OBJECTIVE:

      The objective of this protocol is to obtain oral tissue for analysis by various research
      groups at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The protocol will enroll a convenience sample of 1,000 subjects between the ages of 18 to 50
      years who are in need of third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Subjects will report to the National Institutes of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)
      for up to three visits. The first study visit will involve a screening evaluation to
      determine protocol eligibility. Eligible subjects will be invited back for a second visit for
      wisdom tooth extraction and collection of oral tissue for research purposes. All subjects
      will remain on the protocol for three weeks after surgery, and they will have the option to
      schedule a follow-up visit to the NIH for post-operative evaluation.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      This study does not involve any outcome measurements.
