      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) occurs in a majority of lung cancer
      patients. Thus, not only is this neuropathic pain widespread; there is no way to prevent its
      development, and long-term use of opioids for control of symptoms could result in addiction.
      Ultimately, PTPP and CIPN can lead to long-term suffering and disability during the
      post-treatment phase.(NSCLC), which represents about 85% of lung cancer cases.This is the
      first project of its kind and the potential impact of this research is large, because
      exercise training will be a prescription and the first approach for which NSCLC survivors can
      self-manage chronic neuropathic pain. The ultimate goal of the investigators' work is to
      reduce neuropathic pain for the growing population of cancer survivors while simultaneously
      reducing the need for problematic pharmacologic management. Therefore, results of this study
      have potential for high impact on symptom care because it will allow effective neuropathic
      pain treatment to be in full control of the Veteran, and likely restore function that is lost
      during the chronic pain experience.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To determine the feasibility of conducting an exercise rehabilitation intervention in
           Veterans with NSCLC and PTPP or CIPN.

        2. To determine the effects of a VAMHCS-supervised activity rehabilitation program on
           chronic pain compared to delayed control.

        3. To assess changes in fitness, strength, physical function, fatigue, and quality of life
           (QoL) after activity-based rehabilitation compared to control period.
