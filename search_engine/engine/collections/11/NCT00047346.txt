      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of OSI-774 in
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with moderate liver dysfunction.

      II. Establish the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of OSI-774 in HCC patients with
      moderate liver dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess possible anti-tumor effects of OSI-774 in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma in terms of partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) as assessed by tumor
      shrinkage by RECIST criteria.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
