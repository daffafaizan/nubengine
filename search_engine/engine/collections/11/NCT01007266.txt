      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly prevalent among youth, particularly
      in minority populations. Few pharmacologic agents are approved for the treatment of T2DM in
      adolescents, and behavioral and lifestyle factors may contribute to adolescents difficulty
      adhering to treatment regimens. A minimally-invasive buddy-intervention (to help improve
      diabetes control and to foster improvement in quality of life) has not been systematically
      evaluated in a population of pediatric patients with T2DM.

      Objectives

        1. To evaluate the effect of a minimally invasive intervention the buddy on hemoglobin A1c
           (HbA1c) levels in adolescents with T2DM.

        2. To assess changes between groups in body weight, number of home glucose monitor checks,
           compliance with medications, adherence to visit schedule, and psychological well-being.

      Methods

      Patients will be randomized to conventional treatment versus interventional group (buddy
      arm), and will be followed for 6 months. During this period, all patients should undergo two
      visits including laboratory testing (HbA1c) approximately 3 months apart. Those in the buddy
      arm will have weekly phone or online contact and once-monthly home visits from the buddy (a
      volunteer patient partner), with the use of systematic questionnaires and a secure database
      for data collection and maintenance.
