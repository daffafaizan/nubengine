    
      This study will occur in two parts, Dose-escalation (Part 1) and Cohort-expansion (Part 2).
      The main purpose of Part 1 is to determine the doses and dosing schedule of MPB-1734 that is
      safe and tolerable when given in subjects with certain types of advanced cancer. Part 2 of
      the study will begin when the Sponsor determines the safe and tolerable doses and dosing
      schedule from Part 1. The main purpose of Part 2 is to continue to assess the safety and
      tolerability of the MPB-1734 dose and dosing schedule determined by the Sponsor during Part
      1. The preliminary efficacy of MPB-1734 will also be assessed in both Part 1 and Part 2.
