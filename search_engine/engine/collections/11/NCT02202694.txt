      in Pakistan

      Primary :

      -To assess the feasibility of application of culturally-adapted CBT (CaCBTp) for use in
      Pakistan.

        -  To further modify CaCBTp in accordance with findings of feasibility study

      The Participants will be recruited from psychiatric department of different hospitals.They
      will be randomly divided into two groups; intervention group and treatment-as-usual group. A
      total of thirtysix participants will be recruited in the feasibility study and divided
      equally into two arms. This will ensure that, even after loss to follow-up, the investigators
      will have at least 12 subjects per group for analysis (FDA guidance
      http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5356fnl.pdf. Randomization will be carried out by the on
      offsite statistician . This will provide a reliable geographically remote service. For
      intervention group twelve sessions of CaCBTp will be delivered by trained research clinician
      for a period of three months. Participants in the treatment as usual (TAU) group will be
      given details of intervention at the end of the study and interested Participants will be
      offered CaCBTp.
