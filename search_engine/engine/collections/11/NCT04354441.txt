      complications and mortality from COVID-19 infections. Despite this, epidemiologic data on
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is currently limited to small case-series describing a
      clinical course ranging from mild to critical illness requiring extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated activity against
      SARS-coronaviruses in laboratory studies and are being tested in COVID-19 positive patients.
      HCQ appears more promising than chloroquine due to its greater effectiveness against
      SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and better safety profile. To date, pregnant women have been
      systematically excluded from trials conducted in the general outpatient population. Thus, we
      will carry out a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded trial of HCQ (considered safe
      in pregnancy in pregnant women with early COVID-19 infection across Canada to evaluate its
      effect in reducing COVID-19-related hospitalizations. This outpatient intervention is of
      paramount importance as its goal is to avoid overloading emergency rooms, obstetric triage,
      inpatient wards and critical care units. Upon completion of 6-month, our results can be
      directly applied to clinical care.
