    
      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose,
      dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of
      PBCAR269A in adults with r/r MM. Before initiating the study treatment PBCAR269A, all study
      participants will be administered lymphodepletion chemotherapy. The initial lymphodepletion
      chemotherapy regimen will be composed of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide during the
      Screening Period. On Day 0 of the Treatment Period, study participants will receive a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR269A. All subjects are monitored during the treatment
      period through Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR269A will be followed in a
      separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for 15 years after exiting this study.
