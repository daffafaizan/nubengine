    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), exploratory, open-label (all involved
      people know the identity of the intervention) trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK),
      safety, tolerability and anti-HIV (anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus) activity of etravirine
      (ETR ) when given with atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/rtv) and 1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) in 46 treatment experienced HIV-1 infected patients. The trial will consist
      of : 4 weeks of Screening Period, 2 weeks Pre-Treatment Phase, 48-week Treatment Period, and
      a Final Visit followed by a 4-week Follow-up Period (only for patients not continuing
      treatment with ETR in another trial or program). Safety evaluations (AE reporting, labs,
      vital signs, etc.) will be monitored at each study visit. A PK substudy (included in the
      protocol, with optional participation) with tenofovir (TDF) added to the antiretroviral
      regimen for 7 days will be conducted in patients with > 24 weeks of treatment with suppressed
      HIV-1 viral load. In Pre-Treatment Phase, all patients will receive ATV/rtv 300/100 mg once
      daily to be taken following a meal each morning + 2 NRTIs (dose as specified in the labels)
      for 14 days. In Treatment Phase, patients will receive ETR 200 mg twice daily in addition to
      ATV/rtv (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) once daily with meals + 1 investigator-selected NRTI for
      48 weeks. In substudy TDF 300 mg once daily will be added to the treatment regimen x 7 days.
