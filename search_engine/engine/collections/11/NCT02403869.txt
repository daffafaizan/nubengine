    
      Post-authorization, prospective, multi-centre study in Metastatic Breast Cancer patients
      treated with second-line monochemotherapy.

      A total of 200 patients are expected to be recruited from 32 Spanish sites.

      In this study the results perceived by patients will be compiled to assess overall Quality of
      Life (QoL) in MBC patients treated with second-line monochemotherapy, using the EORTC QLQ-C30
      questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
      Questionnaire) and its modules EORTC QLQ-BR23 (EORTC Breast Cancer specific) and EORTC
      QLQ-CIPN20 (EORTC Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy).

      Patients will be evaluated at the time of acceptance to participate in the study after
      signing the informed consent and will be tracked every three months during treatment with
      second-line monochemotherapy, coinciding with routine assessments within normal clinical
      practice. When the patient completes treatment with second-line chemotherapy he/she will
      enter the post-treatment period, with follow-up at six and 12 months after completion of
      treatment. Also, patients will be followed to assess survival until the end of the study (30
      months after enrolment of the last patient in the study). Follow-up time has been established
      based on the median survival of patients with MBC
