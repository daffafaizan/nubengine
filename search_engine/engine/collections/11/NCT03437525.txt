      of those with the disease, but also provides increased challenges for integration across the
      many dimensions of care (varied medications in addition to insulin, specialty services, diet,
      physical activity, stress management, etc.) and across the many who contribute to care
      (specialists, primary care providers, nurses, dietitians and patient educators, family
      members, friends, worksites). The Shanghai Integration Model (SIM) has made great strides to
      integrating specialty/hospital care with primary/community care. The addition of peer support
      can enhance patient engagement within that integrated care. Peer support can also integrate
      care with the daily behaviors and patterns that optimal diabetes management requires and with
      the family members and others in individuals' daily lives who can support diabetes
      management.

      The "Insulin Peer Support" project is a sub-project of "Peer Support in Diabetes Care", with
      special focus on appropriate insulin use in the community, to help overcome barriers in
      insulin treatment and improve treatment compliance. This project will develop a peer support
      model for diabetes management in Chinese patients undergoing insulin treatment and evaluate
      its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial of 10 CHCs in Shanghai.

      The project is a collaboration among the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong
      University, the Shanghai Diabetes Institute,the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and
      Family Planning, the Shanghai Centers for Disease Control, and, at the University of North
      Carolina-Chapel Hill, Peers for Progress, widely recognized for its leadership in promoting
      peer support in health care and prevention.
