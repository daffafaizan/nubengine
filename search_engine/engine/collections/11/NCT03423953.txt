    
      The ComprehensiveÂ® Shoulder System with Nano humeral component is a humeral prosthesis system
      intended for use in total or hemi shoulder arthroplasty surgery. Total shoulder arthroplasty
      consists of replacement of the humeral head and glenoid. Hemi-arthroplasty consists of
      replacement of only the humeral head.

      This project is a prospective study including one-hundred and fifty (150) anatomic and hemi
      cases and 44 reverse shoulders collected from up to ten (10) sites. All potential study
      subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent process.
