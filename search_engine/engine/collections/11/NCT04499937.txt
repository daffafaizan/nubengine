      concussion, debate persists about the utility of this recommendation for patients recovering
      from a concussion. In addition, patient adherence to physical and cognitive rest
      recommendations after concussion remains unknown. Objective and timely measures of physical
      and cognitive activity will aid in defining the relationship between physical and cognitive
      rest and clinical outcomes, such as symptom status, in the days and weeks after a concussion.
      Random assignment to incentive-based arms will be used to measure patient engagement with the
      study protocol and a dedicated research platform that involves ecological momentary
      assessment (EMA), in which participants report their real-time symptoms and daily activities
      in response to randomly timed prompts, will be used to help assess the rest and recovery
      process among pediatric and adult patients after concussion.
