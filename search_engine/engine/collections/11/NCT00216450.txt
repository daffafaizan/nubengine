      gastrointestinal diseases and associated with stomach inflammation, ulcer of the stomach or
      small intestine. The recommended treatment for the infection is a triple therapy consisted of
      one proton pump inhibitor, such as rabeprazole, and two antibiotics administered for 7 days.
      This is an open label, nonrandomized study of the safety of rabeprazole in the treatment of
      patients with H. pylori infection. The study consists of 2 phases: the 2-month main phase and
      the 4-month monitoring phase (total duration of 6 months). During the main phase, patients
      are treated for 7 days with three drugs (rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxycillin), and
      the effectiveness of the treatment is assessed 4 weeks later. During the monitoring phase,
      patients are interviewed at monthly intervals to assess symptoms and to report any adverse
      events. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the treatment
      and monitoring phases, and laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) and vital
      signs at the start of the study and after 1 month. Assessments of effectiveness include the
      eradication of H. pylori infection, assessed by the urea breath test one month after
      treatment. The primary study hypothesis is that rabeprazole is well-tolerated long-term in
      the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection in routine clinical practice. Rabeprazole
      tablets (20 milligrams[mg]) taken orally twice daily for 7 days. Clarithromycin (500mg) and
      amoxycillin (1 gram) taken twice daily for 7 days.
