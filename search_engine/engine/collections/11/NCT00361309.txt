    
      -  Participants will be given a supply of SU011248 capsules to be taken orally every
           morning for 4 weeks. After taking SU011248 for 4 weeks, there will be a 2 week rest
           period when the participant will not take any capsules. This 6-week period is referred
           to as 1 cycle.

        -  Participants will continue to receive SU011248 study treatment as long as their disease
           does not worsen significantly and they are not experiencing any serious side effects.

        -  During cycle 1 of study treatment, the participant will come to the outpatient clinic
           once a week for blood work, physical examination and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic
           resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), which is done two weeks after they start taking study
           treatment.

        -  During cycle two and every cycle thereafter, the participant will be asked to come to
           the outpatient clinic once every two weeks for physical examination, blood work and
           urine tests.

        -  A CT scan or MRI scan to assess the tumor will be performed once during each cycle for
           the first three cycles, then once every 2 cycles thereafter. ACTH stimulation test will
           be done every 2 cycles. A MUGA scan may be done at anytime at the discretion of the the
           study doctor.
