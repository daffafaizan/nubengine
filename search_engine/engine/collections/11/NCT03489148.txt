      consisted of three groups: (a) the intervention group who learned Tamarkoz速 Sufi meditation
      practices, (b) a second group of students who utilized self-care stress management resources
      at the Tang University Health Services Center, and (c) a third group who was the waitlist
      control group who did not receive Tamarkoz速 and did not use the stress management resources
      at the Tang Center for the duration of the study.

      The design is represented in the following diagram. NR O(a) XT O(b) O(d) NR O(d) XS O(e) O(g)
      NR O(g) O(h) O(i)

      XT represents twelve weeks of Tamarkoz速 training and XS represents twelve weeks of Tang
      Center stress management techniques. Each O represents one of three measurements in each
      group: (a) at baseline, (b) 12 weeks later, immediately after the intervention ends, and (c)
      six weeks post-intervention. The intervention group met twice a week for two and a half hours
      total for three months. One day of the week, they met for theoretical teachings of Sufism,
      and for the second day in the week they met to learn Tamarkoz速 techniques. The self-care
      stress management group used the campus resources for stress management as needed for
      themselves.
