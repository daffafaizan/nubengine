      study in healthy men and women compared the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profiles of two
      50-mg subcutaneous (SC) injections of etanercept liquid (in a 1.0-mL prefilled syringe): (1)
      using a disposable auto-injector device, and (2) using a standard manual injection. Each
      subject received both injections in the abdomen, separated by a washout period of 28 days.
