      dysfunction in HF patients and may be the major precipitant of decompensation and cause for
      admission in these patients. The renal hypoperfusion that occurs with cardiac injury can lead
      to sodium and water retention and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and
      neurohormonal pathways with resultant deleterious effects on the myocardium. A vicious cycle
      may then ensue and be associated with increased cardiovascular complications. In this regard,
      renal dysfunction is of a functional nature and thus means to intervene with this vicious
      cycle need to be sought.

      Several studies already demonstrated the deleterious effects of renal dysfunction on
      prognosis in patients with HF due to chronic left ventricular dysfunction.

      Levosimendan increases myocardial contractility without significant changes in the
      intracellular calcium ion and cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations and does not
      enhance myocardial oxygen demand. By its action on the potassium channels this drug also
      dilates the coronary and peripheral arteries and exerts an anti-ischemic,anti-stunning
      effect. To date, the effects of levosimendan on renal function in patients with worsening
      chronic HF, remain unknown.
