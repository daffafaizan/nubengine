    
      1. The investigators will detect platelet antibodies of participants who are according with
           the inclusive criteria.

        2. For participants with platelet antibodies, the investigators should screen out cases
           owning HPA antibodies and further to identify their genotype.

        3. Platelet infusion of same type will be applied to half of participants with HPA
           antibodies as experimental group, and the another half of participants with hematopathy
           will be infused ordinary platelets as control. The investigators will estimate the
           effect of matching transfusion through laboratory examination such as platelet count 1
           hour and 24 hours after transfusion and clinical feature comparing to control group.

        4. Finally, the investigators will obtain several conclusions includes positive frequency
           of HPA antibodies, the distribution of HPA antigen and antibodies, effect of matching
           platelet transfusion by analyzing a bunch of relevant information. So, strong evidence
           will be provide to decide if it is very important to carry out HPA antibody detection
           and matching transfusion in early phase.
