      pathological or suspicious views related to bladder and urethra. The patients may feel pain,
      anxiety and dissatisfaction when cystoscope is inserted into the bladder. Thus
      nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods are used to decrease pain, anxiety and
      dissatisfaction levels of the patients during the procedure. Music is the most commonly used
      distraction method during cystoscopy, but there are few studies in this issue (only music) on
      literature. In additon, there isn't any study related to stress ball use during cystoscopy
      and there isn't any study which comparatives effectiveness of the multiple distraction
      methods to reduce pain, anxiety and dissatisfaction levels during this procedure. Therefore
      the investigators aimed to compare effectiveness of three different distraction methods
      (music, stress ball and DVD) on pain, anxiety and satisfaction of the patients during
      cystoscopy.
