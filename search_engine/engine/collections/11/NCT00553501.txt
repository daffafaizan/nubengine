      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate (overall and complete) after extended induction therapy
           comprising epratuzumab and rituximab in patients with previously untreated CD20+
           follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

        -  To determine the time to progression after extended induction therapy comprising
           epratuzumab and rituximab in patients with previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of epratuzumab and rituximab in patients with
           previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL.

        -  To establish whether the therapeutic effects of the combination of epratuzumab and
           rituximab are sufficiently promising to warrant evaluation in a subsequent randomized
           trial (in comparison to rituximab alone).

        -  To determine the relationship between the change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake early
           after epratuzumab and rituximab treatment with response rate and time to progression.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction therapy (month 1): Patients receive epratuzumab IV over 5-30 minutes on days
           1, 8, 15, and 22 and rituximab IV on days 3, 8, 15, and 22 in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Extended induction therapy (months 3, 5, 7, and 9): Patients receive epratuzumab IV over
           5-30 minutes followed by rituximab IV in weeks 12, 20, 28, and 36 in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) subcutaneously and undergo positron emission
      tomography at baseline and after induction therapy to assess the degree of FDG uptake.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years then
      every 6 months for up to 10 years.
