      stomach cancer (c)T3-4N0-3M0 CYT- will be randomized into 2 groups using the envelope method.
      The control group will receive only neoadjuvant chemotherapy + gastrectomy/ distal subtotal
      resection with D2 lymph node dissection, the active comparison group - neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy + gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection + PIPAC (Cisplatin (7.5 mg / mÂ²) +
      Doxirubicin 1.5 mg / m2)). Will be assessed: overall survival, median survival, disease-free
      survival, quality of life of patients.
