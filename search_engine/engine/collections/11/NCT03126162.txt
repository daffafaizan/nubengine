      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)" has taken place across a wide range of surgical subspecialties
      including minimally-invasive gynecologic surgery. Many gynecologic procedures that once
      required hospital admission are now being performed as outpatient procedures. To optimize
      same-day discharge through the ERAS pathways, protocols call for early removal of urinary
      catheters following gynecologic surgery. Studies in urogynecologic literature have shown that
      a backfill-assisted voiding trial is superior to a spontaneous voiding trial in patients
      undergoing transvaginal surgery. However, there are limited studies published in literature
      focusing on minimally invasive gynecologic procedures, specifically laparoscopic
      hysterectomies. A successful spontaneous voiding trial is usually a postoperative criteria
      prior to discharge after same-day total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Through this randomized
      controlled trial, the investigators aim to compare two techniques of postoperative bladder
      testing for patients undergoing same-day total laparoscopic hysterectomy. This study would
      provide valuable data on improved measures for predicting voiding efficiency, time to first
      void, and time to discharge for patients undergoing same-day total laparoscopic
      hysterectomies. Ultimately, the investigators predict that backfilling the bladder
      immediately postoperatively, prior to removal of the foley catheter, will hasten time to
      first spontaneous void and reduce the amount of time spent in the recovery room.
