      internal significant bleeding treated by an emergency doctor of the helicopter service or the
      ground team will be enrolled in the study (inclusion- and exclusion criteria: see above). If
      a patient meets the inclusion criteria and is recruited for the study, his baseline values on
      the scene (T1) will first be collected including the first blood collection as well as
      documentation of the clinical parameters (hemodynamics, respiratory and neurological
      function, etc.). Subsequently, 30 patients will be randomized to receive about 50 mg/kg BW
      fibrinogen concentrate (one vial for each 30 kg body weight, estimated by the emergency
      physician), while the other 30 patients receive placebo (also one vial including 100 ml for
      each 30 kg body weight). The flow rate should not exceed 100 ml within 5 minutes.

      FGTW or placebo administrated over 5 min/vial:

      Body Weight: < 30 kg / 30-60 kg / 60 - 90 kg / > 90 kg

      No. of vials: 1 vial (100 ml) / 2 vials (200 ml) / 3 vials (300 ml) / 4 vials (400 ml)

      Fibrinogen (if applicable): 1.5 g / 3 g / 4.5 g / 6 g

      Immediately after admission to hospital, the patient's parameters including blood collection
      (see below) will be measured for the second time (T2), if applicable, after the end of
      administration of the study drug. Additional measurements will be made 3 hours (T3), 9 hours
      (T4), and 24 hours (T5), 48 hours (T6) and one week after admission (T7). 30 days after
      inclusion in the study, a final investigation is planned (T8).

      Coagulation management after admission to hospital is depending on the specific demands of
      the patient and should be performed according to the recommendations of the Austrian Society
      for Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Resuscitation (Ã–GARI)
      (http://www.oegari.at/web_files/dateiarchiv/116/key%20messages%20management%20of%20TIC%202011
      .pdf). Blood loss, transfusion requirements, volume therapy and coagulation therapy will be
      documented.

      When the bleeding is under control thromboprophylaxis has to be performed according to the
      international standard of care earliest after 24 hours after cessation of bleeding
      (preferably using enoxaparin).
