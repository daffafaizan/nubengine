      prevention after a first thrombotic complication are known to be at higher risk of recurrent
      thrombotic events despite INR values in the therapeutic range. It ist also known that
      antiphospholipid antibodies can interfere with phospholipid-dependent tests (e.g. prothrombin
      time and INR).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of interfering
      antiphospholipid antibodies. The intensity of anticoagulant therapy was assessed by measuring
      the INR using different thromboplastins and the CoaguChek system for INR self-assessment.
      Test results were compared to measurements of the phospholipid-independent chromogenic factor
      X.

      The second objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of recurrent thrombotic
      events during 1-year follow-up.
