      antigen (HLA)-identical living and deceased donor renal transplants. The initial 20 subjects
      were randomized to either receive/not to receive a single donor bone marrow infusion in
      addition to the investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus. Since
      the bone marrow infusion has been eliminated in the second group of 20 subjects, no
      randomization was required. All recipients in the second group of 20 subjects will receive
      the same investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus.

      At the time of transplant, participants will receive a 3-hour IV infusion of 30 mg. of
      alemtuzumab. Participants will receive a combination of sirolimus and belatacept for at least
      one year. At that time, eligible participants will consent to and begin oral
      immunosuppressive withdrawal or continue therapy through study close. Sirolimus will first be
      weaned by halving the dose and/or increasing the dosing interval over at least a 2-6 month
      period. After sirolimus is discontinued, participants will remain on monthly IV belatacept
      monotherapy indefinitely.

      Follow-up will continue for at least five years. If subjects are successfully weaned from
      oral immunosuppression during their participation in this trial, no other alternative therapy
      will be warranted. Since belatacept is now FDA approved, subjects will be eligible to
      continue this therapy after their study participation has ended.
