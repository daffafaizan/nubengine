      individuals over their lifetime. Most initial infections occur in childhood and after a brief
      flu-like illness, the virus enters a phase of latency.

      Patients who receive a bone marrow transplant or an organ transplant take medications drugs
      that weaken their immune systems. In these contexts, the virus can "reactivate" and cause
      very serious problems, such as lymphoma. For unknown reasons, people with a normal immune
      system can also develop lymphoma due to EBV.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of immune cells (T lymphocytes)
      that are specifically "taught" to recognize the virus-infected cells and to eliminate them.
      This "education" occurs is done over during a 2 weeks period (approximately), in the research
      laboratory. The cells are then transfused into the patient.
