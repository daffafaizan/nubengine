      followed by placebo or placebo followed by a DPP-4 inhibitor. Each treatment period lasts 6
      weeks, so all patients will receive treatment for 12 weeks in total. Induction of
      hypoglycaemia will take place at 0 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks to determine the glucagon
      response.
