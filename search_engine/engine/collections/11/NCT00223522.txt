      Tri-County MHMR Services and the El Paso Community MHMR Center. Both physicians and patients
      will be asked to rate the patient's medication adherence on their index clinic visit. Initial
      ratings will also occur at this visit. After filling their medication prescription, all
      subjects will be given electronic medication caps that record each time and date their
      medication container is opened. Patients will then be followed in the community for the next
      12 weeks to observe actual adherence to medication from the index visit to the next
      successive clinic visit. Every two weeks pills will be counted and data will be retrieved
      from the electronic medication caps. During the first and last two weeks of study, blood will
      be sampled on two randomly selected occasions approximately 72 hours apart. Self-report and
      physician assessment of adherence, symptom and attitudinal measures will be obtained a second
      time at the second clinic visit 12 weeks after the index visit.
