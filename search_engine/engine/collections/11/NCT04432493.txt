      (sham) and active TMS stimulation on reward processing across two groups of participants -
      healthy controls and opioid users.

      Participants will be asked to engage in a virtual T-maze task, a reward-based choice task
      that elicits robust reward positivities. During this task participants will receive
      simultaneous EEG/TMS, while they engage in the virtual T-maze decision making task, used in
      our previous reward positivity studies on SUDs. ERPs will be recorded throughout the T-Maze
      task, and the reward positivity will be measured as the difference in maximum amplitude
      between reward and no-reward feedback conditions.

      The TMS coil will be positioned using a an Adept Viper s850 robotic arm (SmartMove, ANT
      Neuro, Enschede, The Netherlands), providing precise targeting of the predetermined left
      dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) coordinate (< 10 mm from the scalp, orientated at a 45ยบ
      angle). Participants in the active TMS condition will receive rTMS pulses throughout the
      duration of the T-Maze task, with a maximum of 2000 pulses delivered to each participant.
      Identical parameters will be applied to the SHAM group with the exception that the TMS coil
      will be flipped 180ยบ to mimic auditory stimulation.
