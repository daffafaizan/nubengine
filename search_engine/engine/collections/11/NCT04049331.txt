      therapy in improving fatigue and other outcomes such as sexual function, quality of life,
      body composition, muscle strength and physical activity in a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial in young cancer survivors who report fatigue and have testosterone
      deficiency.

      Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms in men with cancer affecting
      70-100% of patients irrespective of their age. Cancer-related fatigue is experienced by
      patients not only during active cancer treatment, but is also highly prevalent in cancer
      survivors who exhibit persistent fatigue months to years after the end of their treatment
      with the highest prevalence being in recipients of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

      In addition to fatigue, sexual dysfunction is also highly prevalent in male cancer survivors.
      Male cancer survivors also have increased fat mass and decreased lean body mass, a phenotype
      that predisposes them to reduced muscle strength. This phenotype of fatigue, sexual
      dysfunction and adverse body composition is commonly encountered in non-cancer patient
      populations with testosterone deficiency, a condition which is also highly prevalent (50-90%)
      in cancer survivors. Pivotal trials of testosterone replacement therapy in non-cancer patient
      populations have shown an improvement in fatigue, sexual function and body composition in men
      randomized to testosterone compared with placebo. However, the efficacy of testosterone
      replacement therapy on cancer-related fatigue has not been studied.
