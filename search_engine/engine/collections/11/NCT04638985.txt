    
      Following the clinical trial of "Combined Immunization of sIPV and DTaP" in 2019, this study
      recruits 600 18-month-old subjects who have received 3 doses of sIPV + DTaP, and gives them a
      4th dose of vaccination (booster immunization). They are divided into 4 different groups,
      with 150 subjects in each group, and are innoculated with different vaccines.

      To be specific, group 1 receives sIPV (0.5ml)+ DTaP (0.5ml)+ MMR(0.5ml); group 2 receives
      sIPV (0.5ml); group 3 receives DTaP (0.5ml); group 4 receives MMR (0.5ml).

      Blood samples will be collected before vaccination and 30 days after this booster
      immunization. Neutralization antibody will be detected to evaluate the seroprotection rates
      and antibody geometric mean concentrations. The safety of both immunization schedule will be
      monitored as well.
