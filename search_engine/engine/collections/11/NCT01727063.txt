    
      All eligible patients will undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and, in previously
      identified areas of viable, ischemic myocardium unsuitable for direct revascularization, be
      randomized to either placebo (saline) or intramyocardial injection of bone marrow-derived
      cells (BMC) during surgery.

      During follow-up, myocardial perfusion assessment will be performed to determine the
      improvement in treated areas compared to non-treated segments.
