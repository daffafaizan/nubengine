      develop resistance to treatment within months or weeks after salvage therapy. There are still
      no effective markers to predict the response rate to bevacizumab.

      So the investigators initiate a single-arm Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of bevacizumab and nimustine regimen and to explore the predictive markers in
      patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.
