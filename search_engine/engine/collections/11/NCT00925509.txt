    
      -  Investigate the accuracy of inserting implants in the vertical way and in angulation, on
           irradiated native mandible or on microanastomosed fibula flaps

        -  Investigate the accuracy of inserting implants in the anteroposterior way, in the
           vertical way and in angulation for all the involved patients (meaning on irradiated
           native mandible or on microanastomosed fibula flaps)

        -  Investigate the delay of mucous healing

        -  Estimate the prosthetic function

        -  Evaluate the osteonecrosis rate after radiation with traumatic etiology due to
           implantation

        -  Estimate the implant rate due to minimally invasive flaps

        -  Estimate the implant rate due to pure trans mucosa way

        -  Estimate the post surgical therapeutic success after 1 year
