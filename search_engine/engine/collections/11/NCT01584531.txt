    
      This will be a Phase II open-label, multicenter (up to 5 centers), single-arm study. Sixty
      transfusion-dependent patients with MDS classified as Low or Int-1 risk (any cytogenetics) or
      trisomy 8 Int-2 by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) will be enrolled to receive
      rigosertib BID for 21 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle.

      Patients will be stratified on prior treatment with azacitidine and/or decitabine and/or
      lenalidomide and/or erythropoietin.

      Patients will remain treated on study until 2006 Internation Working Group (IWG) progression
      criteria are met or until death from any cause.

      All study participants will be allowed, as medically justified, access to RBC and platelet
      transfusions, and to filgrastim [G-CSF]. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) will not be
      allowed during the initial 3 cycles. Rigosertib dosing adjustment policies are described in
      Protocol.
