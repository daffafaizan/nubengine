      I. To determine the overall efficacy of MLN518 in patients with metastatic clear cell renal
      carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of MLN518 on progression-free survival and overall survival in
      patients with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity of MLN518 in patients with metastatic clear cell renal
      carcinoma.

      III. To evaluate the effects of MLN518 on serum VEGF-A, VEGF-R2, PIGF, and PDGF levels of
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving MLN518.

      IV. To determine the VHL gene status, methylation, and pVHL in archived material from the
      primary nephrectomy specimen of patients receiving MLN518.

      V. To evaluate tumor blood flow and vessel permeability based on functional imaging with
      dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dceMRI) in metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma patients treated with MLN518.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral tandutinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
