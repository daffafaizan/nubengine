      multi-factor maintenance treatment strategy in promoting longer-term smoking abstinence. All
      smokers will receive the same "Acute Phase Treatment" that combines nicotine patch, bupropion
      and intensive self-regulatory skills training. Nicotine patches will be provided for 8 weeks
      and bupropion and skills training will be provided for of 9 weeks. Participants will then
      enter a "Maintenance Treatment Phase" during which half (n=200) will receive three
      individualized relapse prevention training sessions spread over a 12 week period. They will
      also receive 12 weeks of self-administered RPT administered via written treatment modules.
      Finally, telephone counseling will be provided in conjunction with an Interactive Voice
      Response system (IVR) that will allow early detection of smoking "slips" and rapid response
      by treatment staff. The other half (n=200) will be assigned to a control condition that
      consists of three counselor-led sessions of "supportive therapy" spread over a 12 week
      period. P
