      propose to study interval intralesional PRP injections for patients with androgenetic
      alopecia (AGA). Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss world-wide.
      Although there are currently numerous treatment options for this indication including
      minoxidil, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and follicular unit transplant, many of the medical
      treatment options have undesirable side effects, particularly in women of child bearing age.
      These well-documented adverse reactions include impotency, hypertrichosis, and birth defects.
