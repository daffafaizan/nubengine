energy balance obesity abstract paper describes interplay energy intake energy expenditure body energy stores illustrates understanding energy balance develop strategies reduce obesity reducing obesity require modifying energy intake energy expenditure simply focusing food restriction effective reducing obesity human physiology biased achieving energy balance high energy flux i e high level energy intake expenditure previous environments high energy flux achieved high level physical activity today's sedentary environment increasingly achieved weight gain matching energy intake high level energy expenditure feasible strategy people maintain healthy weight restricting food intake meet low level energy expenditure energy balance point view successful preventing excessive weight gain treating obesity energy balance system shows stronger opposition weight loss weight gain large behavior needed produce maintain reductions body weight small behavior sufficient prevent excessive weight gain conclusion concept energy balance combined understanding body achieves balance framework helping develop strategies reduce obesity rates
