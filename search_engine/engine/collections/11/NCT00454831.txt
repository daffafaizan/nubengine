      chitin, which is found in the exoskeleton of crustaceans. It has been suggested that chitosan
      has a lipid-lowering effect by binding to fatty acids and cholesterol in the gastrointestinal
      tract and restricting their absorption.

      This study was designed to determine if HEP-40 chitosan (Enzymatic Polychitosamine
      Hydrolysate - 40kDa), a short-chained chitosan with a molecular weight of 40 kDa, is safe and
      effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol levels in patients who have not been previously treated
      with lipid-lowering agents and who have cholesterol levels that are mild to moderately above
      the levels recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel
      III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines.

      This is a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a
      4-week Pre-Randomization Phase where patients will be instructed to maintain a stable diet,
      patients will be randomized to one of the following study groups for a 12-week Active
      Treatment Phase:

        -  HEP-40 400 mg three times a day (400 mg TID)

        -  HEP-40 800 mg twice a day (800 mg BID)

        -  HEP-40 800 mg three times a day (800 mg TID)

        -  HEP-40 2400 mg once a day (2400 mg QD)

        -  Placebo, three times a day (placebo)

      The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit of administering HEP-40 chitosan at
      different doses and at different dosing regimens compared with placebo. Clinical benefit will
      be defined as the reduction in LDL-cholesterol after 4 weeks of active treatment.
