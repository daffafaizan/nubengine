      diseases including breast cancer, surgical techniques have evolved to preserve the skin flaps
      and nipple areolar complex (NAC) to give better aesthetic outcome without compromising
      outcome. Mastectomy that preserves the NAC is called nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM). NSM can
      provide major psychosocial benefits for patients but is technically demanding and challenging
      to perform. Total mammary glandular excision in NSM can be technically challenging due to
      small size of the incision and poor visualization of dissection plane. Recent studies
      demonstrate feasibility and safety of performing minimally invasive robot-assisted NSM
      (RNSM). The technique of RNSM is still novel.

      This is a single-arm pilot study for feasibility and safety of RNSM.
