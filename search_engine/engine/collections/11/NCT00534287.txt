      therapy. Inadequacy of empirical antibiotic therapy is associated with an increased mortality
      rate. Carbapenems are designed for empirical antimicrobial monotherapy. Combination therapy
      has been suggested but efficiency remains to be proven. In this study, antimicrobial
      monotherapy with meropenem is compared with a combination therapy of meropenem and
      moxifloxacin. It is hypothesized that the superior antibiotic therapy is associated with a
      lower overall organ dysfunction in sepsis. Study therapy lasts for at least 7 days unless
      microbiological results suggest otherwise. Study therapy may be extended to 14 days. Follow
      up examinations occur at 28 and 90 days. This investigator initiated study is supported by
      the German government (bmbf) and unrestricted industrial grants.
