    
      A prospective, one-arm, open-label trial to evaluate the safety of rifampicin at 35mg/kg per
      day, added to the remaining standard first-line drugs, in subjects with tuberculosis
      belonging to groups that have been underrepresented in previous trials: persons living with
      HIV, older than 65 years, malnourished, diabetics, and chronic stable liver disease. The main
      outcome is the rate of severe adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment
      modification as compared to that in a historical cohort (patietns belonging to these groups
      treated in the same centers from 2017-2019). Microbiological efficacy and extended follow-up
      data until one year after treatment will also be collected.
