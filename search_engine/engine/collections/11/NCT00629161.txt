      placebo-controlled protocol. The intervention includes Traditional Chinese Medicinal Mixture
      tid or matched placebo.

      Participating study centers include Neurological University Outpatient Clinics and

      overall wellbeing of PD patients and thus may leads to an improvement of parkinsonian
      symptoms in PD patients.
