        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of imatinib mesylate (in terms of objective response
           and progression-free survival at 6 months) in patients with gliomas.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to glioma
      (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma vs
      anaplastic astrocytoma or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 77 patients (29 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, 24
      patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma, and 24 patients with
      anaplastic astrocytoma or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma) will be accrued for this study.
