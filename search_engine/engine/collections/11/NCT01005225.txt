      containing inherited variants that are statistically associated with the propensity to
      develop solid tumors. Even though it has been firmly established that if an individual
      carries these DNA variants they have an increased chance of developing a solid tumor the
      underlying biological mechanisms for most of these associations are largely unknown.

      In addition to inherited DNA variants that are associated with the development of solid
      tumors it is well established that during the development and growth of solid tumors the DNA
      in these cancer cells undergo somatic changes (mutations). These somatic DNA changes have
      been studied over the past decade and frequently are specific chromosomal translocations and
      amplifications associated with the development of particular solid tumors. In some instances,
      examining the chromosomal translocation and amplification has lead to the discovery of
      proteins contributing to solid tumor pathology.

      the human 8q24 interval that has strong genetic associations with solid tumor development has
      also been noted as frequently amplified in solid tumors and serves as a predictor of poor
      survival in prostate cancers.
