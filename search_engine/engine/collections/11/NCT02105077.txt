      indicate that xenon is also used for increasing performance in high-performance sports. The
      purpose of this study is to establish a method for detecting xenon exposure in humans.

      In patients undergoing surgery with xenon anesthesia as part of routine hospital care, small
      blood samples (3ml) will be taken before anesthesia, during anaesthesia and at 1,2, 4, 8, 16,
      24, 32, 40 and 48 hours after anesthesia. These blood samples will be analyzed for traces of
      xenon.
