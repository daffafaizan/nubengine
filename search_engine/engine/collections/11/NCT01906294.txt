      several scientific and practical considerations as described in the AHRQ user's guide:
      registries for evaluating patient outcomes (www.ahrq.gov, 2007). From a public health point
      of view, such a register should monitor naturalistic (i.e., unbiased) use of diabetes
      treatment in the community and should primarily guide and assist medical professionals to
      make optimal choices in combating diabetes. The primary focus of this registry is therefore
      to monitor the medical and lifestyle treatment of diabetes in order to enable comparison of
      different treatment options and to provide data for future discussions of optimal treatment.
