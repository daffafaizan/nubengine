      investigators will enroll patients who have clinical and lab features characteristic of a PID
      disorder or PCD, but do not have a confirmed genetic diagnosis. Innovative, standardized
      methods (SOPs) will be utilized, including ciliary ultrastructural analyses by transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM), as pertinent. Measures of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) will be
      performed in all subjects to allow comparisons of nNO values in PID vs. PCD. Patients with
      high likelihood of a PID disorder or a high likelihood of PCD will initially undergo research
      genetic testing on a commercial approved panel for PID disorders or a panel of at least 37
      PCD genes. All subjects who do not have a genetic diagnosis from the test panels will undergo
      whole exome sequencing (WES) to search for novel genetic etiologies for PID or PCD.
