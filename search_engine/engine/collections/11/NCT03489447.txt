    
      All adult patients admitted to a general ICU included in the Swedish Intensive Care Registry
      (a majority of all ICUs in Sweden) between 2008-01-01 and 2016-10-18 are followed for one
      year and any deaths are registered. Data on illness severity scores, age, sex, admitting
      hospital and duration of ICU stay are recovered. Data are linked with the inpatient registry
      of the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen), and any discharge diagnoses
      from the last 5 years preceding ICU admission are recovered. These are used to assess chronic
      comorbidity.

      Mortality, adjusted for severity of illness, comorbidity and patient factors, is studied and
      any changes over time during the inclusion period are assessed.

      The data in the Swedish ICU Registry are entered by the treating ICU physicians and include
      severity of illness (Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)3), selected chronic
      comorbidity, sex and date of birth, ICU stay and selected interventions and complications.
      Relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnoses are required and
      assessment of the occurrence of severe sepsis or septic shock, during the inclusion period
      defined according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care
      Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) (sepsis 2) criteria, is mandatory when entering data.
