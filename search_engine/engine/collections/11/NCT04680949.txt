    
      Since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic started in Europe, the Hellenic Institute for the
      Study of Sepsis has launched in Greece the SAVE clinical trial (suPAR-guided Anakinra
      treatment for Validation of the risk and Early management of severe respiratory failure by
      COVID-19) (EudraCT number 2020-001466-11; approval 38/20 of the National Ethics Committee of
      Greece, approval IS 028/20 of the National Organization for Medicine of Greece,
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04357366). The concept of the SAVE trial was that early
      recognition of the risk for the progression of patients with lower respiratory tract
      infection (LRTI) by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 into severe respiratory failure (SRF) may
      guide anakinra therapy to prevent SRF. The tool that was used for the diagnosis of risk for
      SRF is the biomarker suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) at measurable
      concentrations in the blood ≥6 ng/ml. The trial was designed to be open-label non-randomized
      and the idea was το the start of treatment well before any sign of respiratory failure
      emerges. Patients hospitalized at tertiary hospitals during the same time period as the SAVE
      trial was ongoing and who were receiving the same standard-of-care (SOC) treatment were
      studied as comparators. An interim analysis was submitted to the National Organization for
      Medicines; number 108002/23.10/2020. In this interim analysis, 130 patients receiving
      anakinra treatment and SOC were analysed and they were compared to 130 patients receiving
      SOC. The 130 SOC parallel comparators were selected by propensity score matching to be fully
      matched to the anakinra-treated patients for age, comorbidities, severity scores on the day
      of hospital admission, i.e. APACHE II score, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), Sequential Organ
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) and WHO severity, and for the intake of azithromycin,
      hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone. SRF was defined as any respiratory ratio (pO2/FiO2)
      less than 150 mmHg necessitating mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
      The results of this analysis may be summarized as follows:

        -  The incidence of SRF was significantly decreased from 59.2% in the parallel
           standard-of-care (SOC) comparators (n= 130) to 22.3% among the 130 anakinra-treated
           patients; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence intervals 0.20-0.46; P: 4.6 x 10-8.

        -  30-day mortality was decreased from 22.3% in the SOC comparators to 11.5% among
           anakinra-treated patients; hazard ratio 0.49; 95% confidence intervals 0.25-0.97%; P:
           0.041.

        -  Duration of stay at the intensive care unit was shortened with anakinra treatment
           compared to the SOC comparators for the patients who eventually developed SRF

        -  The median cost of hospitalization was significantly reduced from €2.398,40 among SOC
           comparators to €1.291,40 among anakinra-treated patients

        -  No safety concerns were raised.
