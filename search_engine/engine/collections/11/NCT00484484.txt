      To show that low analgesic doses of ketamine associated with opioids better relieve
      refractory cancer pain than opioids without ketamine.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Determine whether ketamine use allows to reduce opioid consumption

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of opioids-ketamine association versus opioids-placebo.

           100 patients are expected : 50 will be treated with opioids and ketamine ; 50 will be
           treated with opioids and a placebo.

      Treatment will be administered for 4 days. Patients will be followed-up for 5 days.

      Success is defined by a decrease of the daily pain score of 50 % after 4 days. The expected
      rate of success in the placebo group is 10 % whereas the expected rate of success in the
      ketamine group is 35 %.

      Primary outcome (pain score on a 11-point numerical scale) will be evaluated everyday as well
      as secondary outcomes (patient and clinician global impression of change, opioid consumption,
      adverse reactions, patient satisfaction on pain relief, sleep interference score).

      Vital parameters (cardiac frequency, respiratory frequency and arterial blood pressure) will
      be checked everyday, many times a day : every hour for the four hours after the beginning of
      the treatment and then, every four hours ; every hour for the two hours following a dose
      shift).
