      I. To determine the feasibility and tolerability of beta-adrenergic blockade in patients with
      metastatic or locally advanced cancer.

      II. To determine the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on the tumor microenvironment and
      host immune system via a series of correlative laboratory studies using cancer tumor tissue
      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the study patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on progression-free survival and overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.
