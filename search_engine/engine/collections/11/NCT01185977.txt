      consented and join this project at UCLA. For analytic purposes, we will define an "enrolled"
      subject as one who has completed the single-blind lead-in week and one week of double-blind
      treatment, and the three EEG recordings at these visits, as any subject who leaves the
      project prior to that point cannot contribute useful data to testing our hypotheses.

      Subjects who enroll in this project will receive 1 week of single-blind placebo lead-in,
      followed by 8 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment either with fluoxetine (FLX), a
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) with FDA approval for use in this age group, or
      with placebo. Brain activity will be assessed with Qualitative EEG (QEEG) recording at
      pretreatment baseline, after lead-in, and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment to expand the
      evidence base on the neurophysiology of treatment response in adolescents. Subjects will be
      assessed for symptom change, adverse events, and suicidality at each visit. Functional
      measures related to treatment will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 4 and 8. Subjects and
      the staff who interact with them will be blinded to QEEG biomarker values during the project.
