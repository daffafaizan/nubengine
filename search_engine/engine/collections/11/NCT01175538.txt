      survival rate of 10-70% at one year depending upon hepatic and renal functions. Treating
      patients to prevent development of first episode of hepatic encephalopathy is classified as
      primary prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy and preventing recurrence of hepatic
      encephalopathy in patients who had previous episode of hepatic encephalopathy is secondary
      prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy
