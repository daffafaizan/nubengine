      sensitized kidney transplant recipients will be collected. The samples will be used to
      compare the effect immunosuppression has on the antibody producing cells from both of these
      kinds of transplant recipients. Bone marrow will be collected from sensitized kidney
      transplant recipients before desensitization therapy prior to transplantation and at the time
      of kidney transplant surgery. Non-sensitized patients will have bone marrow collected only at
      the time of kidney transplant surgery. Blood will be collected at the same time point that
      the marrow is collected in both kinds of patients.
