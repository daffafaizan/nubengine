      investigate the effect of oxytocin treatment on the tolerance of infidelity. Male and female
      subjects would firstly see a neutral face of the opposite sex presented with a sentence
      descried their fidelity or infidelity behavior (sexual or emotional) in a relationship. Next
      the participant will rate the attractiveness, likability and trustworthiness of each
      individual, and whether they would like to have a short/long relationship with him/her. After
      that there will be some implicit attitude tasks to test their implicit attitude towards
      potential partners exhibiting previous fidelity or and infidelity.
