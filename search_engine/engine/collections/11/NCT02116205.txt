      These groups will be split so that 60 individuals receive the 1.0 mg dose and the other 60
      receive the 2.0 mg dose. Every subject will receive a total of 3 injections on Days 0, 28,
      and 56. Half of each of these groups (n = 30) will receive 2 vaccine injections at Days 0 and
      56 (normal saline placebo on Day 28) while the other half will receive 3 vaccine injections
      at Days 0, 28, and 56. All subjects will receive a booster dose at Day 168 to help assess
      immunogenicity with this booster dose. All doses will be administered with the TDS-IM device.
      All subjects will be followed until at least Day 252 (a 12 month follow-up visit may be
      requested). Subjects will complete post-injection memory aids for 7 days after each
      injection. There will also be up to 12 alternates enrolled and used to replace any original
      subject who fails to complete all 3 scheduled primary injections and Day 70 follow-up visit.
