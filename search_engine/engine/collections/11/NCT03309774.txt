      with CRPS. But the impact of relaxation on pain and balance has been proven. This study aims
      to assess the impact of the assumption by the relaxation therapy in children suffering from
      CRPS, on sympathovagal balance.

      It is an experimental prospective single-center study to highlight after a standardized
      relaxation program, changes in the time and frequency indices variability in heart rate,
      parameters of pain and quality of life with the CRPS children 6 to 16 years.
