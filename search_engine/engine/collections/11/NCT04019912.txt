      parkinsonism, there is also evidence of the effects of music-based interventions on
      supporting motor function and emotional well-being in people with multiple sclerosis.
      Interventions based on music can influence multiple functions. Recently it has been shown
      that coupling of auditory signals with motor training may be possible to form a rhythmic gait
      by dragging movement patterns, supporting the generation of better gait patterns; moreover,
      it can have effects on the rhythmic dragging; the commitment of automatic timing systems;
      movement planning, execution and learning; and an increase in motivation. Furthermore, this
      type of coupling has been shown to improve various gait parameters, including cadence, gait
      speed, stride length, gait time variability and pitch width.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the treadmill training combined with
      RAS in terms of mobility, balance and gait parameters, patient's well-being.
