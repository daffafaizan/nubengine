    
      This randomized, controlled trial is designed to test whether short-term (1-2 months) HRT
      cessation will sufficiently lower breast density to decrease the proportion of women who
      receive a recommendation for additional evaluation following a screening mammogram, and to
      examine whether there is a trend by duration of cessation. The study is being conducted at
      Group Health Cooperative, a managed health care organization in western Washington State with
      an organized breast cancer screening program. We are recruiting 1,500 women and will
      randomize women to one of three HRT arms: 1) cessation two months before the screening
      mammogram; 2) cessation one month before; and 3) continued HRT use. We are using a
      computer-assisted method to measure mammographic breast density continuously. Mammography
      recall rates are being determined from an expert radiologist review of the mammograms,
      blinded to HRT status.
