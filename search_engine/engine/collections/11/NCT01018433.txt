      highly prevalent in young adults, with 1 in 10 college students engaging in over 100 episodes
      in their lifetimes. Consequences of NSSI are severe, including physical injury ranging in
      medical severity, distress from shame associated with the behavior, social isolation,
      psychological symptoms, and increased risk and lethality of NSSI over time. Despite the
      prevalence and significant consequences of NSSI, no empirically supported treatments specific
      to NSSI exist. The purpose of this study is to develop, implement, and evaluate an
      intervention specifically for NSSI in young adults, the Treatment for Self-Injurious
      Behaviors (T-SIB). This time-limited intervention will integrate theoretically-based
      strategies whose utility has been identified through empirical research with the goal of
      reducing frequency and severity of NSSI. The research plan consists of 2 phases. During Phase
      1, 12 patients will be treated in an open pilot trial. During Phase 2, 60 patients will be
      treated in a randomized controlled pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability
      of T-SIB, investigate change in NSSI frequency and severity between T-SIB and treatment as
      usual (TAU) through a 3-month follow up period, and evaluate the research design of the
      randomized controlled pilot study to inform both the utility and design of a larger
      randomized clinical trial.
