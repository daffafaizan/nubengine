      Arm label: Experimental

      Arm type: Experimental

      Arm description: Participants from the experimental group will perform MIP concomitantly with
      usual physical rehabilitation program.

      Intervention type: Other

      Intervention name: Motor Imagery Practice of locomotor tasks

      Intervention Description: Together with physical rehabilitation performed with
      physiotherapists, participants from the experimental group will mentally rehearse 3 different
      locomotor exercises that they already physically performed beforehand.

      Exercise 1: 10m Walk

      Exercise 2: Timed Up and Go test (rise up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, come back
      to the chair, turn around and sit down)

      Exercise 3: Stairs climbing test (climb up 4 stairs, turn around, climb down the for stairs)

      Two min of MIP will be scheduled 5 times/day, during rest periods, so that patients complete
      10min of MIP per day.

      Locomotor capacities and phantom-limb pain intensity will be assessed at 5 different moments
      of the functional rehabilitation:

      Evaluation 1: first day of functional rehabilitation Evaluation 2: right after prosthesis
      fitting and when patients are able to walk with it during 10min Evaluation 3: three weeks
      after the second evaluation (to have temporally equivalent data for all patients) Evaluation
      4: one week before leaving the rehabilitation center (to have functionally equivalent data
      for all patients) Evaluation 5: six weeks after patients left the center, for follow-up
      assessment

      Arm label: Control

      Arm type: Active comparator

      Arm description: Concomitantly with usual physical rehabilitation program, participants from
      the control group will perform a cognitive task that has no impact on motor rehabilitation
      (word scramble game).

      Intervention type: Other

      Intervention name: Control cognitive task

      Intervention Description: Together with physical rehabilitation performed with
      physiotherapists, participants from the control group will spend equivalent time focusing on
      a cognitive task without impact on motor rehabilitation.

      Two min of this cognitive task will be scheduled 5 times/day, during rest periods, so that
      patients complete 10min of control task per day.

      As for patients of the experimental group, locomotor capacities and phantom-limb pain
      intensity of participants from the control group will be assessed at 5 different moments of
      the functional rehabilitation:

      Evaluation 1: first day of functional rehabilitation Evaluation 2: right after prosthesis
      fitting and when patients are able to walk with it during 10min Evaluation 3: three weeks
      after the second evaluation (to have temporally equivalent data for all patients) Evaluation
      4: one week before leaving the rehabilitation center (to have functionally equivalent data
      for all patients) Evaluation 5: six weeks after patients left the center, for follow-up
      assessment
