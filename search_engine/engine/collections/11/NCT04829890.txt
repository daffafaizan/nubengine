      risk breast cancer who are treated at Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG) affiliated
      departments of oncology. This study was a pooled analysis of two separate sequential
      feasibility studies who received the below described treatment. Patients who participated
      were 18 years old or older, women of any menopausal status who received epirubicin for 3
      cycles every 2 weeks followed by 3 cycles with cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks followed 3
      weeks later by 9 weekly cycles with docetaxel or paclitaxel. G-CSF was given on days 2-7 of
      each cycle during treatment with Epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. All premenopausal patients
      with receptor positive status received tamoxifen 20 mg p.o. daily for 5 years. All
      postmenopausal patients with receptor positive status were treated with anastrazole 1mg for 5
      years. RT was required for all patients (pre- or post -menopausal), providing that they had
      either a partial mastectomy or tumor size > 5cm and /or more than 4 positive lymph nodes,
      irrespectively the type of surgery (conservative or radical).
