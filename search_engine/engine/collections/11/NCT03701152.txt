    
      Assessment of wound surface area was done by a graded plastic sheet and a metric graph paper,
      by counting the complete squares of the metric graph paper, while the wound size was done by
      using a 10 cm syringe filled with dermazin cream and filling the wound with it.

      Negative pressure device: VAC system 125mmhg (KCI negative pressure equipment).

      Wound surface area tracing tools:

        -  Sterilized transparent film.

        -  Fine tipped transparent marker.

        -  Carbon and a white A4 papers.

        -  Metric graph paper (1mmÂ²).

      Wound volume assessment procedure:

        -  Using a syringe of ten cubic centimeters filled with dermazin cream.

        -  The wound is filled with the cream

        -  The amount of cream injected into the wound was detected in cubic centimeters.
