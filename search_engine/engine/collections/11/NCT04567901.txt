      identify older patients with malnutrition. It consists of serum albumin levels as well as
      body weight measurements. However, even under professional care, the usual body weight is
      often not documented for older patients. To determine the usual body weight of older
      patients, the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) was introduced in 2005 by Bouillanne et
      al - the formula included a combination of serum albumin levels and the ratio of body weight
      to ideal body weight. The GNRI formula replaces the usual body weight in the NRI formula with
      the ideal body weight, calculated using the Lorentz formula. Although the GNRI was developed
      using the data of patients who were admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation care unit, it was
      found to be a strong prognostic factor for certain malignancies and a simple, objective, and
      quick method to determine the nutritional status of patients and long-term postoperative
      outcomes and the correlation between these elements. Using this simple calculation, it is
      possible to evaluate the nutritional status of critically ill patients with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome in the intensive care unit (ICU). Considering that trauma patients
      constitute a specific population, as injuries generally occur accidentally and acutely, it is
      important to determine whether the GNRI can be used to link nutritional status and outcomes
      in trauma patients. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the association between GNRI at
      admission and mortality outcomes of older trauma patients in the ICU.
