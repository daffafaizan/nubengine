      SHUNT Liver Diagnostic Kit (Test) for likelihood of large esophageal varices. Our HALT-C
      Training dataset demonstrated that the DSI 18.3 had sensitivity 95%, specificity 54%, PPV
      19%, NPV >99%, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) 0.09, and positive likelihood ratio (PLR) 2.09
      for large varices. To validate DSI 18.3 as a cutoff for large varices, we will enroll 420
      subjects with chronic liver disease (CLD) of mixed etiologies from 15 to 25 US clinical
      centers (CLD Validation dataset). The target prevalence of large varices is â‰¥20%. Each
      subject will have been scheduled for an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) as part of their
      standard of care for either variceal or non-variceal indications. Enrolled subjects will
      undergo standard clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and the HepQuant SHUNT Test. The EGD
      will be performed within 6 weeks following the HepQuant SHUNT Test. The relationship of DSI
      to large varices will be analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression
      analyses, AUROC, and linear and nonlinear regression and correlation coefficients. Diagnostic
      performance of the DSI cutoff will be defined in the CLD Validation dataset and validated for
      likelihood of large esophageal varices. The validated DSI cutoff will identify subjects who
      are either unlikely or likely to have large esophageal varices.
