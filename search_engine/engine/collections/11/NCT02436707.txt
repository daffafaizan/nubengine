      for treating patients with this disease. It is not clear however if these treatments can
      offer better results than standard treatment.

      The study uses a "pick the winner" design to facilitate efficient screening of novel
      combination treatment regimens and select those meeting pre-specified criteria for testing in
      the phase III setting. All novel treatment options will be compared against the standard
      treatment for this disease: rituximab plus gemcitabine, dexemthasone, and cisplatin (R-GDP).
