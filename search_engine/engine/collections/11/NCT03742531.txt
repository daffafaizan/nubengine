      and best approach has not been described. We want to investigate the effect of oxytocin
      treatment by using different regims in latent phase of labor when oxytocin treatment is
      ceased in active phase of labour. In our trial we discontinued oxytocin in active phase of
      labour and investigate which group needs oxytocin therapy due to inadequate uterine
      contractions and arrest of labor.
