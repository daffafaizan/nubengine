      that encompasses the intricate interplay of classic cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative
      stress and inflammation.

      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a clinical setting that well represents the model of
      widespread atherosclerosis. PAD affects 20% of patients over the age of 75. Furthermore, PAD
      patients are at an exceptionally high risk for cardiovascular events and the majority will
      eventually die of a cardiac or cerebrovascular etiology.

      Polyphenol could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to counteract atherosclerosis. During
      the last decades, a growing interest in polyphenols resulted from prospective and
      epidemiological studies that showed the beneficial effects of these substances on human
      health. In particular, polyphenols exert their beneficial effect by inhibition of NADPH
      oxidase (NOX2), an enzyme directly involved in atherosclerosis; thus, the activation of this
      enzyme leads to an enhanced production of oxidative stress and inflammatory processes.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of polyphenols on oxidative stress and
      inflammation and on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis in PAD patients. Polyphenols,
      inhibiting NOX2-mediated oxidative stress and immune-mediated process, could represent a
      novel therapy to reduce the high risk of cardiovascular events in PAD.
