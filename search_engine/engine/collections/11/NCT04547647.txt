      spinal column, and are represented by cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis,
      and new sacral and coccygeal kyphosis. Despite all these curves, the spinal column should
      work mechanically as a straight and rigid axis to withstand stress, and should be
      functionally flexible in order to allow movement. This mix of opposite behaviors (rigidness
      and flexibility) is the result of a complex stabilization system formed by muscles that
      contract and relax harmonically and absorb any impact exerted on the spinal column structure.
      Biomechanically speaking, the spinal column influences and is influenced by positioning and
      stress of the pelvic and scapular belts, and upper and lower limbs, respectively. Postural
      deformities and alterations should not be evaluated only in terms of bone structure, but also
      in terms of the functional assembly represented by the spinal column [2].

      Adolescence is a stage of fast physical development in which the nervous system and
      musculoskeletal system have yet to fully develop. Changes in the physical morphology of the
      spine are known to cause musculoskeletal system conditions, such as non-specific back pain.
      Moreover, the spinal morphology as scoliosis and kyphosis.

      With early identification and intervention, scoliosis may be prevented from progressing, so
      that it does not interfere with mobility, activity or comfort. Scoliosis has a large
      percentage that remains asymptomatic,[4] Therefore the feasibility of screening is worthwhile
