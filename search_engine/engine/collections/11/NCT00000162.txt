      diabetic retinopathy. Many treatments for this disorder were attempted before 1977, but none
      were proven to be effective. The only treatment that seemed at all promising in preventing
      visual loss from BVO was laser photocoagulation.

      Approximately 500 patients were enrolled in the study. One-half were randomly assigned to
      treatment with argon laser photocoagulation; the other one-half remained untreated as
      controls. For BVO with or without neovascularization, scatter treatment of 100 to 400 laser
      burns was applied in the drainage area of the occluded vein site, avoiding the fovea and
      optic disc. Individual laser burns were 200 to 500 microns in diameter with an exposure time
      of 0.1 to 0.2 seconds. For macular edema, burns of 50 to 100 microns in diameter with
      exposure time of 0.05 to 0.1 seconds were used. A fluorescein angiogram less than 1 month old
      had to have been available for each patient. Treatment was performed under topical anesthesia
      using the argon laser to achieve a grid pattern over the area of capillary leakage identified
      by fluorescein in the macular region. Photocoagulation was extended no closer to the fovea
      than the edge of the foveal avascular zone and did not extend peripherally beyond the major
      vascular arcade. The efficacy of treatment was judged on the basis of visual acuity
      measurements as well as assessment of the subsequent development of neovascularization and/or
      vitreous hemorrhage. Patients were followed for at least 3 years.
