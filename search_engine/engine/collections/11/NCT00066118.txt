      prospective clinical trial with the overall goal of determining if there are detectable
      health effects due to exposure from mercury-containing dental amalgam fillings. Children,
      thought to be the population most susceptible to any possible health effects, were randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups (total n=507). Subjects were originally enrolled at
      ages between 8-10 years of age. To participate, subjects must have: Dental caries in at least
      one posterior tooth; no prior exposure to dental amalgam; a blood lead of <15ug/L; a urinary
      mercury level of <10ug/L; an IQ as measured by the CTONI of >67; and no prior or existing
      serious medical or neurologic condition. One group received only dental filling materials
      other than those containing mercury (plastic and ceramic composites), while the other group
      received mercury amalgam fillings where appropriate (in large restorations in back teeth),
      but the alternative materials everywhere else. Both treatment regimens are standard-of-care
      throughout the world. Subjects receive ongoing dental care via the study clinics, and
      continue to receive dental fillings as needed based on group assignment. The target organs of
      mercury exposure are renal and neurological. Baseline and annual repeated measures are taken
      on all subjects for renal function, nerve conduction velocity and a large battery of
      neurobehavioral tests. Follow-up is planned for a period of 7 years
