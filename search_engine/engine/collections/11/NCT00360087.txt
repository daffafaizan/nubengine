      in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with sickle cell disease (SCD). The
      study population will include male and female patients with sickle cell disease
      (SS,S-beta-Thalassemia) who have previously completed the 16-week treatment period of the
      double-blind study of bosentan (ASSET 1 or ASSET 2). Patients who meet all the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be started on 62.5 mg bid for 4 weeks and
      then start the maintenance dose of 125 mg bid (or stay on 62.5 mg if their weight is less
      than 40kg/90lbs). Patients will be divided into two groups. Group A will consist of patients
      who begin this study within 4 weeks of completing ASSET 1 or ASSET2. Group B will consist of
      patients who begin this study longer than 4 weeks after completing ASSET I or ASSET 2.
      Patients will remain on drug until the FDA approves the drug for use in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension or until the sponsor decides to stop the study.
