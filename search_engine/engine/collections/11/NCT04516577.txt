      alveolar proteinosis (SPSP) to assess the severity and prognosis of patients. The SPSP
      included five aspectes: smoking, symptom, PaO2, chest CT score and DLCO %predicetd. But the
      chest CT score only foucused on range of lesions, and inaccurate. So, investigators plan to
      adopt new score which involves the assessing to range and density.
