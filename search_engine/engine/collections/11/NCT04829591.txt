      critical for an effective treatment. HF is a global problem with significant morbidity and
      mortality, despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology and a growing range of
      therapeutic options. Jordanian Heart Failure Registry (JoHFR) will be the first research
      project of heart failure prevalence in Jordan. It is undertaken by primary healthcare
      professionals with main aim to improve knowledge about the care of patients with HF. The

      the public and private medical sectors in Jordan's medical community. Standards in the
