      Sanitation Fund (GSF) sanitation program in Bihar, India improves health and well-being among
      women and girls. Our study consists of a controlled before-and-after (CBA) study with an
      embedded ethnography.

      Specific objectives are:

        -  Measure the effect of the GSF intervention on sanitation-related psychosocial stress
           (SRPS), generalized psychosocial stress (PSS), perceived quality of life, hair cortisol,
           and urogenital health among women between the ages of 14 and 65.

        -  Measure changes in sanitation adoption (e.g.: sanitation access and exclusive use) among
           individuals / households receiving the GSF intervention.

        -  Document individual and community experiences with sanitation, intervention
           participation, and latrine coverage through ethnographic methods.
