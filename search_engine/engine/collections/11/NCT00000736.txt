      eventually develop AIDS or ARC unless an effective treatment is found. Because AZT is known
      to prolong survival in patients with AIDS or severe ARC and has acceptable toxicity in
      advanced disease, it is reasonable to try it in less advanced cases.

      Patients entered in the study are randomly assigned to one of two doses of AZT or to placebo
      (inactive medication). Patients take 3 capsules 5 times a day (every 4 hours from 8 am until
      12 pm).

      The capsules contain either AZT or placebo and are identical in appearance so that neither
      patient nor physician knows which treatment the patient is receiving. The higher dose
      corresponds to the dose found to be useful in patients with AIDS or severe ARC. Patients
      visit the clinic every 2 weeks for the first 16 weeks, then once a month after that for
      evaluation. Treatment will continue until the results from the study have been analyzed,
      which could be as long as 3 years. If side effects occur, the dose of study medication will
      be decreased or temporarily stopped. If the side effects are severe, then study medication
      will be stopped permanently.

      AMENDED: Effective with Version 4 (900226), dosing for ALL patients on Phase 2 study drug,
      regardless of CD4+ substudy, will proceed as open-label AZT. Original treatment assignments
      employed in the > 500 cells/mm3 substudy during the period from August 16, 1989 through the
      release of this new version. Also, toxicity management and dose modification of AZT for
      patients receiving Phase 2 study drug have been changed.
