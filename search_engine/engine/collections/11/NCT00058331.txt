        -  Compare the effects of 2 different schedules of epoetin alfa on decreasing transfusion
           requirements in anemic patients with nonmyeloid cancer.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on increasing hemoglobin levels in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on overall quality of life (QOL) and
           anemia-specific components of QOL in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      concurrent chemotherapy or radiotherapy (yes vs no), concurrent platinum-based (cisplatin or
      carboplatin) chemotherapy (yes vs no), degree of anemia (mild [hemoglobin at least 9.0 g/dL]
      vs severe [hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL]), age (60 and under vs over 60), and type of
      neoplasm (plasma cell disorder [including multiple myeloma] or lymphoproliferative disorder
      [including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia] vs all other neoplasms).

      All patients receive epoetin alfa (EPO) subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 3 weeks. Patients
      are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
