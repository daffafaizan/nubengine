      funded Breast Care Center (BCC). Within less than one year the Center was seeing 100 - 200
      new patients per week and making 10 - 20 new diagnoses of breast cancer per month. In 1997 we
      began conducting germline testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 under an approved Navy IRB study. To
      date, 51 individuals have enrolled into the Education and Counseling component, and 42
      individuals have elected to receive germline testing. Early on it became apparent that a more
      time efficient approach to education and counseling would be required if access to
      information on breast cancer genetics was to be made available to a larger population.
      Traditionally, education and counseling has been offered on a one to one basis prior to
      germline testing. Often, hours are spent with an individual. At some centers, multiple visits
      are standard. Not only is there a shortage of health care providers trained in cancer
      genetics, but even if there were an abundance of trained providers, the time and cost, as
      well as need for efficiency would preclude this type of approach. Thus, this approach is not
      applicable to most health care delivery systems. We began offering education in small groups
      approximately 18 months ago, using the same informational content that we use in our one to
      one sessions. Based on preliminary, nonrandomized results, there appeared to be no difference
      in learning and general patient satisfaction based on results of pre- and post-test
      administered before and after the education. It was our contention that group education is
      equivalent, and in some situations better than individual education. Therefore, we will
      conduct a randomized trial designed to test equivalence between individual and group
      education.
