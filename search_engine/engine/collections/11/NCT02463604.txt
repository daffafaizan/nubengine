    
      Contrast medium-induced nephropathy has a big impact on clinical outcomes in patients
      suffering from renal insufficiency who undergo percutaneous coronary interventions.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning is proved to protect myocardium in patients undergoing
      percutaneous coronary angiography.

      We will evaluate the effect of remote preconditioning on renal protection.
