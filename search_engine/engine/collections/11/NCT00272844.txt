      error of cholesterol metabolism, with supplemental cholesterol to determine it effects on
      biochemical sterol metabolites, growth, neuropsychological development, ophthalmologic and
      auditory function, ERG (electroretinogram) parameters, and CNS metabolites as determined by
      brain MRS-imaging. Safety of the supplemental cholesterol suspension is monitored by tests of
      hematologic, renal, and liver function at periodic intervals. There is also a substudy that
      is investigating potential genotype-phenotype correlations, as well as another that studies
      biochemical parameters of light sensitivity in cultured skin fibroblasts from affected
      patients.
