      children and two thirds of adults are overweight or obese. Obesity-related chronic health
      problems originating in childhood are often life-long. Overweight and obesity result from
      detrimental patterns of dietary intake and physical activity. These obesity-producing
      lifestyles are established in childhood and are often carried into adulthood, when they
      become more refractory to change. Research has demonstrated that programs involving parents
      and children in a family context have been the most effective in preventing and treating
      childhood obesity.

      Research Question 1: How many parents and children agree to participate, complete data
      collection and complete at least 80% of the intervention? Research Question 2: What reasons
      are given by those not completing the protocol and what suggestions are offered by those who
      do complete the protocol? Research Question 3: What is the relationship of parent or child
      perceptions of authoritative parenting, child perceptions of family models and support for
      healthy eating, physical activity, or reduced sedentary time, and of parenting stress,
      self-efficacy, confidence, and eating behavior on child BMI? Research Question 4: Do parent
      or child perceptions of authoritative parenting, diet, physical activity, fitness or body
      composition; child perceptions of family models and support for healthy eating, physical
      activity, or reduced sedentary time; or parent perceptions of parenting stress,
      self-efficacy, confidence, and eating behavior change across the study time period? Research
      Question 5: Are there relationships between study completion and child or parent BMI, child
      or parent gender, parenting stress, self-efficacy, confidence, and eating behavior?
