    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study
      conducted in patients traveling to developing regions with a known high incidence of TD.
      Eligibility will be based on a symptom complex that is highly indicative of enteric acute
      bacterial infection without indication of systemic infection.

      Approximately 262 patients will be enrolled in the study and randomized at a 3:1 ratio to
      receive Rifamycin SV MMXÂ® 400 mg or placebo orally twice daily for 3 days (72 hours).
      Treatment will be initiated on the day of Screening (Visit 1, Day 1), within 72 hours of
      onset of diarrhea. Daily doses of study drug will be taken at breakfast time and dinner time
      with a glass of liquid.

      Safety and efficacy will be assessed.

      Blood samples for routine safety tests (chemistry and hematology) will be collected at Visit
      1 and at Visit 3 and sent to a local laboratory for analysis and reporting to the
      Investigator for safety monitoring. Urine samples for routine urinalysis (dipstick only) will
      be collected at Visits 1 and 3, and the results will be used by the Investigator for safety
      monitoring.

      If a patient's diarrhea and/or signs or symptoms of enteric infection worsen in a 24 hour
      interval of time during the treatment period or if the enteric illness fails to improve after
      24 hours or more of therapy, the patient may receive Rescue Therapy. Rescue Therapy will be
      prescribed by the Investigator using local standard empiric therapy and/or guided by pathogen
      identification.
