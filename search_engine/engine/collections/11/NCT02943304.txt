      health problem due to a high prevalence of one of the vectors that transmit the virus, Aedes
      Aegypti, and the severe and sometimes fatal complications that can be generated in the fetus
      of women infected by the virus during their pregnancy. Retrospective studies have shown an
      association with microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum,
      and other anomalies of the central nervous system (CNS). The high risk of neurodevelopmental
      impairment in the exposed newborn is a major concern.

      The epidemiologic and neurobiological evidence supporting the link between infection of
      pregnant women, trimester of infection, and the development of such anomalies in the fetus is
      growing to the extent that the Center for Disease Control has officially made a statement
      supporting this association. Although the dimension of the public health impact is still
      unknown, limited prospective data makes counseling of pregnant women difficult, especially
      when they are considering termination of pregnancy.

      Given that evidence supporting the neurotropic quality of ZIKV and the potential variations
      of the effect the virus may have on the developing fetal brain according to the gestational
      age of infection, we have designed a prospective cohort study to determine whether exposure
      of the fetus to ZIKV in symptomatic mothers results in fetal CNS anomalies and/or impaired
      neurodevelopmental outcome of the newborn. As a secondary aim we will determine the effect
      gestational age has on severity of CNS anomalies and neurodevelopmental outcome.
