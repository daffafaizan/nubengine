      pathogenesis, prognosis, and, more recently, in treatment allocations. Chromosomal anomalies
      can be detected by conventional chromosome banding analyses of bone marrow metaphases and
      most of them are provable by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of circulating CD34+
      progenitor cells from peripheral blood. For this prospective multicenter non-interventional
      diagnostic study sequential FISH analyses are performed on immunomagnetically enriched
      circulating CD34+ cells from peripheral blood as follows: A "super-panel" with the probes
      D7/CEP7, EGR1, CEP8, CEP XY, D20, p53, IGH/BCL2, TEL/AML1, RB1, MLL, 1p36/1q25, CSF1R (all
      AbbottÂ® probes) is used for initial screening, every 12 months during follow-up and in every
      case of suspected progression. A smaller "standard-panel" with the probes EGR1, D7/CEP7,
      CEP8, p53, D20, CEP X/Y, TEL/AML1 - plus if necessary an informative probe of the superpanel-
      was performed for analyses at short intervals every 2 months in the 1st year and every 3
      months during the 2nd and 3rd year. Peripheral blood counts are documented once a month, and
      full blood counts with the number of peripheral blasts are recommended at the time point of
      each FISH analysis. Bone marrow biopsies are not part of the study, but they are recommended
      to be performed every 6 to 12 months in the course of the disease. If a bone marrow biopsy is
      performed, conventional chromosome banding analyses on bone marrow metaphases and,
      additionally, FISH analyses of enriched CD34+ bone marrow cells and non-enriched bone marrow
      cells are performed. The results from peripheral blood are correlated with those of
      conventional banding and FISH analyses performed on bone marrow samples. The aims of this
      study are to detect acqired chromosomal aberrations in MDS patients from peripheral blood, to
      follow these anomalies by frequent analyses, to detect rare aberrations and to observe
      karyotype evolution from peripheral blood.
