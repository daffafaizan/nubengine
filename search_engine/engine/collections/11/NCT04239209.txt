      Minimizing discordance and empowering families to make informed decisions about participants'
      loved one's care is important, but it is unclear how best to communicate prognostic
      information to vulnerable surrogates when a patient is expected to die. Participants are
      randomized to view one of 4 intensivist communication styles in response to the question
      "What do you think is most likely to happen?": 1) a direct response (control), 2) an indirect
      response comparing the patient's condition to other patients, 3) an indirect response
      describing physiology, or 4) redirection to a discussion of patient values and goals.

      The participant will then be asked a series of questions to measure participants'
      interpretation of what the intensivist says.
