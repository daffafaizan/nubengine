      the ratio of experimental group to control group was 1:1. The experimental group received 6
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg / m2 day 1 + cisplatin 25 mg / m2 day 1,
      2, 3), 21 days as a cycle. The control group was treated with TAC (docetaxel 75mg / M2 +
      adriamycin 50mg / M2 + cyclophosphamide 500mg / m2) for 6 cycles, 21 days as a cycle. To
      compare the efficacy and safety of 6*TP (docetaxel + cisplatin) regimen and traditional 6*TAC
      (docetaxel + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) regimen in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of TNBC.
