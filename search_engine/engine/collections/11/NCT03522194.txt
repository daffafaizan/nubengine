      regimes are investigated. Anesthesia is maintained with sevoflurane or propofol. Before
      induction of anesthesia a transthoracic echocardiography is performed to examine systolic and
      diastolic function. Immediately after induction, during maintenance and after completion of
      anesthesia any changes of diastolic function are examined with transthoracic
      echocardiography. All anesthetic medications, fluids, vasoactive medications and
      catecholamines are registered.
