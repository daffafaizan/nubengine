      will be done under ultrasound guidance. Double blind Randomized placebo controlled study will
      be done with following 3 groups. Each group will have 8 people, so, the total patients will
      be 24 people.

        1. Stem cell treatment group : stem cell 0.5cc (Total: 10 million cells) + Fibrin glue
           0.5cc + range of motion exercise

        2. Placebo Comparator (Fibrin) group : Normal saline 0.5cc + Fibrin glue 0.5cc + range of
           motion exercise

        3. Exercise comparator group : Normal saline 0.5cc + Normal saline 0.5cc + range of motion
           exercise

      The investigators will compare the efficacy difference with VAS(visual analog scale, primary
      outcome), ASES(American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) Score, UCLA(University of California,
      Los Angles) Shoulder Score, DASH(The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Score and
      change of hypoechogenic lesion with ultrasonography. These measurement will be done at 6 and
      12 weeks after injections and long-term follow-up will be also planned to 6 months, 12months
      and 24 months.
