      differences in mean percent changes from baseline to end-of-treatment in non-HDL cholesterol
      between placebo and the 2g/day and 4g/day Epanova groups. Baseline is defined as the average
      of Visits 2, 3 and 4 (Weeks -2, -1 and 0) and end-of-treatment is the average of Visits 5 and
      6 (Weeks 5 and 6).
