    
      This is a multi-center, open-label clinical study with separate Dose Escalation and Expansion
      Phases to assess preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ATG-019, a dual inhibitor
      of PAK4 and NAMPT, alone or co-administered with starting dose of 500 mg niacin ER (may be
      titrated to 1,000 mg of daily dose, per label), in patients with advanced solid tumors or
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) for which all standard therapeutic options considered useful by
      the investigator have been exhausted and with PD at study entry. The MTD and RP2D will be
      determined.
