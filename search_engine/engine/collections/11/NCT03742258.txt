    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of TAK-659 when combined
      with R-CHOP in the front-line treatment of high-risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of TAK-659 combined with R-CHOP in the front-line treatment
      of high-risk DLBCL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-659 in combination with R-CHOP.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659.

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride
      IV over 3-5 minutes, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive spleen
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years.
