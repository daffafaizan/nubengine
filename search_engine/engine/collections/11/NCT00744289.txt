      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Australia. Despite the existence of a safe and
      efficacious vaccine, hepatitis B coverage remains low among Australian people who inject
      drugs (PWID) and little is known about attitudes to immunisation, barriers to uptake and
      willingness to participate in vaccine trials among this group. Candidate vaccines for
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV are currently in development and HBV immunisation provides a
      surrogate for examining strategies to deliver vaccines to this group.

      Secondary objectives of this trial are to (i) assess the cost effectiveness of the
      interventions; (ii) identify the correlates of immunity in this group; (iii) assess the
      acceptability of vaccines, including HBV vaccines, barriers to immunisation uptake and
      willingness to participate in vaccine trials among PWID; and (iv) assess hepatitis B-related
      knowledge in this group.

      Research Design: A total of 200 eligible PWID or people at risk of initiating injecting
      (those with no history of exposure to or receipt of more than one vaccination against HBV)
      will be recruited and interviewed prior to randomisation on a 1:1 basis (100 per arm) to
      either the (1) control (standard of care) or (2) incentive conditions. All participants will
      be offered the 3 dose accelerated vaccine schedule (20ug at 0, 7 and 21 days) and will be
      followed up at week 12.
