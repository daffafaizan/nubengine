      malignant liver diseases. The role of HP in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) is controversial.

      This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in non-diabetic dyspeptic patients
      with positive antibody to HP and the evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography. After
      excluding other causes, participants with persistent elevated serum aminotransferase levels
      were presumed to have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than (-0.64) and
      positive urea breath test (UBT) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle
      modification alone or lifestyle modification plus HP eradication groups. Quadruple therapy
      (omeprazole, amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate, and clarithromycin) for HP eradication was
      performed in two weeks. HP eradication was documented by UBT. Liver fat content, fasting
      serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase,
      triglyceride, cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein, HOMA-IR, and anthropometric
      measurements (body mass index and waist circumference) were checked at baseline and six weeks
      post-treatment.
