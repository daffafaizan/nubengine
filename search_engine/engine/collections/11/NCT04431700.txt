    
      A randomized controlled trial of the anti-inflammatory whole food diet versus usual diet for
      the induction of remission in 104 adults with mild-to-moderate Crohn's Disease (CD). The
      anti-inflammatory whole food diet will be compared to participants usual diet for
      understanding its effects on achieving clinical remission, clinical response, reduction in
      serological and fecal markers of inflammation, and improvement in patient-reported outcomes,
      such as physical activity, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, social
      satisfaction, and quality of life. The study will involve collection of blood and fecal
      specimens to evaluate the effects of the anti-inflammatory diet on the gut microbiome,
      bacterial metabolome, innate immune markers, and fecal microRNA profiles. The participants
      will be placed on anti-inflammatory diet for 8 weeks and assessed every 2 weeks for
      adherence.
