      prospective (study following participants forward in time), multi-center study of
      participants with NDO. The initial dose of Oxybutynin ER will be 10 milligram (mg) and will
      be titrated to a maximum of 30 mg. Dosage will be adjusted in 5-mg increments at
      approximately 14-day intervals until continence is achieved or the participant cannot
      tolerate side effects. The duration of participation in the study will be 12 weeks. The study
      will consist of 6 visits: baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. Week 4 and Week 8 will be
      telephone visits. Overall safety and efficacy of Oxybutinin ER will be assessed as well as
      safety and efficacy during the titration and maintenance phases. The efficacy of treatment
      will be assessed using urodynamic parameters (the force and flow of urine) and clinical
      parameters (voiding diary and catheterization [use or insertion of a tubular device to drain
      the bladder] schedules). The quality of life will also be monitored in the study.
