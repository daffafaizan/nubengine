      intervention and also tries to define the best order of administration of these two drugs.
      "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration) has approved ibrutinib and obinutuzumab individually for the treatment
      of patients with Chronic Lymphomcytic Leukemia, your type of cancer. However, the FDA has not
      approved the combination of these two drugs as a treatment for any disease.

      Ibrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is believed to block a type of
      protein called a kinase that helps leukemia cells live and grow. By blocking this, it is
      possible that the study drug will kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.

      Obinutuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. It is believed to attach to a
      protein called CD20 on the outside of a Chronic Lymphomcytic Leukemia cell. By attaching to
      the cell, the antibody can cause the Chronic Lymphomcytic Leukemia cell to die.

      In this research study, the investigators are assessing the safety of various dosing regimens
      of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab. The investigators are trying to determine whether it is better
      to give one drug before the other or if they can be started at the same time.
