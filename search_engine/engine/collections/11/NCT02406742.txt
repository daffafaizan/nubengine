    
      The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 Study are to determine the safety of single agent
      CC-122 and the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of CC-122 when administered in combination with
      ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab to subjects with CLL/SLL. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the PK profiles of subjects administered CC-122 in combination
      with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab, to determine ibrutinib concentrations
      when given alone and in combination with CC-122 and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of
      CC-122 at selected dose levels/regimens.
