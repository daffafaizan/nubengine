      surgical procedures in obesity surgery. Indications are based on patient's age, sex, dietary
      habits, the importance of overweight and associated comorbidities and even if rarely
      admitted, based on knowledge of surgical teams and the cost of interventions. Given the
      decrease of gastric banding procedures, Roux-en-Y gastro-jejunal bypass is often considered
      the reference procedure.

      The gastric bypass, developed in the 60s, is performed laparoscopically since the early 90s.
      It allows for a 60% to 70% excess weight loss with control over 75% of comorbidities. It is
      recommended to follow these patients long-term because late complications can occur. These
      patients require ongoing information and regular monitoring. They must also have a
      hyper-protein diet and a vitamin substitute long-term (multivitamins, vitamin B12, calcium
      ...).

      The Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) arises as an alternative to RYGB. It was classically proposed to
      patients with a BMI greater than 60 and significant comorbidities since the procedure let to
      a significant weight reduction in patients for whom any other procedure was too difficult to
      perform. The quality of the weight loss achieved in these patients has led many teams to
      analyze the results of this intervention without conducting an additional procedure. It
      appears from the literature that even performed alone, SG presents many benefits.

      To clarify the role of sleeve gastrectomy in the bariatric procedures range, the
      investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized study to compare laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
