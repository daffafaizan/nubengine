      controlled, parallel arm study. Patients with AF/AFL will be randomized to one of two doses
      of SSR149744C.

      The efficacy of SSR149744C will be based on the proportion of patients converting to normal
      sinus rhythm at the end of the treatment period (48 hours post first dose).

      Patients will receive the study drug on D1 and D2. Patients not converting pharmacologically
      to sinus rhythm will undergo an electrical cardioversion on D3.
