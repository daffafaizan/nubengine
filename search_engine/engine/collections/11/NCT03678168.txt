      substantial amount of bleeding is expected from rhinology surgeries, ingested blood is known
      to be a power full emetic, and the risk aspiration of blood is present due to the fact that
      an endotracheal tube is not 100% effective in protecting the airway. Post-operative nausea
      and vomiting is a frequent problem that is encountered in surgical patients with a 4th to 6th
      fold increase in nasal and endoscopic sinus operations.

      Posterior throat pack is an often-used in rhinology surgery, it is said to help in protecting
      the air way against aspiration and also helps in the reduction of post-operative nausea and
      vomiting, however many studies concluded that posterior throat pack is associated with higher
      amount of post-operative pain, nausea,, vomiting and in some rare cases even forgotten in the
      patient leading to mortality. However, despite poor evidence the placement of posterior
      throat packs is commonly practiced by surgeons and anesthetists because the possible risk of
      aspiration is worrisome to the latter and the former.

      A conventional throat pack consists of gauze, but an alternative practice involves the
      pharyngeal placement of tampons. In Marais and Prescott posterior pharyngeal placement of
      tampons is associated with a decrease amount of post-operative throat pain, when compared to
      conventional gauze throat packs, however they did not compare the incidence of post-operative
      nausea and vomiting in both groups.
