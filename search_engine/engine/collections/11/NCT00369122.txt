      I. Determine treatment-related serious adverse-event rates and adverse-event rates within the
      first 90 days from treatment start in patients with previously untreated locally advanced
      carcinoma of the cervix treated with bevacizumab, cisplatin, and concurrent pelvic
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate treatment-related serious adverse events and adverse events at any time.

      II. Evaluate disease-free survival (local, regional, or distant failure, or death due to any
      cause).

      III. Evaluate overall survival (death due to any cause). IV. Implement the image-based
      brachytherapy guidelines proposed by the Transatlantic Image-Guided Brachytherapy Working
      Group.

      V. Collect CT scan or MRI-based dosimetry of brachytherapy applications used during the
      course of treatment for later analysis of feasibility and consistency as well as dose/volume
      assessments of tumor control and complications.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo pelvic external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for 5
      weeks for a total of 45 Gy.

      Some patients also undergo low-dose rate brachytherapy twice, 1-3 weeks apart, beginning >= 4
      weeks after initiating EBRT or high-dose rate brachytherapy 5 times, >= 48 hours apart,
      beginning >= 2 weeks after initiating EBRT. EBRT and chemotherapy are halted on the day of
      high-dose rate brachytherapy. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1,
      15, and 29 and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 35.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
