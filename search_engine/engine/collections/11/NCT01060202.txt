    
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy with progression marked by symptoms and
      signs of lowered resistance to infection, skeletal destruction, renal failure, and anemia. It
      is incurable and follows a relapsing course, with a median survival of approximately 4-5
      years. The various therapies associated with disease control, are often associated with
      significant side effects, and ultimately, patients relapse. Therefore, assessment of
      health-related quality of life (HRQL) represents an important tool for evaluating the value
      of effective therapies when weighed against the potential toxic effects of treatment from the
      patient's perspective. Patients diagnosed with MM suffer from pain, fatigue, reduced physical
      and role functioning, and reduced overall HRQL compared with an age- and gender-matched
      population. These symptoms can improve with successful treatment with either cytotoxic
      therapy or supportive care. Many clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma have
      been conducted in Korea, but none of them have evaluated the improvement in the quality of
      life in patients with multiple myeloma. Most study variables used to evaluate the quality of
      life of patients with multiple myeloma are subjective and limited. This study will observe
      the degree of the quality of life of patients in the early status of multiple myeloma before
      and after bortezomib administration by using EORTC-C30 (European Organization for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30) and EQ-5D (EuroQol-5
      Dimensions), validated research instruments used to measure the quality of life in cancer
      patients and consequently will provide fundamental data regarding the quality of life in
      patients with multiple myeloma. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered.
