      trial, with a mixed methods component and process/formative evaluations for stakeholder
      engagement. The study team will evaluate three methods for identifying and risk-stratifying
      individuals at risk of hereditary cancer and providing post-risk stratification longitudinal
      care.

      Hypothesis: The study hypothesis is that Comparator 3 will identify more people at high risk
      of hereditary cancers and result in more screening behaviors, greater resource use, increased
      distress, higher perceived risk of cancer and higher satisfaction.

      Long term objective: At study end, the study will show: 1) each comparator's strengths and
      weaknesses, 2) patient preferences, clinical outcomes, and compliance with each step from
      history collection to screening test completion, 3) the resources needed for each strategy,
      and 4) the contextual factors that impact their sustainability, dissemination and
      implementation. Study findings have high potential for generalizability because: 1) The
      multidisciplinary stakeholder team will help to minimize barriers to dissemination and
      implementation of the investigator's findings in other research settings; 2) Study results
      are independent of study setting; 3) The tested methods of family history assessment can
      occur remotely via paper or electronic interfaces; 4) The care coordination method has
      successful precedent in other disciplines and can be delivered remotely; 5) A process and
      formative evaluation with a diverse stakeholder team will inform sustainability,
      dissemination, and implementation, and result in an implementation guide; 6) The results will
      be relevant for both family history-based and direct-genetic testing strategies for
      population screening for hereditary cancer; 7) The results will inform population screening
      for any disease with hereditary risk.
