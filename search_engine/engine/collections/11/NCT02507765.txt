      I. To establish the feasibility of completing SBRT followed by TACE in a 2 day time period.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine acute tumor perfusion changes after SBRT using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) (magnetic resonance [MR]-dynamic contrast enhanced [DCE]/perfusion weighted
      imaging [PWI], MR-diffusion, blood oxygen level dependent [BOLD] sequences).

      II. To establish safety and tolerability of this regimen. III. To determine overall response
      rates (using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria),
      including objective response rate (partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) and
      clinical benefit rate (stable disease [SD] + PR + CR) at 1, 3, and 6 months after TACE.

      IV. To evaluate local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival at 1, 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months after a single-dose of SBRT followed by TACE.

      V. To correlate micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) biomarkers with response and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of SBRT.

      Patients undergo SBRT on day 1 and TACE on day 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-2 weeks and at 1, 3, 6, 9,
      12, 18, and 24 months.
