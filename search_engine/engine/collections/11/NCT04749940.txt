    
      A prospective single-blind study, where the evaluator is blinded to the treatment. Each
      patient will be dressed with both Aquacel® and PRF dressing. Half of the donor site area will
      be dressed with PRF dressing, and half with Aquacel®.

      3 days after surgery the patients will be asked to complete a VAS questionnaire. A week and 2
      weeks after surgery, patients will have their dressing changed as in the first treatment, and
      will answer VAS(9) and bluebelle(10) questionnaires. The wound will be photographed again for
      follow-up. Three weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery the scar in the donor area will be
      evaluated. The photographs will be shown to the blinded evaluator, to evaluate wound healing
      by epithelialization estimation.
