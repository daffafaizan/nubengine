      direct current (DC) polarization of the frontal lobes, which may be a useful modality for
      treatment of frontal lobe cognitive or behavioral deficits. Our secondary objective is to
      gather preliminary data on whether DC can modulate cognitive and emotion-related functions of
      the frontal lobes in healthy individuals. Study population: 25 healthy volunteers between the
      ages of 18 and 80 will be enrolled. Design: The study is a double-blind crossover study with
      three arms: anodal polarization, cathodal polarization, and sham treatment. Outcome Measures:
      The primary outcome measures are 1) cognitive function as measured with the CalCAP battery or
      2) emotional state as measured with the Profile of Mood States. Secondary outcome measures
      include tests of emotion-based decision making and social cognition.
