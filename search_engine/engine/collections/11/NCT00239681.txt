      on a recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Board and the JUPITER Steering
      Committee, which met on March 29, 2008. The study will be stopped early because there is
      unequivocal evidence of a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality amongst
      patients who received CRESTOR when compared to placebo.
