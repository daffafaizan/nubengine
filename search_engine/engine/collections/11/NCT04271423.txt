      flapless or flap technique. Twelve test patients will receive ridge preservation using a
      flapless approach and twelve control patients will receive ridge preservation using a flap
      technique. All sockets will be grafted with demineralized bone matrix and mineralized
      particulate allograft and covered with calcium sulfate barrier. Re-entry surgery will be
      performed at 4 months when a trephine core will be taken from the grafted site immediately
      prior to implant placement and submitted for histologic processing.
