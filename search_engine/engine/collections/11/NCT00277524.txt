      adoption of evidence based shock-reduction programming strategies. Longer VF NID (number of
      intervals to detect in the VF zone) should be utilized with the Anti-tachycardia Pacing (ATP)
      During Charging Feature. ATP during Charging allows physicians to treat with ATP without
      delay to shock. Therefore, VF NID may be extended to allow episodes the chance to
      self-terminate immediately to shock by use of the ATP during the charging feature.
