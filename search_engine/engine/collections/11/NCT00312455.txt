      depressive and aggressive disorders. In addition, there is also evidence that PUFAs play a
      role in treating substance dependent individuals. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the efficacy of EFA and DPA in treating substance dependent individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 3 grams of n-3 PUFAs or placebo.
      Treatment will last 3 months, followed by an observation period of 3 months. Study visits
      will occur monthly and will last approximately one hour. Study visits will include blood
      tests and a physical exam. Throughout the study, participants will continue to receive
      standard substance abuse treatment and will complete urine tests at regular intervals.
