      As we age, both our blood vessels and heart muscle naturally become stiff and loose their
      ability to flex as the heart beats and blood pressure changes. This is believed to worsen
      both blood vessel and cardiac function in older individuals. The stiffened tissue is likely
      to be less able to adapt to the stresses and remodeling that occur after a heart attack
      (myocardial infarction) because the loss of functional heart tissue predisposes the heart to
      poor function and the hearts blood vessels undergo various changes in order to increase the
      supply of blood to the damaged areas.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      VINTAGE-MI is a randomized, double blind study enrolling patients who have recently suffered
      their first heart attack. There are two recruitment clinics within the Johns Hopkins
      University Network, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.
      Following preliminary testing to establish eligibility and baseline function of both the
      heart and blood vessels, study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      L-Arginine or a placebo pill which is identical except that it does not contain L-Arginine.
      These pills will be taken orally 3 times a day for 6 months. Participants will return to the
      clinic 1, 3, and 6 months after they begin taking their medication to have the same
      functional testing repeated.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
