    
      Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, poorly understood and particularly aggressive
      form of breast cancer characterized by diffuse erythema and edema/peau d orange of the
      breast. The proposed case-control study of risk factors for IBC will include approximately
      400 IBC cases accrued over a two-year period in centers in four countries in North Africa
      (the major cancer center and selected private clinicians in Tunisia, the major cancer center
      in Egypt, 2 cancer centers in Algeria, and 2 cancer centers in Morocco). Two control groups
      will be included: 1) 400 non-IBC breast cancer cases and; 2) 400 visitor controls (excluding
      those with breast, ovarian, endometrial, and nasopharyngeal cancers) in the study hospitals.
      The study will involve the administration of a questionnaire, anthropometric measurements,
      and saliva collection for all study subjects. In addition, digital photographs of the breasts
      will be collected for IBC cases, and a clinical examination form and paraffin-embedded tumor
      tissue will be collected for IBC cases and non-IOBC breast cancer controls. The study will be
      conducted as a consortium, with form development and translation coordinated at the National
      Cancer Institute (USA). A review of study procedures will be done after the first three
      months of data collection. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Division of Cancer
      Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), NCI-Office of International Affairs (OIA), University of
      Michigan, and International Breast Cancer Research Foundation (IBCRF) will provide funding
      for the project.
