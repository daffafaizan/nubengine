      diabetes mellitus in Singapore, and this is set to rise with the increasing prevalence of
      diabetes. DPN is also associated with the greatest reduction in health related quality of
      life (HRQoL) among all diabetic complications, specifically PCS (Physical health Component
      Summary) and its sub-components, physical functioning and physical role. However, there is
      currently no intervention that targets individuals with DPN for improvements in HRQoL and
      functional status.

      The investigators hypothesise that a targeted intervention providing strength and balance
      training will improve HRQoL and functional status in patients with DPN, which will be
      sufficiently large relative to increases in cost to make the intervention cost-efficient.

      The specific aims of the study are to test the effectiveness of a structured strength and
      balance training intervention in 1) improving the physical health component summary (PCS)
      measure of health related quality of life, 2) functional status, and 3) assessing
      cost-utility of the intervention, in individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).
