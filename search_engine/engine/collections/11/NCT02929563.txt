      gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, 60% of critically ill children receive these medications.
      This may have unintended consequences - increasing the risk of nosocomial infections - which
      may be more serious and common than bleeding these drugs are prescribed to prevent. A large
      randomized trial (RCT) is needed to assess the balance of these risks and benefits, to
      determine if a strategy of withholding stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill children is
      not inferior to a strategy of routine stress ulcer prophylaxis. RCTs in pediatric critical
      care are exceptionally challenging to complete; thus, a rigorous pilot RCT is crucial. The
      pilot may prevent pursuit of a trial that is ultimately not feasible - which is ethically and
      financially responsible. It is more likely that this carefully designed pilot trial will
      ensure that the larger trial we undertake is successful.
