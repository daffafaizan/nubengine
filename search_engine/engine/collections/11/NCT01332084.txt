    
      In this pilot study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility of a SOTI (Specific Oral
      Tolerance Induction) with hypoallergenic (H.A.) cereals in children with diagnosed
      IgE-Mediated allergy to wheat.

      This is a multi centre, open, pilot study testing 1 product.10 children of any ethnicity aged
      from 1 to 12 years old with diagnosed allergy to wheat will be eligible to participate in the
      study. The duration of the treatment will be 6 months with a minimum of 1 month of daily
      consumption of the hydrolyzed wheat cereals.

      Each subject will feed with a quantity of the assigned study product according to the SOTI.
      The SOTI will be performed at the hospital under the control of qualified doctors and nurses.

      The study product is administered starting with very low dosages, which are increased
      stepwise every 30 minutes up to an amount equivalent to the usual daily oral intake.
      Thereafter, the study product corresponding to the maximum dose tolerated is given in a
      maintenance dose in one serve every day until the final visit during which a challenge test
      with wheat will be performed to assess the tolerance of whole wheat.
