      illness. In the United States, WN is considered a public health threat because severe illness
      caused by WN infection has caused paralysis, coma, and death, especially in the elderly. This
      study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated chimeric virus,
      WN/DEN4delta30, which is derived from the DEN4 dengue virus and wild-type WN serotypes.

      This study will last at least 32 weeks. Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to
      receive 1X10^4 plaque-forming units (PFU) WN/DEN4delta30 or placebo at study entry and Day
      180. Cohort 2 will be randomly assigned to receive a higher dose of WN/DEN4delta30, 10^5 PFU,
      or placebo at study entry and Day 180. Immediately after receiving their injections,
      participants will be observed for 30 minutes for immediate adverse reactions.

      After each vaccination, participants will be asked to monitor their temperatures three times
      every day for 16 days. Study visits will occur every other day after each vaccination until
      Day 16, followed by three additional visits at selected days through Day 180
      post-vaccination. Blood collection, medical history, vital signs measurement, and a targeted
      physical exam will occur at all visits. Participants will also be required to keep
      temperature diaries until Day 16 after vaccination. Female participants will have a urine
      pregnancy test performed within 60 days of study entry, and on Days 28, 42, 150, 180, 208,
      and 222. Pregnancy prevention counseling will occur at selected visits.
