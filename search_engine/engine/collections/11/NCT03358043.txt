      outcomes of adult mechanically ventilated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
      [defined as a PaO2/FiO2 â‰¤300 mmHg on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O or
      more and FiO2 of 0.3 or more] admitted in a network of hospitals from Wales (U.K.). Although
      there are few previous published observational studies examining the incidence and mortality
      of patients with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, there are no studies specifically
      assessing the epidemiological characteristics, patterns of ventilation and clinical outcomes
      in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the current era of lung protective
      ventilation. This study will be done simultaneously with the PANDORA (NCT03145974) in Spain.

      The study is aimed to improve the knowledge on the epidemiology and outcome of ventilated
      patients, to identify the percentage of patients developing ARDS under the current
      definition, to validate a bedside scoring system for stratification of lung severity, and to
      examine the prognosis of hypoxemic respiratory failure, and risk factors associated with
      fatal outcome.
