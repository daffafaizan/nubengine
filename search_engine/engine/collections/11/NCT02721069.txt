    
      This is a Phase 3, repeat dose, open-label, safety study in Epilepsy subjects who have
      frequent breakthrough seizures or Acute Repetitive Seizures (ARS). NRL-1 will be administered
      as needed to treat bouts of those seizures over a 12-month period of time. Doses will be
      defined as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg based on the subject's body weight. A diary will be
      used to record the seizure and NRL-1 administration.
