      neurodegenerative disorders. Despite some therapeutic benefits from the medications targeting
      at cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways in AD and PD respectively, it remains far away from
      a satisfied treatment goal. DAAOI-P is a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor and an agent
      specific to facilitate NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1). The investigators have demonstrated
      that NMDA-enhancement can help PD-D patients. The aim of this project is to examine the
      effectiveness and safety of DAAOI-P treatment for PD with dementia. In addition to evaluating
      clinical treatment response, multidisciplinary examinations, including
      electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      and psychophysical methods to analyze the changes in perceptual sensitivity to faces, emotion
      expressions, and biological motion recognition will be arranged to elucidate the underlying
      mechanism of NMDA modulation in neurodegenerative disorder.
