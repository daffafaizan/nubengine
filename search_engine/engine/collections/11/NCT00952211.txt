      functioning. These burdens complicate the recovery and rehabilitation from stroke. While
      there may be many contributing factors to these burdens, one factor in particular may be both
      terribly common and yet readily susceptible to intervention. Consistent reports from around
      the world demonstrate that >50% of stroke patients have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a
      disorder that is also associated with fatigue, depressive symptoms, and decreased cognitive
      functioning. OSA is also associated with increases in inflammatory products which themselves
      are associated with the same array of burdens.

      This study will examine inpatients at a stroke rehabilitation center. Patients' sleep will be
      studied. Patients with OSA will be randomized to 10 days treatment double blind with either
      continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) treatment or to sub-therapeutic CPAP treatment.
      After 10 days of treatment, the OSA patients and the stroke patient without OSA will be
      restudied.

      The study will shed light on the impact of OSA on stroke patients' burdens.
