      combat childhood obesity, clinicians and scientists recommend lifestyle interventions that
      include increased physical activity and exercise in an attempt to promote weight loss and,
      consequently, decrease comorbidities associated with excess adiposity. More importantly, it
      appears that the influence of regular exercise may offer children with obesity a multitude of
      health benefits, independent of weight loss. However, the intensity of exercise required to
      elicit significant health benefits is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present
      project is to study the influence of high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on the existing
      inflammatory state found in obesity. Specifically, the proposed project will examine
      endothelial function and markers of inflammation, such as TNFa, IL-6, hsCRP, and adiponectin,
      in children with obesity before and after an exercise intervention. The data will then be
      used to determine if changes in these values differ in magnitude based on the intensity of
      exercise. Children with obesity will be randomized into either moderate exercise or HIIE
      groups, and attend sessions 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The moderate group will cycle
      continuously for 30 minutes at 65%-70% of maximal heart rate and the HIIE group will perform
      ten, 2-minute bouts at 90%-95% of maximal heart rate. Outcome measures of body composition,
      aerobic capacity, blood lipids, glucose metabolism, endothelial function, and inflammation
      will be measured pre- and post-intervention. Results may help in establishing exercise
      protocols not only for children with obesity, but also other inflammatory diseases such as
      diabetes, cancer, and arthritis.
