      s System is a high-volume, automated, blood-screening analyzer that is designed to determine
      the presence of specific antigens and antibodies by using chemiluminescent microparticle
      immunoassay (CMIA) detection technology. The system performs high-throughput routine and stat
      processing that features continuous access and automated retesting.

      The Alinity s System is used for infectious disease marker testing in blood-screening and
      plasma laboratories for the following assays: Anti-HBc, Anti-HCV, HTLV I/II, Chagas, HBsAg,
      HBsAg Confirmatory and HIV Ag/Ab Combo.
