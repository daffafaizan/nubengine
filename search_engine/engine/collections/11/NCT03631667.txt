      Spectrometry (AMS, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) in plasma and urine collected over
      48 hours following oral doses of 50 ng dose (5.4 nCi) alone or with 1250 ng phenanthrene.
      Metabolite profiles and kinetics of elimination are predicted to be consistent with a BaP
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model developed by Pacific Northwest National
      Laboratory (PNNL). A non-smoker, not exposed occupationally, receives 270-700 ng of BaP
      daily; about 95% dietary. The WHO has set an estimated safe daily lifetime (70 year/70 Kg
      individual, cancer endpoint) exposure to BaP of 42-350 ng. This protocol represents de
      minimus risk.
