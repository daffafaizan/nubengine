      retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with gall bladder stones and calcular
      obstructive jaundice as regards operative difficulties, conversion rate, signs of
      inflammation, degree of adhesions, blood loss, postoperative morbidity, and hospital stay.
      Moreover, bacterial examination of bile and culture sensitivity test for assessment of
      bacterial colonization and relate the degree of colonization to timing of laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, to decide upon the
      optimal timing for the surgery.

      The study population will be divided into 2 groups; group (A) will be managed by early
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days after ERCP and group (B) will be managed by
      late LC one month after ERCP.
