      (Anesthesiology. 2018 Oct;129(4):710-720 ) Included patients were all the patients scheduled
      for elective primary total hip or knee arthroplasty and assessed by an anesthesiologist
      involved in the Cross Iron Study. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, age under 18 years old,
      systemic infection, bilateral arthroplasty, revision arthroplasty, and participation in a
      preoperative autologous donation program.

      This was a observational study. The patient blood management program included: erythropoietin
      with iron supplementation if preoperative hemoglobin was lower than 13 g/dl; tranexamic acid
      during surgery; intravenous iron postoperatively and use of prespecified thresholds for
      homologous blood transfusion. Blood transfusion and anemia were assessed until day 5 or
      discharge, whichever came first. Major thromboembolic or cardiovascular events were assessed
      during admission and one month after discharge.
