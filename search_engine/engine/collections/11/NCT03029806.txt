      regulation of blood pressure in African American and Caucasians, focusing on the
      salt-sensitive regulatory enzyme Lysine-specific demethylase 1. This might help us understand
      why some people develop high blood pressure.

      Healthy volunteers will be screened for eligibility and invited to participate in a 2 weeks
      study. Week 1 will be consumption of a low salt diet. Week 2 will be a high salt diet.

      At the end of each week, participants will be admitted to a Clinical Research Center
      overnight and for one day.

      On the CRC, participants will remain fasting and supine overnight and then next morning
      undergo hormonal and vascular testing. This will consist of blood drawing, echocardiogram,
      vascular tonometry, and assessment of renal blood flow before and after a low-dose
      Angiotensin II infusion.

      The study outcome will compare how variants in the LSD1 gene affect hormonal and vascular
      responses according to race. This information will help us determine why some races and
      genetic profiles are more susceptible to detrimental effects of salt in the diet while others
      are protected against these effects.
