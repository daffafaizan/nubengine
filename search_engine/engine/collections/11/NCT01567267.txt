      care decisions. However this demand for autonomy can only be used for shared decision making
      if the patient has basic skills in critical health literacy. To transfer health care literacy
      to young and healthy consumers educational intervention programs at high-school might be a
      feasible and effective way. This preliminary phase 2 study is designed to investigate the
      effect of an educational intervention to be integrated in a curriculum for upcoming teachers
      in biology.
