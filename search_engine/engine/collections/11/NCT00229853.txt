      a diverticulopexy (an additional stitch which holds the ring open and prevents recurrence).
      This is a difficult step to perform through the thoracoscope.

      We plan to review the use of this step, the diverticulopexy, and collect data regarding the
      ease of the procedure and the overall outcome. Once we have accomplished this, we hope to
      present our initial results of this new procedure.
