      To achieve steady state, all subjects are positioned in a semi-recumbent position (30Â°) for
      60 minutes before the start of the intervention and remain in that position during the entire
      investigation. Subjects are instructed to avoid talking and movements during both steady
      state and measurements. Airway suctioning (up to 20 kPa) through the tracheal cannula is
      performed only if there is risk for tube obstruction or if SpO2 decreases below 90%.
      Frequency of airway suctioning, and number of coughs during the study time are registered. An
      extra pre-intervention measurement is performed 15 minutes after the first to increase the
      validity of baseline measurements and control for changes in measured variables due to
      spontaneous variations.

      A PEP device consisting of a one-way valve and exchangeable resistance nipples is used during
      the PEP breathing treatment. The resistance nipple is chosen at the start of the intervention
      aiming at an airway pressure of 10-15 cmH2O during tidal breathing (measured with a
      calibrated manometer). The duration of the PEP treatment is 15 minutes. Complementary oxygen
      is delivered at the same amount as before the intervention.

      Measurements:

      The primary outcome is PaO2. Five separate arterial blood samples of 0.7-1.5 ml each
      (altogether 3.5-7.5 ml for each subject) are drawn from an existing arterial catheter in the
      radial artery in the left or the right arm by nurses at the ward, and directly analysed.

      Subject characteristics are registered from the clinical records, including gender, age, body
      mass index (BMI), smoking history, duration of invasive ventilation, and length of ICU stay.
