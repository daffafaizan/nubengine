      Primary

        -  Determine tumor response to selective internal radiation therapy comprising yttrium Y 90
           resin microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) in patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the health-related quality of life of patients receiving this regimen.

        -  Determine the survival of patients receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo selective internal radiation therapy comprising yttrium Y 90 resin
      microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) via catheter directly into the hepatic artery on day 1.

      Health-related quality of life is assessed prior to initial treatment and then periodically
      thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 12-24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
