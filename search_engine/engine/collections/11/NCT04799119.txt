      fostering atherapeutic partnership between adolescents with developmental disabilities (DD)
      and the participants family dog. The investigators will evaluate imitative 'Do As I Do'
      (DAID) training into a unique Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI) aimed at increasing activity
      levels, enhancing social support by promoting a stronger dog-human bond, and increasing
      feelings of responsibility and wellbeing within this population.

      The investigators propose to address the critical need for empirical evaluation of novel
      theoretically based multi-site animal assisted interventions through the following specific
      aims.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate a novel multi-site DAID dog training intervention to promote
      physical activity in adolescents with developmental disabilities.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a multi-site DAID intervention on the adolescent's
      quality of life and feelings of social wellbeing.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of a multi-site DAID intervention on the child-dog
      relationship and mutual wellbeing.

      Participant Population: Adolescent participants with a developmental disability, between the
      ages of 10-17 years will be recruited through community-based programs/organizations
      associated with children with DDs in around our sites. A DD will be confirmed through parent
      report (e.g., initial recruitment conversations, and documented through the initial
      demographic questionnaire).
