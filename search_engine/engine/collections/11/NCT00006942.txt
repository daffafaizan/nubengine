      I. To estimate the overall response rate and the complete response rate of patients with
      platinum-refractory ovarian cancer who are treated with infusional Bryostatin-1 given in
      combination with intravenous cisplatin.

      II. To estimate the duration of response in these patients. III. To obtain tissue in order to
      evaluate the molecular determinants of apoptosis including: p53 status, WAF1/CIP1 gene
      expression prior to and directly after chemotherapy, bcl-2 gene expression in vivo, bcl-2/bax
      ratio, p21, and the extent of apoptosis determined by the TdT assay; and the molecular
      determinants of DNA damage and repair including: expression levels of ERCC1.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously over 72 hours immediately followed by cisplatin
      IV over 1 hour. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
