    
      Open-Label, Dose-Escalating, Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Phase I Study of PM01183 in
      Patients with Advanced Acute Leukemia to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 administered as 1-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on three
      consecutive days (Days 1-3) to patients with advanced acute leukemia and to assess the safety
      profile and tolerability, to obtain preliminary information on the efficacy and to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomic (PGx) profile of PM01183.
