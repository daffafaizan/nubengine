      related to swallowing, called transient. These transient lower esophageal sphincter
      relaxations (tLESR) are generally triggered by gastric distension and its physiological
      purpose is to vent the stomach. The gastric accommodation is a physiological process in which
      the gastric fundus actively relaxes during a meal in order to accommodate it.

      This study is driven by the hypothesis that impairment of the gastric accommodation may
      facilitate triggering tLESR and, therefore, reflux events. We aim to evaluate the relation
      between gastric fundic relaxation and the number of gastroesophageal reflux events in
      children. We also aim to evaluate if there is a relation between the gastric emptying and the
      number of reflux episodes.
