      Their advantages are their acceptable fracture resistance, excellent biocompatibility,
      moderate opacity, etc. Because the increase in demand for more esthetic restoration, various
      ceramic materials have been used as a core material for several all-ceramic systems. Their
      properties have been investigated extensively in many in vitro studies. Currently, there are
      not much results regarding clinical performance and wear mechanism of ceramic-based
      prosthesis and more information are required for future research.
