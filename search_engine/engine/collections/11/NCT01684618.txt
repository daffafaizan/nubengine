      cerebral hypoxia is considered to have an important role. The preterm infants are at
      increased risk of respiratory distress, episodes with low oxygenation, mechanical
      ventilation, risk of hypocapnia and labile or low blood pressure. These conditions can affect
      the microcirculation and hence the oxygenation of the brain. Hyperoxia is also a point of
      interest, since high levels of oxygen can cause vasoconstriction. Preterm infants is often
      treated with CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure), but the effect of different flow
      pressures on the regional cerebral oxygenation is not known.

      The investigators will examine the normal physiological response of the brain in a group of
      preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) of 32-37 weeks and a group of term infants to the
      commonly used treatment in neonatology, CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure).

      The investigators will do dynamic research with continuously monitoring of the cerebral
      oxygenation using the INVOS® Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter (Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS)).
      INVOS® is the first NIRS-based oximeter CE-approved for hospital use in Denmark.

      There will be no follow-up.
