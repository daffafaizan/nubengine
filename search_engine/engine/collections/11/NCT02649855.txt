    
      Background:

        -  A phase III trial demonstrated that combining docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy
           (ADT) significantly improved survival (57.6 vs 44.0 months (HR=0.56, (0.44-0.70), p
           <0.0001) for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).

        -  PROSTVAC (developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian
           Nordic Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for
           prostate cancer.

        -  Preclinical and clinical studies support the potential synergy in the combination of
           docetaxel and PROSTVAC. The potential to combine docetaxel with vaccine in mCSPC could
           improve upon the survival advantage that has been previously seen.

      Objectives:

      Primary

      -To determine if PROSTVAC combined with docetaxel is able to induce greater antigen spreading
      (i.e. a broader immune response) with greater associated response score compared to docetaxel
      alone after 19 weeks.

      Key Eligibility Criteria:

        -  Must have castrate sensitive prostate cancer (rising PSA and testosterone over 100) or
           is within 134 days of starting ADT (Arm A or B) or within 28 days of start ADT (Arm C)

        -  Histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer

        -  Patients must have metastatic disease

        -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria

        -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function

      Design

        -  This is a randomized trial of ADT followed by simultaneous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3 weeks
           x 6 cycles + PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles versus ADT followed by sequential docetaxel 75
           mg/m(2) q3 weeks x 6 cycles followed by PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles in men with newly
           diagnosed mCSPC.

        -  Patients who have not started ADT or who have been on ADT 28 days or fewer will be
           assigned to treatment with PROSTVAC for 4 - 6 injections followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2
           q3 weeks x 6 cycles.
