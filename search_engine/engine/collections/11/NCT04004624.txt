      and identification of its isthmus, however this is uncommonly accomplished due to hemodynamic
      non-tolerance and limited temporal and spatial resolution. Substrate mapping has been
      developed as an alternative method to identify the isthmus of post-infarction VT during sinus
      rhythm (SR). However, it has limited specificity to critical VT sites.

      Fundamental work in animal models of healed infarction and humans has shown that the VT
      isthmus corresponds to locations characterized by marked activation slowing during SR.
      Furthermore, these locations serve as "anchors" for multiple VT morphologies and cycle
      lengths.

      The hypothesis of this study is that activation mapping during SR or pacing can improve the
      specifically for identifying the critical VT sites.

      The aim of this prospective, multi-center controlled study is to evaluate the utility and
      limitations of functional mapping for guiding ablation of reentry vulnerably zones for
      long-term control of VT
