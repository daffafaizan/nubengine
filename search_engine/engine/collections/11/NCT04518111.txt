    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of medial UKA and HTO in the treatment
      of AMOA by investigating the performance of these 2 procedures in terms of functional
      outcome, radiographic assessment, range of motion, postoperative complications, revision rate
      and relevant health economics outcome, then identify factors associated with better clinical
      performance. It is aimed to provide evidence-based guidelines for selecting the appropriate
      procedure in managing AMOA in Chinese population based on the findings of this study.

      The secondary endpoints will include:

        1. Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)

        2. SF-12 Health Survey

        3. Radiographic assessment includes pre-op and post-op mechanical femorotibial angle
           (mFTA), patella height, patellofemoral medial and lateral articular surfaces, and
           displacement angle of patella

        4. Range of motion

        5. Adverse event rate and classification (including complication)

        6. Operating time

        7. Total blood loss (BRECHER formula)

        8. Revision rate

      Health economic outcomes based on hospital discharge days, recovery time, physiotherapy and
      complications/ reoperations will also be analyzed.
