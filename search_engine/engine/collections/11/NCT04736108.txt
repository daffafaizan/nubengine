    
      IDC-P is an adverse pathological entity of prostate cancer, characterized by the growth of
      malignant cells in pre-existing prostatic ducts and acini, and is present in high-grade
      disease and associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown that IDC-P was
      significantly associated with an adverse clinical course in patients who received radical
      prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and the presence of IDC-P on the biopsy specimen was
      associated with a poor prognosis in terms of overall survival (OS) and a poor docetaxel
      response in patients with distant metastasis at the initial diagnosis. Our previous
      researches as well as other published data indicated that abiraterone had a better
      therapeutic efficacy than docetaxel as the first-line therapy in metastatic castration
      resistance prostate cancer（mCRPC）with IDC-P. Therefore we intended to perform this single-arm
      phase II clinical trial to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate
      Plus ADT as neoadjuvant therapy for high-risk localized prostate cancer with IDC-P. The
      primary endpoint is the pathologic complete response (pCR).
