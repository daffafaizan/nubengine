      progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistances leading to cardiac failure and death.
      Patients with PH are categorized in two major groups: primary PH (PPH) wich is idiopathic,
      and secondary PH associated with many conditions such as chronic pulmonary embolic diseases
      (CPED).Increase in vascular resistance in PH is secondary to vasoconstriction and to a
      proliferative remodeling process of the arterial wall leading to obliteration of the small
      arterioles. On the other hand, hypoxemia is known to cause similar changes in vascular
      architecture. Also, some small cohorts study in the literature mentioned an increase of sleep
      hypoxemia prevalence accounting for almost 70% of cases. The mechanisms of this hypoxemia are
      completely unknown.Our study is observational, prospective and transversal, searching for
      hypoxemic respiratory sleep disorders (HRSD) in PPH and in CPEPH. Included patients will have
      one night polysomnography (CIDELEC) with a continuous measurement of transcutaneous PCO2.The
      major objectives are to determine the prevalence of HRSD, their physiopathologic mechanisms
      and their possible causal factors according to PH history, clinical findings and hemodynamic
      severity.
