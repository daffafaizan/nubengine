      treatments for localized prostate cancer. Prostate was initially thought to be a non-moving
      target, but the newest reports have raised the contrary as evidence. Image-guided
      radiotherapy (IGRT) is a current standard treatment for localized prostate cancer which
      enables to take into account interfractional prostate motion before treatment.

      The Calypso® System (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) is a recent technology
      using electromagnetic transponders implanted within the prostate. It is a real-time target
      tracking system that takes into account both inter- and intrafractional target motion. So the
      exact position and movement of the prostate can be determined during radiation therapy
      treatment.

      As Planned Target Volume (PTV) margins integrate set-up margins and the management of organ
      motion, margin reduction can reasonably be considered in case of target motion management
      improvement.

      To date, no prospective randomized clinical data is available using this technique for the
      treatment of low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients with modern standard
      fractionation radiotherapy and image guidance.

      The aim of this study is to assess pelvic late toxicity rate after intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) when using the Calypso® System with a reduction of treatment margins. In
      this randomized study, patients will receive IGRT treatment using the Calypso system or a
      conventional IGRT treatment.
