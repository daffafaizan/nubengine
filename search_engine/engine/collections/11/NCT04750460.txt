      secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis-dependent patients. It is known to be associated
      with significant drop of parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level after surgery. Thus, in the present
      study we test the hypothesis that reducing iPTH difference before/after PTx with teriparatide
      injections immediately after surgery may alleviate clinical course of post-PTx hypocalcemia.

      This is a feasible study aimed to determine the sample size for further large-scale trial.
