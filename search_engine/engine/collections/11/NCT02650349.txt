      will be obtained at baseline, prior to trial implantation of SCS. At trial implantation a
      Vectris® SureScan® MRI 1x8 lead will be implanted, targeted by intraoperative mapping. This
      lead will be connected to a temporary extension cable and ENS.

      Normal trial period will be respected based on the reimbursement rules in Belgium (4 weeks).
      When the patient is eligible for implantation of the definitive SCS system (more than 50%
      pain reduction and/or more than 50% reduction in pain medication), patient will undergo
      surgery for definitive implantation. Then the Vectris® SureScan® MRI lead will be connected
      to a RestoreSensor® SureScan® MRI neurostimulator.

      After stabilisation of the stimulation parameters at least for more than 1 month, the second
      session of neuroimaging will occur (T1) with the RestoreSensor® SureScan® MRI neurostimulator
      in MRI mode. Minimal one month later ( 2 months after implantation of definitive SCS system)
      the patient will undergo the last session of neuroimaging (T2) with the stimulator in MRI
      mode. During that period prior to the MR-session, a new protocol will occur with paresthesia
      free high density SCS. The MRI protocol will occur after stabilisation of the stimulation
      parameters at least for more than 1 month. During the whole period, patients will fill in a
      VAS diary (back and leg pain separately) and at time of neuroimaging T1 and T2 a Likert-scale
      in order to evaluate the satisfaction grade of the patient. Additionally, patients will also
      wear during the whole period an Actiwatch, measuring sleep patterns and filling in
      questionnaires at B, T1 and T2 (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Holland Sleep
      Disorders Questionnaire (HSDQ).
