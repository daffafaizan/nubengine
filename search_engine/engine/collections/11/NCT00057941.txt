      I. Evaluate the antitumor activity of anastrozole given in combination with the EGFR tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor ZD1839, and of fulvestrant given in combination with the EGFR tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor ZD1839.

      II. Evaluate the safety of anastrozole given in combination with ZD1839 and fulvestrant given
      in combination with ZD1839.

      III. Evaluate the interaction of biological characteristics that predict for response of
      breast cancer to treatment with anastrozole and ZD1839 and with fulvestrant and ZD1839.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      hormonal therapy (yes vs. no) and dominant site of disease (soft tissue/lymph nodes vs. bone
      vs. visceral). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral anastrozole and oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28.

      Arm II: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1 and oral gefitinib once daily
      on days 1-28.

      Courses in both arms repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
