      transplantations with hematopoietic-cells from another person. It is estimated that over 75%
      of these patients will develop an infectious complication, of which approximately one third
      can be life-threatening. A significant proportion of these infections are caused by
      opportunistic viruses, such as BK virus.

      This virus establishes latent infection in most individuals, but does not normally cause
      disease. It can reactivate after hematopoietic-cell transplantation and represents the second
      most common viral infection in this patient population. BK virus is associated with kidney
      failure and a decreased chance of survival after hematopoietic-cell transplantation. There
      are no effective antiviral treatments for this disease.

      Despite being the second most common cause of clinical disease hematopoietic-cell
      transplantation, very little is known about this virus. To address this knowledge gap, the
      investigators aim to study patients with confirmed BK virus disease post allogeneic
      hematopoietic-cell transplantation.

      As part of this study, regular urine and blood tests will be done to understand how the virus
      behaves over time and which organs it affects. Blood and urine samples will also be obtained
      to study how the immune system rebuilds itself after hematopoietic-cell transplantation.
      Finally, an ultrasound of the kidneys and the bladder will be done to evaluate for any
      presence of disease in these organs.
