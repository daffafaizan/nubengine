      caused by bacteria on the skin being injected within tissue. Alcohol has been shown to be a
      good disinfectant, reducing the number of bacteria on skin by 47-91%. However, in previous
      clinical trials, there has been no clinical impact of using or not using alcohol swabs on
      infections and infection symptoms calling into question the practice of using it prior to all
      injections. These studies, however, are generally of low scientific rigor (e.g., not
      randomized, not blinded, did not use standard case definitions of the adverse reactions being
      measured). Moreover, it is important to note that none of them specifically evaluated vaccine
      injections, the most common type of injection worldwide.

      At present, based on the available evidence base, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
      Centre for Disease Control (CDC) do not recommend the use of alcohol swabs before vaccine
      injections. As a result, immunizers in many countries around the world currently do not
      cleanse the skin with alcohol prior to vaccination. Despite these recommendations, clinicians
      in our community and across Canada commonly use alcohol swabs prior to all vaccine
      injections. In this application, investigators will undertake a pilot randomized study to
      evaluate the incidence of infection symptoms and infections in children undergoing
      vaccination with and without skin cleansing with alcohol swabs.
