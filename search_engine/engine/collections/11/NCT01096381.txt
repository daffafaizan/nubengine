      Primary

        -  To measure the endothelial function over time, including non-invasive assessment of
           digital-pulse amplitude via Endo-pat test, serum tPA, PAI-1, VEGF, urine TXa2, and
           PGI-M, in patients with solid malignancies treated with chemotherapy with or without
           bevacizumab.

        -  To compare endothelial function changes between patients who develop hypertension (HTN)
           versus patients who do not develop HTN.

      Secondary

        -  To compare circulating soluble cytokines, proangiogenic factors, glucose tolerance, and
           cardiac biomarkers over time in these patients.

        -  To compare endothelial progenitor cell levels pre- and post-bevacizumab in these
           patients.

        -  To assess whether physical fitness level at baseline and at 3 months after treatment
           initiation (assessed subjectively by questionnaire) correlates with relative risk of
           developing NCI grade â‰¥ I cardiotoxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo 24-hour blood pressure monitoring at baseline, before second
      bevacizumab therapy, and periodically during study. Patients also undergo a digital-pulse
      amplitude measurement periodically during study.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for circulating soluble
      cytokines, proangiogenic factors, glucose tolerance, cardiac biomarkers, and endothelial
      progenitor cell level studies. Patients also undergo 24-hour urine sample collection at
      baseline and periodically during study for protein, creatinine, and metabolites of
      prostacyclin and thromboxane.

      Patients complete physical activity questionnaires at baseline and at 3 months.
