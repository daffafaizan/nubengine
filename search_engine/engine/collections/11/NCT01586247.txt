      8g/day), B. lactis BI07 (administered at 109 CFU/day) and the synbiotic (8g/day of GOS and
      109 CFU/day of B. lactis BI07) on the human gut microbiota.

      A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study will be conducted in 40
      healthy older (â‰¥60 years of age) volunteers. The placebo will consist of maltodextrin (a food
      grade ingredient, administered at 8g/day).

      Changes in the gut microbiota will be determined by measuring bacterial population levels in
      human faeces using 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes and fluorescence in situ
      hybridisation. Faecal pH will be measured and the production of short chain fatty acids
      (SCFA) will be analysed and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

      The secondary objective of this study is to examine the effect on cellular immune function.
      This will be achieved by investigating phagocytosis activity, natural killer cells which are
      CD4+, CD8+, CD25+ and CD2+ and CD3+ subsets, the marker of T-cell maturation period.,
      salivary IgA levels, inflammatory markers (plasma - tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL6, IL1,
      chemokines and soluble adhesion molecules).
