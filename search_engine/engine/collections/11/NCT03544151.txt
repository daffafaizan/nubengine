      right internal jugular vein catheter using Swan-Ganz Continuous Cardiac Output
      Thermodilutioon Cather (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo V).The investigators measure the distance between
      the insertion point and the junction between right atrium and superior vena cava using
      Swan-Ganz CCOmbo V.
