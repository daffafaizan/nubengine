      improve upper extremity (UE) function resulting from neuroplasticity changes in the motor
      cortex. However, the necessary and sufficient parameters of this therapy in humans have not
      been fully investigated. Delineation of the most efficacious and efficient therapy for
      promoting UE recovery post-stroke is necessary before effective clinical implementation of
      this therapy. The current compared the effects on motor function impairments for three
      bilateral movement groups involving two doses of treatment (i.e., bilateral training coupled
      with neuromuscular electrical stimulation) and a sham control. During the subacute recovery
      phase (3 - 6 months), patients who meet motor capabilities criteria will be randomly assigned
      to one of three groups: (a) low intensity: 90 minutes/session, 2 sessions/week 2 weeks;
      bilateral movement training coupled with active neuromuscular stimulation on the impaired
      wrist/fingers; (b) high intensity: 90 minutes/session, 4 sessions/week for 2 weeks; bilateral
      movement training coupled with active stimulation on the impaired wrist/finger extensors; and
      (c) control group (sham active stimulation). Patients' UE motor capabilities were assessed
      before treatment therapy began (pretest) and within the first week after the treatment
      therapy ended (posttest).
