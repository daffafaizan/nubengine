      angiogenesis. Animal studies have shown that endostatin is capable of blocking the
      proliferation and organization of endothelial cells into new blood vessels in vitro and
      inhibiting angiogenesis and growth of both primary tumors and secondary metastasis. Regarding
      breast cancer, in vivo studies showed that the combination of paclitaxel and P125A-endostatin
      inhibited mammary cancer growth, delayed the onset of multifocal mammary adenocarcinomas,
      decreased tumor angiogenesis, increased the survival of treated mice in the prevention model,
      and inhibited lung and lymph node metastasis in the intervention model. Moreover, in a
      prospective, randomized, controlled, phase II neoadjuvant trial, the combination of
      rh-endostatin with chemotherapy produced a higher tumor response rate without increasing
      toxicity in breast cancer patients. Considering these promising data, this prospective study
      was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostar combined with taxane-based
      regimens for HER-2-negative MBC patients.
