      with subunit envelope proteins offers the most promising strategy to date for a safe and
      immunogenic vaccine in humans. This study will further examine the combination vaccine
      approach and define an optimal prime-boost strategy.

      Healthy volunteers are randomized to one of eight groups. All patients receive initial
      immunization with HIVAC-1e, followed by two boosts at months 8 and 12 of rgp120/HIV-1SF2
      (BIOCINE), rgp120/HIV-1IIIB (Genentech), rgp120/HIV-1MN (Genentech), or gp160 MN (Immuno-AG).
      Additionally, half of the patients in each subunit vaccine group receive a repriming with
      HIVAC-1e at month 4. Subjects are followed for 18 months.
