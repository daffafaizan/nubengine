        -  The first part is the Efficacy Study mainly designed to evaluate the frequency and
           severity of vasomotor symptoms [VMS] in both hysterectomized and non hysterectomized
           postmenopausal participants after treatment with two doses of E4 (15 mg or 20 mg) or
           placebo for 12 consecutive weeks. Thereafter treatment will proceed for a total duration
           of 52 weeks, to continue the evaluation of secondary efficacy, safety and the effect on
           the endometrium. For endometrial protection, all non-hysterectomized subjects will
           receive treatment with 200 mg progesterone (P4) once daily for 14 consecutive days,
           after completion of the E4/placebo treatment.

        -  The second part is the Safety Study designed to evaluate the general safety, secondary
           efficacy (Lipid, glucose metabolism, health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and
           treatment satisfaction [TS]) after treatment with E4 20 mg for one year in
           hysterectomized postmenopausal participants."
