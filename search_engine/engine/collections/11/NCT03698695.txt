    
      This is a double-blind, 3-arm, parallel group study of 15 days duration including a
      scopolamine challenge at D15. Healthy male subjects will receive daily doses of THN201
      (donepezil 5 mg and mefloquine), donepezil 5 mg or placebo and one subcutaneous injection of
      scopolamine 0.5 mg on D15. Cognitive function, EEG and P300 will be assessed at baseline and
      before and after scopolamine challenge at D15. A final safety evaluation will be performed 2
      weeks after the end of the treatment period. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed to
      obtain a time/concentration profile of donepezil and mefloquine.
