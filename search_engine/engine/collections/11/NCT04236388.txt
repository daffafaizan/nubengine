      proof-of-concept for the efficacy of ketone supplementation in reducing blood pressure and
      improving vascular and cognitive function in older adults; 2) Establish proficiency and
      feasibility with the proposed cognitive function measurements; and 3) Obtain preliminary data
      for effect size generation.

      Background: Age is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Middle age is a
      vulnerable period where cardiovascular risk factors, such as BP, begin to emerge and signs
      and symptoms of disease first becomes evident. Hypertension is present in 60-75% of adults in
      this demographic and associated with vascular dysfunction and cognitive decline. Low
      Carbohydrate High Fat (LCHF) ketogenic diets have become increasingly popular for improving
      cardiometabolic health but adherence is suboptimal due to their restrictive nature.
      Supplementation with ketone drinks increase plasma Î²-hydroxybutyrate and mimics the metabolic
      effects of LCHF ketogenic diets as well as lowers BP and improves vascular and cognitive
      function in rodent models. Whether ketone supplementation lowers BP and improves vascular and
      cognitive health in humans of any age is unknown.

      Approach: A double-blind randomized 2x2 crossover design with 2 repeated measures in each
      period will be used. Pre-/post-test evaluation in each period will be used to evaluate the
      benefits to vascular and cognitive health ingestion with consumption of a ketone
      drink/placebo drink.
