      test the effectiveness of the final intervention video.

      Participants in the RT will complete the "Enrollment Questionnaire" and then will be
      randomized to either watch a short video on 1) debiasing about LARC safety (intervention arm;
      n=110) or 2) vector control (control arm; n=110) (Figure 2). Participants then will have the
      option of receiving routine contraceptive services that follow standard care. After three
      months, trained interviewers will contact participants to administer the short "Follow-up
      Questionnaire" via telephone. To corroborate participant reporting of contraception use
      during follow-up, the investigators also will extract data on LARC use from participant
      medical records.
