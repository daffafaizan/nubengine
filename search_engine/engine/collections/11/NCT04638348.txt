      electromyography (EMG) biofeedback via vaginal probe in the treatment of urinary incontinence
      and that of the newly developed EMG biofeedback with Bluetooth; (2) to investigate the
      effects of conventional biofeedback, the new biofeedback, and pelvic floor muscle training
      (PFMT) alone on urinary incontinence and adherence to PFMT.

      Hypotheses: (1) The new biofeedback will be easier to use and women will more readily accept
      it than the conventional biofeedback. (2) Women assigned to the new biofeedback group will
      report better adherence to PFMT and greater improvements in urinary incontinence than women
      assigned to participate in the conventional biofeedback group.

      Design and subjects: A three-armed randomized pilot trial will be conducted with 51 women who
      have stress urinary incontinence.

      Interventions: Women will be randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups (new
      biofeedback or conventional biofeedback) or the control group (PFMT alone). Women in the
      intervention groups will perform PFMT either with the new biofeedback or the conventional
      biofeedback, based on their group allocation. The control group will perform PFMT without a
      biofeedback device.

      Outcome measures: Feasibility measures, International Consultation on Incontinence
      Questionnaire, and 1-hour pad test.

      Data analysis and expected results: A one-way between-groups analysis of covariance will be
      conducted. Adherence to PFMT will be better in the new biofeedback group than in the
      conventional biofeedback group. New biofeedback will have greater beneficial effects on
      urinary incontinence than either the conventional biofeedback or PFMT alone.
