    
      Aim of the program is to describe effectiveness and tolerability of systemic pharmacotherapy
      as a part of combination therapy and its effect on the overall treatment outcomes in patients
      with venous ulcers (CEAP classes C6) treated in real clinical settings.

      The planned number of patients is 350.

      The inclusion period lasts for 6 months. The treatment will be consistent with routine
      clinical practice, local label for the medical use of drugs and the specific clinical
      situation. The following objective methods will be used to assess the changes in the skin
      condition:

        -  measurement of the area of reference ulcer (using LesionMeter*) before and after the
           treatment;

        -  changes in status localis.

        -  The presence and location of venous reflux and/or occlusion. The study does not
           implicate any intervention to routine management of patients with chronic venous disease
           (CVD). In particular, in this study the parameters that are usually evaluated during the
           examination of patients with classes C6 CVD (CEAP) will be recorded. Special attention
           will be paid to evaluating changes of the area of referent VU using objective methods
           (measuring ulcer area using LesionMeter, time to ulcer healing).

             -  LesionMeter is a generally available tool for measuring the venous ulcer area.
