    
      This is a single-center observational cohort study that follows the use of treatment with
      siltuximab in patients with COVID-19 who have developed serious respiratory complications,
      defined by the need of ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive). Retrospective data
      collection will be carried out on those patients who have received siltuximab as a treatment
      for their Covid-19 and patients enrolled in ReCOVID19-2020, a retrospective study enrolling
      consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (interstitial pneumonia and
      positive test for SARS-COV-2) and who received standard treatment and who were hospitalized
      from 23 February up to 13 March 2020 at Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital.

      The control cohort of the cohort study will include all the patients with pneumonia/ARDS in
      need of non-invasive ventilation (CPAP or NIV) or intubation and not receiving experimental
      treatments in the ReCOVID-19-2020.Patients that will be included will be divided into 2
      cohorts, and per current estimation split in a 3:1 ratio: 75% will be in Cohort A as treated
      with CPAP/NIV, while 25% will form Cohort B and consists of patients in an ICU setting who
      are receiving mechanical ventilation.

      Procedures outlined in this protocol are based on how the patients were managed as per
      clinicians' best judgement and best practice. No clinical procedures are required by this
      observational protocol. Data on the procedures already performed during the routine diagnosis
      and treatment of COVID-19 patients will be collected. The list of clinical and laboratory
      parameters is provided to direct data collection for this observational study (as available
      in the medical records).

      During their hospitalization, patients will be monitored as per standard hospital practice or
      as per national (emergency) guidelines in accordance with extraordinary circumstances
      relating to the COVID-19 outbreak. After discharge, patients will be asked to provide (from
      their primary health care providers) relevant laboratory results and safety information for
      approximately 30 days following the start of COVID-19 treatment via ventilation (either
      mechanical or non-invasive).
