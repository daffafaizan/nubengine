    
      Adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
      receive blinatumomab or 1 of 4 pre-specified, investigator-chosen, SOC chemotherapy regimens.
      Randomization was stratified by age (< 35 years vs â‰¥ 35 years of age), prior salvage therapy
      (yes vs no), and prior allogeneic HSCT (yes vs no) as assessed at the time of consent.

      The study consisted of up to a 3-week screening and pre-phase period, a treatment period
      consisting of induction with 2 cycles of either blinatumomab or SOC chemotherapy, a
      consolidation phase of up to 3 additional cycles of protocol-specified therapy, and a
      maintenance phase for up to an additional 12 months with protocol-specified therapy. A safety
      follow-up visit 30 days after the last dose of protocol-specified therapy and a long-term
      follow-up period were included. The long-term follow-up part of the study was discontinued
      prematurely based on a recommendation from the data monitoring committee (DMC) that the study
      be stopped for benefit.
