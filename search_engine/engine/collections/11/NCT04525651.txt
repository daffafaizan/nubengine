      previous stage, the acupuncture manipulation acquisition system is used to compare and
      analyze the analog waves output by the experts' acupuncture manipulation and the manipulative
      therapeutic apparatus in the system data analysis module, in order to verify the consistency
      of bioelectric signals of different reinforcing and reducing manipulation of acupuncture and
      experts' manipulation. The biocompatibility of shock wave was detected by Massachusetts
      General Hospital Needle sensation scale ((Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture
      Sensation Scale, MASS)). The visual analogue pain score ((Visual analogue scale, VAS)), neck
      disability index scale ((Neck Disability Index,NDI) and short form 36-item questionnaire
      (SF-36) were used to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the instrument in the
      treatment of cervical pain in cervical Spondylotic radiculopathy, and the appropriate
      syndrome type of the scheme was studied.
