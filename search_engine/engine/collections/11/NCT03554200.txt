    
      In the present study patients will be randomized into 2 groups (standard of care +
      Empagliflozin 10 mg/d or standard of care + placebo). Cardiac output will be assessed by a
      medical device for noninvasive monitoring of hemodynamic parameters (cardiac output, systemic
      vascular resistance, stroke volume and blood pressure) using finger cuff technology for pulse
      contour analysis.

      These investigations will inform about Empagliflozin dependent effects on hemodynamic and
      cardiac function in patients with acute heart failure. The investigation will further assess
      the therapeutic efficacy of Empagliflozin on heart failure symptoms using objective
      (respiratory rate, oxygen requirement, peak expiratory flow rate, urinary volume, body
      weight, diuretic requirement, length of hospital stay) and well accepted, patient orientated
      secondary endpoints. In addition, metabolic regulators and parameters relevant for cardiac
      function and substrate metabolism will be assessed to further investigate possible mechanisms
      of Empagliflozin-dependent actions on cardiac function.
