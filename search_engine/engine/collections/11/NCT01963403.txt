    
      Women who are experiencing irregular and/or heavy bleeding associated with the use of an
      etonogestrel (ETG) implant will be recruited for this study. Women who have bothersome
      bleeding will be randomized to use either a combined oral contraceptive pill or a placebo
      pill.

      Participants will take one pill every day and record their bleeding patterns on a daily
      diary.

      Participants will have one screening/enrollment visit, two in-person follow up visits, and
      one telephone follow up contact. Subjects will be enrolled for a total of 84 days (three
      months).

      Participants will be assigned to a treatment group at her screening/enrollment visit. Her
      first follow up visit will occur 22-28 days after her enrollment. Participants can choose to:

        -  Continue use of assigned treatment medication

        -  Discontinue use of assigned treatment medication, but use an open-label combined oral
           contraceptive pill

        -  Discontinue the use of assigned treatment medication, decline use of an open-label
           combined oral contraceptive pill

        -  Discontinue use of ETG implant.

      Participants who choose to continue use of ETG implant will have a follow up telephone
      contact 50-56 days after her enrollment visit. A final in-person visit will occur 78-84 days
      after enrollment. Bleeding patterns will be assessed by daily bleeding diaries completed by
      the participant.
