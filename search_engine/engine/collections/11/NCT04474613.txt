      mutations will be considered for this study. The primary objective of this prospective study
      is to examine if using liquid biopsy can reduce time to treatment (TTT) in external
      participants with NSCLC. Secondary objectives examined will include time to actionable
      genetic testing results (ctDNA or tissue), rate of actionable biomarker discovery, and rate
      of appropriate guideline-directed therapy based upon testing results.

      A liquid biopsy is a test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer cells. A traditional
      biopsy, which requires tissue to be removed from the body, takes 14 days to be tested. A
      liquid biopsy takes 7 days which significantly shortens the TTT for those diagnosed with
      NSCLC. By studying this, doctors may be better able to determine if this will be beneficial
      and result in less time taken to treat cancer.
