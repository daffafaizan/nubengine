      standardized induction to general anesthesia all patients will be given the infusion of
      hyperosmotic NaCl 5 ml/kg/BW during 30 min, group A 1.5% NaCl, group B 3% NaCl.
      Corticosteroids will be administered as usually. After dura opening the brain relaxation
      score will be assessed by surgeon (1 = completely relaxed, 2 = satisfactorily relaxed, 3 =
      firm brain, 4 = bulging brain), and the first measurement of the brain microcirculation
      provided by use of SDF probe in the area of the healthy brain, and of perifocal oedema. Both
      sites of investigation will be marked for the second measurement, which will be done after
      the end of tumor resection. Laboratory examinations: natremia preoperatively, natremia and
      osmolarity peroperatively 1 hour after NaCl infusion and at the end of surgery. Concentration
      of natrium will be examined in CSF after dura opening. Anesthesia management will be
      according to the standardised protocol, the patients will be awaken and extubated after the
      end of the procedure at the operating theatre.
