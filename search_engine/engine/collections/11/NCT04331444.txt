      increased, still less than a third obtain their optimal glycemic goal. The use of continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) in persons with type 1 diabetes has shown to be the most important
      driver for improvement in glycemic control-even more than insulin-pump therapy-but the use of
      technology in type 2 diabetes are not yet reimbursed and has been investigated in very few
      studies.

      The study will be a single center, prospective, randomized, open-labelled, three-armed study
      with the randomization 2:1:2 in group A with CGM, group B with CGM and peer-support, group C
      as a control group with SMBG. The study will run for 12 months and will include 100 adult
      participants with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, treated at the outpatient clinic at Steno
      Diabetes Center Copenhagen. Recruitment will begin in August 2020 and end in July 2021. Final
      12-month follow-up is anticipated to be in August 2022.

      The study is investor-initiated. The primary investigator (Nanna Lind, PhD. Student) will be
      responsible for execution of this study under guidance by the sponsor Kirsten NÃ¸rgaard.
      Results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals.

      Our study will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the use of CGM in the treatment for
      type 2 diabetes, potentially shaping clinical guidelines for SMBG frequency and timing as
      well as use of technology in type 2 diabetes with an impact on both healthcare and healthcare
      costs.
