      widely used in the setting of hypoxemic respiratory failure of heterogeneous etiology, with
      no definitive evidence for the superiority of one technique on the other. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether alternating NIV and HFO brings any advantage on gas exchanges
      and prognosis compared to the use of HFO alone in the homogeneous setting of
      pneumonia-associated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
