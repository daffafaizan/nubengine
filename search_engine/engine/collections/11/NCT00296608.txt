        -  Compare the recurrence-free and overall survival of patients with resectable stage II or
           III adenocarcinoma of the rectum treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without
           concurrent chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium followed by
           surgery and adjuvant fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, gender, location of the tumor relative to the anal margin
      (0-5 cm vs > 5 cm), and tumor stage (T3 vs T4). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 neoadjuvant therapy arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil IV over 15 minutes
                on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of
                disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo concurrent
                radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

             -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.

        -  Surgery: In both arms, patients undergo surgical resection within 3-10 weeks after
           completing neoadjuvant therapy.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Within 3-10 weeks after surgery, all patients receive adjuvant
           chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil IV over 15 minutes on
           days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for at least 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 762 patients will be accrued for this study.
