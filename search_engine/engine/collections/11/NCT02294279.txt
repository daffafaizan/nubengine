    
      Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with planned enrolment of 264 patients
      from the UK and Singapore. Eligible patients are 18-80 years old with ≥6 weeks' duration of
      non-specific respiratory symptoms defined as cough and/or wheeze and/or dyspnoea. Patients
      with FEV1 <90% predicted at visit 1 must show reversibility of <20% at visit 1 or within the
      prior year. Key exclusion criteria are prior diagnosis of asthma; evidence of concomitant
      chronic respiratory disease, respiratory tract infection; or known significant risk factor
      for cough or wheeze.

      Baseline assessments will include spirometry (FEV1, forced vital capacity) and FeNO
      measurement. Patients will be provided with a peak flow meter for twice daily measurement
      throughout the study. At 2 weeks, a clinical assessment and spirometry will be performed to
      confirm eligibility, and patients will complete four validated questionnaires to assess
      quality of life, asthma control, and asthma symptoms, including a visual analog scale for
      bother from asthma symptoms. Eligible patients will then be stratified by baseline FeNO level
      (normal ≤25, intermediate >25 to ≤50, or high >50 ppb); each group will be randomised to
      receive beclometasone 400 mcg daily or placebo for 6 weeks. An optional blood sample will be
      collected from consenting patients to assess blood eosinophils.

      At visit 3, final assessments will include spirometry, FeNO measurement, and all
      questionnaires. Interaction analysis will be used to determine whether a differential effect
      exists in response to ICS between FeNO groups.
