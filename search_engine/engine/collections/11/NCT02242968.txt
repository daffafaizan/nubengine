      Among other things, testing of vaccines or antiviral medications requires knowing whether the
      prospective subject has been previously infected by the virus to be studied. We will recruit
      healthy persons for this study and screen them for their eligibility to potentially
      participate in clinical trials of investigational or licensed vaccines or antiviral products.
      In most cases this will involve a medical history, physical examination, and obtaining blood
      to test for past exposure to one or more viruses being studied in ongoing and upcoming
      vaccine or antiviral therapy trials. In some cases blood may be tested for viral DNA or RNA
      and urine, stool, nasal swab, or nasal wash may be tested for viruses. Additional testing,
      such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) may also be done.
      Blood samples will also be stored for future research. This study should help us to identify
      a group of healthy volunteers who will be eligible, based on testing for their prior exposure
      to viruses, to participate in vaccine or antiviral therapy trials.
