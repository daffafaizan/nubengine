      arm clinical trial in HBsAg and HBeAg positive pregnant women (from 28 weeks until one year
      postpartum) and their infants (until 18 months of age). Pregnant women with HBsAg and HBeAg
      will receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once daily from 28 weeks of pregnancy until
      two months postpartum. Their infants will receive hepatitis B (HB) immunization, starting
      with the first dose soon after birth.

      The study aims to show that substituting maternal antiviral treatment for infant HBIg can be
      favorably considered in settings where HBIg plus vaccine has been used as well as in settings
      where only vaccine is used. A significant improvement over the standard HBIg + vaccine
      strategy would be that adding an antiviral strategy results in less than 2% transmission. A
      total of 499 women and their infants will be enrolled in public hospitals in Thailand and Lao
      PDR.

      The study will be monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at least annually.
