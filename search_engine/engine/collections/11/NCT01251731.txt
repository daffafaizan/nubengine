    
      This study will evaluate the single-dose (SD) pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),
      safety, and tolerability of oral doses of 10, 40, and 80 mg E5501 administered to 36 healthy
      male and female Japanese, Chinese, and Caucasian subjects. For the SD Treatment Period, 12
      subjects from each ethnic group will be randomized to receive single doses of 10, 40, or 80
      mg E5501 or matching placebo each treatment period. Each subject will be allocated to a
      treatment sequence to be dosed with either placebo for the three periods or dosed with each
      of the three different doses in the three periods. For the Multiple-Dose (MD) Treatment
      Period the 12 subjects in each ethnic group will be further randomized as active (dose level
      to be determined from the SD Treatment Period or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.
