    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm clinical study in patients
      presenting thoracic aortic pathologies. Patients with thoracic aortic pathologies who are
      planned to undergo thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a stent-graft based on
      routine clinical assessments performed as part of the patients' standard care will be
      screened after obtaining the informed consent from the patients, and if eligible, enrolled
      and scheduled for the implantation procedure with the study device.

      Following a baseline assessment, the implantation procedure will be performed according to
      the Instructions for Use and local routine practice. A follow-up visit will be performed 30
      days after the implantation procedure. The investigator will perform assessments of the
      implantation procedure and device system and document adverse events and device deficiencies.
