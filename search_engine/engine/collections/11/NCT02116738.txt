      many options regarding the surgical treatment of the disease has been described, the
      consensus about treatment stills remains unsatisfactory, as all the surgical methods have
      encountered with different rate of recurrences. Our aim in this study is to compare the
      widely used technique in pilonidal sinus surgical treatment Modified Limberg Flap
      Transposition and relatively less used technique Lateral Advancement Flap Transposition with
      Burrow's Triangle, in the terms of VAS scores, recurrence, postoperative complications,
      surgical site infections in the first 6 months.
