      study. Evogliptin (Trade name, Suganon) is a new, novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4)
      inhibitor which reveals a favorable results on glucose-lowering effect in patients with
      diabetes. However, its effect on renal function in patients with diabetes has been
      uncertained. To compare the effect of evogliptin and linagliptin on the reduction of
      albuminuria, we will recruit a total of 210 patients with Type 2 diabetes and renal
      insufficiency and allocate the participants into evogliptin group and linagliptin group with
      a ratio of 1:1 after radomization from 10 hospitals. After the oral administration of
      evogliptin 5mg per day or linagliptin 5mg per day for 24 weeks, the percent change of urine
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) at Week 24 and at baseline will be measured as a primary
      endpoint. In addition, the percent changes of UACR, hemoglobin A1c, Cystatin-C, Nephrin,
      N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), glycated albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) between baseline and Week 12 or Week 24 will be studied as secondary endpoints.
