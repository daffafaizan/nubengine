      transplantation. Pancreas transplantation has been increasedly performed to manage labile
      diabetes mellitus during the last few decades and survival rates of pancreatic grafts are
      improving. One of the challenges that is faced following pancreas transplantation alone are
      pathologic changes from diabetes frequently seen in native kidneys in the pancreas transplant
      recipients. High levels of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have been identified as risk factors
      for decline in kidney function and progression to end-stage renal disease. The objective of
      this trial is to take subjects who have biopsy proven CNI toxicity off of their CNI and begin
      belatacept, which is not a CNI.

      The hypothesis is by switching the pancreas transplant subject with documented CNI kidney
      toxicity to belatacept will slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.
