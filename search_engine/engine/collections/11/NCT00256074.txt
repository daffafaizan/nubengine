      randomised to one of two treatment groups.

        1. Standard therapy group. Will receive high carbohydrate, low fat enteral feeding, (16.7%
           protein, 30% fat and 53.3% carbohydrate). The target rate is determined by the treating
           physician and dietician, for a minimum of 5 days following randomisation.

        2. Alternative therapy group will receive high-fat, low carbohydrate enteral feeding,
           (16.7% protein, 55.2% fat and 28.1% carbohydrates. At a target rate determined by the
           treating physician and dietician, for a maximum of 5 days following randomisation.

      All patients will receive enteral feeding by continuous flow for 24 hours a day. The decision
      to commence or cease enteral feeding will remain with the treating physician.

      The measurement of VO2, VCO2, resting energy expenditure and respiratory quotient wil be made
      on all participants 12 hourly for a maximum of 5 days using the direct calorimeter. The
      indirect calorimeter is connected to the expiratory outlet of the ventilator, collecting and
      analyzing gas that is normally discharged in to the atmosphere.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the use of high- fat, low-carbohydrate enteral feed,
      significantly reduces the carbon dioxide production and the respiratory quotient in
      critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory failure. Compared to
      standard high-carbohydrate low-fat enteral feed.
