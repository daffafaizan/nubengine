      oil filled. However, it has some obvious disadvantages such as the cut of the normal retina
      surrounding, leaving a large area of retinal deficiency and significant exposure of retinal
      pigment epithelium and choroid membranes.

      In this study, we try to apply a modified surgery named Multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy
      to re-attach the retina.

      Instead of cutting through the proliferated retina directly, this new surgical approach
      adopts to cut the retina apart in a honeycomb shape with the help of electrocoagulation.

      In this way, we not only relax the traction of the proliferative membranes, but also reserve
      the rest retina to cover the RPE layers.

      Based on the hypothesis above, we are aiming to explore the safety and efficacy of this new
      surgical approach
