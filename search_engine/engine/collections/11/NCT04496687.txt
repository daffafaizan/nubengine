    
      Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is an under-diagnosed cause of acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS), myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac arrest. The inner lining of the
      coronary artery splits and allows blood to seep into the adjacent layer, forming a blockage
      (hematoma), or the artery continues to tear, creating a flap of tissue that blocks blood flow
      in the artery.

      SCAD strikes generally healthy, younger individuals (average age 42) who do not have
      traditional cardiac risk factors. Warning signs of SCAD encompass the full range of ACS and
      MI symptoms, from vague to classic. The cause of SCAD is currently unknown and the
      psychosocial impact of SCAD is traumatizing. The work of the iSCAD Registry will encompass
      the physical and psychosocial study of SCAD.
