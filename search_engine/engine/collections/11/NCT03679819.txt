      prostate cancer lesions relative to whole mount section after radical prostatectomy as the
      reference. The analysis will include the detection of all prostate cancer lesions as well as
      the detection of significant prostate cancer lesions. With this approach it is possible to
      calculate the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value
      and overall accuracy of the correct detection of prostate cancer in the prostate. These
      results are of importance when the ExactVu ultrasound scanner is to be used later for
      prostate cancer diagnosis using targeted biopsies.
