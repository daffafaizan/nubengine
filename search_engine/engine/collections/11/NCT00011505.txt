      presents in infancy. The mainstays of treatment, prednisone and transfusion therapy, have
      long-term toxicity in many patients, and bone marrow transplantation with an HLA-matched
      donor is an option for only a minority of patients. Most importantly, patients with DBA have
      an increased risk of progression of myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and aplastic anemia
      compared to the general population.

      The characterization of potentially mutated genes in DBA is an area of active research, and
      at least one mutation present in about one-fourth of DBA patients may cause disease due to
      decreased production of a ribosomal protein. This finding raises the possibility that the
      disease, at least in some patients, may be correctable by genetic therapy, by which a normal
      copy of the mutated gene can be introduced into the "stem cells" which give rise to red
      cells.

      It is therefore of interest to identify any particular characteristics of DBA patients which
      might delay or hinder the application of gene therapy to their disease. This pilot study of
      15 patients is designed to evaluate: 1) the CD34+ cell mobilization response to
      administration of standard doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 2) the
      potential for stem cells from DBA patients to be collected by large volume leukapheresis of
      subjects who have been given G-CSF, and 3) the ability of these G-CSF mobilized cells to be
      transduced with vectors being developed for gene therapy applications. Outcome parameters to
      be monitored are the mobilization response to G-CSF, the safety profile and tolerance of
      G-CSF and leukapheresis, and the efficiency of transduction of DBA stem cells with standard
      gene therapy vectors. Effectiveness will be gauged by historical comparison of these
      parameters to normal healthy age-matched volunteer.

      It is important to point out that there is no therapeutic intent to the majority of this
      protocol or direct benefit for enrolled patients. We do plan, however, to cryopreserve the
      remainder of the mobilized cells collected by apheresis for possible autologous
      transplantation in the event of the patient's progression to leukemia of bone marrow failure
      in the future.
