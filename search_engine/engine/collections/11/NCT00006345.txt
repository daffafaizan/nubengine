      denileukin diftitox in terms of avoidance and/or reduction of hypersensitivity type
      reactions, flu-like symptom complex, and vascular leak syndrome side effects (adverse events)
      in patients with persistent or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. II. Assess the response
      rate in terms of tumor burden reduction in these patients treated with this regimen. III.
      Determine the rate of patient withdrawal from the study due to adverse effects.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV
      over 30-60 minutes on days 1-5. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone twice daily
      beginning 24 hours prior to and concomitantly with denileukin diftitox. Treatment continues
      every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 or 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
