      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of pathological complete response (i.e., tumor completely gone) in
           women with previously untreated, unresected, stage II-IIIB breast cancer treated with
           neoadjuvant therapy comprising capecitabine and paclitaxel (albumin-stabilized
           nanoparticle formulation) (Abraxane^®).

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine overall clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive up to 4 courses of capecitabine and paclitaxel (nanoparticle
      albumin-stabilized formulation) (Abraxane^®) in the absence of disease progression. Patients
      then undergo definitive surgical resection of the tumor off study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
