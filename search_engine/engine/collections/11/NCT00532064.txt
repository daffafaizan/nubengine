    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if specific biomarkers (troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP])
      detect cardiotoxicity earlier than standard clinical means in patients receiving sunitinib
      malate (SU11248) or sorafenib chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To prospectively evaluate the incidence and severity of cardiac toxicity related to
      sunitinib or sorafenib during chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate or sorafenib chemotherapy then undergo blood collection 2
      weeks later, and then every 4-6 weeks for up to 6 months to test for troponin I and BNP.
