      alone to same-day Dilapan with 400-mcg misoprostol for cervical preparation prior to D&E at
      14 0/7 to 19 6/7 weeks. Patients will first be randomized to misoprostol alone or
      misoprostol-Dilapan, and then separately randomized to use the misoprostol buccally or
      vaginally.

      The primary outcome measure is total procedure time. Secondary outcomes include D&E procedure
      time, initial cervical dilation (measured by the largest Hegar dilator accepted without
      resistance prior to the start of the procedure), patient-oriented outcomes (side effects of
      buccal and vaginal misoprostol), and patient acceptability and satisfaction.

      The investigators have chosen a randomized controlled trial with a factorial design to be
      conducted at Washington Hospital Center and Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington. A
      total up to 180 English speaking women will be enrolled in the study so that 160 will be
      randomized and receive study interventions. The study will enroll healthy women, over the age
      of 18, eligible for non-urgent D&E at 14 0/7 weeks to 19 6/7 weeks, confirmed by sonogram.
      The women will be randomized to receive either misoprostol alone or Dilapan with misoprostol.
      Women will then be randomized to receive 400-mcg of misoprostol either buccally or vaginally.
      Computer generated randomization will be utilized to assign treatment arms. Approximately 4-6
      hours prior to procedure, women will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment
      combinations:

        1. Misoprostol 400-mcg vaginally

        2. Misoprostol 400-mcg buccally

        3. Dilapan insertion with 400-mcg misoprostol vaginally

        4. Dilapan insertion with 400-mcg misoprostol buccally
