      upper limb. It considerably impairs patient's quality of life and generates important social
      consequences due to the lost of productivity and the cost of treatments. Both surgical and
      conservative treatment are utilized for CTS management. Manipulative treatment is a
      conservative, non-drug and cheap management option which can be proposed, but by now,
      treatment guidelines and reviews do not recommend it due to lack of evidence to assess his
      efficacy.

      Hypothesis: Manipulative treatment can relieve patients of discomfort and dysfunction and
      then be utilized as a cheap conservative management of CTS.

      Study design: Two-groups randomized single-blind interventional study. Methods: Sixty-six
      patients reporting CTS symptoms that are confirmed by clinical exam and nerve conduction
      studies will be included. Participants will be randomized in two arms, one receiving
      manipulative treatment and one receiving simulated manipulative treatment (1/week for 4
      weeks). The main outcome measures will be the DASH questionnaire, the Boston Carpal Tunnel
      Syndrome Questionnaire, patient estimate on Visual Analog Scale for pain and the EuroQol-5D
      scale. All outcomes measures will be administrated to participants before the first
      manipulation, after the last session (4 weeks) and 12 weeks after the baseline measure.
