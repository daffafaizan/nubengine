           producing more than 7900 deaths annually . The majority of patients with bladder cancer
           about (70-80%) present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer .

        -  Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that degrades cellular organelles and
           proteins to maintain cellular biosynthesis during stress ; cancer cells induced
           autophagy to counteract with anticancer therapy by helping them to evade apoptotic
           pathway .Autophagy is achieved by many autophagy-related genes .

        -  Previous studies found that human bladder cancer cell lines exhibit high basal level of
           autophagic activity that may contribute to resistance to current anticancer treatment,
           so targeting basal autophagy may help to develop novel therapeutic strategies .
           Autophagy is potently induced by activating transcription factor 6(Endoplasmic Reticulum
           stress marker) , and Malondialdehyde (oxidative stress marker) .

        -  Recently several studies demonstrated the role of autophagy in Bladder Cancer
           progression as evidenced by detection of microtubule associated protein and its
           relevance with muscle invasion beside its grade dependency . Autophagy was grade
           dependent process . Autophagy related gene 7 is a key protein involved in autophagosomes
           biogenesis, Knockdown of Autophagy related gene 7 induced apoptotic cell death in
           bladder cancer cell lines measured by increased caspase 3 level, Based on these previous
           studies autophagy plays a role in bladder cancer progression so interruption of its
           pathway may serve a novel target for future therapies.
