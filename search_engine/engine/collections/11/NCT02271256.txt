      research and develop a functional intimate apparel for adolescents with early scoliosis. As a
      result, this will reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.

      The design of functional intimate apparel will incorporate different mechanisms, such as a)
      compression and pulling forces through a close fit of the intimate apparel, b) lumbar flexion
      by using a supporting belt, c) transverse forces applied by inserting pads inside the pocket
      lining with the principle of the 3-point pressure system, d) axial rotation or coupled motion
      by using a system with uneven straps, and e) an active mechanism that aims to shift the trunk
      away from areas of pressure.

      In this study, the eligible subjects will be given a functional intimate apparel to wear for
      8 hours a day. Monitoring and observation will be provided during a 6-month wear trial. The
      effectiveness of the functional intimate apparel will be evaluated by pre- and post-
      treatment X-ray radiography and sonography.
