      surgery and anesthesia in the elderly. Postoperative delirium is an acute-onset diffuse brain
      dysfunction that is characterized by a fluctuating course of confusion, disorganized
      thinking, inattention, irritability, disturbances of the circadian rhythm, and disorders of
      consciousness. Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium occurs immediately after emergence
      from anesthesia and affects up to 45% of patients after elective surgery.

      It is unclear, whether PACU delirium is associated with intermediated or long-term adverse
      outcomes including neurocognitive disorders or mortality. The aim of this prospective
      observational was to assess self-reported cognitive function and health-related quality of
      life in patients with and without PACU delirium three months after radical prostatectomy.
