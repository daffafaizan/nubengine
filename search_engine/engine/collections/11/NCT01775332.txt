    
      This study involves a formative evaluation of the health literacy resources that we have
      already developed. We see approximately 60 new patients a year with pituitary disorders, plus
      the follow-up patients: all of these patients will be offered the opportunity to participate
      in the study. These materials include a website (containing videos, illustrations and written
      materials) and plain language educational brochures. The educational materials include
      information that patients will need throughout their experience with a pituitary tumour,
      ranging from the signs and symptoms of tumours, to long-term post-operative lifestyle
      changes. This evaluation will be a mixed-methods evaluation.

      Part A (Think aloud) will use "think-aloud" processes to evaluate the usefulness and ease of
      use of a website that we have developed with patients and their families.

      Part B (Resource assessment) will involve the use of questionnaires followed by
      semi-structured interviews with patients and families before and after using the resources.
