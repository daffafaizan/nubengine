    
      This is a phase I study of combination immunotherapy with IFN-γ and the PD-1 inhibitor
      nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on at least one prior
      systemic therapy, which may include prior immunotherapy. Patients will be treated with a one
      week induction phase (IP) of IFN-γ, followed by a combination phase (CP) with IFN-γ and
      nivolumab for three cycles, followed by a single agent phase of only nivolumab for up to one
      year. The study will primarily assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. Tumor
      assessments will occur after three cycles of combination therapy, then every three cycles
      thereafter. Secondary objectives including ORR, PFS, and OS will also be assessed, as will
      various correlative analyses. Initial accrual will occur using a modified 6+6 design, and if
      endpoints for safety (using DLT criteria) are met, expansion cohorts in RCC and UC will be
      opened for up to 15 patients.
