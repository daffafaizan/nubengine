      long-term morbidity for patients who survive the initial bleed. The most frequent and morbid
      complication is delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) resulting from angiographic vasospasm of the
      arteries of the circle of Willis. At present, there is no protective therapy aimed at
      neuronal preservation during this period of ischemia. The standard medical care is primarily
      to maintain intravascular volume status to improve cerebral perfusion during arterial
      narrowing, or calcium channel blockers for smooth muscle relaxation on the arterial wall.
      Experimental and clinical data suggest a primary mechanism of neuronal injury during ischemia
      is excitotoxicity, glutamate-induced cell death resulting from overstimulation of ionotropic
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and resultant excessive calcium influx. Ketamine is a
      dissociative anesthetic with a mechanism of action of non-competitive antagonism of the NMDA
      receptor, routinely used in operating rooms and intensive care units as an analgesic and
      anesthetic. In addition to its anesthetic properties, ketamine is also an anti-inflammatory
      agent and a sympathomimetic, maintaining sedation without the adverse effects of hemodynamic
      instability. Identification of a neuroprotective entity for DCI following SAH would vastly
      improve the quality of life and shorten hospital stay for patients with a ruptured
      intracerebral aneurysm. It is critical to identify such agents so that patients survive their
      injury, spend shorter time in the ICU, and can return to work and maintain relationships.
