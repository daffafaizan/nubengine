      systemic administration due to the blood brain barrier. To improve drug delivery to the brain
      to achieve very high local concentrations of the anti-neoplastic agent with low system
      toxicity, a local regional approach is proposed. CM-BC2, an irinotecan hydrochloride
      drug-eluting bead, is an investigational medicinal product intended for direction injection
      into the tumor resection margin. The objective of this trial is demonstration of safety and
      feasibility of this intraparenchymal injection of irinotecan hydrochloride drug-eluting beads
      in the treatment of recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme.
