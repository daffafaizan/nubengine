      disease following TIPS placement. Given that the most common indications for TIPS placement
      are also defining features of decompensated cirrhosis, specifically hemorrhage and refractory
      ascites, the overall health of this patient population is extraordinarily complex. One
      notable circulatory impact of cirrhosis is the increase in total blood volume in concert with
      a disproportionate increase in splanchnic blood volume. Therefore, at the time of TIPS
      placement, a patient may experience a marked increase in central blood volume that may lead
      to cardiac dysfunction. Considering that a central feature of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is
      attenuated response to stress, it is conceivable that some perioperative cardiovascular
      complications could be attributed to the patient's baseline health rather than an isolated
      effect of the procedure alone. By instituting measures to identify patients that may be at
      increased risk for an adverse outcome, this proposal hopes to offer a new paradigm for
      managing TIPS patients in the acute postoperative setting. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to derive better correlates between non-invasive and invasive measurements of
      cardiac function.
