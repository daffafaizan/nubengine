      therapeutic window, and causes nephrotoxicity. For cyclosporine infusion, a tunneled central
      venous access device is used; however due to the lipophilic properties of the drug, it can
      adsorb to the catheter surface and falsely raise cyclosporine concentrations in blood
      specimens. Some authors recommend sample collection through peripheral access only. Others,
      however, have shown that these can be collected through the catheter line not used to infuse
      the drug. Controversies still exist, though, regarding the best timing and blood volume to be
      discarded to collect the sample.

      The hypothesis adopted was that drug adsorption occurs in the line used for infusion.
      Therefore, there is no statistical or clinical difference between the blood sample collected
      from the peripheral venous access and from the line not used for cyclosporine infusion.
      Additionally, this difference becomes smaller when waits five minutes between the
      interruption of the infusion of the drug and the collection of the blood sample.
