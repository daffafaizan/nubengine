      therapeutic agents that can slow down cartilage degeneration, improve reparation and
      ultimately prevent joint prosthetics. MSCs are capable to direct differentiation into
      chondrocytes, produce cytokines and growth factors with immunomodulatory and
      anti-inflammatory effects, stimulate angiogenesis, as well as induce chemotaxis of endogenous
      progenitors. Bone marrow-derived and placenta-derived MMSCs can be considered the most
      promising source for cell therapy of joints disorders according to availability, safety and
      expected therapeutic efficacy.
