    
      Materials and methods: Simultaneous MRI-PET (FDG) will be prospectively obtained in patients
      (n = 60) initially presented with brain tumors by using integrated MRI-PET (Biograph mMR,
      Siemens, Germany). We will exclude the patients suspected to have benign brain tumors such as
      meningioma and schwannoma on previous imaging studies. We will use the imaging protocols
      including whole body MRI-PET and advanced brain tumor imaging (DWI, PWI and DCE). In
      addition, we will analyze the imaging parameters to see whether the enrolled tumors are
      primary brain tumors or metastatic, and evaluate the tumor grading efficiency and prognosis
      prediction for the patients with high grade astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas.

      Expected results: We expect that whole body MRI-PET is useful for the differential diagnosis
      of primary and metastatic brain tumors, and the multiparametric information from DWI, PWI,
      DCE and PET can be used for the tumor grading and prognosis prediction of the primary brain
      malignancies.
