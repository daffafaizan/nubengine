      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment
      with targeted study agent in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple
      myeloma.

      II. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. III. To identify potential
      predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or
      resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and
      imaging-based assessment platforms.

      IV. To assess whether radiomic phenotypes obtained from pre-treatment imaging and changes
      from pre- through post-therapy imaging can predict objective response and progression free
      survival and to evaluate the association between pre-treatment radiomic phenotypes and
      targeted gene mutation patterns of tumor biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if less than 2
      years from study entry, and then every 6 months for year 3 from study entry.
