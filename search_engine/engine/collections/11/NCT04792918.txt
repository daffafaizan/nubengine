    
      This study aims to collect biological samples (stool, stomach fluid, urine, and blood) from
      preterm infants at risk of developing NEC or LOS; as well as environmental samples from
      infants' hospital surroundings (swabs, air), nutritional intake (formula, breastmilk) and
      samples from their family members (faeces, vaginal swab).

      The main focus of the study is to assess strain-level stability of gastrointestinal
      microbiota in these infants and potentially assess the source of disease-causing microbiota
      species/strains.
