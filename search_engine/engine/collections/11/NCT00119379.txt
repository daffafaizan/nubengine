      however, the relationship between NRTI-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and lipoatrophy is
      still unclear and requires additional research. Additionally, the relationship between the
      gain in dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)-measured limb fat and mitochondrial DNA
      (mtDNA) content, mitochondrial function, fat apoptosis, and oxidative damage will also be
      examined in this study.

      Patients will participate in this study for 48 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups. Group 1 patients will receive NucleomaxX every other day. Group 2
      patients will substitute TDF for ZDV or d4T every day in their current stable NRTI-containing
      ARV regimen. NucleomaxX will be provided to Group 1 patients, but TDF or any other ARV will
      not be provided by this study.

      There will be 10 study visits, which will occur at study entry and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24,
      30, 36, and 48. Blood collection will occur at all visits. Additionally, urine collection,
      DEXA scans, and fat biopsies will be done at study entry and Weeks 24 and 48.
