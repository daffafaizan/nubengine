    
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common condition affecting up to 2-4 % of the
      general population. The pathophysiologic consequences of OSA include: excessive daytime
      sleepiness leading to increased car and work related accidents; and increased incidence of
      hypertension (HTN), stroke and possibly coronary artery events. In addition, patients with
      severe and untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have increased mortality compared to
      patients with treated severe OSA.The main stay of treatment of OSAS is the application of
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. The main problem with CPAP therapy
      is compliance. Heliox, a mixture of oxygen and helium has been used for many years in the
      treatment of upper airway obstruction. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the
      effectiveness of Heliox in the treatment of OSAS. Adult subjects with the diagnosis of
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome who are referred for repeat sleep study for CPAP titration
      will be evaluated.
