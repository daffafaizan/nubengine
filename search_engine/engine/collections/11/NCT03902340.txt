      and inducing functional impairment. More specifically knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common
      disease associated with significant morbidity. Its prevalence increases with age
      dramatically. KOA is frequently associated with pain which can worsen with daily activities.
      The goals of KOA treatments are to provide pain relief and to improve function and quality of
      life. For the American college of Rheumatology and despite the frequent use of TENS in
      treating patients with KOA, questions remained regarding its efficacy. Consequently TENS
      needs additional clinical studies to demonstrate its efficacy in management of painful
      osteoarthritis.

      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and to the safety of TENS in
      the management of chronic, nociceptive pain in patient suffering from KOA.
