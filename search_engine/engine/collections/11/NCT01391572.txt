    
      Patient Population:

      Thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after esophagectomy with at least 15 lymph nodes
      removed for adequate nodal staging.

      T3-4, any N, M0.

      Scheme:

      After esophagectomy, patients are firstly stratified by 2 factors: (1)number of lymph node
      metastasis (<3 or >=3) and (2)tumor resection status (R1 resection or R2 resection).

      Note: Pathological R0 resection status is required for this study. So here R1 and R2
      resection are not actually pathological status of resection, only clinical judgement by
      physician based on the chest-CT before esophagectomy.

      Then patients are randomized to 2 arms:

      Arm A:

      Large field radiation (tumor bed + ENI (elective nodal irradiation)) + Sequential
      chemotherapy (4 cycles).

      Arm B:

      Small field radiation (tumor bed only) + Sequential chemotherapy (4 cycles).
