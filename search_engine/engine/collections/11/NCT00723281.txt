      regarding the coronary arteries in the setting of heart transplant and be used to risk
      stratify patients with regards to the developments of transplant coronary artery disease.

      Specific Aim 1- To test the hypothesis that coronary CTA can accurately measure
      cross-sectional vessel wall area using conventional coronary angiography with intra-vascular
      ultrasound as the standard of reference.

      Specific Aim 2- To test the hypothesis that coronary CTA can accurately measure
      cross-sectional vessel wall thickness, vessel area and luminal area using conventional
      coronary angiography with intra-vascular ultrasound as the standard of reference.

      Secondary Aim - To asses the correlation of cross-sectional vessel wall area, vessel wall
      thickness, vessel area, luminal area and vessel wall index with global and regional left
      ventricular function using coronary CTA.
