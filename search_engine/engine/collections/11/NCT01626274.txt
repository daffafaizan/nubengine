      LAVIMO measurements like heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing and arterial blood
      oxygenation are performed parallel to standard polysomnography measurements and subsequently
      compared to the data of the standard polysomnography. The LAVIMO sensor system consists of
      the in- ear sensor, the electronics and a PC; the individually formed sensor is embedded into
      an ear mould for proper fit inside the ear canal. Inside two LEDs emit light into the
      adjacent skin at 760 and 905 nm wavelengths. The intensity of the backscattered light is
      detected by a photo detector. In the electronics, the control signals for the LEDs are
      provided, as well as the photo detector signal is further processed and A-D converted. The
      electronics also provide a wireless connection to the PC via bluetooth. Data recording, post
      processing and displaying are tasks of the PC. The feasibility of non- intrusive 24 hours and
      non-invasive measurements like heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing and oxygen
      saturation is proved via this minimized sensor and electronics placed at a suitable place at
      the body guaranteeing high wearing comfort. This includes a wireless data communication for
      unrestricted mobility. Subsequently the data are compared to the standard polysomnography
      data to extract vital signs or for example to recognize possible phases of sleep apnoea. The
      goal in future refering to preventive medical monitoring will be early detection of risk
      factors for patient's health and improvement of living conditions.
