      fracture [1, 2], mostly due to falling [2]. Among the most serious and common fractures are
      hip fractures, reaching significant levels of mortality [2] and disability [3]. Hip fracture
      is an increasingly important problem internationally, particularly in developing countries,
      due to the growth in the numbers of older people. It is estimated that in 2050 the global
      number of hip fractures will be between 7.3 and 21.3 million [4] and the cost with the
      treatment will be approximately of 131.5 billion dollars [5], due the population increase.

      Physical and psychological limitations post-fracture, such as decreased mobility [6] and
      muscle strength of lower limbs [7], deficit balance [6], lack of trust [7], fear of falling
      [6] and increased risk of falls [8], hamper around 40% of older people from returning to
      their daily activities to live independently and safely [3, 9]. Even after two years of
      injury, more than half of the elderly do not regain the functional level prior to injury
      [10], persisting with moderate to high risk of falls [6].

      Risk of falls and future falls in this population may be due either to physical limitations
      [11, 12] (due to insufficient recovery of balance, muscle strength and consequently mobility)
      and the fact they have already suffered a fracture previously [13], further increasing the
      chances of new fractures in this population [14].

      There is no consensus about the best intervention for functionality of the elderly after hip
      fracture. However, recently different exercise programs have been suggested to improve the
      mobility of these patients [8]. Some studies have shown the effectiveness of rehabilitation
      programs in the period of up to 6 months after injury [15-18]. Although, few studies have
      explored the late period rehabilitation (over 6 months) [19, 20], when functional limitations
      can persist due to inadequate dose as well as the type of exercise performed. Population in
      Brazil is growing age in one of the fastest rates in the world and will be even greater in
      the coming decades. The number of seniors will double between 2002 and 2020, from 15 million
      to 32 million and reach 64 million by 2050 (about 30% of the total population in Brazil)
      [21]. Furthermore, the elderly aged 80 and over will increase exponentially over the next
      four decades, putting a growing and disproportionate demand on the health system and social
      support [21].

      The purpose of this study is to determine if an exercise program training for people who have
      suffered a fall-related hip fracture will improve functional mobility when compared with
      usual care.
