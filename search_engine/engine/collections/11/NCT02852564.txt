      States. Patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) are in desperate need for
      both effective and easily tolerated treatment options. Current standard of care includes
      immediate post-operative Mitomycin C (MMC), which decreases the rate of recurrence but does
      not alter progression. Furthermore, in patients with high-grade NMIBC, standard of care
      dictates that patients undergo intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy. This
      treatment has a high degree of morbidity with both local and systemic side effects along with
      significant discomfort from treatment (intra-urethral catheterization and bladder
      instillation). Our goal is to develop a bladder cancer treatment strategy designed to
      decrease recurrence/progression rates in addition to decreasing the morbidity of treatment.

      Twelve evaluable NMIBC patients will participate in this Phase 1 trial.

      Treatment - patients will receive a single, 50 mg oral dose of ethacrynic acid administered
      as two 25 mg strength EDECRINÂ® tablets immediately prior to transurethral resection of
      bladder tumor.

      Concentrations and excretion rates of ethacrynic acid in the urine, as well as of cysteine,
      glutathione, and mercapturate metabolites, will be measured for each of 4 urine specimens
      collected on the day of surgery (before, during, and at 2 timepoints after surgery).

      Adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory values, and vital sign measurements will
      be collected.

      Efficacy of ethacrynic acid treatment will be estimated by recording
      recurrence/non-recurrence of disease at 3 months post-treatment
