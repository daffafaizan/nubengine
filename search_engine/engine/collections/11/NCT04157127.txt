    
      The primary objective of this phase 1, first in man trial is to determine the safety,
      toxicity, and feasibility of delivering autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma lysate plus mRNA to pancreatic cancer patients as adjuvant therapy
      following completion of standard chemotherapy.

      Patients will first complete standard treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma which is
      surgically resectable or potentially resectable and then within 3 months of finishing
      standard treatment, they will have three doses of the dendritic cell vaccine by perinodal
      injection using ultrasound (US) or computed-tomography (CT) guidance.
