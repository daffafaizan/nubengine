      diabetes. The management is even more difficult, during a camp, probably due to increased
      hypoglycemia maybe from increase of intensity of physical activity. Few studies confirm this
      hypothesis but none evaluated the correlation between steps, energy expenditure, sleep time
      and glycemic control and insulin dosage.

      Methods and Materials 60 patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 10 to 12 years, in
      multiinjection insulin therapy observed for 21 days (one week of camp, one week before and
      one after it). Food program was the same both at home and during the camp. They checked
      glycemia almost 5 times a day. A wrist accelerometer was used to evaluate sleep, steps and
      energy expenditure.

      All data were recorded in a daily diary.
