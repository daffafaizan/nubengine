    
      Patients take nitazoxanide daily for 8 weeks with a dose escalation after the first 4 weeks.
      Patients return to the hospital for examinations every 2 weeks during the 8-week treatment
      period and 6-week follow-up. Nitazoxanide therapy is discontinued in patients showing a
      complete clinical and parasitologic response (therapeutic cure) after 8 weeks of treatment
      and in patients showing a therapeutic cure at two consecutive visits (Weeks 2 and 4 or Weeks
      4 and 6). These patients undergo a physical examination including stool analysis for
      Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and routine laboratory tests at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 after
      completion of nitazoxanide therapy. Patients who do not show a complete clinical and
      parasitologic response (therapeutic failure) after 8 weeks of treatment are allowed to remain
      on nitazoxanide therapy through the Open Label Compassionate Use of Nitazoxanide in Treatment
      of Cryptosporidiosis in AIDS Patients (UMD-95-009) protocol.
