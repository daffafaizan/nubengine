    
      Observational prospective Clinical Trial designed to:

        -  record all patients treated with a latest generation ALL-like therapy (e.g.: Holzer,
           LSA2-L2 modified, GIMEMA LAL094), an enhanced therapy (hyper-CVAD or Stanford),
           autologous or allogeneic transplant or reduced intensity conditioning allotransplant
           after induction/consolidation and also expected cases treated with high dose sequential
           therapy or intensified minimal residual disease (MRD) oriented therapy;

        -  enter classic T-LBL patients (bone marrow infiltrate <25%) treated as long as previous
           section;

        -  monitor therapy response/phenotype ratio by the study of phenotype;

        -  monitor therapy response/residual disease/patients outcome ratio by the study of T-cell
           receptor gene rearrangement;

        -  evaluate any gene-profile difference between T-LBL pre-thymic phenotype and T-LBL thymic
           phenotype so as to correlate it to outcome;

        -  monitor the stage of the disease at diagnosis, during the therapy and during the
           follow-up by means of TAC, so to value if PET (in association with TAC) is an additional
           and/or outcome predicting element compared to TAC.
