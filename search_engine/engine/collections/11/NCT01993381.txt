    
      1. Primary Objective To evaluate the role of some predictive biomarkers for
           chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting

        2. Secondary Objective To evaluate the clinical characteristics related to
           chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in Korean patients

        3. Study design

           Chemotherapy Day Day1 Day3 Day15

           Chemotherapy 1st cycle FOLFOX/ FOLFIRI 2nd cycle FOLFOX/ FOLFIRI Blood Sampling 1st
           sampling (8 a.m.) 2nd sampling (8 a.m.) 3rd sampling (8 a.m.) Evaluation of nausea and
           vomiting Patient's Diary (Day 1-4)

        4. Evaluation of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting

             -  Patient's Diary consisting of the following three elements:

                  1. NCI-CTCAE (National cancer institute-common toxicity criteria adverse event)
                     version 4.0

                  2. 100mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS)

                  3. Functional living index- emesis

             -  Patients should write 'Patient's Diary' from chemotherapy day 1 to chemotherapy day
                4.

        5. Evaluation of the serum levels of Biomarkers (substance P et. al.) 1) Blood sampling

             -  Sample 1: 1st cycle, chemotherapy starting day 1, fasting 8 a.m.

             -  Sample 2: 1st cycle, chemotherapy day 3, fasting 8 a.m.

             -  Sample 3: 2nd cycle, chemotherapy starting day 1 (day 15 after 1st cycle
                chemotherapy), fasting 8 a.m.

                2) ELISA test for biomarkers (Sample 1,2,3)

      5. Visiting Schedule

      Screening Chemotherapy Time of Visit D-3 to -1 1st day of 1st cycle (Day 1) 3rd day of 1st
      cycle (Day 3) 4th day of 1st cycle (Day4) 1st day of 2nd cycle (Day 15) Inclusion/exclusion
      criteria x Informed consent x Distribution of patient's diary x Blood sampling x x x Return
      of patient's diary x

      6. Statistical methods and data analysis Continuous variables, including serum levels of
      biomarkers, are expressed as median, minimum, and maximum values. Comparisons of continuous
      variables are made using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The chi-square
      test is used for comparisons of categorical variables.
