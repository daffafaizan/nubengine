      generation, that are partly dependent on (interleukin-4) IL-4 and (interleukin-13) IL-13
      signalling, two additional characteristic features of asthma ie airway hyperresponsiveness
      and mucus hypersecretion are also determined by IL-13 biology. Neither of these important
      features have been investigated in any clinical trials of anti-IL-13 molecules. Accurate
      endotyping to identify patients in whom IL-13 mediated biology is the dominant pathobiology
      of asthma (selecting patients with significant airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus
      secretion) may elicit greater clinical effect. Taken together, we propose to investigate the
      effects of Dupilumab on airway hyperresponsiveness, on airway eosinophilia and mucus biology
      and their relation to airway structure and function (ventilation heterogeneity), and airway
      autoimmune responses.

      To satisfy the proposed objective we will evaluate well-established outcome measures of
      airway hyperresponsiveness (provocation concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in
      FEV1 (PC20), type 2 inflammation (sputum eosinophils, blood eosinophils and exhaled nitric
      oxide (eNO)) and mucus biology.
