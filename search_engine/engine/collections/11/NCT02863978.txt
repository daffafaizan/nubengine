      the two first ones (sepsis and maturation) :

        1. Early diagnosis of sepsis for the following cases : Late onset sepsis of premature
           newborns, materno-f≈ìtal sepsis, and newborn infection by chorioamnionitis

        2. Cardio-respiratory and neurobehavioral maturation (movements, sleeping cycles)

        3. Influence of environmental factors and developmental care on selected parameters

        4. Influence on care organisation of the possibility to access videos and movement analyses
           by medical teams

        5. Influence of glycemia on selected parameters

        6. Influence of neurological lesions and broncho-pulmonary dysplasia on selected parameters

        7. Indices correlation with medical images MRI (T1, T2, diffusion, Arterial Spin Labelling)
           from neonatal units and with health evaluated after 1 and 2 years with the Ages & Stages
           Questionnaires (ASQ)

        8. Evaluation of the acquisition system's user-friendliness
