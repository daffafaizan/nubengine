      lying above the abdominal muscle wall and visceral adipose tissue, corresponding to the
      intra-abdominal fat witch is more harmful to health.

      The accumulation of fat tissue differs between genders and age. Men have a huge propensity
      for developing central fat and women accumulate more subcutaneous fat tissue on the
      gluteal-femoral region. Some authors suggest that the accumulation of fat tissue increases
      with age.

      Several studies have concluded that there is a relationship between the abdominal fat storage
      and the degree of lumbar curvature.

      In addition, some authors also suggest that there is a relationship between the degree of
      lumbar lordosis and cellulite, which is related to circulatory changes.

      However these relationships are not yet clarified in the literature.
