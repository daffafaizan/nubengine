    
      The primary objective of ROSSINI 2 is to determine whether three specific in-theatre
      interventions, alone or in combination, result in decreased rates of surgical site infection
      (SSI) up to 30 days post operation in adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

      Ten local NHS hospitals will participate in the pilot phase of ROSSINI 2 and at least 60 NHS
      hospitals in the UK will participate in the main phase of ROSSINI 2.

      Approximately 6610 patients will be required to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction in the
      intervention arm(s) (15% to 10%) with 85% power.

      Three health technologies will be assessed versus their control arms (standard care):

        1. 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine skin preparation, versus any other standard skin preparation

        2. Iodophor-impregnated incise drape, versus no drape

        3. Gentamicin-impregnated implants/ sponge at closure, versus no implant
