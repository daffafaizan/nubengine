      I. To determine the recommended phase II doses of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) and
      13-cis-retinoic acid (CRA) when administered to adults with recurrent malignant glioma who
      are not receiving cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess dose-related toxicities. II. To measure 6 month progression-free survival and
      overall survival. III. To estimate response rates in those patients with measurable disease.
      IV. To evaluate for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)vIII, phosphatase and tensin
      homolog (PTEN), cyclin D1, cyclin E, and RARbeta1 expression in tumor samples from enrolled
      patients as predictors of clinical benefit from this combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive isotretinoin orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and erlotinib
      hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.
