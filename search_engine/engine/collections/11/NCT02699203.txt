      carbohydrate meal designed to elicit different insulin responses on two separate occasions.
      Blood samples and saliva samples will be collected for 2 hours following each meal and
      insulin will be measured in both plasma and saliva. The relationship between plasma and
      saliva insulin following the two meals will be assessed.
