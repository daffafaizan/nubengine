      rate remain low nevertheless the improvement in the last years. In particular also in
      relatively young reproductive age women nevertheless the good embryos produced and
      transferred pregnancy rate and implantation rate remain low. Recently, it has been showed
      that culture medium supplemented with G-CSF, may improve the embryo outcomes in IVF. In this
      trial the investigators will test the potential benefits of this culture medium on embryos of
      patients undergoing IVF. 180 infertile women undergoing IVF no more than 37 years old will be
      selected. These patients will be assigned to two arms, one experimental and one other of
      control by a computer generated sequence. After the oocyte retrieval and fertilization by
      ICSI procedure, the fertilised oocyte (2PN)will cultured with the G-CSF supplemented culture
      medium or in normal culture in micro drop of 30microliters under oil until the day of
      transfer (day five or blastocyst sage embryos). A maximum of two embryos will be transferred.
      The pregnancy rate, implantation rate and number of blastocyst developped will be the
      outcomes considered
