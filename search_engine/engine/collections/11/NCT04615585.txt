      randomized, controlled clinical trial. Thirty patients with mild to moderate chronic
      periodontitis were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (test): will include 15 patients treated
      with SRP followed by application of Aloe vera gel in the periodontal pockets at day 1 and
      after 1 and 2 weeks, and group 2 (control) which includes 15 patients treated with SRP only.
