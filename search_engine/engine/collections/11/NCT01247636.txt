      reserve that make them vulnerable of being dependent of others. Research have shown that
      older people discharge from hospital are vulnerable for functional decline during hospital
      stay and this decline can persist 6 to 18 months after discharge from hospital.Exercise
      interventions are proven to have effect on mobility, balance and falls among
      community-dwelling older people and several studies have shown that deconditioning as a
      consequence of disuse is reversible with training even in very old individuals. However, few
      studies have evaluated the effects of physical activity promotion and exercise intervention
      among elderly recently discharge from a geriatric outpatient clinic.
