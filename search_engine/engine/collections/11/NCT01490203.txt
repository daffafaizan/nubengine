           posthepatectomy liver failure. However, the function of the future remnant is decreased
           in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, compared to that of healthy
           patients with an equal volume. Therefore, volume-based estimation of hepatic reserve
           function is inadequate for patients with hepatic dysfunction.

        2. Standard clinical liver function tests, such as ICG clearance rate or Child-Pugh score,
           provides measurements of the global hepatic function, but cannot evaluate the functional
           distribution in the liver. Gd-EOB-DTPA (Gadoxetic acid, PrimovistÂ®, Bayer Schering)
           enhanced MRI has been recently demonstrated to have the potential to be an imaging-based
           liver function test, with the possibility to detect functional differences on a regional
           or even segmental level.

        3. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI may be able to assess not only global but also segmental
           liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have a relatively
           high risk for developing liver failure after surgical resection due to coexistent
           hepatic damage by chronic viral hepatitis and/or cirrhosis preoperatively.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the global and segmental hepatic uptake and
      excretion of Gd-EOB-DTPA on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI correlates with standard liver
      function test results in the patients with HCC before major hepatic resection/RFA.
