      I. To objectively assess changes in cognitive performance and quality of life (QOL) pre and
      post participation in a cognitive rehabilitation intervention in gynecologic and breast
      cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy.

      II. To measure changes in neural function as measured by functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal and corresponding behavioral
      responses while performing cognitive tasks.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (Skills workshop): Patients participate in a memory and thinking skills workshop once
      weekly for 7 weeks. Patients complete cognitive tests and questionnaires at pre-baseline
      (Visit 1), baseline (Visit 2), and 7 weeks (Visit 3).

      ARM II (Education workshop): Patients participate in education workshop for 7 weeks 1-hour
      duration group focusing on the brain and cognition. Patients complete cognitive tests and
      questionnaires at pre-baseline (Visit 1), baseline (Visit 2), and 7 weeks (Visit 3).
