      mechanism of action involves activation of immune system and extensive mobilisation of
      various immunocytes to administration locus. It's safety and tolerability is currently
      evaluated in first-in-man phase I study in prostate cancer patients. Treatment strategy for
      the disease (radical prostatectomy or active observation) will be determined by the
      Investigator in accordance with routine clinical practice of the hospital.

      Patients will be randomised in cohorts of 4 subjects, where 3 subjects will be administered
      with Mobilan (лю-VM3), and one patient will be administered with placebo.

      The dose will be escalated from cohort to cohort, the decision on possible dose escalation
      will be made by Independent Safety Review Board.
