      also been shown that circulating cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) is released from apoptotic or
      necrotic tumor cells. In a study of cfDNA level after surgery in colon cancer patients, they
      suggested that cfDNA could detect recurrence of cancer several months earlier than the
      conventional follow up studies. Following several reports have suggested that cfDNA can
      invade host cells and alter host cell biology to cause cancer metastasis.

      In this regard, we will collect from non-small cell lung cancer patients cohort who underwent
      curative resection, and will evaluate whether peripheral cfDNA can aid early detection of
      cancer recurrence. We will also study the genomic signature of cfDNA to assess the
      relationship between cfDNA and clinical outcome of non-small cell lung cancer patients.
