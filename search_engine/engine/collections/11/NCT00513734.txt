      Intensive therapy unit (ITU) patients and the need for effective eye care in ITU has been
      recognised for some time. We compare two popular methods of eye care; a hydrogel dressing and
      lacrilube ointment. Each recruited patient had each eye randomised to different treatments.
      Daily ophthalmology ward rounds were undertaken to identify any corneal exposure keratopathy.
      Patients were removed from the trial if one eye developed significant exposure needing
      treatment.
