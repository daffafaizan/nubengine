      importance of prevention isn't more to justify but it is not consensus on common conduct to
      follow.

      Propose: a paramedical research protocol to improve the positioning of the hemiplegic
      shoulder in stroke unit and prevent shoulder pain acute stroke.

      Objective: show the superiority of an approach to prevention of shoulder pain of patients
      post-stroke, in stroke unit.

      A clinical trial, a comparative of superiority, monocentric, in two parallel groups is in
      included phase.

      Investigators are initiating a study on new positioning devices providing optimal positioning
      of the hemiplegic shoulder according to the criteria given in the literature: elbow flexed at
      40°, hand semi-prone, fingers abducted and in extension, and thumb in abduction. The medical
      devices under study are the SYSTAM'® positioning device for the upper-arm (spine position)
      and Ultrasling ER 15° DONJOY® (sitting or standing-up position). The study will include 30
      acute stroke patients (ischemic or haemorrhagic) with no alertness problems and with a
      shoulder motor function score between 0 and 2 on the Held-scale. A visual analog scale (VAS)
      will be used, thus excluding patients with aphasia and dementia. The new positioning will be
      maintained for a maximum of 1 month or until the Held-scale score reaches 3. The primary
      end-point is pain (VAS) on Day 2, Day 7 and at 1 month. The secondary end-point is the
      National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) at these times. Other variables are time
      (in hours) between patient arrival on the stroke ward and positioning, protocol compliance by
      staff and patients, and the percentage of patients with a diastasis on arrival and on
      discharge.
