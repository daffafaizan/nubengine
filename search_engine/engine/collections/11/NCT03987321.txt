      embolism, inferior vena cava filter placement plays an important role in patients who are
      amenable to anticoagulant therapy. Currently, many different types of retrievable filters are
      being used in clinical practice and the choice of the filters depends on operators'
      preference and institutional availability. Each filter has different designs to maximize
      retrievability and minimize indwelling complications. Up until now, the prior studies on the
      filter retrievability and indwelling complications have been retrospective in nature and had
      relatively long dwell times. Comparative data regarding the retrievability of the inferior
      vena cava filters may help to choose filter selection. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to
      compare two commonly used inferior vena cava filters (Denali and Celet filters)
