    
      The aim of this study is to compare the image quality of the half radioisotope dose scans
      obtained using a CZT (cadmium zinc telluride) camera with scans acquired using a standard of
      care imaging protocol/radioisotope dose performed on a traditional (conventional) camera.

      The proposed strategy of a half dose/extended time protocol with the CZT camera should yield
      a similar count activity and consequently image quality equivalent to that detected by a
      conventional SPECT system.
