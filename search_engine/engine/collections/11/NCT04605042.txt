      six patients with solid pancreatic lesions referred for EUS guided fine needle biopsy will be
      randomly assigned to two groups. For group A which will be used with 22G EUS Procore fine
      needle biopsy device, the pass sequence is WS-SNP-WS-SNP technique. For group B with 22G EUS
      Procore fine needle biopsy device, the pass sequence is SNP-WS-SNP-WS. All procedures will be
      performed by experienced echo-endoscopists, and the patients and assessors (cytologists and
      pathologists) will be blinded during the entire study. The primary outcome measure is the
      diagnosis yield. Secondary outcome measures are specimen quality.
