      (i.e., stent thrombosis); yet rates of non-adherence range from 21-57% by 12 months. Mobile
      technology through TM or mobile apps is a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote
      behavior change and enhance medication adherence. The three specific aims of this proposal
      are to: 1) determine preferences for content and frequency of TM to promote medication
      adherence through focus groups; 2) determine the most patient-centered app to promote
      adherence through a content analysis of all commercially available apps for medication
      adherence and focus groups centered on usability; and 3) compare adherence to antiplatelet
      medications in 225 Veterans post ACS/PCI through a randomized controlled trial. Participants
      will be randomized to either TM, mobile app, or website-control group. The focus groups will
      be stratified by low/high mobile phone use and sex.
