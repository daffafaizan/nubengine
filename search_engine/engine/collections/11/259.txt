the behavior of lymphocytes in primary explants of human lung cancer invitro .the activity of lymphocytes within outgrowths from explanted tissuefragments of 20 human lung cancers has been studied . the study includedcancer-bearing tissue explants from all cases and noncancerbearing lungtissue from 4 of the 20 cases . five major categories of lymphocyticbehavior were derived from the study, namely.. (1) emigration andmigration of lymphocytes from the explant,. (2) clustering oflymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation oflymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. and (5) emperipolesis .criteria for these different lymphocytic activities have been amplifiedor introduced .findings of particular interest were.. (1) the frequency of both viable and nonviable lymphocytes within the vacuoles of other cells . thisobservation is considered to be an absolute criterion for the recogni-tion of emperipolesis . a subsequent /inclusionbody/ appearance of thedead lymphocytes has been observed . (2) the intimate relationship ofameboid forms of lymphocytes to selected cells, resulting in ajuxtanuclear and frequently unipolar crowding of one cell by numerouslymphocytes while nearby cells were totally devoid of ameboidlymphocytes . reasons are given to support the impression that thisphenomenon is re lated to sensitization . there is also the possibilitythat the phenomenon may indicate that the lymphocyte is /conditioned/ .(3) the apparent entry of the lymphocyte into the cell has been recordedby timelapse cinematography .a lymphocyte relationship to cancer cells was infrequently foundalthough explants of 15 of the 20 cases produced identifiable cancercells and lymphocytes emigrated from the explants of all 20 cases . itis not apparent from this limited study whether this is a significantfinding .
