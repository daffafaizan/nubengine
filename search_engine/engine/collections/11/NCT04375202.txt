    
      This is an interventional, pilot, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 2 study,
      enrolling patients with COVID-19 disease. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive Colchicine plus current care versus current care.

      One-month rate of entering the critical stage (either a. Respiratory failure occurs and
      requires mechanical ventilation; b. Patients combined with other organ failure need ICU
      monitoring and treatment; c. Death) is the primary endpoint. Secondary objectives are trend
      of White blood cell count, Change of the "Sequential Organ failure Assessment" (SOFA), Rate
      of biochemical criterion (CK, ALT,ferritin) recovery, Rate of disease remission and safety of
      Colchicine.
