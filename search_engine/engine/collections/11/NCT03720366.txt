      in the study are approved for use in the countries where the study will be conducted. The
      probes in Arm 1 consist of single doses of caffeine (100mg), dextromethorphan (30 mg),
      flurbiprofen (50 mg), midazolam (0.03 mg/kg), and omeprazole (40 mg). Arm 2 probes consist of
      digoxin (0.25 mg), and rosuvastatin (10 mg). Arm 3 probe is pioglitazone (15 mg). Enasidenib
      is administered orally. All probes, except for midazolam, are administered orally. Midazolam
      will be administered intravenously.

      In Part 1 (equivalent to Cycle 1), eligible subjects will receive the probes on Day -1,
      followed by the first dose of enasidenib on Day 1. Enasidenib will continue to be taken once
      daily for 28 days. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected according to
      a set schedule. Subjects will receive the probes a second time on Day 28. Part 2 of the study
      begins the next day when the subject begins a second round of daily enasidenib doses
      (equivalent to Cycle 2). Safety assessment s and procedures consistent with AML standard of
      care will continue.
