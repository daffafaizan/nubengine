      of subjects who had been exposed to study drug (either SKY0402, bupivacaine HCl, or both) in
      prior SKY0402 breast augmentation studies. Specifically, the protocol was designed to elicit
      any changes in the response of the silicone shell of the implant after exposure to study
      drug.
