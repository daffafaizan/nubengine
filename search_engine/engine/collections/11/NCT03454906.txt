      with ESA is a well-documented phenomenon. Several factors have been found to affect
      hemoglobin variability, including drug related, such as pharmacokinetic parameters,
      patient-related differences in demographic characteristics and factors affecting clinical
      status, as well as clinical practice guidelines, treatment protocols and reimbursement
      policies. Inflammation is also an important factor associated with hemoglobin variability,
      and the consequences of persistent inflammatory activity are far-reaching in affected
      patients.

      In present study, the factors influencing hemoglobin variability with inflammatory and
      nutritional parameters and its associations with all-cause mortality among hemodialysis
      patients are investigated.
