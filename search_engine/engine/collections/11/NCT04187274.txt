      challenging because of the lack of tools available. Through using urethral
      photoplethysmography, the urethral perfusion index (uPI) could allow tissue perfusion
      monitoring through a modified urinary catheter. The goal of this observational study is to
      evaluate the feasibility , performance and behavior of the IKORUS (Advanced Perfusion
      Diagnostics, Villeurbanne, France), a new device in the field. We aimed to assess its
      performance (duration and signal quality), the uPI variations during hemodynamic events
      (fluid challenge) in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and equipped with an
      advanced hemodynamic monitoring.
