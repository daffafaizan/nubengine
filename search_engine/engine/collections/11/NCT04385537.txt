    
      This will be a randomized, controlled trial in men and postmenopausal women (50-75y).
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the two study groups: a control group (CON) following
      their usual diet, or intervention group (PECAN) following their usual diet but also consuming
      68g/day of pecans as a snack.

      There will be 3 visits: A Screening visit and a baseline and post-diet intervention visit
      (4-weeks). Anthropometrics, questionnaires, a fasting blood sample, and fasting vascular
      measures will be collected at each visit. Subjects will participate in a saturated fatty acid
      meal challenge in which additional blood, vascular measurements will be collected.

      Hypothesis: Daily pecan consumption will result in improved fasting blood lipids, vascular
      measures, antioxidant status, and appetite compared to the control group. Additionally, also
      the PECAN group will result in improved postprandial blood lipids and vascular measures
      compared to the control group.
