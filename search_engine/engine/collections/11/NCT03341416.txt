      several aetiologies, from degenerative to genetic and vascular diseases. The initial focus is
      vascular and spinal cerebellar ataxias. The participants will be submitted to a
      neuronavigation protocol for the precise location of the dentate nucleus contralateral to the
      most symptomatic side. After that, the participants will be randomly assigned to 5 active or
      5 placebo sessions of 1Hz TMS over the located area. After the first 5 sessions and a period
      of at least 4 weeks washout, the participants will cross over and receive other 5 sessions,
      active or sham. Clinical and video evaluations will be conducted before and after active and
      sham cluster of sessions. The good responders, i.e., with over than 30% of improvement after
      the active section will be eligible to bilateral dentate nucleus DBS. After that, again, a
      cross-over double blind on-off stimulation will be performed. Each period (on or
      0ff-stimulation) will last 4 weeks.
