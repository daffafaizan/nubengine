      is an international multicentre, prospective, observational study, whereby patients with
      biopsy-proven low-rectal cancer (lower edge of the tumour < 6cms from the anal verge on MRI),
      will be recruited from participating centres, having given informed, written consent. Data
      from the radiology, surgical and pathological aspects will be collected and analysed
      centrally at the Royal Marsden Hospital. The patient's medical records will be reviewed for
      five years post surgery, and the patients will also be followed up by quality of life
      questionnaires. This project aims to show that in low rectal cancer, improved local control
      and survival can be achieved through a reduction in the involved CRM rates by MRI-planned
      surgery and selective pre-operative therapy. It also aims to assess the ability to predict
      disease recurrence and to provide an assessment of disease-free survival and overall
      survival.
