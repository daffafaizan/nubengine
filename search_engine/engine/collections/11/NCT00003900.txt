      non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with irinotecan and docetaxel. II. Determine the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes immediately followed by docetaxel IV
      over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5
      years or until death.
