      Patients with radiculopathy who had motor findings, who underwent any operations due to neck
      problems, who had systemic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases, inflammatory or infectious
      diseases, history of malignity, congenital anomalies, who benefited from another therapy
      modality and the ones in whom physical therapy modalities could not be used due to
      contraindications (individuals with sensory disorders, who use cardiac pace maker) were
      excluded from the study.

      A total of 36 individuals were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Randomization was allocated
      by numbered envelopes method. A total of 30 subjects (15 in Matrix Rhythm Therapy (MRT) group
      and 15 in CG) with neck pain due to mechanic causes like cervical discopathy, cervical
      arthrosis or myofascial pain syndrome were participated in this study.

      All assessments were done by the same physiotherapist (FU) before therapy and at the end of
      treatment sessions. The physiotherapist who did the assessments did not know to which group
      the subjects were belonged. Another physiotherapist who was not informed about the results of
      the evaluation treated the patients.

      Home-based exercise programs and recommendations were also given to patients. Matrix Rhythm
      Therapy is developed by Dr. Ulrich G. Randall at the university of Erlangen/Nuremberg.
      Longitudinal stroking, compression and spooning techniques are specific methods of MRT.
      Therapies of the patients were done by the physiotherapist who had certificate of MRT
      application.
