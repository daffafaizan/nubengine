      Exercise has salutary effects on glucoregulation and visceral adiposity, an important link
      for adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Exercise also upregulates neurotrophic activity, an effect that serves to increase neuronal
      viability in the same brain regions that support complex cognitive functions affected by
      metabolic disease. In this proposed controlled intervention trial, the hypothesis is that
      aerobic exercise will have a beneficial effect on cognition and several biomarkers that index
      disease progression for older adults with IGT. 40 older subjects (age: >55 yrs) with IGT,
      confirmed by OGTT, will be randomized to an aerobic fitness or stretching program for 6
      months. Cognitive measures and fasting blood samples will be obtained at baseline, month 3,
      and month 6. Cognitive tests will evaluate abilities affected by age and by significant
      glucoregulatory dysregulation. In addition, all subjects will undergo a
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp protocol, a cardiopulmonary fitness assessment, and body
      fat quantification procedures, immediately before and after the intervention. The specific
      aims of the study will be to determine if aerobic exercise enhances cognition for older
      adults with IGT, to evaluate whether exercise-induced change in insulin sensitivity predicts
      cognitive performance, and to relate exercise effects on insulin sensitivity and cognition to
      changes in specified biomarkers. The results of this study may provide support for a
      relatively simple and inexpensive treatment strategy that targets many of the health factors
      that influence risk of cognitive decline.
