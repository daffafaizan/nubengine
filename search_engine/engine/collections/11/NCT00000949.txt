      delays progression to AIDS and extends survival is currently unknown, such clinical benefits
      of rIL-2 can only be established in a large, long-term, randomized trial. This study examines
      the effect of two different rIL-2 doses on HIV viral burden and CD4+ cell count and provides
      additional information on optimal dosing, safety, and antiviral activity of rIL-2.

      Patients are randomized to receive one of two subcutaneous (sc) doses of recombinant rIL-2 or
      no rIL-2. Those patients who take rIL-2 initially receive three courses of treatment. For
      this study, a course is defined as eight calendar weeks, including the five-day period of sc
      rIL-2 administration. Additional courses are given (no more frequently than every 6 weeks) in
      order to maintain a CD4+ count of at least twice its baseline level or at least 1,000
      cells/mm3. Follow-up will continue for all patients until a common closing date of 12 months
      following enrollment of the last patient.
