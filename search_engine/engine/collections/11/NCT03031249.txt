      have reached CR are randomized into two groups.

      In experimental group, patients receive cytarabine at a dose of 3g/㎡/d on the first, third
      and fifth day, ATRA at a dose of 30mg/㎡/d on day 1-14 and ATO at a dose of 0.15mg/kg/d
      (maximum, 10mg/d) on day 1-14. Patients in control group only receive high dose of
      cytarabine.

      The safety and efficacy of ATRA plus ATO regimen is evaluated.The primary outcome is
      relapse-free survival rate after treatment.
