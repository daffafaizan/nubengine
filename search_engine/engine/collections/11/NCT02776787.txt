      into account previously unexplored areas in surgical decision-making including the
      comprehensive impact of this disease, as well as factors that impact a surgeon's willingness
      to recommend surgery. Ultimately, this patient-centered research approach will help us
      understand the impact of treatment decisions on a patient's quality of life, work, and
      clinical symptoms, and will ultimately help to inform our recommendations for the treatment
      of patients with diverticulitis.

      The DEBUT study was developed from questions raised by our Washington State Surgical
      Collaborative, (SCOAP Colon and Rectal Surgery Work Group) and will be carried out in clinics
      and hospitals across Washington State, Oregon, and California. The investigators invite
      patients to participate in research activities designed to identify the impact of
      diverticulitis and treatment options, in order to better understand the outcomes that matter
      most to patients. Patients who are considering surgery or who have received treatment for
      their diverticulitis will be recruited for study participation. Participants will complete a
      baseline survey via a convenient electronic platform, and follow-up surveys will be sent
      quarterly for up to four years. These surveys will examine quality of life, overall health,
      and clinical symptoms to understand what drives patients and surgeons to an operation, as
      well as how that decision impacts quality of life and recurrent events in patients that
      choose to have surgery compared to those that do not have surgery. Participating surgeons
      will complete surveys that examine their indications for surgery and surgical outcomes.
