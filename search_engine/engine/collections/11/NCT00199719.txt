      peginterferon alpha 2-a (40KD) weekly, and ribavirin with dose adjusted on BW (< 75 kg 1000
      mg/day, >75 kg 1200 mg/day) for the first three months with adjunction of amantadine 200 mg
      daily for the following 9 months.

      Plasma concentration profiles of ribavirin were studied after the first dose (D0) and at W12.
      At each period, blood samples were collected pre-dose and 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
      and 10 hours post-dosing. Ribavirin concentrations were measured using liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ribavirin area under the concentration-timcurves
      (AUC0-10h) were derived from plasma concentrations profiles using the linear trapezoidal
      rule.

      Virological follow-up was performed at W2, W4, W6, W8, W12, W24 and W72. Early virological
      response was defined by undetectable viral load at W12.
