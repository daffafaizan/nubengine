    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA
      response (defined as a ≥3 fold increase from baseline) 4 weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB
      administered in a neonatal schedule at a High, Mid or low vaccine titre. In addition the
      cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA response (defined as a ≥3 fold increase from baseline) 4
      weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB administered in an infant schedule at a high dose of vaccine
      will be assessed along with cumulative vaccine take and components of vaccine take after 3
      doses of RV3-BB administered in a neonatal or infant schedule.

      The safety and tolerability of RV3-BB when administered as an infant or as a neonatal
      schedule will be described.
