      I. To pilot test a novel parenting intervention. II. To examine the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of the parenting intervention on child medication adherence among
      children who are experiencing an illness.

      OUTLINE: Participants with poor medication adherence are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      EARLY GROUP: Participants continue medication adherence monitoring over 1 week and then
      receive parental skills intervention sessions consisting of 4 integrated components: creating
      consistent medication routines, education in child management strategies, strategies for
      helping children adhere to medication, and training in specific parental behavioral
      techniques over 30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks.

      DELAYED GROUP: Participants continue medication adherence monitoring over 2 weeks and then
      receive parental skills intervention sessions consisting of 4 integrated components: creating
      consistent medication routines, education in child management strategies, strategies for
      helping children adhere to medication, and training in specific parental behavioral
      techniques over 30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks.

      LATE GROUP: Participants continue medication adherence monitoring over 3 weeks and then
      receive parental skills intervention sessions consisting of 4 integrated components: creating
      consistent medication routines, education in child management strategies, strategies for
      helping children adhere to medication, and training in specific parental behavioral
      techniques over 30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks.
