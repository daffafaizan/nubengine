      injury (TBI) patient population. We will assess outcome measures that test
      neuropsychological, cognitive, communicative, and physical functional outcomes on up to 60
      patients with TBI and 20 healthy volunteers. Our aims are to evaluate the appropriateness of
      specific tests for TBI as well as to test patient tolerance of an extensive battery of
      assessments and the time required to complete the assessments. We will also focus on
      improving staff competencies as they relate to new or novel assessments on the TBI patient
      population.
