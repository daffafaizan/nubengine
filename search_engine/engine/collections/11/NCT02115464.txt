    
      This is a randomized, phase II, open label study in patients with locally advanced NSCLC
      which will compare standard RT (60-63 Gy for 6 weeks) plus concurrent Cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy (CRT) with or without consolidation (standard arm) vs the same CRT with or
      without consolidation plus treatment with Metformin concurrent with CRT and continuing for a
      total of 12 months (experimental arm). Ninety-four eligible and consenting patients will be
      randomized to one of the two treatment arms. Patients randomized to the experimental arm will
      receive Metformin (2000 mg/day) for a period of 12 months. Patients will be continuously
      evaluated for toxicity, will be assessed weekly at clinic visits during concurrent CRT
      treatment with or without consolidation and at follow up clinic visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months (from the date of randomization). Disease progression will be evaluated every 3 months
      for up to 12 months. All patients will be followed for up to 24 months (2 years) for
      survival.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of Metformin on the proportion
      of patients free of disease progression at 12 months after initiation of drug treatment.
