    
      The use of statin therapy in familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is known to reduce
      cardiovascular risk and is a first line recommendation, however, there is considerable
      residual risk predicted by the presence of fasting and post-prandial hypertriglyceridaemia.

      This study will examine the effect of oral n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters supplementation
      (4g/day, Omacor) on postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia and post-prandial arterial function
      when administrated to FH patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to their
      residual fasting hypertriglyceridaemia.
