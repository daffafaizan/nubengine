      histories of perpetrating intimate partner violence (IPV). F4C is designed to meet a
      significant unmet intervention need for fathers who have a history of family violence who are
      not helped by currently available batterer intervention programs (BIPs). BIPs that are
      currently available nationally have shown limited efficacy with high rates of repeat
      violence.

      This project will provide needed data to further develop F4C and move to a Stage II efficacy
      trial by: 1) revising the BIP group intervention manual to be delivered in an individual
      treatment format; 2) develop a fidelity measure for F4C and the BIP; 4) conduct a stage 1b
      randomized trial (consistent with the stage model of intervention development) to show
      initial feasibility, acceptability and intervention signal with the targeted population.

      Sixty fathers with a history of IPV who have already failed a treatment as usual group BIP
      will be randomly assigned to F4C or an individually delivered comparable dose of BIP.
      Reflective functioning and emotion regulation will be examined as the mechanisms through
      which Fathers for Change reduces IPV and child maltreatment risk behaviors.
