    
      Participants eligible for randomization will be randomized 1:1 to extended-release
      buprenorphine (XR-B) vs. extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) prior to release from the
      correctional controlled environment (including jails, prisons, work release and residential
      treatment, or other correctional facilities) and treated for 24-weeks following release or
      upon entry into a community CJS-mandated program.

      XR-B (SublocadeTM, Indivior) is a partial opioid agonist indicated for the treatment of
      moderate to severe opioid use disorder. Delivered as a pre-filled 2cc subcutaneous monthly
      injection, typically using two 300mg/1.5 ml initial starting doses followed by 100mg/0.5 ml
      monthly maintenance doses. The study will provide up to six monthly XR-B doses throughout the
      study. Prior to an initial injection, the participant must be stable for seven days or longer
      on sublingual buprenorphine (SLB) at doses of 8mg/day or higher.

      XR-NTX (VivitrolÂ®, Alkermes) is an opioid antagonist indicated for the prevention of opioid
      dependence, following detoxification. A negative opioid urine toxicology, negative
      self-report of any recent opioid use, and a naloxone challenge. The naloxone challenge
      consists of 0.4-0.8mg of IV/SC/IM naloxone followed by the observation of no opioid
      withdrawal symptoms, or the use of oral naltrexone (12.5-25mg) followed by 1-2 hours of
      observation. XR-NTX is delivered as a 380mg (4cc) intramuscular injection to the upper outer
      gluteus (buttock) monthly. The study will provide six or more monthly XR-NTX doses.
