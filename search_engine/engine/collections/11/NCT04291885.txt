      multi-institutional trial for patients with stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).
      Participants on the trial will receive either avelumab or placebo for 6 months. The primary
      aim of the I-MAT trial is to develop an effective, well-tolerated adjuvant immunotherapy
      regimen for patients with stage I-III MCC, following local and regional treatment options
      which includes surgery and/or radiotherapy.
