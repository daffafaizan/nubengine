      non-metastatic NSCLC, and have an ECOG PS score of 0-3 to be considered for enrollment.
      Subjects with small peripheral lesions(â‰¤3cm) are excluded, as the aim is to improve outcome
      in larger, central NSCLC carrying a higher risk of pneumonitis, as well as poorer local
      control. Feasibility of SBRT is judged by the treating physician. Chemotherapy given before
      SBRT is permitted, but subjects must be immunotherapy naive.

      SBRT is planned on the (persistent) PET+ tumor location for a dose of 10-12 Gy in 5
      fractions, delivered on sequential weekdays. In the Phase 1, 5 subjects will each receive
      GC4711 by 15-minute IV infusion, before each SBRT fraction After the Phase 1, a Phase 2,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study phase will be initiated, wherein
      approximately 66 subjects referred for SBRT with early stage large or central localized NSCLC
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either GC4711 or placebo given intravenously
      (IV) before each fraction of SBRT.

      All subjects will be evaluated for changes in the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide
      (DLCO) and pneumonitis. All subjects will be followed for 12 months for treatment related
      adverse effects, disease control (Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS),
      Distant Metastases (DM) rate and local control-(RECSIST 1.1), and quality of life (FACT-L) A
      Data Monitoring Committee will be established for the Phase 2 portion of the study to provide
      independent monitoring of safety given the blinded design.
