      by masking the PD-1 receptor. Our hypothesis is that the masking of the PD-1 receptor by
      pembrolizumab results in the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes with specificities
      against tumor associated antigens (TILs). In untreated lung cancer tumors, we would expect
      few tumors to have TIL cells with specificities against tumor associated antigens. Based on
      the response rate to pembrolizumab in advanced lung cancer, we hypothesize that at least 20%
      of lung cancers would have TIL cells with specificities against tumor associated antigens
      after pembrolizumab therapy.

      Studying neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy is an attractive strategy for studying the
      immunologic changes caused by PD-1 (programmed death receptor 1) checkpoint masking. Most of
      the immunologic activity associated with pembrolizumab occurs in the tumor and surrounding
      microenvironment. Evaluation of post-pembrolizumab tumor will be important to understanding
      factors associated with pembrolizumab activity, immune tolerance, and discovery of other
      targets for immune therapy. Pembrolizumab has known benefit in non-small cell lung cancer.
      The addition of pembrolizumab for two doses prior to surgery and four doses after surgery has
      the potential to confer clinical benefit. Large randomized phase 3 trials are now testing
      whether PD-1 checkpoint antibodies improve survival as adjuvant therapy after resection of
      early stage lung cancer.
