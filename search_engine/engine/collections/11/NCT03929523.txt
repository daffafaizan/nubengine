    
      This multicentric randomized controlled trial concerns adult patients undergoing whole liver
      transplantation in any of the 8 participating centers in France, who will receive an ECD
      liver graft from a brain-dead donor.

      After providing written informed consent prior to the performance of any study specific
      procedure, the recruited patients will be randomized either in the experimental group (HOPE
      group) or in the control group.

      In the HOPE group, ECD liver grafts will undergo a hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE)
      via the portal vein for a period of 1 to 4 hours (minimum 1 hour) after the "back-table"
      phase (graft preparation), in parallel with the recipient hepatectomy, using the CE-certified
      Liver Assist® perfusion pump/device (Organ Assist®, the Netherlands) with Machine Perfusion
      Solution (Belzer-MPS, CE-certified).

      The control group will consist of a classic static cold (4°C) storage with Institute George
      Lopez (IGL-1)® solution from graft harvesting until liver transplantation, which is the gold
      standard procedure in liver transplantation.

      The primary endpoint will be early allograft dysfunction (EAD) according to Olthoff's
      criteria, which will be compared with the Model of Early Allograft Function score (MEAF
      score) and the Liver Graft Assessment Following Transplantation risk factor (L-GrAFT).

      According to the primary endpoint, a sample size of 133 patients per randomized group (266 in
      total) is needed. The duration of the inclusion period is expected to be 36 months with a
      1-year follow-up for each patient.

      The potential impacts of the study are expected on 3 levels: (1) for the patient, decreased
      postoperative morbidity and mortality of liver transplantation with ECD donors; (2) for the
      French liver transplantation community, familiarization with liver machine perfusion, and (3)
      economically, decreased costs of liver transplantation (health economic analysis included in
      the study).
