    
      Exercise in the heat has large effects on cardiovascular strain, the ability to regulate core
      body temperature, and performance because of an increase in the reliance on body fluid
      distribution to the skin to maintain adequate sweat rates and heat dissipation.
      Carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage intake during exercise in the heat may improve fluid
      balance and subsequent physical performance.

      The participants will be assigned each arm in a randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over
      fashion separated by at least 2 weeks. Participants will be placed in a heated environment
      for the duration of the exercise intervention.
