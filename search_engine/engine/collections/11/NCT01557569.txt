      facility. This will help participants initiate withdrawal. During the following 8-weeks the
      participant will come in for 3-4 visits each week. Three of these visits will be with the
      research assistants and one visit will be with a therapist in order to work with the
      participant using a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. Therapy visits are typically
      scheduled on a day that the participant is coming for clinic anyways so the number of visits
      per week is typically 3. During the 10-week period the investigators will collect various
      measures, including vitals, cognitive assessments, mood assessments, urine drug screens,
      weekly use reports of methamphetamine, and any reports of symptoms or side effects. This will
      tell the investigators if atomoxetine is safe and if a participant lapsed or relapsed.
