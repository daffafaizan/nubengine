      catheterization in women randomized to intraurethral lidocaine gel instillation or
      lubrication of the catheter's tip with lidocaine gel.

      Women aged 18 years and older who will be referred for multichannel Urodynamic study in order
      to evaluate lower urinary tract symptomswill be included.

      Patients will be randomized to 2 groups: (1) 5mL of 2% lidocaine gel instilled directly into
      the urethra 5 minutes before catheterization; (2), 5mL of 2% lidocaine gel poured on the
      distal part of the catheter. The randomization technique will be employed by a computerized
      random number generator.

      A 12F Nelaton urethral catheter will be introduced in order to measure post-void residual
      volumes. Subsequently, multichannel Urodynamic testing (Duet Encompass System - Mediwatch
      Group Plc) will be performed using a dual lumen 6F urethral and 9F rectal catheters. Filling
      will be carried out using room temperature saline at a filling rate of 50 ml/min.

      Patients will be requested to fill out a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) visual
      analog pain scale (VAS) in different time points: prior to gel instillation (baseline),
      immediately after gel instillation (only in group 1), immediately after the introduction of
      the Nelaton catheter, 5 and 30 minutes after the catheter will be taken out.

      Time frame of the study: 30 minutes before the test and 1 hour after the test. Since the
      study evaluates pain during the procedure the time frame of the study and assessment is very
      short. longer follow-up is not needed.
