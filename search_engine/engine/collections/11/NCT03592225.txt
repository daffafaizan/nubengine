      train them in methods for recommending HPV vaccine with greater confidence and efficiency is
      effective to increase HPV vaccination coverage in France. As each health professional is
      associated in France to a specific reference number i.e. "RPPS number", RPPS numbers for all
      General Practitioners (GP) from the city of Lyon will be randomly allocated either to the
      intervention arm or to the control arm to ensure that each arm contains 50% of the total
      number of GPs. After allocation, GPs in the allocation arm will be identified and invited to
      attend the intervention i.e. a 3-hour workshop at IARC in the presence of HPV vaccination
      specialists. The effect of the intervention on the HPV vaccination coverage in Lyon will be
      measured through HPV vaccines reimbursement data extracted from the Inter-Scheme National
      Information System within the National Health Insurance System (SNIIR-AM : Système National
      d'Information Inter-Régimes de l'Assurance Maladie ). Linkable data between girls and General
      Practitioners (GP) via RPPS numbers will allow us to allocate girls either in the
      intervention or the control arm. Vaccination coverage will be estimated within each of these
      cohorts.
