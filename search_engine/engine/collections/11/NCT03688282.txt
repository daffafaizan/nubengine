      have high rates of compliance with the study protocol, receive consistently therapeutic
      levels of vibration and see significant effects on bone turnover based on plasma markers of
      bone anabolism and catabolism.

      The anticipated outcomes from serum draws are an improvement in two bone turnover markers
      after a 30 minute treatment with the WVD.
