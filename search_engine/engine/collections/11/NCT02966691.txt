      I. The first one involves the construction of better image processing algorithm from a
      learning sample. The learning sample will include 600 virtual slides made from the urine
      sample of the first 600 patients enrolled.

      II. The second one, will evaluate from an evaluation sample, the diagnostic performance of
      the test VisioCyt, to identify patients with versus without bladder tumors, using as
      comparator the results of the examination of reference: histology. The evaluation sample will
      include 400 slides, made from the urine sample of the last 400 patients enrolled.
