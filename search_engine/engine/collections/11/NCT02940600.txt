      years. Old donors are a valuable resource but their use has been related to a major incidence
      of primary non function (PNF), delayed graft function (DGF) and ischemic type biliary lesions
      (ITBL).

      Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a major reason for the development of these complications and
      and old grafts are more susceptible than younger ones.

      Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is a novel and promising technique that allows
      preservation in a more physiological environment. It is our belief that the use of NMP might
      reduce the impact of ischemia-reperfusion injuries in older grafts thus reducing the
      incidence of complications and providing a better outcome.
