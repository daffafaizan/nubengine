      dramatically but less prominently in diabetic patients. Even in the era of DES, diabetes
      remains a significant predictor of coronary restenosis especially in cases of small baseline
      and post PCI vessel size, longer stent length, current smokers, and high level of CRP.
      Restenosis remains a main clinical and angiographic concern after DES implantation especially
      in diabetic patients. Diabetes has been known as a major risk factor for in-stent restenosis
      after DES implantation.

           neointima volume by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

        2. Secondary end point: Comparison of pioglitazone and placebo on the changes in the levels
           of inflammatory markers (hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-Î±, adiponectin).
