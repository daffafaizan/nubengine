      neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). NMBAs are usually administered after testing mask
      ventilation; however, muscle relaxants may improve mask ventilation and they do not alter
      mask ventilation. Thus, growing evidence suggests to administer muscle relaxants before
      testing mask ventilation.We will administer rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg and
      saline (placebo group) before starting with mask ventilation. We will grade mask ventilation
      based on various scores before and after rocuronium application. Afterwards patient's
      tracheas will be intubated. We assess risk factors for difficult mask ventilation.

      We hypothesize that rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg will be superior to rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg and saline.
