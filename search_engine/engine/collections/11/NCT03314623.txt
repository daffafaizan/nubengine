      tolerated following plate osteosynthesis after a proximal tibial plateau fracture is possible
      without increased risk of loss of reduction and/or failure of the osteosynthesis.
      Subsequently, this may lead to earlier recovery and less risk of thromboembolic
      complications.

      The investigators hypothesize immediate weight bearing as tolerated (WBAT) following plate
      osteosynthesis after a proximal tibial plateau fracture, in cases deemed stable by the
      surgeon, will not lead to any loss of reduction.

      Exposure will be defined as surgery with one or two angular stable plates (closed reduction,
      internal fixation) after a proximal tibial fracture. Patients will be allowed immediate
      weight bearing as tolerated in cases where the osteosynthesis is deemed stable. This
      represents the current practice at Slagelse Hospital. Typical, all lateral tibia plateau
      fractures (AO fracture classification 41B1-3) osteosynthesized will be allowed immediate WBAT
      after surgery. Other tibia plateau fractures will be allowed immediate WBAT if the
      osteosynthesis is deemed stable by the surgeon perioperatively.

      Fractures are treated with one or several locking plates, and if needed after reduction of
      the tibial plateau, an impacted allogenic bone graft is used. The bone graft is applied
      through a cortical window osteotomy distal to the fracture.

      Follow up will be performed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year by any of the
      authors or a consultant in orthopedics. Follow up will be performed at the outpatient clinic.
