      The test panel will be recruited from the dental students of the Lutheran University of
      Brazil, Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. At recruitment, subjects will be asked about their
      medical and dental history. Written and oral explanations detailing the study purpose and
      design will be given for each subject. Subjects that preliminarily met inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be selected for a dental screening appointment. If the subject met all the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, an informed consent was handed out and, upon acceptance, signed
      by the volunteers.

      The following clinical parameters were assessed in the order listed below from all teeth,
      excepting the third higher/lower molar.

      Presence of calculus (C) in all teeth, at 6 sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal,
      disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and disto-lingual) was scored as a dichotomous
      index: 0 - Absence of calculus; 1 - Presence of calculus.

      Discoloration Index proposed by Lobene 36 and modified by Macpherson et al. 2000. This
      involves visual stain assessment of the buccal/labial and lingual/palatal aspects of the
      index teeth.
