    
      This is an observational, retrospective, non-interventional study that will include
      schizophrenic patients who were initiated on AOM treatment during an schizophrenia-related
      hospitalisation at least 6 months before data collection and in a real clinical practice
      setting.

      Data from each patient will be collected after informed consent is obtained (if possible),
      and will include retrospective information mainly from the index date (start of AOM
      treatment, baseline timepoint) until the last information available in the patient file at
      the time of data collection (minimum of 6 months after the index date). Data will be
      retrospectively collected from all visits occurring as per clinical practice (usually
      once-monthly).
