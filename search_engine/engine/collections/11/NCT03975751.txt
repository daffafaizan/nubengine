      high-level studies of sedation and analgesia in China are still deficient, especially in
      patients with brain injuries who even have been excluded from the relevant studies. In the
      present study, a multicenter, 1-day point cross-sectional study about the sedation and
      analgesia among patients in China, particularly brain-injured will be investigated. The
      objectives are to investigate sedation and analgesia among patients in China and to compare
      sedation and analgesia between brain injuries and other patients.
