      lateral epicondyle, and travels proximally until it dives between the posterior portion of
      the V shaped insertion of the deltoid and the external? insertion of the triceps, whereupon
      it joins with the radial nerve.

      A proposed pathological explanation is that repetitive co-contraction produces irritation and
      compression of the nerve at the delto-tricipital (D-T) fascial penetration point. Clinically
      the patient experiences pain localized to that compression point, and traveling distally
      along the course of some or all of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve.

      Perineural injection of dextrose has been previously reported for therapeutic use in chronic
      pain associated with Achilles tendinopathy. Empirically,injection of D5W with a small needle
      along the course of the PACN and at the D-T penetrator has been found to resolve both pain
      and dysfunction (describe dysfunction).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either 1 month of physical therapy or to 0,1,2 and
      3 week injection of D5W. The use of standardized measurement tools for pain (0-10 numerical
      rating scale) and function (Quick DASH) will be utilized to determine baseline status and
      status at 1 month. At 1 month, subjects receiving therapy will be allowed to cross over to
      injection treatment and all participants will receive as needed treatment until the 1 year
      period of follow-up. Thus only 1 month data is randomized but long term data will be
      gathered.
