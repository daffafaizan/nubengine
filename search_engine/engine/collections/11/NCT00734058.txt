      indications for the SOLAR™ System based on 0-30 day data; as well as to support the expansion
      of indications for the SOLAR™ System and ATRILAZE™ System for the treatment of atrial
      fibrillation based on 180 days data. The data will be evaluated by comparing post-operative
      data to the historical control data. The subjects in the study cohort will receive laser
      ablation therapy using the investigational device during a concomitant surgical procedure.
