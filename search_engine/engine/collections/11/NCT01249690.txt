    
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant tumor with abnormal proliferation of monoclonal plasma
      cells in bone marrow. Bone damage is one of the characteristic clinical manifestations.
      Myeloma plasma cells and bone marrow microenvironment are the targets of thalidomide and
      bortezomib. The regimens based on them as first-line treatments of MM have greatly improved
      efficacy and prolonged the survival of MM patients. But whether the regimens can prevent and
      treat bone complications of MM patients or improve the quality of life is not clear. By
      evaluating the efficacy of PAD-regimen(Bortezomib,Pirarubicin and Dexamethasone) and
      TAD-regimen(Thalidomide,Pirarubicin and Dexamethasone) in MM and the effect of them on bone
      lesions, this study can provide evidence of evidence-based medicine for MM treatment.
