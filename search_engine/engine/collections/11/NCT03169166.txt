      fertilization, either in normal or stimulated ovarian cycles in assisted reproductive
      techniques. This step has traditionally been accomplished by the administration of human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger which mimics LH activity. However, hCG is a primary
      cause of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women and appears to initiate the
      complex cascade that leads to the development of serious medical complications. Numerous
      strategies have been suggested to prevent OHSS; one of these is the administration of a
      gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist trigger instead of hCG. Despite a high safety
      profile, the GnRH agonist trigger of follicle maturation was found to be associated with a
      decreased probability of clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates and very high miscarriage
      rates. A profoundly deficient luteal phase is believed to be the cause of compromised
      reproductive outcome. Our personal clinical practice at the AUBMC Fertility Center seems to
      indicate that a novel GnRH agonist administration protocol is associated with a comparable
      reproductive performance to standard hCG trigger. In this study, we aim to validate the above
      clinical impression and assess associated parameters of success. Therefore, a prospective
      comparative randomized controlled trial will be performed in order to investigate the effect
      of three repeated doses of GnRH agonist trigger "Triptorelin" accompanied by intensive Luteal
      Support on the ongoing pregnancy outcome in women who are hyper-responders to ovarian
      stimulation when undergoing assisted reproductive technology.
