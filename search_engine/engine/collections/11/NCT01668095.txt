    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate whether the expression of a subset of proteins (by immunohistochemistry),
      known to be Involved in the paired box (Pax)3, Pax7, and Patched-1 neuromuscular development
      pathways, are dysregulated in advanced and relapsed alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas.

      OUTLINE:

      Immunohistochemistry is performed for each candidate target (Pax3, Pax7, and Patched-1) in
      each disease (alveolar, embryonal, and anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma) for tissue microarray
      analysis.
