      compromised chemo-reflexes that results in hypoventilation during sleep. Recently, a
      heterozygous PHOX2B gene mutation was identified in CCHS. This report was made to increase
      physicians' awareness of this rare disease.

      Methods: A Chinese family of CCHS with presentations from newborn to adulthood and genetic
      analysis confirming the PHOX2B mutation was analyzed. After identifying central
      hypoventilation in an adult male (index case), clinical evaluation was performed on the
      complete family, which consisted of the parents, five siblings, and five offsprings. In
      addition, pulmonary function test, overnight polysomnography, arterial blood gas, and
      hypercapnia ventilatory response, and genetic screening for PHOX2B gene mutations were
      performed on living family members.
