    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the quality of surgical plans prepared under the guidance of the non-contrast,
      ionizing-radiation-free perforator phase contrast angiography (pPCA) against plans based upon
      the current gold standard, the X-ray-based, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic
      angiography (CTA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether pPCA is more accurate than CTA for vessel size measurement.

      II. To assess the impact of pPCA-based surgical planning on the clinical outcomes of
      abdominal-based free flap surgery.

      III. To obtain and analyze cost/expenditure information for pPCA-guided abdominal-based free
      flap procedures.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care CTA and undergo pPCA MRI for up to 60 minutes before
      surgery.

      After surgery, patients will be followed up at 24 hours, 1 week, 3 months, 1 year and 2
      years.
