      availability of synthetic glucocorticoids. Current replacement therapy has improved this
      dramatically, but recent data suggest that outcome is still compromised. Patient receiving
      replacement therapy with hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate have compromised quality of
      life, reduced bone mass, increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature
      mortality that is more than twice the mortality rate in the background population.

      Circulating cortisol levels follow a distinct diurnal pattern with high levels in the early
      morning and low trough values around midnight. Using available formulations for replacement
      therapy this circadian rhythm is had to mimic and also during the active time of the day high
      peaks and low troughs occur.

      In this trial a newly developed novel dual-, controlled release formulation of hydrocortisone
      that has in healthy volunteers been able to mimic the circadian pattern of circulating
      cortisol was studied in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease).
