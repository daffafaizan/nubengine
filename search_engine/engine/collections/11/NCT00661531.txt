      to treat hormonally sensitive breast cancers, treatment with pharmacologic doses of estrogen
      was a common technique used to treat post-menopausal women with hormone sensitive metastatic
      disease that resulted in durable responses with regression of disease. A randomized trial
      comparing tamoxifen and pharmacologic doses of estrogen demonstrated similar rates of
      response with long-term follow-up data confirming a survival benefit for those treated with
      the estrogen preparation. Additional data has shown that post-menopausal women with
      hormonally sensitive tumors that have progressed on prior endocrine therapies responded to
      treatment with pharmacologic doses of estrogen. These data, coupled with pre-clinical data
      that postmenopausal levels of estrogen can be used to cause apoptosis (programmed cell death
      within the tumor) and tumor regression in exhaustively treated endocrine resistant disease
      form the rationale for the proposed clinical trial. This trial seeks to confirm the response
      rate for estrace treatment in a patient population heavily pre-treated with modern endocrine
      therapies.
