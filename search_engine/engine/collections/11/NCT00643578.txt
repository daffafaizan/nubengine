      will be measured and they will perform standard spirometry. If the results of this test are
      70% of normal or greater, they will be examined by a physician, and blood (1 teaspoonful) and
      urine will be collected for routine laboratory tests (CBC and routine urinalysis). If they
      are a female, a pregnancy test will be performed.

      During the second visit, subjects will inhale 1 or 2 doses of formoterol, (Foradil Aerolizer
      12 mcg/capsule) a long-acting bronchodilator and 1 hour later, perform a methacholine test.

      At the end of the methacholine test, they will be given albuterol to reverse the effects of
      methacholine. On the third study day, they will repeat the second visit but with the opposite
      dose of Foradil.
