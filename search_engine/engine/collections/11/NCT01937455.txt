    
      This study is a phase 1, randomized, blinded, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of rAAV1-PG9DP when administered intramuscularly at 4x10^12 vg, 4x10^13 vg,
      8x10^13 vg and 1.2x10^14 vg in healthy male adults.

      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before injection and will be followed for 12 months
      after the single administration. It is anticipated that it will take approximately 13 months
      to enroll the study.

      Volunteers will be randomly assigned investigational product (IP) or placebo within each of
      the dose groups described in the study design table above depending on which group is
      enrolling. Study staff and volunteers will be blinded only with respect to the allocation of
      placebo or IP. Blinding will not apply to the assignment of dosage levels.

      Volunteers will be offered enrollment into a follow-up study at the research center when they
      have finished participating in the trial
