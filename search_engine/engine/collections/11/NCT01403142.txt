      transplant as part of their standard of care, with various degrees of disease and with
      different lesion subtypes. Imaging will take place at the time of routine coronary angiogram,
      which is standard of care in this patient population,or when clinically indicated. In prior
      studies using IVUS todetect CAV, the yield was significantly higher with multi-vessels
      imaged. OCT is an intravascular light-based imaging modality that measures the intensity of
      reflected light waves and converts these echoes into a high-resolution tomographic image. It
      is a catheter-based invasive imaging system analogous to IVUS but uses light as opposed to
      ultrasound to generate in vivo images of coronary arteries. It has the highest resolution of
      any intravascular imaging modality, capable of obtaining detailed cross-sectional images of
      coronary arteries in vivo at a resolution of 10 um or near histologic. This device, which is
      FDA approved for intracoronary evaluation, has been used in evaluating patients with coronary
      artery disease, specifically for plaque composition analysis, as well as for proper stent
      deployment after percutaneous intervention.
