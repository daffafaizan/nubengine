      The spa therapy group received 18 days of therapy over 3 weeks. Patients in the control group
      received 18 days of therapy over 3 weeks after the 6-month follow-up visit.

      Follow-up was at 3 and 6 months, by a visit to the examination.

      The hypothesis of our study is to demonstrate clinical improvement at six months. The main
      endpoint is the number of patients achieving minimal clinically important improvement (MCII)
      at 6 months, defi ned as ≥19.9 mm on the visual analogue pain scale and/or ≥9.1 points in a
      normalised Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index function score.
