    
      On the basis of the current knowledge on the outcomes of Ross Operation we aim to create a
      large multi centric registry in order to obtain data on the preoperative intraoperative
      management of these patients and on the postoperative long-term results of this procedure.

      Patients data will be entered by the investigators in an electronic database Preoperative
      variables will include age, comorbidities, functional status, indications for surgery,
      morphology of the aortic valve Additional morphological data and aortic and pulmonary
      measurements will be taken intraoperatively Postoperative follow-up data including both
      clinical outcomes (mortality, reoperation for pulmonary autograft failure, major cardiac
      events, stroke, infection) and morphological measurements by means of CT scan or
      echocardiography, will be inserted.

      Quality of life by means of SF12 and Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire and
      EQ-5D score will be collected.

      Follow-up endpoints are at discharge, 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years and 20 years.
