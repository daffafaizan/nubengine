      the bladder is the 4th most commonly diagnosed cancer and 7th leading cause of cancer death
      in the American men, and represents an important target for mortality-reducing efforts.
      Furthermore, these tumors, even in early (i.e. curable) stages, usually cause several easily
      detectable abnormalities, including hematuria, and the presence of abnormal tumor products
      that are shed into urine or lie within exfoliated malignant cells.

      The overall goal of the proposed study is to gain information concerning the performance
      characteristics of three bladder cancer markers when combined with hematuria testing in
      detecting bladder cancer.

      A mail back questionnaire, completed at the beginning of the study, will provide information
      about the participants and the results of testings will be reported after each testing
      period. Individuals with even a solitary positive test will undergo a thorough urologic
      evaluation to determine the cause of hematuria and follow-up will continue or 2 years after
      completion of the study. At the time of the evaluation, three bladder cancer marker tests,
      NMP22 Bladder Chek, ImmunoCyt and UroVysion FISH will be performed, but regardless of the
      results, a hematuria evaluation will be completed. Data will be updated continually.

      The 10 day testing with Hemastix will be repeated 9 months after the first one is completed
      regardless of the outcome of the first testing.
