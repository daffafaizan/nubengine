      single administration of either individual, autologous ATCell™ lines suspended in 5% dextrose
      lactated Ringer's solution or a vehicle (5% dextrose Lactated Ringer's solution) not
      containing cells. Each ATCell™ cell line will be created from cells grown from the stromal
      vascular fraction (SVF) of a participant's own adipose tissue collected by liposuction, and
      each treated participant will only receive their own cells.

      Within the treated group, 3 dosing levels will be explored: 50 million cells, 150 million
      cells, or 300 million cells, and a Placebo group which will receive 5% dextrose lactated
      Ringer's solution free of cells. Participant follow-ups will take place 1 day following the
      tissue harvest procedure and, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months following
      ATCell™ treatment. Comprehensive participant's evaluations involving data collection will
      take place 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment.

      It has been proposed that in general, mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) events need to be
      taken far more seriously, and that even mild TBI events can result in lasting negative
      consequences as evidenced by lower performances on neuropsychological assessments when
      compared with age-matched controls2. In fact, this condition may eventually lead to
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which, together
      may be termed the AD-like dementias3, further underscoring the need for effective clinical
      intervention. Currently, no effective treatments are available for this condition aside from
      treatment of the symptoms, although some more comprehensive treatments have been proposed.
