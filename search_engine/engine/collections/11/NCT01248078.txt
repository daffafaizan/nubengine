      reduce postoperative maternal infectious morbidity is generally used but may not be efficient
      based on the available data. Also, the optimal timing of prophylactic antibiotic
      administration is unclear.

      Methods. The investigators compared the effectiveness of cefazolin, administered before skin
      incision versus after umbilical cord clamping versus placebo in a three-arm randomized trial.
      The primary endpoint of the study was postoperative infectious morbidity, defined as wound
      infection, endometritis, or urinary tract infection. Results: The primary outcome was
      observed in 18/370 women in group 1 (4.9%) and in 14/371 women in group 2 (3.8%), whereas it
      was noted in 45/371 women in group 3 (12.1%; p<0.001 for group 1 vs. group 3; p<0.001 for
      group 2 vs. group 3; p<0.001 for group 1 vs. group 2 vs. group 3). The number needed to treat
      to avoid one primary outcome was 13. Comparing groups 1 and 2, there was no statistically
      significant difference regarding the primary outcome (p=0.6).

      Conclusions. In this prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial the investigators were
      able to demonstrate the usefulness of prophylactic cefazolin in elective caesarean section
      versus placebo, irrespective of the timing of administration, ie before skin incision or
      after umbilical cord clamping.
