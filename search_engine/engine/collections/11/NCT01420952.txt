      glutamate by activating proteins inside nerve cells that affect cell metabolism, thereby
      fine-tuning the signals sent between cells to maintain balance in neuronal activity. mGluR
      receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1s) are located in several brain regions, including the cerebellum,
      hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and basal ganglia. mGluR1 activation stimulates phospholipase C,
      resulting in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels. Detailed
      study of mGluR1s has heretofore been hindered by the lack of high affinity and of selective
      ligands for this receptor subtype.

      The present protocol will use a new PET ligand [C(11)]mGlu1 to 1) perform kinetic brain
      imaging to quantify mGluR1 binding parameters in brain and determine the reliability and
      reproducibility of these measures in 15 healthy volunteers (Phase 1); and 2) if the tracer
      proves successful in Phase 1, we will estimate radiation-absorbed doses of [C(11)]mGlu1 in
      healthy human subjects by performing whole body imaging (Phase 2).

      Successful development of a PET ligand to image mGlurR1 would have a strong impact on
      clinical management of brain disorders characterized by disruptions in glutamatergic
      transmission, including anxiety and stress disorders, drug addiction, epilepsy, Huntington s
      disease, and Parkinson s disease.
