      gemcitabine; day 1, 2h intravenous infusion of 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin; day 1, deep
      intramuscular injection of 2500 U/m2 PEG-ASP at three different sites. The regimen was
      repeated every 2 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. Stage IE/IIE patients underwent four
      cycles induction chemotherapy, followed by involved-field radiotherapy after got CR, PR or
      SD. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was done by linear accelerator at 2.0 grays (Gy)
      per daily fraction with 5-6 weeks. The involved- field radiation (IFRT) dose was 50-56 Gy.
      Stage IIIE/IVE patients patients underwent at least two cycles treatments unless there was
