    
      This is a Phase I dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, double blind study assessing the safety
      and preliminary efficacy of an anti-cocaine vaccine called "dAd5GNE vaccine". The vaccine is
      designed to prevent cocaine from reaching the brain. The vaccine is comprised of GNE, a
      cocaine-like molecule that is linked to the capsid protein of a disrupted serotype 5
      adenovirus. The vaccine is used to evoke "immunity" to prevent cocaine from reaching the
      brain. The vaccine evokes an immune system response and stimulates the creation of
      anti-cocaine antibodies. The antibodies bind to the cocaine molecules when a person takes
      cocaine and prevents the cocaine molecules from reaching the brain. This cocaine-antibody
      complex is not able to cross the blood brain barrier and thus eliminates the effects of
      cocaine on the brain, as seen in pre-clinical studies done by our group. In mice, rats and
      nonhuman primates, this vaccine evoked a persistent, high titer, high affinity IgG
      anti-cocaine antibody response. The pre-clinical studies conducted establish efficacy for
      high anti-cocaine antibody titers. The immunity sequesters parenterally administered cocaine
      in the blood, in mice, rats and nonhuman primates (Appendix I-III).

      For each subject, the study will take place over a period of 32 weeks from the time of the
      first vaccine administration, and will enroll cocaine addicts, as defined by the Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, Text Revisions (DSM-V-TR).
