      adopted.This trial adopts the seamless design of phase I/IIa, which is carried out in two
      phases, phase I and phase IIa, phase I is the age/dose climbing phase, and phase IIa is the
      dose expansion phase.It is planned to enroll 580 subjects, divided into 5 age groups,
      including: young adults (18-59 years old, 60 people), adolescents (6 -17 years old, 60
      people), and elderly (≥60 years old, 160 people) , Toddlers (2-5 years old, 140), infants (6
      weeks to 23 months old, 160).Research phase and trial grouping: age/dose climbing phase: 340
      subjects are planned to be enrolled in Liuzhou City, and they will be enrolled in the group
      according to the age order of young adults → adolescents and old people → toddlers → infants
      and young children. There are 10 cohorts, randomly divided into experimental group (low-dose
      or high-dose), placebo group (containing aluminum), and the random ratio of each entry stage
      is 2:1. Among them, infants and the elderly will be added a placebo group without aluminum
      adjuvant, test group (low dose or high dose), placebo group (aluminum), placebo
      (aluminum-free), the random ratio is 2:1:1; Dose expansion stage: It is planned to enroll 240
      subjects in Rong'an County. The elderly, infants, and infants will be divided into 3 cohorts,
      and each age group will be randomly divided into low-dose or high-dose groups, with a random
      ratio of 1:1.According to the order of young adults → adolescents and elderly → toddlers →
      infants and young children, the dose is from low to high, and the investigator (including the
      main investigator and the field investigator) will review the safety of the low-dose/placebo
      group 7 days after the first dose. After the safety data is confirmed, you can enter the
      high-dose/placebo group for this age group to explore. After DSMB examines the safety data of
      the first dose of young and middle-aged people to 30 days after the full exemption and
      confirms safety, they can enter the adolescent and elderly age group; DSMB examines the
      safety and confirms the safety of the first dose of adolescents and the elderly to 30 days
      after the full exemption After that, you can enter the infant age group; the investigator
      (including the main investigator and the field investigator) will review the safety data 7
      days after the first dose of the infant low-dose/placebo group and confirm the safety, then
      you can enter the infant age group explore. The three age groups (cohorts 4 and 6, 7 and 8, 9
      and 10) of the elderly, toddlers, and infants can be entered into the corresponding age after
      the DSMB reviews the safety data of the first dose to 30 days after the full exemption and
      confirms the safety. In the dose expansion phase (cohorts 11, 12, 13), 80 subjects were
      enrolled in each cohort (of which, 40 were vaccinated with low-dose trial vaccine and 40 were
      vaccinated with high-dose trial vaccine).
