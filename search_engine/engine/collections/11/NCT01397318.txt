      investigated by surveying 300 pregnant women who are over 23 weeks of gestation and screen
      for pregnant women with fatigue and poor sleep quality. In the second-stage, experts in
      obstetrics and TaiChi will be invited to modify a TaiChi exercise program. Thirty women who
      experience fatigue and poor sleep quality will be invited to practice the modified TaiChi
      exercise. Comments from those participants on the program will be used to refine the program
      and a DVD will be made. After the program is well-designed and recorded, participants
      recruited for the third-stage study will be randomly assigned to TaiChi or comparison group.
      They will be asked to complete questionnaires and give blood samples for biomarker tests when
      they are at 27-29, 31-33, and 35-37 weeks of gestation; in labor; and at 4-6 weeks
      postpartum. In addition to practice the exercise at home, participants in the TaiChi group
      will practice TaiChi in groups every month. In contrast, comparison group will be asked to
      keep on their usual daily activities, no other interventions will be introduced. Phone calls
      or postcard will be made or sent routinely to participants to ensure their long-term
      participation. Questionnaires used for the study include 10-item Perceived Stress Scale,
      Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive
      statistics, Pearson correlation, and generalized estimating equations will be applied to
      understand predictive effects of maternal stress, fatigue, sleep quality, and biomarkers on
      infant outcomes; and effects of modified TaiChi exercise on maternal stress, fatigue, sleep
      quality, biomarkers, and infant outcomes. In addition to develop a modified TaiChi exercise
      program suitable for pregnant women, the study anticipates that maternal stress, fatigue, and
      poor sleep quality can predict infant outcomes through immunologic pathway, and the modified
      TaiChi exercise can reduce maternal stress and fatigue, improve sleep quality, modulate
      biomarkers, and hence prevent adverse infant outcomes.
