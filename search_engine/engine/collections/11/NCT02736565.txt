    
      Study testing of pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX will involve patients (≥age 8) with advanced
      Ewing's sarcoma. The first 3 subjects enrolled onto the study as well as the first subject
      enrolled into each dose cohort must be 16 years of age or older. pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1
      LPX will be given via intravenous infusion. Patients will be accrued in 3- patient dose
      escalation cohorts using the following escalation schema (50%→33%→25%→25%→25%) at a starting
      IV dose of 0.04 mg/kg.

      If 1 of 3 subjects within a dose cohort experiences a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), that dose
      cohort will be expanded to six subjects provided no further subjects experience a DLT. If no
      further subjects experience a DLT, dose-escalation may continue. If ≥2 subjects within a dose
      cohort experiences a DLT, this will define the DLT dose level and the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) will have been exceeded.

      The preceding dose level will be expanded to a total of 6 subjects and, if ≤1 subject
      experiences a DLT, that dose level will be considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If no
      further subjects experience a DLT, dose-escalation may resume per escalation schema.

      Once the presumptive MTD is reached, an additional 6 subjects will be treated at that dose,
      designated the expanded MTD dose cohort.

      Serum for pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis will be collected on Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1
      (C1W1D1), Cycle

      1, Week 6, Day 4; and Cycle 2, Week 1, Day 1 at following time points (±10%):30 minutes prior
      to administration and at the following time points after initiation of study agent
      administration: 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours
      and 48 hours.

      Serum for cytokine analysis will be collected on Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 at following time
      points (±10%): 2 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours. Serum for cytokine analysis will also be
      collected on Cycle 2, Week 1, Day 1 and Cycle 3, Week 1, Day 1, at following time points
      (±10%): 30 minutes prior to administration and at 6 hours after initiation of study agent
      administration.

      Blood for analysis of RNA mechanism will be collected prior to administration of the study
      agent and 48 hours after study agent administration (with a 10% window). Blood for RNA will
      be collected at the first and last dose of each cycle (e.g. C1W1D1, C1W6D4).

      Blood for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis will be collected at Cycle 1 Week 1 Day 1,
      Cycle 1 Week 3 Day 1, Cycle 2 Week 1 Day 1 prior to product infusion and every even cycle
      thereafter at Week 1 Day 1 prior to product infusion.

      If available, a biopsy or pleural fluid will be collected 1 to 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Week
      1 Day 1 and 72 hours after the last dose of Cycle 1.
