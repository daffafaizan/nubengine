      may be associated with the early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our biophysical
      model of retinal photochemistries predicts that as the lens yellows with age a spectral
      imbalance of the light reaching the retina causes steady-state A2E levels to rise in the RPE,
      which induces increasing RPE stress leading to AMD progression. If correct, this rise in A2E
      levels and the initial injury could be prevented by appropriately chosen spectral filtering
      (e.g., colored sunglasses). Autofluorescence imaging of the retina currently allows
      noninvasive mapping of total accumulated lipofuscin fluorophores within the macular retinal
      pigment epithelium (RPE) but not A2E or its precursor alone. By adding new sets of excitation
      and emission filters to existing fundus cameras and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopes,
      we propose to map individually both A2E and its precursor A2PEH2 or their fractional
      contributions to the total retinal fluorescence. By following A2E fluorescence in both eyes
      in subjects following bilateral cataract surgery and intra-ocular lens [IOL] implantation
      with early symmetric age-related maculopathy who wear our bicolored sunglasses whenever
      outdoors in the daylight, we propose to test this hypothesis while efficiently controlling
      for hidden genetic, physiological, and environmental confounding variables between subjects.
      This pilot protocol seeks to optimize recruitment of suitable subjects and the
      reproducibility of our spectral imaging and noninvasive analysis of A2E and A2PEH2 levels in
      the normal and microscopically abnormal regions of the macula. The data from this pilot study
      will be used to design a clinical study to test our hypothesis.
