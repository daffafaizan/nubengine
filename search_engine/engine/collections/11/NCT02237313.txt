      psychology, sociology). No such study has yet been carried out in the pemphigus who has been
      the subject of a very small number of works in sociology or psychology. The only studies are
      studies of quality of life with no longitudinal follow-up. The perspective of qualitative and
      quantitative data, sociological and psychological approaches, should allow more innovative
      and adapted to the medico-social and psychological care of patients with pemphigus
      approaches. The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants leading to moments of
      vulnerability in the course of patients with pemphigus in order to be able to offer
      preventive or corrective actions to improve the experience of the disease.
