    
      This is a multicenter pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of intravenous
      infusions of autologous (the patient's own) umbilical cord blood cells in term gestation
      newborns with neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy). If a neonate is born
      with signs of moderate to severe encephalopathy and cooled for the encephalopathy, the
      neonate can receive their own non-cryopreserved volume- and red blood cell-reduced cord blood
      cells. The cord blood cells are divided into 3 doses and infused at 12-24, 36-48, and 60-72
      hours after the birth. Infants will be followed for safety and neurodevelopmental outcome up
      to 18 months.
