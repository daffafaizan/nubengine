        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of PS-341 in patients with advanced
           malignancies.

        -  Determine, in a preliminary manner, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

        -  Regimen A: Patients receive PS-341 IV twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every
           6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3-4 or 2 of
      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Regimen B: Once the MTD has been determined in regimen A, patients receive PS-341 IV
           twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.
