      nutrients, fluids, medications directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth and esophagus.
      These devices are also known as gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) or percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy tube (PEG tube). These are used when patients have conditions that make them
      unable to swallow. While parenteral (Intravenous) nutrition and nasogastric tubes are also
      nutritional-support methods. A variety of g-tube designs have been used in pediatric to adult
      populations. The insertion of a g-tube is one of the most common endoscopic procedures and is
      relatively safe. The OSU endoscopy lab placed 381 g-tubes in 2018.

      The most common G-tube used by the OSU Endoscopy Lab is the Balloon Bolus feeding tube. In
      2017 the Capsule Dome G-Tube became commercially available. The cost of the Capsule dome
      g-tube is twice as expensive as the standard balloon g-tube. The insertion costs would be
      comparable.

      The need to perform a pilot comparative study of the two g-tubes is necessary to improve our
      physicians understanding of the potential cost-effectiveness that longer patency we could
      gather from the alternative device.
