      Medtronic CoreValve® System (MCS) in a subset of subjects excluded from the U.S. Extreme Risk
      Pivotal Trial population due to one or more additional co-morbidities, as measured by a
      composite of all-cause death or major stroke at 12 months, in the treatment of symptomatic
      severe aortic stenosis in subjects necessitating aortic valve replacement. Subjects enrolled
      in this study have a predicted operative mortality or serious, irreversible morbidity risk of
      ≥50% at 30 days associated with surgical aortic valve replacement.
