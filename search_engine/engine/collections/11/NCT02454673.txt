      N+ are included. Initially, patients are diagnosed by computerized tomography scan and
      endoscopic ultrasound. The neoadjuvant strategy consisted of 3-4 cycles of preoperative
      chemotherapy (group A) or 3-4 courses of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (group B). Chemoradiotherapy comprised weekly chemotherapy concurrently
      with daily external beam radiotherapy up to 45 Gy). Surgery is scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after
      the end of CRT. Pathological response is graded according to the Becker criteria. Statistical
      analysis is performed IBM SPSS v20. Nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) modelling is applied to
      evaluate the impact of dynamic changes in tumor size, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and
      platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on the clinical outcome of these patients.
