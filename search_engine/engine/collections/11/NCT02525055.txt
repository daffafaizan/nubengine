      United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends influenza vaccination
      for everyone over 6 months of age. The failure of the flu vaccine in 2014-2015 demonstrates
      the need for a model that allows the rapid development of novel antivirals,
      universal/intra-seasonal vaccines, immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies and other novel
      treatments. Studies using experimental influenza virus infection in human participants have
      demonstrated that adult volunteers can be infected by nasal inoculation, and experimental
      infection is safe and not associated with transmission to contacts. The experimental virus is
      manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice for use in the Human Viral
      Challenge Model.

      The investigators chose an H3N2 influenza subtype given that this strain has the most
      substantial impact in terms of morbidity or mortality annually as described by the Centre for
      Disease Control . The investigators first subjected the virus batch to rigorous adventitious
      agent testing, then confirmed the virus to be wild-type by Sanger sequencing and finally
      determined the virus titres appropriate for human use via the established ferret model. hVIVO
      team built on its previous experience with other H3N2 and H1N1 viruses to develop this unique
      model.

      The first part of study (Cohort 1) was to determine the safety and optimal virus titre in
      healthy adult volunteers using our unique clinical quarantine facility in London, UK. After
      the first part of the study was completed, the study was amended to add an older population
      group (45-64 years old) in order to characterise the course of infection in an age group
      better representing the at-risk population.
