    
      This is a phase II, prospective, longitudinal, multi-center trial of poly-ICLC (Hiltonol Â®)
      treatment for progressive low-grade gliomas in pediatric patients with NF1. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC in pediatric NF1 patients with progressive
      low-grade glioma (LGG) as measured by objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) within the first
      48 weeks (12 cycles) of therapy.

      The secondary objectives are to:

        1. Determine 12, 24 and 60 month progression free survival (PFS) in pediatric NF1 patients
           with progressive LGG treated with poly-ICLC.

        2. Evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC in pediatric NF1 patients with progressive LGG as
           measured by best objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) within 24 cycles of therapy.

        3. Evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC in pediatric NF1 patients with progressive LGG as
           measured by clinical benefit response rate (CR+PR+MR+SD) after 12 and 24 cycles of
           therapy.

        4. Assess the toxicity associated with poly-ICLC treatment in pediatric NF1 patients with
           LGG.

      Exploratory objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the visual outcome measures in children with progressive optic pathway gliomas
           treated with poly-ICLC. Visual response is defined as 0.2 logMAR or greater in acuity
           improvement.

        2. Evaluate patient reported outcomes and quality of life measures.

        3. Evaluate biological correlates.
