      breast cancer treated with letrozole (Femara) as first-line therapy. II. Determine the
      objective response rate, time to treatment failure, survival rate, and changes in symptom
      distress in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to time to diagnosis
      of metastatic disease. Patients receive oral letrozole (Femara) daily. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 590 patients will be accrued for this study.
