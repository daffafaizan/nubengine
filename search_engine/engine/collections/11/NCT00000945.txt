      infects the brain of patients infected with HIV-1. Cidofovir is known to be an effective
      treatment for cytomegalovirus of the eye and, in laboratory and animal testing, has also been
      shown to be effective against several other viruses. However, cidofovir is considered
      investigational as a treatment for PML.

      In this multicenter, open-label study 24 patients receive cidofovir iv over 1 hr on days 0,
      7, then every 2 wk for a total of 13 doses.

      Oral probenecid is given 3h prior to and 2h and 8h following cidofovir administration.
      Nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptors are withheld on days of probenecid
      administration. Protease inhibitors are continued during probenecid administration.
