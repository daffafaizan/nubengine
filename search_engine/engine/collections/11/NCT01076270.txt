      I. The percentage of normal donors who collect at least 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg recipient
      weight on day 1 after administration of combined filgrastim and plerixafor.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measuring CD34+ cells/ul in peripheral blood of donors 11, 15, 24 and 36 hours post
      dosing.

      II. Tolerance and safety of combined filgrastim and Plerixafor in normal donors.

      III. Engraftment of filgrastim/plerixafor mobilized stem cells in allogeneic recipients.

      IV. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following the use of
      filgrastim/plerixafor mobilized stem cells.

      V. Yield of CD34+ cells based on donor weight.

      OUTLINE: Donors receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) and plerixafor SC on day -14 and
      undergo leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on day -13. These cells
      are frozen to preserve them. Treatment modifications may apply according to sufficient
      collection of PBSC. Patients receive standard high-dose conditioning and undergo allogeneic
      PBSC transplantation on day 0 using the previously frozen cells.

      After completion of study treatment, donors are followed up 1 day after the last stem cell
      donation.
