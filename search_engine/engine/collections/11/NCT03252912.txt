      parenchymal metastases, the incidence of LM seems to be increasing, due to the growing
      incidence of metastatic BC, the improvement of survival and the poor diffusion of therapeutic
      agents into the central nervous system (CNS). Several prognostic factors have been
      identified, including the age at diagnosis, the functional and neurological status, the delay
      between the diagnosis of cancer and that of LM. Other CSF biomarkers have been evaluated for
      the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases. Finally, the CellSearchÂ® technique allows for the
      characterisation of proteins expressed by CSF tumors cells (E.G., HER2) and will make
      possible a better understanding of the physiopathology of tumor dissemination to the CS.

      Other neuronal biomarkers could be interesting for the diagnosis of LM in BC patients. Among
      them, the protein Tau (total-Tau or T-Tau) is involved in several neurological diseases.
      However, to date, no study has evaluated CSF or serum T-Tau in LM from solid tumors.

      Several neuronal biomarkers could also be good candidates, such as the neurogranin CSF and/or
      serum levels or the CNS neurofilaments (NF), that seem to be a good reflect of axonal injury
      and neuronal loss.
