      efforts to heal the wound with standard treatments, such as antibiotics and surgery to clean
      the wound. Currently, there are no good treatment options for these types of complex
      craniofacial wounds. This study will evaluate what happens when free dermal fat autografting
      is used to help treat complex craniofacial wounds by evaluating the area where the graft was
      placed to better understand how these types of grafts function. Free dermal fat autografting
      is the process of taking fat from under the outer layer of skin and moving it to another part
      of the body of the same individual. Although free dermal fat autografts have been used for
      many decades in plastic and reconstructive surgery to help a variety of patients suffering
      from different problems, only one study has used them to help heal complex craniofacial
      wounds. This use of free dermal fat autografting is not considered to be experimental or an
      investigational product by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Still, the use of free
      dermal fat autografting has not been formally evaluated to understand how these types of
      grafts help patients with complex craniofacial wounds.
