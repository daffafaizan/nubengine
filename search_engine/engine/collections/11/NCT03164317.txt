      very low. One of the important reasons for this is the lack of awareness and the inability of
      the doctors working in busy out patient settings of public health facilities to care
      adequately for the patients. Hence there is a need for task shifting.

      In this trial a trained nurse care coordinator will be placed in the Community Health Centres
      (CHCs) and she will be provided with an Electronic Decision Support System (EDSS), in the
      form of an android application installed on a tablet, to treat hypertension. The trial will
      be carried out in twelve CHCs of Visakhapatnam district in southern Indian state of Andhra
      Pradesh.
