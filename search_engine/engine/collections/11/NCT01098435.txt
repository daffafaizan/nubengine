      33) or matching placebo. Once-daily at-home dosing will begin at randomization and will
      continue for 6 weeks. There will be 8 study visits over a 12-week study period. On an ongoing
      basis, subjects will complete a take-home binge diary designed to record the number of
      binge-eating episodes (binge episodes) and binge-eating days (binge days, days during which
      at least 1 binge occurred), as well as snacks and meals consumed daily over each 7-day
      period.
