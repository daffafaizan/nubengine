      glucose homeostasis. Arginine is a β cell secretagogue, potentiating glucose stimulated
      insulin secretion. Further, it has been shown that glucose can stimulate NO production in
      primary β cells, and NO then enhances insulin secretion.

      On the other hand, because the only known fate of citrulline is its conversion to arginine,
      citrulline supplementation could be a more efficient and safe way to increase intracellular
      arginine. Compared to enteral arginine, citrulline administration to healthy humans elicited
      a greater increase in plasma arginine and NO products, suggesting a greater increase in
      cellular arginine availability for NO synthesis. Therefore dietary citrulline supplementation
      will result in greater arginine availability and NO synthesis than arginine supplementation
      per se in KPD patients. In addition, because the consequences of diminished NO production in
      usual type 2 diabetes includes vascular dysfunction, an overall increase in NO production in
      response to citrulline supplementation will result in an improvement in vascular function
      assessed by arterial flow-mediated dilation
