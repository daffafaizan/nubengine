      basis of genomic alteration analysis of the tumor have longer progression-free survival from
      the time of randomization than those whose treatment is not selected on the basis of
      alteration analysis.

      OUTLINE: After completion of molecular profiling, patients who qualify for the trial will be
      offered randomization as previously. If they wish to be randomized, patients will be
      randomized to one of the two arms: matched targeted therapy (ARM I) or other therapy (ARM
      II). Patients who decline to be randomized will then be offered their choice of the two trial
      arms.

      ARM I: Matched targeted therapy: Molecular profiling results are used to assign targeted
      therapy. Patients receive targeted therapy by participating in a Phase I or a Phase II
      clinical trial. If a clinical trial is not available, and a commercially available targeted
      therapy exists (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved for another indication), patients
      can receive the FDA-approved drug.

      ARM II: Other therapy: Patients receive standard of care therapy at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      Patients with tumor progression who achieve the primary study endpoint can cross over to the
      other treatment arm.
