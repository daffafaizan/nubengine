    
      Background: The diagnosis and differentiation of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is
      challenging due to the absence of a gold standard diagnostic modality for confirmation.
      Exhaled breath volatile metabolite analysis focusing on diagnosis and differentiation of IBD
      is a promising approach. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluated the accuracy of exhaled
      breath volatile metabolite analysis for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

      Method: A single center, prospective study of diagnostic testing will be conducted,
      recruiting crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and healthy controls (HC). The
      exhaled breath volatile metabolite will be analyzed using gas chromatography/mass
      spectrometry (GC-MS). The informations of patient's disease location, disease activity,
      laboratory parameters and current medications will be collected to determine the feasibility
      of exhaled breath volatile metabolite analysis.
