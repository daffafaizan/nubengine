      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While liver biopsy is still considered the gold
      standard for diagnosing and assessing the presence and degree of liver fibrosis and
      inflammation, it has disadvantages including the potential for sampling error and risk of
      complications. New imaging modalities such as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), intravoxel
      incoherent motion (IVIM), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), T1ρ relaxation time (T1ρ), T1
      mapping of pre-contrast and hepatocyte phase using hepatocyte specific agent and
      susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) allow non-invasive evaluation of liver parenchymal
      characteristics and may be able to detect and quantify parenchymal fibrosis alleviating the
      need for biopsy. Patients with chronic liver disease or normal liver parenchyma who are
      scheduled to undergo either liver resection or liver biopsy are included. Referred patients
      undergo multiparametric MRI including DWI, IVIM, DKI, T1ρ, T1 mapping of pre-contrast and
      hepatocyte phase and SWI before surgery or biopsy. The pathologic changes are evaluated using
      multiparametric MRI, and compared between normal/early fibrosis and advanced fibrosis. To
      explore if combine these techniques could reach higher diagnostic performance for detection
      and grading of liver fibrosis. This project will provide a reliable and noninvasive method
      for the monitoring stage of liver fibrosis and therapeutic evaluation.
