      depending on the location or the severity of the disease.

      Since the large use of laparoscopy for the treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction, interesting
      and encouraging results have been published.

      However, so far, a laparoscopic approach has some technical disadvantages like a poor
      ergonomy, a 2 dimensional vision, an unstable camera and the use of straight instruments. To
      overcome these natural limitations, robotics has been gaining increasing acceptance in
      general surgery.

      Several groups have reported their encouraging experience with robotic rectopexy. Yet, these
      studies were not randomized or double blinded.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of robotics for complex pelvic floor
      dysfunction and to compare the outcomes to the laparoscopic approach.
