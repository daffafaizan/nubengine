    
      After obtaining Institutional Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent from
      legally acceptable representative relatives, patients with traumatic brain injury, aged from
      18- 60 years old, ASA from (I-III), GCS more than 8 undergoing emergency craniotomy surgery
      will be selected for this prospective randomized Study.

      The anesthesia will be induced with 2mcg/kg fentanyl and 2 mg/kg propofol. Muscle relaxation
      will be achieved with 0.5 mg/kg atracurium.

      Anesthesia will be maintained with:

        -  Group I, isoflurane (mac<1) mixed with oxygen 40% and fentanyl 1mcg/kg hourly.

        -  Group PD, propofol infusion(100-150mcg/kg/min) and dexmedetomedine 0.3mcg/kg /h.

      Parameters will be assessed Preoperative period

        -  Ischemia modified albumin level from venous sample.

        -  Basal Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure. Mean arterial blood pressure,
           oxygen saturation, heart rate.

        -  GCS. Intraoperative period

        -  Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure. Mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen
           saturation, heart rate after intubation, 5,15,30,60,90min and after extubation.

        -  Need for resuscitation with vasoactive drugs.

        -  Brain relaxation score at dural opening and closure.

        -  ICP

        -  Intraoperative blood loss.

        -  Amount of fluid and blood transfusion. Postoperative period

        -  Ischemia modified albumin immediately postoperatively, after 6h and after 24 hours.

        -  Type of surgery.

        -  Duration of surgery.

        -  Extubation time.

        -  Recovery scores (Ramsay sedation score and modified Alderte score).

        -  GCS immediately postoperatively, after 6h, after 24h and after 48 hours.

        -  Total analgesic requirement during the first 24 hours.

        -  Need for ICU admission.

        -  Length of ICU stay.

        -  Complications.

        -  28 day mortality.
