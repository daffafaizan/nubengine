      exposure therapy for patients with psychiatric disorders. It immerses patients into
      hospital-based procedures. We and others showed that VR prep reduces anxiety levels for
      elective surgical patients (manuscript submitted). However, the efficacy of VR in reducing
      peri-procedural anxiety in vulnerable psychiatric populations has not been assessed. This
      will be the first RCT utilizing VR to reduce patient anxiety before ECT through education. If
      VR education reduces anxiety in this vulnerable population (as proof of concept), it could
      increase ECT success by decreasing anesthetic requirements. Using VR technology, our study
      will provide patients and their families with a balanced and in-depth look at ECT safety and
      efficacy, and its recent advances in management of psychiatric disorders.

      Primary objectives of this study are to assess whether creating a VR-ECT-360 video that
      immerses and educates patients and their families in the ECT experience 1) enhances factual
      knowledge and reduces stigmatizing attitudes toward ECT, and 2) reduces pre-procedure anxiety
      as compared to traditional 2D video. The secondary objective is to investigate the ease of
      use of VR technology in a vulnerable psychiatric patient population. Given the high rate of
      treatment refusals in this population, we hypothesize that implementation of our approach
      will reduce anxiety through patient education thereby decreasing chances for treatment
      refusal and drop-out rates. We suggest that use of VR will be a clinically relevant approach
      in such a vulnerable population (as proof of concept) and could increase ECT success by
      decreasing anesthetic requirements (anesthetics suppress desired seizure activity).
