      treatment option for patients with early stage prostate cancer. The most severe side effect
      of PI is urinary retention requiring intermittent self-catheterization (ISC). This study will
      assess the ability of pharmacologic intervention to ameliorate the post-operative side effect
      of PI. The use of both tamsulosin and dutasteride is proposed to have benefit in reducing
      urinary symptom score and in reducing the rate of intermittent self-catheterization for
      patients with prostate adenocarcinoma after prostate implant.
