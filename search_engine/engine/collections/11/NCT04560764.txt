    
      In this study, the intervention will be conducted using a system composed by multiple
      devices, which are:

        -  HTC Vive (HTC, headset e Steam station): three-dimensional viewer used for the
           implementation of the immersive virtual environment, allows both the visualization of
           the videos and of the exercises to be performed;

        -  Leap Motion Controller (infrared camera): contactless device for tracking the movement
           of the patient's fingers and hand;

        -  Zed Mini (RGB binocular camera and depth camera): Stereo Labs' Zed Mini stereoscopic
           camera is mounted on the HTC Vive viewer to allow virtual elements to be overlapped
           within the environment;

        -  Cometa Wavetrack (transmitter/receiver and Inertial Measurement Units): system for upper
           limb movement tracking through the use of four wireless inertial sensors applied to the
           chest, to the arm and to the forearm of the participant through elastic bands and to the
           hand of the participant through skin-compatible double-sided adhesive patches.

      All the devices have been tested to ensure safety of the participants and are provided with
      the appropriate documentation of declaration of conformity according to the European
      reference regulations. A careful risk analysis was carried out to ensure the safety of the
      participants.

      All the devices will be working simultaneously during each session of treatment. For the
      experimental group, the instrumentation will be used to see the video of the exercises that
      the participants will be later asked to perform and to actually perform them; in the control
      group, it will be used to see a video of a natural landscape with a 180Â° perspective and to
      perform the same exercises than the experimental group.

      The devices will be used both for the execution of the exercises both to collect information
      listed in the outcomes section as secondary outcomes: in particular, these information will
      be provided by the Leap Motion and by the Cometa Wavetrack devices.
