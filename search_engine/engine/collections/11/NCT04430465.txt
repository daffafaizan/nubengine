      cardiometabolic health in slightly overweight 8-13-year-old children. Moreover, KORN aims to
      investigate effects on body weight and body composition, inflammatory markers,
      gastrointestinal wellbeing and cognitive function and explore the potential underlying
      mechanisms through assessment of changes in the children's gut microbiota as well as
      potential genotype-dependent and sex-specific effects.

      The study has a randomized controlled cross-over design. In two 8-week dietary periods the
      children will receive grain products (cereals, breads, pasta etc) with either high or low
      content of wholegrain from oat and rye in random order. Measurements and biological sampling
      will be performed at 0, 8 and 16 weeks.
