    
      Patients with Hydrocephalus, managed with an implanted Codman HakimTM Programmable Valve
      (CHPV), occasionally visit their physician to have their valve adjusted to a different
      setting to manage their condition. After the adjustment, an x-ray of the skull is taken to
      confirm the valve setting.

      The Codman VPV System is designed to facilitate and confirm the adjustment of a CHPV. After
      signing the informed consent, Subjects will be enrolled in the study and have their CHPV
      adjusted using the Codman VPV System. After the adjustment, an x-ray of the skull will be
      taken to verify the valve setting. No further follow up visit is needed after the adjustment.

      This study is expected to enroll about 300 Subjects from up to 20 sites in the United States.
