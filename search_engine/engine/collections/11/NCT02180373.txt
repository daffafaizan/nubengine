      undergoing physician-specified intervention and follow up, and meet enrollment criteria, will
      participate in the study. The PREDICT study includes two independent arms to assess
      restenosis - peripheral vein graft (VG) bypass surgery and endovascular (angioplasty and
      superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting). In broad outline, approximately 1,000 patients
      will be enrolled for each arm, with clinical follow-up out to two years. Demographic,
      clinical, and procedural data will be collected at baseline. Clinical and imaging data will
      be obtained over the follow up period in accordance with standard post-procedural
      surveillance practices (1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months). Blood samples will be obtained for
      genomic DNA and plasma biomarkers at 3 time points - baseline, 1 month and 6 months. The
      baseline samples will provide key information about patients with advanced PAD, often
      correlated with significant coronary disease.

      Data is entered by clinical coordinators into electronic case report forms in the Remedy
      Informatics database controlled by Vascular Cures. No PHI is included. Paper copies are
      maintained at the site. Registry data elements were developed with the study PI at University
      of California at San Francisco (UCSF). The Vascular Cures project manager reviews the
      database on a monthly basis to insure that case report forms (CRFs) are being completed
      appropriately and manage the data. Minor data omissions will be ignored; coordinators will be
      asked to re-submit for any major omissions. Site coordinators are responsible for managing
      all activities related to patients.
