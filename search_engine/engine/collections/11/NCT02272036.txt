      of our patients already use mobile phones the study should evaluate if time adjusted
      information about diet recommendation, laxative intake and behavioral recommedation improve
      the patient compliance and the quality of colonoscopy preparation. In total 14 SMS wil be
      sent to the study participants starting 4 days prior the colonoscopy appointment. No
      additional or different information is provided in comparison to regular colonoscopy
      preparation for out-patient colonoscopy.

      Study participant are randomized when included into the study. Group 1 receives a SMS-
      supported colonoscopy preparation, group 2 receive no SMS and prepares regularly.

      Primary endpoint is bowel cleanness measured by Boston Bowel preparation scale, secondary
      endpoints are patient satisfaction, adenoma detection rate and compliance.
