      techniqueinvasive (amniocentesis or chorion biopsy). Eitherscreening for first or second
      trimester aneuploidies ofhigh risk, due to the presence of fetal malformation, due toearly
      intrauterine growth retardation (ICR) or due tosuspected chorioamnionitis.

      The study population will be pregnant women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection(by PCR on
      nasopharyngeal aspirate or serology)that have an indication to perform an invasive
      technique(chorionic biopsy or amniocentesis) along thegestation.The sample size will depend
      on the duration of theSARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Initially we propose a study period of 18 months in
      which we would have an approximate total of 225 pregnant women with indication of invasive
      technique.It is planned to conduct a PCR study for SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid or chorionic
      villi to those pregnant women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection(approximately 5% of the
      total pregnant womenwith indication of invasive technique (11-12 pregnant women)).This
      determination is made as part of theroutine clinical practice in the context of the study
      ofscreening for perinatal infections.
