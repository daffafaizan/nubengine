      evaluated by all diagnostic methods. Each examiner will independently record the dental
      findings using all methods, the visual- tactile assessment method and both fluorescent-aided
      identification methods. The visual-tactile assessment method includes the use of mirror,
      probe under good illumination condition, while the fluorescent-aided identification methods
      will be performed by both light-induced fluorescence intraoral camera and laser-induced
      fluorescence device. Then Diagnostic performance for caries detection was evaluated,
      assessing the validity of each diagnostic method in diagnosing secondary caries around
      margins of resin composite restorations
