      chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced disease, still about 30% develop relapse
      locoregionally or distally. Salvage or second-course radical radiotherapy with or without
      chemotherapy may achieve durable disease control for locoregionally advanced recurrent
      disease. However for those who had received 2 courses of radical radiotherapy or those with
      distant metastases, systemic chemotherapy would be the only drug of choice. Platinum-based
      doublet chemotherapy including cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, gemcitabine or
      taxane is considered the standard first-line treatment. For second-line treatment, whether
      platinum-based chemotherapy was given previously is a consideration. Re-challenge with
      cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil can be considered in patients who enjoyed a good initial
      response to the same regimen with an intervening disease-free period of more than 1
      year.However so far there has been no recognized standard third-line systemic treatment.
      Metronomic oral chemotherapy may provide an ideal choice patients treated in this setting by
      shifting the targets from tumor cells to tumor vasculature so as to reduce the chance of drug
      resistance as well as offering a relatively low toxicity profile to them who have been
      significantly jeopardized by the long-term complications brought prior courses of radiation
      therapy, surgery and chemotherapy.

      In view of the above, we investigated metronomic open-label oral cyclophosphamide as
      third-line treatment or beyond in patients with inoperable locoregionally advanced recurrent
      or metastatic NPC who had failed at least 2 lines of prior systemic chemotherapy.
