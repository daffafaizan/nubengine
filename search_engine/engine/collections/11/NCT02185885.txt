      The PPCI trial is a randomized, controlled, outcomes assessor and patient blinded,
      single-center superiority trial with two parallel groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The
      randomization will be stratified according to age (stratum 1 < 70 years; stratum 2 â‰¥ 70
      years) and type of surgery (stratum 1 - surgery involving the aortic and/or mitral valve;
      stratum 2 - surgery not involving these valves).
