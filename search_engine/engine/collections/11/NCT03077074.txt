      same phase of the period- both visits in the luteal phase with a month between each visit. In
      this part of the study there will be 40 participants with a wider range of BMI. This phase of
      the study will include a nutritional intervention - the participants will be asked to have a
      carbohydrate restricted diet (60 grams of carbohydrate)- for a period of a month with no
      caloric restriction. Food records will be kept and followed and a ketone test (blood test)
      will be done on the morning of the study visits.
