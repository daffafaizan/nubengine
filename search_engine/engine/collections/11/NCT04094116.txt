    
      Patients in Wong Siu Ching Clinic and Tai Po Clinic who are found to have ear wax after
      physical examination will have ear syringing done, without pre-ear oil application. On the
      other hand, patients in Fanling Family Medicine Centre with ear wax will be given ear oil one
      week before performing ear syringing. We will compare the respective success rates of ear
      syringing from these 2 groups, the mean numbers of syringing attempts, subjective improvement
      in hearing , as well as any complications such as ear canal abrasion, ear drum perforation,
      any pain or vertigo reported by patients. For those cases who fail ear syringing , olive oil
      will be prescribe and arrange 1 week follow up for ear syringing .
