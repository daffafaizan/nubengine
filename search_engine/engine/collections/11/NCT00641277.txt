    
      When maxillary anterior (upper front)and/or mandibular incisors are congenitally missing or
      lost due to other causes, the space between adjacent teeth is frequently too narrow to
      support traditional implant therapy and patients are often advised to fill the space with
      conventional fixed or removable prosthetic appliances.

      The one-piece titanium construction of the Maximus design is believed to retain optimal
      biomechanical stength while remaining small enough for use in anterior reconstruction thereby
      allowing access to spaces that were previously beyond the scope of implant dentistry.
