      trials with children and adolescents; highlighting the need for more clinical trials with
      pediatric populations. Lacking in the area of pediatric clinical research are resources to
      educate children and adolescents about clinical research in fun, interactive, and
      developmentally appropriate ways. Thus, a web-based resource, DigiKnowIt News, was developed
      for youth aged 8 to 14 years to educate youth about participating in pediatric clinical
      trials. The web-based resource includes video spotlights, investigations, and electronic
      comic books. The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      determine the effectiveness of the web-based resource and examine its impact on youths'
      knowledge about pediatric clinical trials, self-efficacy about making decisions about
      participation in clinical research, and positive attitudes towards participation.
