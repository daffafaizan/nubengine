    
      After obtaining the patients' agreement, they will be randomized in one of the 3 experimental
      groups:

        -  G1: Attentional training to avoid threatening, negative or pain-related information.

        -  G2: Attention training for vigilance for positive emotional information.

        -  G3: neutral attentional training (control group).

      The study will be conducted from the patient's home via a connection to the protected site of
      the Nantes University Hospital. The various questionnaires will be completed from the secure
      site of the Nantes University Hospital and the computerized experimental tasks will be
      carried out using the Inquisit software (WEB version at home).

      The study will begin with an evaluation of the patients' attention and psychological
      processes (completion of questionnaires + 2 attention tasks), during a follow-up visit to the
      urology department of the University Hospital of Nantes.

      Then, an 8-week attentional re-training program (2 training sessions per week) will be
      proposed.

      At the end of the 8 weeks, an evaluation (Questionnaires + attention tasks) will be offered
      to patients always from home.

      Finally, a final evaluation, 4 weeks after the end of the re-training, will always be
      proposed from the patient's home.
