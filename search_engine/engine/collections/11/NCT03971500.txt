      criterion will be randomized to IVUS- or Angiography-guidance group (first randomization). In
      the IVUS-guidance group, IVUS will be used to evaluate the lesion's specificity and to
      measure lesion length, landing zone, and reference vessel diameter prior-to stenting; and to
      assess stent expansion, extension, apposition, and possible complications after stent
      implantation. The IVUS- defined criteria for the optimal stent deployment included: 1) the
      minimal stent area (MSA) in the stented segment is >5.0 mm^2, or 90% of the MLA at the distal
      reference segments; 2) plaque burden 5-mm proximal or distal to the stent edge is <55%; and
      3) absence of >Type B edge dissection. Further treatment will be required if stenting
      procedure is defined as suboptimal according to IVUS definition. IVUS will be not allowed to
      be used in the Angiography-guidance group.

      Those patients who have had no MACCE or major bleeding (BARC 3 or 5) within 30 days and have
      continued on aspirin and ticagrelor for 30 days without interruption for >48 hours will be
      randomized 1:1 to:

        1. Ticagrelor plus+ matching placebo for an additional 11 months (SAPT group)

        2. Ticagrelor plus aspirin (study drug) for an additional 11 months (DAPT group) Follow-up
           of all subjects will continue for 1 year with an option for additional follow-up to 3
           years.
