      of depressive symptoms in patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD) or hypertension.
      By means of a depression screening and individual patient-targeted feedback the level of
      depression should decrease, the percentage of treated depressed patients should increase and
      health economic costs should be lowered. The main hypothesis is that screening plus targeted
      feedback results in a greater reduction of depression than screening only.
