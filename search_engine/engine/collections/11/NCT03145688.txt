        1. Does the habit formation condition improve child health-related quality of life, and
           health-related fitness outcomes compared to the control and planning conditions at six
           months? Hypothesis: Child health-related fitness and quality of life will be higher for
           the habit formation condition in comparison to the control and planning conditions.

        2. Can group differences among behavioural, and health-related fitness outcomes be
           explained through a mediation model? Hypothesis: The covariance of the assigned
           conditions (habit formation, planning + education, education control) on child physical
           activity will be explained by parental support habit, and through the use of consistency
           and cues regulation strategies (i.e., manipulation check). In turn, the covariance
           between support habit and health-related outcomes will be explained by physical activity
           among conditions. The habit formation condition will not affect parental support
           intentions or underlying outcome expectations (benefits of physical activity) for
           support of child physical activity because its effect on behavior is to tie initial
           intentions to behavioural action or to work independent of goals and intentions.

        3. Is there an intergenerational, seasonal, or gender difference across primary outcomes by
           assigned condition? Hypothesis: Parents in the habit formation condition will show
           higher physical activity via some activities being performed with their children in
           comparison to the other conditions. No differences in gender or season are hypothesized
           but these are exploratory research questions because there is limited research at
           present [28] to make any definitive statement.
