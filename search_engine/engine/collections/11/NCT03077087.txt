      Typically, 10-14 days after Integra® placement, a patient returns to the operating room, the
      top silastic layer of the Integra® is removed, and an autograft - a split-thickness skin
      graft harvested from the patient - is applied directly on top of the incorporated Integra®.
      The result is regarded to be a cosmetically and functionally superior result to that which
      would have been obtained had the wound bed itself been autografted at the time of excision,
      as opposed to being covered by Integra® and autografted during a second operation.

      Integra® use in single-stage procedures to cover defects without grafting has shown benefit
      when defects are fairly small, e.g. fingertip injuries, and small head and neck skin cancer
      resections. While single-stage reconstruction with Integra® has been demonstrated with
      standard thickness Integra®, this decreased thickness would increase the likelihood of graft
      survival due to the decreased distance of nutrient diffusion.
