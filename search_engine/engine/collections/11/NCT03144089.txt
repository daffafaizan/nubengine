      morbidity and mortality. The Articulating Oral Airway (AOA) is a novel oral airway which
      actively displaces the tongue, allowing for a greater cross-sectional area for MV. The
      investigators hypothesize that, while using the same ventilatory pressure in neuromuscularly
      blocked patients with predictors for difficult mask ventilation, MV with an AOA will not
      result in smaller expired tidal volumes than MV with a similarly sized Guedel oral airway
      (GDA). In other words, the AOA will be non-inferior to the GDA in terms of expired tidal
      volumes.
