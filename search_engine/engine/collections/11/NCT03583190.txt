      for a number of neuromusculoskeletal conditions including cervicogenic headache (CGH). Dry
      needling is performed by taking a mono-filament needle and inserting it into symptomatic soft
      tissue. In this trial, the dry needling will be performed segmentally in the neck and along
      the patient's headache distribution pattern. Orthopedic manual therapy (OMT) may include both
      thrust and non-thrust techniques applied to a targeted spinal level and has a
      well-established treatment effect for patients with CGH. In this trial, the OMT will be
      applied pragmatically to the cervical spine at the most symptomatic level of the headache.
      Other interventions used in this trial will include patient education, thoracic manipulation
      and exercise.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either dry needling or OMT 2x/week for 2 weeks and
      then 1-2x/week for 2 weeks totaling 6-8 visits over the course of 1 month. The 1 week and 1
      month outcomes collected will be reported on separately from the 3 and 12 months.
