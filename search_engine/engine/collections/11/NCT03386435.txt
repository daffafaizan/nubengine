      disease. In light of advancements in surgical techniques, immunosuppressive agents, and
      perioperative critical care, the overall 3-year survival of patients undergoing LT has
      exceeded 80%. Despite its outstanding success, LT still entails certain complications
      including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI).

      IRI occurs when the blood supply to an organ or tissue is temporarily cut-off and then
      restored, and it is well-known as an underlying cause of primary non-function, biliary
      complications, and eventual graft loss after LT. Despite many attempts to ameliorate hepatic
      IRI, no definitive therapies have been established. In addition, the mechanisms of IRI remain
      largely unclear.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a novel and simple therapeutic method to lessen the
      harmful effects of IRI. RIPC indicate that brief episodes of ischemia with intermittent
      reperfusion are introduced at a remote site, leading to systemic protection against
      subsequent insults as evinced on kidney, heart, liver, and other tissues. While RIPC has been
      shown to reduce hepatic IRI in several small animal studies, the beneficial effects of RIPC
      in hepatic IRI have been inconsistent. By far, the majority of RIPC studies on hepatic IRI
      have been animal studies; hence, there are limitations relating to the lack of human clinical
      trials.

      Therefore, our aim was to assess the effects of RIPC on postoperative liver function in
      living donor hepatectomy.
