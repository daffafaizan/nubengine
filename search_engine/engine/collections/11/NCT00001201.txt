      rendered the peripheral nervous system the best studied and most accessible level of the
      nervous system. But even after intensive diagnostic evaluation of peripheral neuropathies in
      large diagnostic centers, 24 to 70% of disorders remain unclassified. Analogous statistics
      for disorders of muscle and neuromuscular transmission are not known but probably similar, if
      not worse. Clearly, detailed diagnostic characterization of disorders of the peripheral
      nervous system is the first stage in clinical intervention.

      Currently, the EMG Laboratory at the NIH offers complete clinical, electrophysiologic, and,
      when appropriate, pathologic evaluations on all referrals from the other Branches and
      Institutes. Since these referrals come primarily from within the NIH, most disorders are
      secondary to other systemic disease. This protocol is designed to extend the services to
      direct referrals of primary disorders of the peripheral nervous system. The purposes are
      first, to learn more about established diseases; second, to identify and characterize new
      diseases; third, to assess current methodologies and technologies; and fourth, to refine old
      methods and develop new ones. Under this umbrella protocol, individual cases and clinical
      series can be investigated.
