    
      Long-term follow-up of patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with intravitreal
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) combined focal laser and identification
      of prognostic morphological characteristics.

      Prospective clinical trial (50 treatment-naive eyes) with DME randomized 1:1 receiving
      intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) and prompt grid laser compared to ranibizumab and
      deferred laser. Morphological characteristics potentially relevant for prognosis were
      assessed at baseline, month 6, month 9, year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of follow-up.

      Grid laser and ranibizumab therapy is expected to be effective in DME management during
      long-term follow-up. Immediate combined therapy will likely signify a trend of functional
      superiority in an early disease phase. Intraretinal hyperreflective material in SD-OCT will
      likely negatively related to BCVA.
