      transfusions as part of their treatment. In this study, we are testing a new way of preparing
      RBC units (pooled RBC units) for transfusion compared to the standard RBC units. We are
      testing this because blood transfusions may be associated with side effects that may be
      harmful. We have developed a new way to process RBC for transfusion to try and reduce some of
      those side effects.

      The pooled RBC units will be made by sterilely pooling five (5) single RBC units into one
      container where the blood will be mixed together, and then separated into five individual RBC
      units, ready to be used for transfusion. The purpose of the study is to determine the safety
      of the blood prepared in this new way compared to standard RBC products.

      The primary objective is to determine if there is no significant difference in transfusion
      associated adverse events in POOLED-RBCs compared to standard RBC product groups. Secondarily
      to determine if there are no significant differences in new antibody and new positive direct
      antiglobulin test (DAT) formation in the POOLED-RBCs compared to standard RBC product groups.
