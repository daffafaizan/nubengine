      pediatric neurologist. Children at levels 3/4/5 of the GMFCS who did not have any open wounds
      on the foot, where the application was to be performed, and whose parents consented to the
      child's participation were accepted in the study. However, those children were excluded who
      were treated with botulinum toxin in the last six months, underwent surgery, were treated
      with reflexology or any other alternative medicine method and who had refractory epilepsy.
