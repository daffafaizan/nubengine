    
      In this study, a total of 219 subjects from the MOON nested cohort will be studied at CCF,
      Vanderbilt and OSU, Table 1. Among them, some will have added MRI during their 10-year visit
      for the MOON study. Some subjects who finished their 10-year visit for the MOON Onsite study
      already will be called back to have MRI. PROMs and other information of these subjects will
      be collected through the MOON study.

      In addition, 30 age-, sex- and BMI-matched control subjects (10 from each site) will be
      recruited and scanned for MRI. PROMs (KOOS, IKDC, Marx, SF-36) will be collected from these
      controls.

      Among the 10 controls recruited locally at CCF, five will also travel to OSU and Vanderbilt
      to be scanned at the other two sites for cross-validation among the three sites. There will
      be a separate consent for the 5 controls that will be traveling to each of the 3 sites for
      the scans. The remaining 25 controls will be tested at only their local site.
