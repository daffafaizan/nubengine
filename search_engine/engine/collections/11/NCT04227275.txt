    
      This is a Phase 1 single-arm study designed to identify the dose and regimen of CART-PSMA-
      TGFÎ²RDN cells that can be safely administered intravenously following the lymphodepletion
      (LD) regimen to patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
      Following Dose Escalation, a Cohort Expansion will enroll patients to further explore the
      safety and tolerability of the selected dose and schedule.

      It is anticipated that up to 50 patients will enroll in this study in both dose escalation
      and cohort expansion.
