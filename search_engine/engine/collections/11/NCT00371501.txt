      subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Subclinical
      atherosclerosis is assessed by ultrasound study of the carotid vessels and CT scan of the
      coronary arteries for calcium scores. Blood markers of endothelial activation will also be
      studied.
