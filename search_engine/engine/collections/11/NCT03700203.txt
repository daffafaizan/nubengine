    
      Study design: Multicenter case-control study, 14 tertiary teaching hospital emergency
      departments in Korea

      Study period: September 2017 to December 2023 (75 months)

      Study population: Early cardiac arrest patients aged between 19 and 79 (1,780 cases) and
      their age-, gender-, and urban/rural area-matched community controls (3,560 cases).

        -  Cases will be consecutive adult patients with EMS-treated OHCA and transport to the 14
           emergency departments of participating hospitals. A prospective OHCA patient cohort will
           be developed and all survived OHCA cases will be followed at 1-month and 6-month after
           ED discharge by telephone. During the study period, the investigators aim to recruit a
           total 1,780 cases (200 cases between September 2017 and August 2018, 600 cases between
           September 2018 and August 2020, 80 cases between September 2020 and December 2020, and
           900 cases between January 2021 and December 2023).

        -  matched community-based controls (2:1 matching) will be selected from two health
           screening centers. Controls are those who visit the participating health screening
           centers for their annual routine physical examinations. During the study period, the
           investigators aim to recruit a total 3,560 controls (400 controls between September 2017
           and August 2018, 1200 controls between September 2018 and August 2020, 160 controls
           between September 2020 and December 2020, and 1800 controls between January 2021 and
           December 2023).

      Data collection: Following data will be collected for both cases and controls.

        -  Clinical data: Basic demographic and clinical outcomes will be retrieved from medical
           records.

        -  Survey data: Comorbidity, family history of selected diseases, lifestyle behaviors
           (including smoking, alcohol, physical activity, sleeping, nutrition, marital status,
           occupation), and history of selected chronic diseases data will be collected.

        -  Blood samples: The investigators aim to develop both clinical and behavioral (including
           nutrition, alcohol, and smoking) biomarkers of OHCA. The investigators also plan to
           further develop OHCA biomarkers using proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics.

        -  Follow-ups: All survived OHCA cases will be followed-up at 1-month and 6-month after ED
           discharge and their survival, disability, and quality of life outcomes will be collected
           by telephone.
