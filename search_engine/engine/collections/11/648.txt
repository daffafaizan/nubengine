chromosome changes in human diploid-cell cultures infectedwith mycoplasmathis communication shows that mycoplasma may alsochange cell chromosomes, and therefore emphasizes theneed for caution in interpreting experimental resultswithout adequately testing for the presenceof mycoplasma.  chromosome damage similarto that described here has been induced byviruses in cell cultures and in blood cul-tures.  chromosomal abnormalities havealso been reported in blood cultures and bonemarrow from leukaemic patients.
