    
      This two-part study is designed to characterize the steady-state PK of oral Tazemetostat and
      its metabolite EPZ 6930 when administered as a single and twice daily dose in subjects with
      advanced malignancies while taken alone or in combination with either itraconazole or
      rifampin.

      Part 1: Tazemetostat and Itraconazole Drug Interaction Part 1 of the study will evaluate the
      drug-drug interaction between Tazemetostat and itraconazole in an open-label, fixed
      sequential cross over design. Subjects in Cycle 1 of Part 1 will be treated for 39 days. On
      Days 1, 15 and 36, a single oral dose of 400 mg Tazemetostat will be administered in the
      morning. From Days 3 - 14 and 21 - 35, subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of
      Tazemetostat twice daily (12 hours apart). From Days 18 - 38, a single dose of oral 200 mg
      itraconazole will be administered daily in the morning after a meal, co-administered with
      Tazemetostat when necessary. PK blood samples will be collected on Days 1 - 3, 15 - 18, 21 -
      22, and 36 - 39. Sparse PK samples will be collected on Days 25, 28, 31, and 34.

      Part 2: Tazemetostat and Rifampin Drug Interaction Part 2 of the study will evaluate the
      drug-drug interaction between Tazemetostat and rifampin in an open-label, fixed sequential
      cross over design. Subjects in Cycle 1 of Part 2 will be treated for 26 days. On Days 1, 15
      and 24, a single oral dose of 800 mg Tazemetostat will be administered in the morning. From
      Days 3 - 14 and 17 - 23, subjects will receive an oral 800 mg dose of Tazemetostat twice
      daily (12 hours apart). From Days 17 - 25, a single dose of oral 600 mg rifampin will be
      administered daily in the morning one hour before a meal, co-administered with Tazemetostat
      when necessary. PK blood samples will be collected on Days 1 - 3, 15 - 17 and 24 - 26. Sparse
      PK samples will be collected on Days 19 and 21.

      Subjects may discontinue from the study after completion of Cycle 1 or can continue treatment
      (Cycle2+ onwards) with Tazemetostat at the recommended therapeutic dose of 800 mg twice daily
      until Investigator-assessed clinical disease progression per standard practice, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study by the sponsor. All subjects who
      receive the recommended therapeutic dose of 800 mg Tazemetostat twice daily for 9 Cycles or
      longer, and are eligible to continue receiving Tazemetostat, will transfer to a Rollover
      Study (EZH-501) for monitoring and continued study drug at the Investigator and Medical
      Monitor's discretion.

      For both Parts 1 and 2, safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the subject's
      participation. Subjects must have an end of study visit after 30 days of the last dose of
      Tazemetostat for safety assessment.
