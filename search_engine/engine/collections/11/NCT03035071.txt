      Standardized preoperative efforts could increase the outcome of these patients. While early
      reports of medical pioneers focused particularly on safety and feasibility, more recent
      studies showed that implementation of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) was widely
      accepted. Since first reports of MIE, different techniques and adjustments have been
      discussed. A recent publication of a large prospective trial in Phase II showed the safety of
      a total minimally invasive approach (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and
      laparoscopy). Surgical technique however is still a subject of debate and the level of
      evidence remains still low. Proving feasibility does not warrant a paradigm shift, as
      experience is an important factor for safety and patient benefit.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate morbidity and mortality of open esophagectomy (OE)
      versus hybrid-MIE in a randomized controlled setting.

      Prior to surgery patients will be randomized either the minimally invasive surgery group
      (laparoscopic gastric tube formation and thoracotomy) or the the open surgery group (open
      gastric tube formation with an open laparotomy approach). Randomizing tool is the
      "randomizer" of the medical university of vienna. (link is attached below)
