      Nudge. This Nudge was the influenza vaccine prescription form accompanied on the back of the
      telephone numbers of the occupational health centers of the hospitals where residents were on
      probation.

      The interns of the group "Nudge" saw at the end of their questionnaire the following
      statement: "If you are not vaccinated against the flu so far, you can get the form stapled to
      this questionnaire, it will allow you to get the vaccine in pharmacy. On the back you will
      also find practical information about immunization services at your place of training. " A
      group will receive an implemented Nudge questionnaire, a group will receive a questionnaire
      without Nudge and a control group will not be asked. (Phase 1) The 3 groups will receive a
      month later a questionnaire evaluating the effectiveness in terms of immunization coverage,
      and the acceptability of the Nudge, for oneself and for others. (Phase 2) The control group
      will only receive the Phase 2 questionnaire to control the Hawthorne effect.

      The difference between the 3 groups will consist exclusively in the exposure of the
      participants to:

        -  A questionnaire on their attitude (opinion) towards vaccination;

        -  The numbers of the occupational health vaccination centers of their places of training;

        -  The flu vaccine prescription form, to be signed and stamped by a doctor (also already
           freely available on the internet)
