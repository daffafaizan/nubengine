    
      This is a 16-week, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study of
      4-week randomised treatment periods to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 5 ug of Ba 679
      BR inhalation solution from Respimat compared to tiotropium inhalation powder capsule (18 ug)
      via HandiHaler in patients with COPD. The two 4-week randomised treatment periods are
      separated by 4-week washout period.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary aim of this trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of lung function response to
      5 ug (2 actuations of 2.5 ug) of Ba679BR Respimat delivered by the Respimat inhaler once
      daily compared to tiotropium (18 ug) inhaled as powder capsule from the HandiHaler once daily
      at the end of 4-week treatment periods in patients with COPD. The hypothesis test of
      non-inferiority will be performed at alpha = 0.025 (one-sided).

      Comparison(s):

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the trough FEV1 response determined at the end of each
      4-week period of randomised treatment.
