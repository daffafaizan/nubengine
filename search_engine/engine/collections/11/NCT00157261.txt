    
      The trial is a prospective, international, multi-centre, randomised (1:1), double-blind,
      parallel group comparison conducted for investigating the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase
      and placebo in patients with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin.

      Approximately 1300 patients (two groups of 650 patients; tenecteplase or matching placebo)
      suffering from witnessed (by eye or ear) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac
      origin, who are treated with ALS-CPR will be randomised at approximately 40 study centres.
      Randomisation is done immediately after insertion of an IV line is established. Study drug
      application, as a single IV bolus over 5-10 seconds, should be done immediately after the
      first vasopressor application during the ALS-CPR procedure.

      PCI facilities will be required at all participating sites, i.e. hospitals receiving
      patients.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary aim of the trial is to demonstrate superiority in the intent-to-treat analysis of
      tenecteplase over placebo with regard to primary endpoint as the incidence of 30-day survival
      (30daysurv).

      Comparison(s):

      Group A (experimental; fibrinolytic treatment) Tenecteplase, as a single IV bolus over 5-10
      seconds, immediately after first vasopressor dosage during standardised ALS-CPR procedures
      according to the International CPR Guidelines.

      Group B (reference) Placebo, as a single IV bolus over 5-10 seconds, immediately after first
      vasopressor dosage during standardised ALS-CPR procedures according to the International CPR
      Guidelines.
