      and who are still experiencing symptoms. Subjects are given the ACTH gel to take twice each
      week for 12 weeks as a supplement to current therapies. Subjects are required to visit the
      clinic for a baseline visit, at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. We will obtain a
      blood sample for research purposes.
