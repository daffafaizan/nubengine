      undergoing any radical treatment in the two arms of the study. Another primary endpoint is to
      measure the difference in detection of high risk patients when comparing CT and MRI for all
      patients.

      Secondary outcomes will measure the proportion of patients who underwent neoadjuvant
      treatment, quality of surgery including free resection margins, perioperative morbidity and
      mortality, permanent defunctioning stoma rates, downstaging, quality of life at 1 year, 3
      years and 5 years.
