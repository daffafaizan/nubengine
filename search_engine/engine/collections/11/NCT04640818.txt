      consulting the Multiple Sclerosis Center of Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland.

      Enrolled patients will have 5 Study Visits, one every 3 months according to clinical
      practice. At visits at 3 and 6 months only adverse events will be collected for study
      purposes. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline, Month 6 and Month 12. Clinical
      assessments correspond to medical exams performed routinely in MS patients treated with anti
      CD20 or cladribine therapy: clinical assessments, monitoring haemoglobin parameters, serum
      immunoglobulins, liver and renal function.(6, 12 months), radiological disability progression
      and biomarker of ongoing neurodegeneration (12 months).
