      invited to participate in this clinical trial. The patients will be randomized to receiving
      the injection with the Buzzy versus the control group without the Buzzy. Both groups will
      still receive their typical supports that will include their choice of local anesthetic
      cream, relaxation and distraction techniques. Randomization will be stratified for the
      ability to self report.

      Measures to capture the pain will include self report of pain, by using the Face Pain Scale
      revised (FPSr) in all participants who are able to self report. In addition all participants
      will be evaluated by the use of the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability scale (FLACC
      scale), an observational tool validated to capture pain responses. The investigators will
      also include measurement of heart rate at rest, during and after the intervention.
