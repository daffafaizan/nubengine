      µg b.i.d. in terms of trough Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) (mean of 23 hours
      15 min and 23 hours 45 min post QVA149 dose) following 26 weeks of treatment in patients with
      moderate to severe COPD.

      The study population will consist of approximate 736 male and female adults (age 40 years and
      greater) with a clinical diagnosis of stable COPD [GOLD (2010)] and a smoking history of at
      least 10 pack years. It is anticipated that approximately 981 patients will need to be
      screened in order to randomize 736 patients into 2 treatment arms of the study with an equal
      randomization ratio, meaning QVA149 (368 patients), fluticasone/salmeterol (368 patients).
      Treatment randomization will be stratified by current/ex-smoker status and prior ICS use. It
      is intended that 552 patients will complete the study at Week 26 without major protocol
      deviations. Dropouts will not be replaced.

      This will be a multi-national study, including China, and at least two other countries.

      Standardization FEV1 AUC0-12h will be performed in a subgroup of around 100 patients (50
      patients per treatment arm) in pre-selected centers.
