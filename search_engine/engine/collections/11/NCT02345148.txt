      be approximately 42 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is,
      28 days before study commences on Day 1) and open-label Treatment (Day 1) and Follow-up (up
      to Day 13). Esketamine will be administered by intranasal route (delivery of medications
      through the nasal mucosa) on Day 1. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
