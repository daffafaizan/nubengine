    
      PBGM01 is an adeno-associated viral vector serotype Hu68 carrying GLB1, the gene encoding for
      human beta-galactosidase, formulated as a solution for injection into the cisterna magna.
      This is a global interventional, multicenter, single-arm, dose escalation, adaptive design
      study of PBGM01 delivered as a one-time dose administered into the cisterna magna to patients
      with infantile GM1 gangliosidosis. There are two infantile subtypes of GM1 gangliosidosis:
      early onset infantile (Type 1) and late onset infantile (Type 2a) which are defined by the
      age of onset of disease symptoms.

      Early Onset Infantile (Type 1):

        -  Onset <6 months of age

        -  Age at enrollment: >4 to <24 months of age

      Late Onset Infantile (Type 2a):

        -  Onset >6 to 18 months of age

        -  Age at enrollment: >6 to <36 months of age (except Cohort 1 will be >12 to <36 months of
           age)

      In Part 1 of the study, two dose levels of PBGM01 will be studied separately in patients with
      either Type 1 or Type 2a GM1 gangliosidosis (see table below). The cohorts for patients with
      Type 1 and Type 2a will be assessed independently from each other. Part 1 will enroll a total
      of four cohorts, enrolled sequentially with separate dose-escalation cohorts for Type 1 GM1
      and Type 2a GM1. Enrollment will initiate in Cohort 1. Following completion of Cohort 1,
      simultaneous enrollment in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will occur. Cohort 4 will follow completion
      of cohort 3.

      Part 2 of the study will test the safety and efficacy of PBGM01 in confirmatory cohorts for
      Types 1 and Type 2a GM1 gangliosidosis with a dose chosen based on the data obtained in part
      1 of the study. This will be a 2-year study with a 3-year safety extension.
