      joints, rechargeable batteries, an array of sensors and a computer-based control system. It
      is snugly fitted on the body and worn underneath the clothing, if desired. ReWalk is a new
      realization of the Powered Exoskeleton concept, first tried about fifty years ago with no
      success. Employing an innovative, non-robotic design approach, it uniquely matches the user's
      capabilities with the control mechanisms. Upper-body movements of the user are detected and
      used to initiate and maintain walking processes. User stability and safety during ambulation
      is secured by concurrent use of safety aids such as crutches for walking and railing for
      stairs.
