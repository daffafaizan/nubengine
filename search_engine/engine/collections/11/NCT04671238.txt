      bone lesions compared to benign osteoarticular lesions (Kuji I et al, Eur J Hybrid Imaging.
      2017), and some have even defined an SUVmax threshold value that points to prostatic bone
      metastases (Mohd Rohani MF, Ann Nucl Med. 2020; Tabotta F et al. BMC Musculoskelet Disord.
      2019). A study conducted by Beck et al (EJNMMI Research 2016) evaluating the metabolism of
      secondary bone lesions by visual analysis and SUV peak, revealed a discrepancy between visual
      and Quantitative methods in one third of cases, thus showing the importance of these
      quantification indexes in the analysis of these records.

      In musculoskeletal pathologies, the quantification of bone scans is developing. Suh MS et al
      (Radiology. 2016) evaluated SUVmax in bone tomoscintigraphy coupled with CT in
      temporomandibular osteoarticular disease (Suh MS et al, Radiology. 2016). Cachovan et al
      (EJNMMI Res. 2013) and Huang et al (Ann Nucl Med. 2020) reported a correlation between mean
      SUV and lumbar vertebrae (LU) bone density, which reinforces the physiological significance
      of SUVs.
