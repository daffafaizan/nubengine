      before clinical means are able to detect any lens changes in animal and limited human
      studies. This ability will make it very useful in future clinical studies of cataract
      etiology as well as treatment. A recently concluded clinical cross sectional study of lenses
      (in vivo) using the DLS device showed good reproducibility and good correlation with clinical
      cataract grading. It also detected remarkable changes in the lens crystalline proteins with
      aging and with cataract formation. We therefore propose to study the characteristics of the
      crystalline proteins in pristine young normal lenses with DLS for comparison with aging and
      cataractous lens findings. We will examine 30 young normal subjects, perform undilated eye
      examinations, and obtain DLS measurements of their lenses. We will then use these DLS
      measurements for comparison with the previously obtained aging and cataract DLS measurements,
      to obtain normative data for future lens and cataract clinical studies.
