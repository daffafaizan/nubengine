      sensorimotor function in stroke. It was introduced for the first time by Axl Fugl-Meyer and
      collaborators and originally published in both English and Swedish, representing the first
      quantitative assessment tool for the hemiplegic patient.

      The FMA is a valid, reliable, responsive and most widely used standardized clinical scale for
      the evaluation of the degree of sensory and motor impairment of the hemiplegic patient, and
      to date is considered one of the most used tools worldwide. Extensive research has shown that
      FMA is easy to use and does not require special equipment, making it particularly suitable
      for different types of clinical setting around the world.

      There are many currently translation and cultural validation studies of the FMA in several
      languages (Danish, Norwegian, Spanish, French), but an official version validated in Italian
      is no available to date.

      This study aims to perform and develop a transcultural validation of the FMA for the upper
      and the lower limbs in Italian, following a methodological approach, already validated, for
      the process of translation and cultural adaptation, including formal involvement of the
      University of Gothenburg, which holds the rights on the original scale.

      The translated version in Italian is tested by 3 physiotherapists admitted to the
      neurological department at The Don Carlo Foundation, in order to identify lingual and
      conceptual inconsistencies that could influence the score, the understanding, the
      interpretation and the cultural equivalence of the scale.
