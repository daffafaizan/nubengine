    
      Aim: to determine and compare the short term effect of angiotensin converting in the
      management of hypertension as well as the oxidative effect of Zofenopril and perindopril in
      blacks hypertensive patients in the Yaoundé Central Hospital.

      Method: A double-arm, double-blind, randomized and parallel clinical trial conducted at the
      Yaoundé Central Hospital. Hypertensive patients who are not taking angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptors blockers, are randomize into 2 groups. Depending on
      the group, the intervention consisted of the administration of Perindopril 10 mg daily or
      Zofenopril 30 mg daily for 08 weeks. The endpoints were the nycthemeral blood pressure
      profile, pro oxidant marker (malondialdehyde) and anti-oxidant marker (Ferric reducing
      antioxidant).

      Progress: Recruitment for PEZO-HP was completed in May 2019 with 24 patients.
