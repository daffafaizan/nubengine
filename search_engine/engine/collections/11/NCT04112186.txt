      opiate/opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose. Research into the enhancement of treatment
      options for individuals with opiate/opioid use disorder (iOUD) is clearly a priority. The
      development of neuroscience-informed behavioral therapies that could be used as adjuncts to
      improve effectiveness of medication-assisted interventions in iOUD is a national priority, a
      response to the opiate crisis. This study measures the neural correlates of cognitive
      function and reward processing as potentially contributing to and predictive of the impact of
      an 8-week group therapy on addiction outcome in iOUD. Using a pre-post randomized treatment
      design with a 3-months follow-up, this study will examine the impact of group therapy, as
      add-on to methadone maintenance, on neural functional and structural plasticity, and clinical
      outcomes (including daily ecological momentary assessments), in treatment-seeking iOUD (with
      primary use of heroin). Treatment-seeking iOUD will be randomized to 8-weeks of one of two of
      group therapies and scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) immediately before and
      after treatment. Healthy controls will be scanned at similar time intervals. Clinical outcome
      will be assessed during, immediately after and 3-months after therapy. Results may help
      identify individual variability in the brain regions/circuits that support reward processing,
      including cue reactivity, and inhibitory control and that could change with, and predict,
      response to treatment, ultimately contributing to precision medicine in OUD.
