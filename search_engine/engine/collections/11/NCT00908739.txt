        -  To identify consistent patterns of VEGF expression, E-cadherin regulation, matrix
           metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activity, and carbonic anhydrase 9 activity as predictive
           factors in the development of aggressive tumor behavior in tumor tissue samples from
           patients with localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected tumor tissue samples are examined by immunohistochemistry for
      levels of expression of five different factors related to aggressive tumor behavior (i.e.,
      VEGF expression, E-cadherin regulation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activity, and
      carbonic anhydrase 9 activity). Samples are compared to positive tissue controls (i.e., VEGF-
      tonsil; E- cadherin-normal breast or endometrium; MMP2- placenta) and a negative control
      (i.e., isotype matched normal serum) to identify consistent patterns of expression/activity
      of these factors. Levels of expression are quantified as 5-level scores (0 to 4 scale) and
      differences between any two areas of a tumor are analyzed.
