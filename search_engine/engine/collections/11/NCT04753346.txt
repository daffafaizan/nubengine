      with COVID-19 according to normal values and reveal the relationship of this change with age,
      gender, physical activity level, disease severity and accompanying medical conditions.

      Patients older than 18 years old who are diagnosed with COVID-19 according to clinical
      symptoms and rt-PCR test positivity and at least 30 days past the end of their symptoms are
      accepted for the study.

      According to World Health Organization's (WHO) classification, COVID-19 disease severity is
      determined. Physical activity level of the patients before COVID-19 is evaluated with
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Risk of anxiety and depression of the patients
      is identified with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which has 14 questions. To
      evaluate cardiopulmonary fitness level, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and 6-minute
      walk test are applied. Cardiopulmonary exercise test is gold standard to determine cardiac
      and respiratory functions. Pulmonary function test is performed to identify the conditions
      that affect the results of cardiopulmonary exercise test.
