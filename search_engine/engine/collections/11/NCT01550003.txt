      Period which will continue until the approval of the marketing application for the
      Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) indication in the study
      participant's country or region or until further notice from UCB (approximately 4-6 years
      duration; depending on region). A Final Visit will be conducted 12 weeks after last dose of
      study medication. Overall, study visits will occur monthly during the first 6 months and
      every 2 months afterwards. All patients will receive active treatment with Certolizumab
      Pegol. The dose will depend on actual weight. Home dosing will be allowed between study
      visits.

      If less than 50 % of the study population achieves an adequate response to the treatment
      (American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30 % (PedACR30) response) at Week 16, the study
      will be entirely discontinued.
