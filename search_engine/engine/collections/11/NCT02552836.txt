      intervention that controls for non-specific factors (i.e., supportive psychotherapy) in
      reducing depressive symptoms. A secondary aim is to determine whether IPT is better than
      supportive therapy in improving quality of life, interpersonal functioning, attachment
      patters, and motor symptoms, and whether treatment gains are durable at 6-months follow-up.
      An exploratory aim of the study is identify moderators and mediators of treatment outcome.
      Patients who meet study criteria will be randomly assigned to either 12 sessions of IPT or 12
      sessions of supportive therapy. The primary efficacy measure (Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale) will be administered at baseline, weeks 6 and 12, and at 6 months follow-up.
