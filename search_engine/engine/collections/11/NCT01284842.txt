      The effect of acute partial sleep deprivation on surgical proficiency is still
      controversially discussed. The present study is the first to measure objective physiological
      parameters of fatigue in respect to subjective perceptions of sleepiness in VR- research of
      surgical performance.

      Methods:

      38 surgeons were explored on three consecutive mornings: prior to a 24-Hour- Call, post-call
      and after 24 hours resting. Hours of sleep were recorded. Subjective alertness was assessed
      using the standardized Stanford-Sleepiness-Scale (SSS). Saliva cortisol concentrations and
      pupillary activity were measured by ELISA and pupillography. The VR-simulator LapSimÂ® was
      used to assess technical skills through defined low- fidelity VR-tasks "cutting", "clip
      applying" and cognitive skills through defined high-fidelity VR-tasks "intracorporal
      suturing", "VR-cholecystectomy". Objective alertness was measured by the standardized
      d2-Paper-Pencil-Test.
