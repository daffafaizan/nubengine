        -  To determine if patients who are treated with a probiotic-containing diet develop
           infection with one of the probiotic microorganisms while undergoing allogenic
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy or myelodysplastic
           syndrome.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral Lactobacillus rhamosus GG (Culturelle DS) once daily beginning
      when blood counts have recovered without filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) support
      for 3 consecutive days and continuing for 1 year after transplantation.
