      families with a focus on understanding cognitive function challenges that are related to
      self-regulation (using focus groups i.e. FG and feedback sessions i.e. FB). (2) To evaluate
      the feasibility and acceptability of this novel family-based treatment. (3) Explore potential
      associations between pediatric cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors and self-regulation in
      children with and without overweight or obesity. (4) To refine the F-ABT protocol and to
      maximize participant feasibility, acceptability, safety, and tolerability of F-ABT. (5) To
      provide pilot, proof-of-concept, and preliminary efficacy data of beneficial effects of F-ABT
      on SR and BMI in children with SR deficits and their caregivers.
