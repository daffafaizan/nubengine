      immunosuppression, but from improved understanding of the normal mechanisms that generate and
      maintain self-tolerance. RG2077 may block a T cell costimulation pathway central to the
      pathophysiology of MS. A total of 20 patients with MS will be enrolled in this study. Each
      patient participates in the study for 4 months.

      The dose-escalation portion of this study evaluated the safety of a single infusion of RG2077
      (CTLA4-IgG4m) in 16 patients with MS and is now complete. Patients who participated in the
      single infusion portion of the study were assigned to one of four groups. Each group received
      a different dose of RG2077. The second portion of the study will evaluate the safety of 4
      doses of RG2077 in 4 additional patients. In the multiple infusion portion of the study, all
      patients will receive the same dose of RG2077. Patients will be monitored for possible side
      effects of RG2077.
