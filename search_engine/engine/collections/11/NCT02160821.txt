      between the ages of 1 and 9 undergoing bilateral ureteral reimplantation surgery through a
      low transverse incision will be enrolled. Narcotic requirement, pain scores (FLACC/FACES),
      episodes of nausea/vomiting, and anti-spasmodic requirement will be recorded in the PACU and
      at 6 hour intervals through 24 hours from the time of the block placement.
