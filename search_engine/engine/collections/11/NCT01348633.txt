      technologies in a clinical setting. This phase of the Proposal will aim to validate and
      calibrate the new technologies, explore the signal-to-noise ratio of RBF and oxygen
      saturation parameters, generate values to define the impact of absorption, morphological
      fundus variation and pre-retinal autofluorescence on oxygen saturation imaging and will
      establish a database of healthy control imaging values for both new technologies and the
      reproducibility of those measurements. Note: Sample size calculations have been conducted for
      all aspects of this phase of the protocol, based upon our extensive retinal vascular
      reactivity work. We will build and develop unique quantitative imaging technologies to that
      will permit us to explore the physiology of retinal and choroidal perfusion and vascular
      regulation, and retinal oxygenation.

      Having completed the Validation and Calibration phase, this research will ultimately add to
      our basic knowledge in predicting the development of sight-threatening change in patients
      with the ARMD, diabetic retinopathy and primary open glaucoma, and facilitate earlier
      detection of the problem to help us discover earlier treatments for people with these
      conditions. The reliability of each imaging technology will be assessed by determining its
      ability to differentiate between diseased and healthy eyes. Through this proposed Research
      Program, we will build and develop unique quantitative imaging technologies to:
      Comprehensively assess the blood supply to, and vascular regulation characteristics of the
      posterior segment of the eye, a diagnostic capability that is currently severely limited.
      Assess oxygen saturation disturbances in the retina and ON that occur prior to clinically
      detectable changes, diagnostic capability that currently does not exist. Using the retinal
      blood supply and oxygen saturation parameters, we will derive net oxygen delivery to the
      retina and optic nerve head (ONH), a diagnostic capability that does not exist
