      however, there is a lack of evidence regarding: 1) extend of instruction and supervision, and
      2) frequency of training session during the wek.

      Questionnaires will be send to around 2000 office workers inviting them to participate in
      work site training for 1 hr per week for 20 weeks. Those accepting the invitation will be
      randomized into 5 different groups:

        1. training 1 hr one time per week supervized 50% of the time

        2. training 3 x 20 min per week supervised 50 % of the time

        3. training 3 x 20 min per week supervised only initially with careful instructions

        4. training 10 x 6 min per week supervised 50 % of the time

        5. no training serving as reference control group At termination of the training period
           there will be a follow-up questionnaire survey
