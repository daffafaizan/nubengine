      Primary

        -  Provide treatment with docetaxel and imatinib mesylate for patients with
           androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases that progressed while receiving
           docetaxel and placebo on MDA-ID-030008.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate and time to progression in these patients after crossover
           from docetaxel and placebo to docetaxel and imatinib mesylate.

        -  Compare the modulation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor pathway by
           docetaxel and imatinib mesylate vs docetaxel and placebo in the same patient.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this crossover regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, crossover, multicenter, extension study. Patients who
      progressed on the placebo and docetaxel arm of MDA-ID-030008 crossover to receive docetaxel
      and imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral imatinib mesylate
      once daily on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each therapy course, and at the completion of
      therapy.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
