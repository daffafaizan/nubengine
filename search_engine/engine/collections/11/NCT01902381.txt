      I. To evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activities of CPI-613 in myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) patients who have failed previous agents (such as decitabine [Dacogen], azacitidine
      [Vidaza], growth factors or lenalidomide).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days
      1 and 4 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
