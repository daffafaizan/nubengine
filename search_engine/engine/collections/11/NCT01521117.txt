      adult population in the United States over the age of 65. Some of the most disabling symptoms
      of Parkinson's disease are balance and gait dysfunction, leading to falls. These symptoms do
      not respond to current dopamine directed therapies. Evidence from both pathologic studies and
      advanced imaging has demonstrated that a cholinergic deficiency in the thalamus and basal
      ganglia is found in individuals with PD who fall compared to non-fallers. The central acting
      acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, donepezil, has been demonstrated to decrease falls in
      individuals with PD. The mechanism by which falls decreased is unknown. Our open label pilot
      data indicates that donepezil can improve quantitative measures of balance in individuals
      with PD. Suggesting that improvements in balance in the mechanism by which donepezil reduces
      falls. Our goal is to determine whether donepezil will:

        -  Improve quantitative measures of balance in subjects with Parkinson's disease compared
           to placebo.

        -  Improve quantitative measures of gait in subjects with Parkinson's disease compared to
           placebo.

        -  Improve cognitive measures in non-demented subjects with Parkinson's disease.
