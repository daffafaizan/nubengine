      controlled versus reference treatment protocol, open.

      Patients will be seen 16 times for the purposes of the study. They will be hospitalized
      during therapy. Discharge from hospitalization occurs during follow-up depending on the
      patient's condition.

      the end of treatment (visit week 12). These visits will coincide with treatment sessions with
      the EMDR Â± SB / SMP protocol, as part of the support of their complex psychotrauma. At the
      end of treatment, the patient will be evaluated during follow-up visits at Month 1, Month 3
