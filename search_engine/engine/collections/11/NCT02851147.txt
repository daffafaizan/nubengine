      Topcon and other manufacturer's slit lamps will evaluate operability and usability of SL-D301
      and DC-4 digital camera attachment instrument performing routine eye examinations and image
      capture on volunteer subjects using above mentioned instruments. Similar evaluations will be
      performed with the SL-3G Slit Lamp and a comparative evaluation will be drawn between the two
      instruments. At the end of the evaluation, the evaluator will be presented with a
      questionnaire on specific points regarding the performance and features of the instruments
      and interviewed. The responses will then be evaluated by Topcon.
