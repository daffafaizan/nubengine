      of relevant specimens can be collected quickly from tissue registry. There is a current lack
      of knowledge regarding to what extent formalin fixation alters the identification of proteins
      in the skin with inflammatory dermatoses. This information would be important to assess when
      determining the limitations (or potentially lack thereof) of using fixed specimens in
      research.

      Collaborators have successfully developed a murine model that can accept human skin
      xenografts. While those investigators have successfully demonstrated transplantation of
      healthy skin onto mice, it is unknown whether skin affected by inflammatory disease can be
      transplanted and, if so, whether the inflammatory skin disease remains, whether it spreads to
      involve host skin, or whether it resolves. Determining feasibility of transplanting inflamed
      human skin using this model, as well as observing the course of this inflammation, are the
      next steps in advancing this potentially invaluable research modality.
