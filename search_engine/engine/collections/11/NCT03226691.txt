      marrow and differentiate to all lineages of peripheral blood cells. HSC transplantation is
      the only curative option currently available for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients either
      via allogeneic HSC transplantation or HSC-targeted gene therapy. Granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF)- mobilized HSCs are frequently utilized in the adult setting of
      HSC transplantation because of the faster hematologic recovery as compared to bone marrow. As
      an autologous HSC source for gene therapy, bone marrow harvest has been generally employed
      since G-CSF has been prohibitive in SCD patients due to granulocyte stimulation and the
      associated reports of vaso-occlusive crises, multi-organ failure, and death. However, when
      bone marrow harvest is used, the amounts of collected cells are limited and anesthesia is
      required. In order to obtain HSCs in large numbers without anesthesia, patients will undergo
      mobilization followed by large volume apheresis. Plerixafor is an alternative treatment for
      mobilization without direct stimulation to granulocytes, and it is theoretically applicable
      for SCD patients. The primary endpoint of this study is to obtain sufficient amounts of HSCs
      collected from the peripheral blood in SCD patients after plerixafor mobilization with an
      acceptable safety profile. The harvested products will be stored as backup for patients
      undergoing gene therapy as well as allogeneic HSC transplantation.
