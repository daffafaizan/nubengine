      will be randomized into a three arm 12-week trial. Participants in the telemedical (TM) and
      telemedical coaching (TMC) group got a weighing machine and a step counter, with automatic
      transfer into a personalized online portal, which could be monitored from both, the
      participant and the study centre. The TMC group weekly will get care calls from the study
      centre aiming to discuss measured data and to fix target agreements. The control group will
      remain in routine care.
