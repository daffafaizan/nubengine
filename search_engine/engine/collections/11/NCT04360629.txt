      randomised assigned to three groups. Low dose TXA, high dose TXA or a placebo of IV saline
      which will be infused prior to skin incision in patients undergoing elective cytorsductive
      surgery for ovarian cancer .

      Intraoperative blood loss will be estimated by the volume in the suction drains and by
      weighing the swabs. Postoperative blood loss will be estimated by the volume in the drains.

      The other secondary outcomes will be inclued perioperation transfusion volume, thromboembolic
      complications, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, adverse thrombogenic events within 30
      days, 30-day all-cause readmission and so on.
