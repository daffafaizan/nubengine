      Crohn's disease in patients undergoing resective surgery.

      Methods: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study that will determine the
      endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's disease 12 months after curative, resective ileal or
      ileocolonic surgery in patients receiving post-operative vedolizumab or placebo. Patients
      will receive the first infusion of vedolizumab (300 mg) or placebo (1:1 randomization) 2-4
      weeks after surgery. Subsequent infusions of vedolizumab or placebo will occur at 2, 6, 14,
      22, 30, 38, 46, and 54 weeks after the first infusion. The primary assessment for
      determination of drug efficacy will be presence or absence of mucosal inflammation
      (representing active Crohn's disease) at the ileocolonic anastomosis and neo-terminal ileum.
      This assessment will be made by colonoscopic inspection one year after surgery. Patients with
      an elevated fecal calprotectin at week 22 will undergo a 6-month post-operative clinical
      colonoscopy to assess for endoscopic recurrence.

      Subject population: Patients scheduled for resectional surgery for ileal or ileocolonic
      Crohn's disease will be eligible for the study. Subjects will be male or female who are 18
      years of age or older.
