      therapy (iCBT) can improve engagement and success in an existing Supported Employment (SE)
      program among the most functionally disabled patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective
      disorder. The iCBT condition also included computerized cognitive remediation. The primary
      specific aim was to determine whether iCBT will significantly improve work outcomes at
      post-treatment to a greater extent than Usual Care (UC) in low functioning patients with
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder who join the SE program. The secondary aims were to
      evaluate the whether iCBT will significantly improve work outcomes at 6 month follow-up
      relative to UC, and whether iCBT will improve functional outcomes post-treatment and at
      follow-up relative to UC in subjects who join the SE program.
