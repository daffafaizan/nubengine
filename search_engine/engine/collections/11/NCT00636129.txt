      response (RR) training will be associated with different degrees of change in physiological,
      psychological, hormonal, molecular and immunological markers. Prior studies have reported
      reduction on many of these parameters after 8 weeks of RR training. However, we now seek to
      understand the degree to which incremental decreases in these parameters are exhibited at 0,
      4, and 8 weeks of RR practice in 30 healthy adults. Furthermore, we will explore correlations
      between levels of exhaled nitric oxide or plasma nitrites/nitrates and oxygen consumption
      during RR elicitation. We will also examine any associations between changes in oxygen
      consumption and psychological factors, physiological parameters, and biochemical outcomes.
      Lastly, we will bank plasma and peripheral blood cells from these samples for future
      assessments of immune markers, cell typing and gene expression.
