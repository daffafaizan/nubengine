      retransplantation is often considered. While some centers have reported equivalent results
      for retransplantation as compared to primary transplantation, this strategy remains
      controversial. We seek to examine outcomes following re-transplantation in children and
      identify risk factors for mortality.

      Objective 2: Adult African-Americans have been reported to have lower survival following
      heart and other solid-organ transplantation. The relationship of recipient race to survival
      following pediatric heart transplantation has not previously been reported.

      Methods: We would like to review the United Network for Organ Sharing database. We plan on
      reviewing database records of heart transplantation subjects <18 years of age from 1987 to
      2004. Indications for retransplantation and patient race characteristics will be collected
      and evaluated. Analysis will be performed using proportional hazards regression controlling
      for other potential risk factors. The contribution economic disparity, insurance status and
      HLA mismatching to disparities in outcome will also be explored.
