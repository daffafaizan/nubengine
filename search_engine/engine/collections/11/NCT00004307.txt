    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This protocol involves 2 clinical studies. Part A is a metabolic study of
      glutamine conversion to urea at different levels of protein intake, while on and off
      medications. Part B is a dose escalation study of a first-generation adenoviral vector with
      an E1 deletion and an E3 deletion substitution (d1309) expressing ornithine transcarbamylase
      (OTC).

      In Part A, diet is controlled for protein and calories. Intravenous glutamine and urea are
      administered. Controls are given intravenous arginine, phenylacetate, and benzoate.

      In Part B, groups of 3 patients are given a single low, intermediate, or high dose of
      intravenous OTC vector. Allopurinol is administered every 12 hours for 12 days. As of
      12/10/1999, Part B of the study is closed.
