      of chronic musculoskeletal pain in patients experiencing acute pain and injury. Investigators
      propose to address this unmet need by intervening at the point when pain is still acute with
      pain management that is intended to alter the mechanisms involved in the transition from
      acute to chronic pain. The proposed study, "Altering The Transition from Acute to Chronic
      Pain (ATTAC-Pain): A randomized clinical trial of duloxetine for the treatment and prevention
      of musculoskeletal pain," will examine the ability of duloxetine to improve pain outcomes in
      individuals presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute musculoskeletal pain.
      Investigators will enroll a total of sixty participants. Eligible patients who consent to the
      study will: be randomized in the ED, receive a dose of study drug (duloxetine 30mg,
      duloxetine 60mg, or placebo) in the ED, and be discharged from the ED with a two week supply
      of study drug. Following discharge, the patient will receive follow-up assessments via
      internet-based surveys and phone to monitor for adverse events and evaluate patient outcomes.
      The patient will also return to the study site for an in-person follow-up interview 6 weeks
      after their initial ED visit. The study team will recruit participants at the Rhode Island
      Hospital and the Miriam Hospital EDs. The results of this study will be used as basis for a
      potentially high impact large-scale trial examining an important new non-opioid pain
      treatment option that reduces acute pain and prevents the transition to chronic pain. This in
      turn can improve recovery, reduce opioid use and its sequelae, and decrease health care
      costs.
