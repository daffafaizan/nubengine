    
      The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial randomizing patients to
      different treatment protocols depending on their pain associated with venous cannulation.
      There will be two set of instructions for perioperative treatment, one for those grading pain
      associated with venous cannulation <2.0 (low-pain) and another for those grading VCP â‰¥2.0
      (high-pain).

      The low-pain group will be randomized to standard treatment or opioid-free anesthesia. The
      high-pain group will be randomized to standard treatment or extra in form of additives like
      esketamine and clonidine.

      In the low-pain group the investigators aim for non-inferiority with the gain being avoiding
      opioids. In the high-pain group the investigators aim for lower post-operative pain.
