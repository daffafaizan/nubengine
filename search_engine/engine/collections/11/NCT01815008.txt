      (rs12041331) on responsiveness to clopidogrel. The investigators will further assess the role
      of other genetic variants in determining the response to single or dual anti-platelet
      therapy. Apparently healthy subjects (N= 2108) from high-risk families are being (a)
      identified from a proband with early-onset CAD and (b) genotyped on the Illumina 1 million
      platform, with imputation to 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. The investigators
      plan to characterize the variance in platelet aggregation to multiple agonists (ADP,
      collagen, and arachidonic acid) after 1-week therapy with clopidogrel in a high-risk subset
      of GeneSTAR subjects (N=100). The investigators further plan to determine the extent to which
      variants identified in the PEAR1 gene modify platelet responsiveness to inhibition by
      clopidogrel in this high-risk subset. In addition, the investigators aim is to determine the
      extent to which variants in other recently discovered genes, by themselves, and in
      combination with PEAR1, modify platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel alone and with aspirin
      in this high-risk subset. Lastly, the investigators also want to determine what changes in
      platelet mRNA are produced by aspirin alone and by aspirin with clopidogrel.
