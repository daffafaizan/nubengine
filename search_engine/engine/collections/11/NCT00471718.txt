    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-751 in patients with androgen-independent,
           hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer and determine the maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD) and optimal phase II dose of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rate (partial and complete response) in patients with
           measurable disease treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the effect of this drug on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in patients
           with nonmeasurable disease.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral ABT-751 twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment
           repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ABT-751 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 50 additional patients may be treated at
      the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) which is the dose level at the maximally administered
      dose.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive ABT-751 at the MTD determined in phase I. After completion of
           study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study.
