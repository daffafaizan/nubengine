    
      The present pilot study is designed to assess the feasibility of using MRI as the initial
      imaging modality in the investigation of patients presenting with suspected scaphoid fracture
      at the Emergency department or Urgent Care Centre. This study will inform the design of a
      study that will aim to evaluate whether the proposed intervention is likely to generate
      cost-savings whilst improving or maintaining overall patient quality of life and
      satisfaction.

      Patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture will be randomised to receive standard of care
      using 4-view plain x-ray (control group) as the first imaging modality or MRI examination as
      the first imaging modality.
