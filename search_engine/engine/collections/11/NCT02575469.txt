      ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis). The best way
      to measure exercise capacity is to perform a cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
      Normal/reference values in health and disease relate to specific population and
      subpopulations. The population in Israel is unique in its diversity.

      Objectives: Data collection of exercise capacity assessment in health and illness in the
      northern of Israel for future local database.

      Population: 500 Patients evaluated routinely in the exercise lab (pediatric cardiology
      institute) and healthy volunteers evaluated as controls.

      Study design: Prospective observational study. Participants will answer a health related
      questioner, undergo a physical examination, perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test on a
      treadmill or a cycle ergometer .
