        -  Compare progression-free survival rates of patients with poor prognosis stage II or III
           non-seminomatous germ cell tumors with an unfavorable decrease of tumor markers after
           treatment with 1 course of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin followed by subsequent
           treatment with 3 additional courses of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin OR dose-dense
           sequential combination chemotherapy.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive 1 course of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). Patients with a
      favorable decrease of tumor markers after 1 course of BEP receive 3 additional courses of
      BEP. Patients with an unfavorable decrease of tumor markers after 1 course of BEP are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive 3 additional courses of BEP.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive dose-dense sequential combination chemotherapy comprising
           cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, and ifosfamide.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 260 patients will be accrued for this study.
