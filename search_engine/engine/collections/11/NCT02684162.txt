    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response (CR) rate of guadecitabine (SGI-110) with or without
      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) either for the treatment of morphologic relapse or the
      presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with AML
      and MDS (cohort 1 and 2).

      II. The relapse-free survival with the use of SGI-110 as maintenance therapy in patients with
      high risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (cohort 3).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of SGI-110 with or without DLI in this subject
      population.

      II. To evaluate overall response and survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive DLI intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on day
      6 of cycles 2, 4, and 6 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
