      the identity of the intervention), parallel-group, multicenter (study conducted at multiple
      sites) study to evaluate that low risk PE participants who are discharged from the ED and
      treated with rivaroxaban compared to participants who are treated with initial
      hospitalization and standard-of-care. The study consists of a Screening and Randomization
      Period, followed by a 90-day open-label treatment period, and an end of study/early
      withdrawal (EOS) visit. The duration of study participation for each participant is
      approximately 3 months. The participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      treatments. Safety will be monitored during the study.
