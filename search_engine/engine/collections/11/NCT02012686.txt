      thyroidectomy, 80 percent of patients experience posterior neck pain as well as the incision
      site pain. The posterior neck pain is thought to be due to hyperextension is continued during
      an average of 90 minutes of surgery. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or opioids are
      administrated to reduce the pain, but the pain still remained.

      TENS is simple, non-invasive analgesic technique that is used extensively to reduce acute and
      chronic pain. TENS has beneficial effect for the reduction of postoperative pain. The
      conventional way of administering TENS is to use electric characteristics that selectively
      activate large diameter Aβ fiber mediating touch perception without activating smaller
      diameter Aδ and C fiber.

      In this study, TENS during thyroidectomy in posterior neck pain will be evaluated.
