      adalimumab on health-related quality of life (QoL) and work productivity in participants with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in routine clinical practice in China. The decision to prescribe
      adalimumab for RA was based on clinical practice criteria without taking participation in
      this study into account. Participants were included in the study after a physician's decision
      of initiating adalimumab treatment. Participants were followed for 24 weeks, with scheduled
      study visits at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24.
