      effect of high (7.2% THC) and moderate (3.0% THC) dose of marijuana, relative to placebo, on
      alcohol craving and on behavioral economic measure of alcohol demand after exposure to
      alcohol cues, and on subsequent drinking in an alcohol choice task in which participants
      choose either to drink or receive monetary reinforcement for drinks not consumed. Moderators
      of the marijuana's effects on alcohol-related dependent variables will be tested: DSM5
      alcohol use disorder severity, affective vulnerability, trait impulsivity, and working memory
      functioning. Several empirically-determined mechanisms that may explain why marijuana may
      increase risk of alcohol relapse and help maintain heavy drinking will be tested as mediators
      of marijuana's effects on alcohol. The study will recruit 173 non-treatment seeking heavy
      episodic alcohol drinkers who smoke marijuana at least twice weekly to obtain the final
      sample of 150 with complete data (15% of attrition). Participants will be tested at a
      baseline session and during three experimental sessions. Investigators will collect blood
      samples for analysis of cannabinoid plasma levels and to examine marijuana-induced changes in
      hormones and other biomarkers potentially related to appetite, inflammation and stress.
      Collection of these biomarkers would allow for a greater understanding about the mechanisms
      whereby marijuana may acutely increase alcohol motivation and use. The findings will inform
      researchers and clinicians about how marijuana acutely increases alcohol craving and
      consumption. The strategy of this proposal is to use the most comprehensive controlled test
      characterizing marijuana's putative effects on alcohol.
