    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 0% ARA +0.4% DHA or 0.76%
      ARA +0.4% DHA supplemented infant formula provided to 6 months old healthy infants for 6
      months. Infants will have been breast-fed or formula-fed prior to enrollment. The difference
      in total plasma fatty acid ARA levels between the two groups at 6 months of supplementation
      will be measured. Parents will be asked about the infant's current daily diet (fatty acid
      intakes calculated via 24 hour recalls). All completed infants will be enrolled into a 6
      month extension period (non-supplemented) to collect additional measures of efficacy (i.e.
      infections and illnesses, immune markers) and safety out to 18 months of age.
