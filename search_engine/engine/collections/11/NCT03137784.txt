      trial design. During a screening epoch patient eligibility will be assessed. The screening
      epoch will be followed by a 21-day Run-in epoch during which patients will continue their
      inhaled corticosteroids use but be withdrawn from LABA-treatment and switched to short-acting
      bronchodilator-rescue medication. After the Run-in period patients will be randomized to one
      of the 6 treatment sequences and enter the first 7-day study treatment period. Treatment
      period one is followed by a 10 to 14 days washout period after which patients begin the
      second 7-day treatment period which is then followed by a second 10 to 14 days washout period
      followed by the third 7-day treatment period. At the end of each treatment period spirometry
      will be performed to assess the primary endpoint in terms of trough FEV1. The study
      population will consist of approximately 144 patients with asthma who have been treated in a
      stable regimen of ICS/LABA for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.
