      involvement in the efficacy of botulinum toxin treatment for torticollis. Cervical dystonia
      (spasmodic torticollis) patients will be selected from the Neurology clinic. Subjects will
      range in age from 18 years old through 90 years old. Subjects are expected to be ambulatory
      and independent. Patients are generally expected to be in good health. Exclusion criteria
      include significant intracranial metal (typically fixed dental bridges or braces) generating
      significant magnetic artifact, medical instability, pregnancy, and certain other factors such
      as severe head tremors that would produce magnetic artifact. Clinical states of torticollis
      patients will be assessed by using Tsui scale. Every torticollis patient will have
      magnetoencephalography on the day of botulinum treatment beforehand and approximately 2-8
      weeks after botulinum treatment. We will compare the results of magnetoencephalography
      between control subject and torticollis patient before botulinum treatment aiming to find any
      difference between the two populations. We also compare the results of magnetoencephalography
      in individual torticollis patient before and after botulinum treatment, aiming to detect the
      changes between these two conditions in the same individual and possibly between the average
      of data from each condition before and after botulinum treatment.
