      Primary

        -  Compare the effects of selenium vs placebo on tissue biomarkers of prostate cancer
           susceptibility, using tissue samples from biopsies before and after treatment, in
           patients undergoing brachytherapy for stage I or II prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effects of selenium on antioxidant enzyme activities in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, whether there is a threshold effect among patients with low
           baseline levels of selenium treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium for 3-6 weeks. Patients then undergo
           brachytherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo for 3-6 weeks. Patients then undergo
           brachytherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months.
