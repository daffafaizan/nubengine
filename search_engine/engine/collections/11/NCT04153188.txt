    
      This is a prospective, two-arm randomized, baseline-controlled, pilot study to evaluate
      treatment outcome of 3 Vbeam® Prima PDL treatments in subjects applying once-daily RHOFADE®
      topical oxymetazoline HCL 1.0% cream for improvement in erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.
      Treatment outcome will be compared to oxymetazoline HCL 1% cream alone.

      Subjects with moderate or severe (Grade 3 or 4) erythematotelangiectatic rosacea on the
      validated Clinical Erythema Assessment (CEA) Scale and Subject Self-Assessment (SSA) Scale
      will be enrolled and randomized to one of two study arms:

      Arm 1- 3 monthly treatments with Vbeam® PDL with daily RHOFADE® topical oxymetazoline HCL
      1.0% cream.

      Arm 2 -Treatment with daily RHOFADE® topical oxymetazoline HCL 1.0% cream only.

      All subjects will apply RHOFADE® cream daily during the 6-month study. After 1-month of
      RHOFADE® cream, subjects in the combined treatment Arm 1 will receive the first of three
      monthly Vbeam® PDL treatments (at 4-week intervals) with a 3-day washout of cream before each
      treatment.

      Investigators will assess erythema severity, global aesthetic improvement and vessel size
      improvement with treatment at 1, 2, 3 and 6-months' post-baseline. Subject satisfaction will
      be assessed. Safety assessments will be conducted at each study visit, and subjects in Arm 1
      will also be assessed for treatment-associated discomfort and post-treatment response
      following PDL treatments.
