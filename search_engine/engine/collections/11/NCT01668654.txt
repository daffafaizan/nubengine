    
      Epilepsy is among the most common serious neurologic disorders in childhood. Medicines with
      novel actions of mechanisms of action are needed to try to address the unmet clinical need
      for seizure control in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of retigabine/ezogabine as an adjunctive
      treatment in subjects with either partial onset seizures (12 to < 18 years old) or
      Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (12 to <30 years old) who have participated in a previous ("parent")
      study.
