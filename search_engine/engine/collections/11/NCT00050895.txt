      (ARV) therapy naive, but an optimal regimen has not yet been established. This study will
      compare a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, a ritonavir
      (RTV)-enhanced protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen, and a nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing regimen for the initial treatment of HIV infection.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms. In Arm A, patients will
      receive lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) twice daily and efavirenz (EFV) once daily before bed.
      Arm B patients will receive LPV/r twice daily, lamivudine (3TC) once daily, plus either
      stavudine extended release (d4T XR) once daily, zidovudine (ZDV) twice daily, or tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) once daily. Patients in Arm C will receive EFV once daily before
      bed and 3TC plus either d4T XR once daily before bed, ZDV twice daily, or TDF once daily
      before bed.

      Study visits will occur every 4 weeks until Week 24, then every 8 weeks thereafter for a
      maximum of 96 weeks. Blood will be drawn at every visit and a urine sample will be collected
      every 8 weeks. Body measurements will be taken at Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96. Whole body
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be done at Weeks 48 and 96. Patients must
      fast before study visits at Weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96. Women in the study will have
      gynecological assessments every 24 weeks.
