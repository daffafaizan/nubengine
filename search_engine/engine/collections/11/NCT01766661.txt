    
      Anastomotic leak represents the most frequent complication after rectal cancer surgery and a
      lateral covering ileostomy is usually performed to reduce its incidence. Other important
      consequences of rectal cancer surgery are alterations in bowel habits and function and a
      negative impact on quality of life. This prospective, randomized, multicenter and controlled
      trial compares post-operative complications, quality of life, faecal incontinence and
      recurrence rate in patients treated for low rectal cancer with colo-anal anastomosis
      protected by a lateral ileostomy or with a two-staged Turnbull-Cutait colo-anal anastomosis.
