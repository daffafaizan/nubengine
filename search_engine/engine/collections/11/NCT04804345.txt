      patients. In patients at high risk for excessive bleeding the prophylactic use of
      antifibrinolytics may be useful. This study propose to compare the efficacity and innocuity
      of aprotinin and tranexamic acid to reduce the proportion of patient presenting severe
      peri-operative bleeding according the Universal Definition of Perioperative Bleeding (UDPB)
      classification.
