      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The evaluation of the total atrial conduction time via
      tissue Doppler imaging (PA-TDI interval) can be used to identify patients with increased risk
      of new onset AF. Autonomic function can be assessed by different non invasive clinical
      investigations.

      The investigators hypothesise that PA-TDI interval is increased in acutely exacerbated COPD
      (AECOPD) compared within stable COPD and that increased PA-TDI is related to impairment of
      autonomic function. For this purpose, 25 patients with AECOPD and 25 patients with stable
      COPD were characterized by clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, lung function,
      electrocardiography, echocardiography and autonomic function.
