    
      Trial: Randomized 3 arm (1:1:1) parallel design comparative effectiveness trial

      Stratification: Systemic corticosteroid/immunosuppressive therapy vs. none

      Treatments: 1) difluprednate 0.05% 2) combination therapy of prednisolone acetate 1% with
      nepafenac 0.1% 3) combination therapy of difluprednate 0.05% with nepafenac 0.1%

      Masking: Unmasked treatment administration; masked outcome assessment (evaluation of OCT and
      visual acuity)

      Follow-up: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 weeks

      Treatment protocol:

      Patients will be randomized at enrollment to either:

        -  difluprednate 0.05% 4 drops per day

        -  prednisolone acetate 1% 4 drops per day and nepafenac 0.1% 3 drops per day

        -  difluprednate 0.05% 4 drops per day and nepafenac 0.1% 3 drops per day

      If macular edema has not resolved at Week 4, continue study treatment at the same dose until
      Week 6.

      If macular edema has resolved at Week 4, reduce study treatment as follows:

        -  difluprednate 0.05% 1 drop per day until Week 6, then stop

        -  prednisolone acetate 1% 1 drop per day and nepafenac 0.1% 3 drops per day until Week 6,
           then stop

        -  difluprednate 0.05% 1 drop per day and nepafenac 0.1% 3 drops per day until Week 6, then
           stop

      If macular edema does not resolve at Week 4 but has resolved at Week 6, reduce study
      treatment at Week 6 as follows:

        -  difluprednate 0.05% 1 drop per day until Week 8, then stop

        -  prednisolone acetate 1% 1 drop per day and nepafenac 0.1% 3 drops per day until Week 8,
           then stop

        -  difluprednate 0.05% 1 drop per day and nepafenac 0.1% 3 drops per day until Week 8, then
           stop If macular edema resolves at Week 4 but reoccurs at Week 6, treat per best medical
           judgement.

      After Week 8, there are no restrictions on the treatments patients may receive, and
      medications can be tapered further, discontinued, or changed at the discretion of the
      treating physician and patient preference. If a patient with previously resolved macular
      edema has a recurrence, the physician may treat according to best medical judgement.
