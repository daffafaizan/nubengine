      the common cold, fever, and coughs in mammals and birds. However, in some cases,
      coronaviruses are associated with more serious and lethal conditions, such as pneumonia,
      bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      originating from Wuhan, China led to a global health crisis. At the time of writing,
      SARS-CoV-2 infected more than two million, resulting in almost 180.000 deaths. World Health
      Organization declared new SARS-CoV-2 infection a pandemic, and many states enacted strict,
      rules such as border closures, transportation restrictions, and quarantine.

      The term 'sexual behavior' encompasses a large spectrum of actions in which humans present
      their sexuality. Previous reports have analyzed the effect of mass disasters on female sexual
      behavior.

      Many studies in the literature have described the relationship between mass disasters and
      female sexual behavior, but none have investigated the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on
      women's sexual attitude. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the effect of the
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on female sexual behavior.
