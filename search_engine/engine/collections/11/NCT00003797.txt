        -  Determine the response rate and survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
           and overexpression of HER2/neu treated with gemcitabine and trastuzumab.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly during weeks 1-7. Patients
      receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes once during week 1 and trastuzumab IV over 30-90
      minutes once weekly during weeks 2-8.

      Patients with stable or responding disease receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly
      during weeks 1-3 and trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes once weekly during weeks 1-4. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 41 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-24 months.
