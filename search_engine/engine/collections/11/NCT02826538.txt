      upper extremity, lower extremity and pelvis fractures to be more accurate compared with
      standard procedures of fracture fixation. Accuracy is evaluated by calculating translation
      and rotation comparing the postoperative 3D model versus the preoperative 3D plan.

      Secondary outcome is an assessment of the surgical outcome using validated outcome
      instruments for each fractured body part like "Patient related wrist Evaluation" (PRWE)
      scores for distal radial fractures, as well as evaluation of range of motion.
