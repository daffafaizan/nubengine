      in patients who receive oxygen therapy. The mask is composed of a regular aerosol mask with
      corrugated tubing (15 cm length) inserted into two lateral holes.

      Each included patient will wear the standard Non-Rebreather Mask (NRM) which is the standard
      delivery oxygen system for patients with acute severe hypoxemia. Then the patients will wear
      the DTM for 30 minutes. Finally the DTM will be replaced by the NRM for the next 30 minutes.
      The impact of both oxygen delivery system will be assessed by measuring the change of blood
      gases with each system.
