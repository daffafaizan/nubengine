      use and chronic pain are being recruited. Participants will be screened on the telephone for
      major inclusion/exclusion criteria. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria based on the
      screening assessment will be set up for an appointment in the clinic. Participants will be
      instructed not to use alcohol, prescription opioids, or any other drugs on the day of their
      appointment. All study procedures will take place at the 30 Bee Street location of the Brain
      Stimulation Lab (BSL). The protocol contains 1 screening visit, 10 TMS visit, and 2 follow up
      visits. Individuals that are eligible following the screening visit will be randomized to
      receive real or sham TMS.

      On each TMS visit participants will undergo a single 20-minute session of 10Hz real or sham
      rTMS (on-time=5 secs, off-time=10 secs) at up to 110% of resting motor threshold using a
      MagVenture MagPro TMS machine.

      Primary outcomes will be:

        1. change in pain sensitivity levels in the pain assessment task and

        2. change in levels of opiate craving.

      The investigators will use analysis of variance models with group (real rTMS vs. sham) as the
      between-subjects factor and time (pre- to post-TMS) as a within-subject factor. The
      investigators will test the hypothesis that rTMS will result in significantly lower levels of
      reported pain sensitivity and craving, as compared to sham. Blind interim analyses of the
      data will be conducted when 50% of the sample has been accrued.
