      short-term outcomes associated with an innovative service delivery model to increase
      adherence to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) during the transition from jail to the
      community for rural individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). The significance of this
      study is grounded in the public health emergency associated with the opioid epidemic in rural
      Appalachia, the increased vulnerability of rural individuals with OUD, and the dearth of
      available and accessible evidence-based treatment in the region. This R34 has potential to
      make a significant contribution to the OUD treatment field by advancing knowledge on
      innovative service delivery models to increase access to evidence-based treatment to reduce
      high-risk opioid use and related health disparities among hard-to-reach, high-risk,
      underserved populations. The study will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) Adapt
      XR-NTX services for use in community supervision (P&P) offices to increase adherence during
      re-entry from jail for rural individuals with OUD. (2) Examine feasibility, acceptability,
      and short-term outcomes of XR-NTX adherence and relapse to opioid use through a small pilot
      trial with 60 rural individuals with OUD. The pilot trial will include OUD screening, medical
      evaluation, XR-NTX initiation prior to jail release, and random assignment to one of two
      community re-entry treatment models to receive on-going XR-NTX injections in the community
      after release in either: (1) A local rural P&P office (n=30), or (2) Services as Usual
      (n=30), referral to a community clinic). If this study establishes feasibility of this
      innovative community-based treatment model for XR-NTX in a rural, underserved area, findings
      will be used to develop an R01 application to test the approach in a larger RCT during
      community re-entry from jail among high-risk rural individuals with OUD in Appalachia. The
      long-term goal of this research is to increase access to evidence-based treatment for OUD
      among high-risk, underserved populations.
