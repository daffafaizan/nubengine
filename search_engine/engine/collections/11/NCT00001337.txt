    
      Background:

      The treatment of the intermediate and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in adults and
      children commonly induces complete responses in a sizable fraction of the treated population,
      and about 2/3 of the complete responders appear to have prolonged disease-free survival.

      The present study assesses the activity and tolerability in previously untreated patients of
      a regimen of EPOCH infusional chemotherapy given intensively with G-CSF support.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      Assess complete response (CR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of dose-adjusted
      EPOCH-Rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) with G-CSF in agressive B-cell lymphomas.

      Eligibility:

      Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the following categories: mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL)
      and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBL).

      Patients greater than or equal to 12 years old.

      Any Stage for PMBL and MGZL.

      No prior systemic chemotherapy.

      HIV negative.

      Design:

      This study will estimate the complete response rate of a group of previously untreated
      patients and the extent to which EPOCH infusional drug delivery accompanied by a
      hematopoietic growth factor can increase the dose intensity of treatment.

      Patients receive prednisone orally for 5 days, a 96 hour infusion of vincristine,
      doxorubicin, and etoposide, and a bolus of cyclophosphamide on day 5.

      Cycles are repeated every 21 days for a total of 6-8 cycles.

      Patients with CD20 expressing tumors (i.e. mature B-cell lymphomas) will also receive
      rituximab, the humanized monoclonal antibody against the CD20 receptor on day 1 of each
      cycle.

      A total of 348 patients will be enrolled on this protocol.
