      It is planned to have 30 evaluable subjects at least divided evenly among 3 independent PIs
      from one hospital. Each PI will enroll 12 subjects at least. The ration of evaluable test
      subjects to control subjects will be 2 to 1. The study lens will be dispensed randomly to
      subjects who have normal ocular health and conform to a set of criteria. It is necessary to
      wear the lens 8 hours a day and 5 days a week at least and follow up for one month (30 days).
      Data will be collected at baseline, 1 week, 2 week and 4 week of daily disposable modality
      including Adverse Reactions, Slit-lamp findings and Symptoms, Problems, and Complaints,
      vision acuity, keratometry change and reason for discontinuation.
