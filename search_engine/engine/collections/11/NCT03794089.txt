      anxiety, but rates of treatment are low. Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI), in
      which mental health clinicians provide brief treatment in the primary care setting, can
      bridge the gap between demand for, and availability of, anxiety treatment. However, brief
      anxiety interventions suitable for use in the PC-MHI setting are needed. Developing an
      effective brief PC-MHI intervention for anxiety would address a gap in VA treatment options
      and facilitate high quality healthcare that improves treatment engagement, clinical outcomes,
      and patient experience. To ensure maximum reach, this intervention should accommodate a
      variety of subthreshold and diagnostic anxiety presentations, as well as comorbid depression.

      Objectives: The overall goal of this research program is to develop, refine, and evaluate a
      brief anxiety intervention that will be acceptable to Veterans and feasible for PC-MHI
      providers. The primary aim of the current study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled
      trial to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, potential implementation barriers and
      facilitators, and effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care.

      Methods: This will be a pilot hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation randomized
      controlled trial (N = 36). The primary goal is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
      effectiveness of the intervention in reducing anxiety symptom severity compared to usual
      care. The secondary goal is to collect preliminary data on implementation barriers and
      facilitators that may affect future real-world uptake.
