      tolerate standard therapies, or for whom no effective standard therapy is available, or who
      refuses standard therapies. Surufatinib 250 mg once a day (QD) will be orally administrated
      and Toripalimab 240mg will be intravenously administered every 3 weeks up to documented
      disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant request, or withdrawal
      of consent. For Toripalimab, the upper time limit for treatment is 2 years. The primary
      objective is safety of safety run-in (about 6 patients) and objective response rate (ORR) of
      Surufatinib combined with Toripalimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
