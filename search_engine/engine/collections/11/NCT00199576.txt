      12-hour-pretreatment by methylprednisolone before a planned extubation in adult patients
      ventilated for more than 36 hours in the ICU. Methylprednisolone (20 mg) or placebo was first
      administered intravenously 12 hours before extubation and continued every 4 hours until tube
      removal. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of laryngeal edema within 24 hours of
      extubation. Laryngeal edema was clinically diagnosed and considered as major when requiring
      tracheal reintubation.
