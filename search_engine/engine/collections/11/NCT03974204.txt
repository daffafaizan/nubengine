    
      The aim of this study is to describe the association between the initial proteomic profile
      issued from cerebrospinal fluid microvesicles and the initial cytological analysis of the
      cerebrospinal fluid in breast cancer patients with a suspicion of metastatic meningitis.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  Describing the association between the initial proteomic profile and:

             -  the histological types and hormonal receptors status of the breast cancer,

             -  the likelihood of leptomeningeal metastasis according to the EANO-ESMO
                classification (Lack of evidence / possible / probable / confirmed) ,

             -  the likelihood of leptomeningeal metastasis according to the EANO-ESMO
                classification, combined with histological type and hormonal receptors status.

        -  Evaluate the prognostic value of the proteomic profiling for overall survival, according
           to the EANO-ESMO classification and other known prognosis factors, in patients
           classified "possible", "probable" or "confirmed" leading to leptomeningeal metastases
           specific treatment,

        -  Evaluate the impact of the evolution of the proteomic profile a month after the start of
           this treatment on the overall survival, in patients with leptomeningeal metastases
           specific treatment,

        -  Evaluate the association between the proteomic profile and the EANO-ESMO classification
           at least 3 months after the initial EANO-ESMO classification,

        -  Evaluate the evolution of the proteomic profile 3 months after the initial EANO-ESMO
           classification, in patients initially classified "lack of evidence", broadly and
           according to the evolution of cytology, the administered treatments and to the EANO-ESMO
           response if applicable,

        -  Compare the proteomic profiles issued from cerebrospinal fluid and blood
