      and knee osteoarthritis. The vendors employ different design features (e.g. use of video for
      patient narratives, interactive values clarification exercise) and the study will examine the
      relative impact of the different features on decision quality. Eligible subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive one of two decision aids before their upcoming clinic visit with
      a participating provider. Immediately before the visit, participants will complete a short
      questionnaire about the decision aid. This pilot study will assist with determining the
      potential difference between these two decision aids on improving knowledge and use of
      decision aids.
