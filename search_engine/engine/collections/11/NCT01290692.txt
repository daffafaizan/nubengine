      surgically removed to provide cells for the vaccine. Second, the patient will be vaccinated
      with the vaccine formulation. Third, the patient's blood will be filtered for killer T cell
      precursors which will then be cultured and stimulated to reach a higher (killer) activity
      level. Fourth, the activated cells will be infused into the patient's bloodstream so that
      they will be able to attack the cancer.
