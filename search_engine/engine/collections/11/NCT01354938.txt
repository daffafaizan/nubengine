    
      Participants in this observational study had a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and signs and
      symptoms of an acute exacerbation, clinically diagnosed by the sudden worsening of symptoms
      characterized by extreme breathlessness and increased chest tightness, wheezing, cough, or
      sputum changes. A sequential non-systematic sample of patients with AECB from May 2011 until
      January 04, 2012 is included in this observational study.

      The observation period for each individual patient started with the diagnosis of the acute
      exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and prescription of antimicrobial medication per routine
      clinical care. This observational period continued during the treatment period and ended on
      at least one follow-up visit at the end of the treatment. Duration of treatment was based on
      physician's judgment of severity of the patient's condition. The usual treatment period
      ranges from 5 to 14 days.
