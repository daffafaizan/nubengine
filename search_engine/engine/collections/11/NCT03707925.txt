      I. To assess the pathologic changes that result from bronchoscopic laser ablation of
      peripheral lung tumors focusing on the proportion of complete tumor ablation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of this technique by describing both procedure-related complications
      such as bleeding or pneumothorax and post-procedure adverse effects such as fever or
      pneumonitis.

      II. To assess the pathologic changes observed in the lung tissue surrounding the treated lung
      tumor.

      III. To assess radiographic changes observed by cone-beam computed tomography (CT)
      immediately after the application of bronchoscopic laser ablation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bronchoscopic laser ablation following standard bronchoscopy and
      endobronchial ultrasound. Patients also undergo CBCT before and after laser ablation. 48-72
      hours after the procedure, patients undergo standard surgical resection of the lung tumor.
