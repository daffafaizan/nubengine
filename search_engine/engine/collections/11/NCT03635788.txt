      treat participants with a history of sub-optimal adherence and control of their HIV
      infection: long-acting (LA) antiretroviral therapy (ART) with rilpivirine (RPV) LA and
      cabotegravir (CAB) LA versus all-oral standard of care (SOC).

      The study includes four steps. In Step 1, participants will receive a SOC oral induction
      regimen consisting of an ART regimen that involves at least 3 drugs for 24 weeks.
      Participants who achieve milestones will receive conditional economic incentives at Weeks 2,
      4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.

      In Step 2, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either oral RPV + oral CAB for
      4 weeks followed by RPV-LA + CAB-LA every 4 weeks for 48 weeks or to continue on SOC for 52
      weeks.

      At the completion of Step 2, eligible participants randomized to SOC will have the option to
      register to Step 3 and receive LA ART, which includes oral RPV + oral CAB for 4 weeks
      followed by RPV-LA + CAB-LA every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Participants already receiving RPV-LA
      + CAB-LA in Step 2 will continue on this regimen in Step 3 for 52 weeks.

      Eligible participants will enter Step 4 and be followed for 52 weeks on locally sourced oral
      ART.

      Participants will be followed for up to a total of 180 weeks. Study visits, which will occur
      throughout the study, may include physical examinations; blood, urine, and hair collection;
      liver function tests; questionnaires; and an electrocardiogram (ECG).
