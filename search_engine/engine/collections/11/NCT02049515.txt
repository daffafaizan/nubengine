    
      This is an open-label, two- arm, extension study designed to enable subjects who have
      experienced radiologically- confirmed disease progression in Study IPI-145-07 to receive the
      alternative treatment (either IPI-145 or ofatumumab) than what was received during study
      IPI-145-07.

      Subjects who have previously received ofatumumab in study IPI-145-07 will receive a starting
      dose of 25 mg IPI-145 BID continuously in a 21 day cycle for Cycle 1 followed by 28- day
      treatment cycles thereafter for up to 11 cycles or until disease progression, discontinuation
      from study participation, or start of subsequent therapy, whichever comes first. After
      completing approximately 11 cycles of treatment with duvelisib, subjects who, in the judgment
      of the Investigator, may derive benefit from continued treatment may continue to receive
      additional cycles of duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However,
      to receive additional cycles of duvelisib beyond 11 cycles, subjects must have evidence of
      response and CLL/SLL requiring treatment according to the IWCLL/IWG by Cycle 12 Day 1.

      Subjects who have previously received IPI-145 in study IPI-145-07 will receive a starting
      dose of 300 mg ofatumumab on Day 1 followed by seven weekly doses of 2000 mg. Thereafter,
      subjects will receive 2000 mg ofatumumab once every month for four months unless disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Administration of ofatumumab will not exceed the
      12 doses (within 7 cycles).
