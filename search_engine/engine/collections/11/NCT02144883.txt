      and infant death, and children's developmental problems. It is also associated with
      significant economic costs. Telephone cessation quitlines have been suggested as one good way
      to reach pregnant smokers.

      This randomized controlled trial was embedded into a free statewide telephone cessation
      quitline in California. The primary component of the intervention was telephone counseling
      using a structured protocol developed specifically for the pregnant population. The
      counseling consisted of nine counseling sessions.

      A secondary component of the intervention was the mailed materials. Following enrollment in
      the study all subjects (control and intervention) received a self-help quit kit for pregnant
      smokers and fact sheets on second-hand smoke and additional tips for quitting while pregnant.
      Subjects in the counseling intervention group received five additional mailings. These
      mailings were designed to remind them of their commitment to quitting and of the presence of
      counseling support if they needed help.

      Prior to 36 weeks gestation (in the third trimester), 2-months postpartum, and 6-months
      postpartum we conducted a brief telephone survey to assess smoking status. The information
      obtained allowed us to determine 30-day prolonged abstinence rates.

      Prior to 36 weeks gestation (in the third trimester), the investigators sent a kit and
      requested saliva samples be mailed back to biochemically verify smoking status by testing for
      cotinine and nicotine byproducts.
