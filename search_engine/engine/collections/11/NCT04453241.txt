      randomized into 1:1 ratio to receive three doses of either test vaccine (NPB615) or
      comparator vaccine (Gardasil). The safety of the test vaccine (NBP615) was confirmed by 2nd
      vaccination in adult subjects. After that, enrolment of 120 adolescent subjects proceeded.
      Eligible subjects who previously agreed to participate in the study were screened and only
      those subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in to 1:1 to receive
      two doses of test vaccine (NBP615) or comparator (Gardasil pre-filled syringe). 0.5 ml
      Intramuscular injection at were given at each vaccination and two blood sample, pre vaccine
      and post vaccine 4 weeks after completion of vaccine were collected to assess the
      immunogenicity of NBP615 and Gardasil, comparator vaccine. Solicited adverse events occurred
      up to 7 days after each dose of the investigational product were collected in the diary card.
      Unsolicited adverse events occurred up to 28 days after each dose of the investigational
      product were collated in the diary card. Serious adverse events were collected during the
      entire study period. In addition to this safety data was collected through the study period
      by active contact with the study participants by doing home visit or by telephone contact.
