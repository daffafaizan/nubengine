      portion of the blood. This treatment is mainly used for familial hypercholesterolemia, but
      can be used in other rare diseases. Familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is an inherited
      genetic condition that causes accumulation of cholesterol in the blood, which can lead to
      atherosclerosis and heart disease. This treatment is recommended for patients who do not
      respond to dietary and/or medication control of LDL cholesterol.
