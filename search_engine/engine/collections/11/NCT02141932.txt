      Informed consent mandatory.

      No exclusion criteria.

      Hypotheses:

      The carotid arteries and the heart can be assessed bed-side by pocket-size ultrasound
      scanners with high feasibility and reliability.

      Bed-side assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart by pocket-size ultrasound scanners
      may reduce the need for more advanced (higher cost) imaging procedures.

      Methods:

      Pocket-size imaging device from GE Ultrasound, commercial available. Approved for clinical
      use. High-end echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasound by high-end equipment (GE Vivid
      9) and computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at the Department of Radiology,
