        -  Develop Integrated Biomedical Computing Tools (IBCT) for the better understanding and
           treatment of pancreatic cancer by using the power of computer and informatics sciences.

        -  Continue development of the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR)
           infrastructure to act as a repository for socio-demographic, environmental, clinical,
           and family history data collected from individuals and interested family members with a
           personal and/or family history of pancreatic cancer.

        -  Participate in an international pancreatic registry known as the PCCR by sharing
           information collected for research purposes only, to be used by pancreatic cancer
           research collaborators from other institutions.

        -  Collect and bank excess biological materials (i.e., pancreatic tissue, tumor tissue,
           and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer tissue, and/or paraffin-embedded tissue), blood, and
           serum from registry participants for future research.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood and pancreatic tissue collection. Normal, tumor, and/or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer tissue, and/or paraffin-embedded tissue from prior surgery or biopsy are
      obtained.

      Patients provide or complete personal information about themselves, their medical history,
      their diet and lifestyle habits, any past or current environmental exposures, and re-create
      their family tree for any cancers that have occurred in any of their family members. Clinical
      data is collected annually.

      High Risk participants provide blood samples and complete questionnaires at baseline.
      Clinical data is collected annually.
