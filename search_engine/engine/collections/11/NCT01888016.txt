      physiotherapies treatment in rotator's cuff surgery patients, we'll randomize about 60
      patients for arm's of study. Both arm's will receive 10 standard physiotherapies treatments
      in 2 weeks while the experimental arm will receive 3 manual intervention on deep fascial
      tissues, according to fascial manipulation technique, providing a specific motor and manual
      assessment, and a deep manual intervention over specific fascial alteration.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of fascial manipulation treatment we'll use 2 type of outcome
      measure and we will compare the result of both arms of study.
