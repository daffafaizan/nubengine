    
      Patients of Heart Institute of the University of SÃ£o Paulo with inherited cardiac
      channelopathies will be included, considering the criteria for inclusion and non-inclusion,
      after reading and signing the informed consent.

      They will undergo dental restorative treatment in two sessions, in the morning period, with
      an interval of at least seven days (wash-out) between them, and the patients will be their
      own control.

      In the first session, after randomization, patients will receive lidocaine 2% without
      vasoconstrictor (LSA) or lidocaine 2% with 1: 100,000 epinephrine (LCA) (cross-over),
      resulting in two conditions: with adrenaline and without adrenaline.

      The randomization of the anesthetic solution will be performed by the main researcher, being
      blind to the performer researcher and to the patient.

      The injected volume will be 3.6 mL (2 cartridges) of the anesthetic solution, using blocking
      technique of the inferior alveolar nerve.

      The patients will be monitored by Holter for 28 hours starting one hour before the procedure,
      for registration and analysis of cardiac electrical activity during the two sessions. Blood
      pressure will be monitored with digital sphygmomanometer and anxiety will be measured with
      Facial Image Scale, both on three occasions: at the beginning of the baseline periods, before
      starting application of anesthesia and at the end of the proceedings. The results will be
      analyzed statistically.
