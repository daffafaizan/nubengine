      of medical data. Unfortunately, these useful and meaningful clinical data were not properly
      managed or analyzed. Therefore, data mining technology has become an essential instrument for
      hospital management and medical research. Possible meaningful information can be obtained
      from the database through data mining. About 2,000 diabetic patients had been enrolled in
      Diabetes Care Program since Oct 2002 in our hospital. We intend to look for the determining
      factors that affect the prognosis of diabetes mellitus in our patients group.
