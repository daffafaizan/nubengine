      The purpose of this study is to determine if in focal hand dystonia there is disinhibition
      involving key structures of the motor control system (basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum and
      motor cortex) caused by dysfunction of the GABA-ergic neurons. The major inhibitory
      neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), which acts
      mainly through GABA A receptors, the majority of which possess the benzodiazepine binding
      site. Pathological processes involving GABA-ergic neurons will cause alterations in the
      density of GABA receptors, which can be visualized and measured with positron emission
      tomography (PET) using as a radioactive ligand [(11)C] Flumazenil.

      Study Population

      This research will be conducted using 20 patients with primary focal hand dystonia and 20
      healthy volunteers that are matched by age and gender.

      Design

      By using positron emission tomography (PET) using radioactive ligand [(11)C] Flumazenil, we
      will detect alterations in the density of GABA receptors in patients with primary focal hand
      dystonia in comparison with control subjects.

      Outcome Measures

      We will be able to determine the density of GABA A receptors of the various Regions of
      Interest as measured by PET analysis among these groups of subjects. This study should
      provide new information concerning localization and degree of dysfunction of GABA-ergic
      neurons in movement related structures in dystonia, which might open new possibilities for
      pharmacological treatment of this disorder.
