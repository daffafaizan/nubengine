      betacoronavirus, which named the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It was frequently
      reported that COVID-19 could be a public health crisis with high infectiousness, and it
      naturally spread across the country. Most of patients with COVID-19 infection were found to
      have non-specific symptoms including fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue. In addition, some
      patients were more likely to develop severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS), or even die. However, there was no timely and effective
      treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), are
      derived from plants and usually incorporate one or more herbs as the basic drug(s) to treat
      the disease. An RCT was performed to investigate TCM was effective and safe for treating
      COVID-19 infection. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, and 1 subject on
      conventional medicines and TCMs granules for every 1 subject on conventional medicines.
      According to recommendations for prevention and control of pneumonia cause by COVID-19
      infection from China National Health Commission, conventional medicines involve oxygen
      therapy and antiviral therapy (alfa interferon via aerosol inhalation, and
      lopinavir/ritonavir, p.o). Additionally, planned interim analysis will be performed, because
      the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection might affect estimated enrollment.
