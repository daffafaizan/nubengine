    
      We will enroll 124 foreign-born, Chinese-speaking women from Southern California and Maryland
      areas with moderate to severe levels of fatigue, diagnosed with stage 0-IV breast cancer,
      aged 21-74, and 1-5 years post-primary treatment. Using an adaptive treatment strategy
      design, participants will be randomized to either the acupressure intervention or control
      groups. The acupressure group will learn how to press three chief energy acupoints on each
      side of the body through de novo 11-minute Chinese-language video and practice acupressure
      every day (one minute per acupoint; a total of 6 minutes per day) for an 8-week intervention
      period. Participants will be telephone interviewed twice: at baseline and 8-weeks
      post-intervention follow-up.
