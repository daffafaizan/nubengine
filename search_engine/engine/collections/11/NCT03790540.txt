      selected from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and Public Health Department,
      Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University after securing necessary consents. These children
      will be selected based on a need for local anesthesia for pulpotomy treatment on both sides
      of the mandible. All selected children will be randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group I
      (assigned to injection with the aid of DentalVibe tool), Group II(assigned to conventional
      injection). Each group will receive 2 mandibular nerve block injections with two different
      injection techniques, with 1-2 weeks apart as a washing out period. Mandibular nerve block
      injection will be either with vibration using DentalVibe at the injection side or topical
      analgesic (benzocaine 20%) gel will be applied before the injection of local anesthesia at
      first the appointment, and the alternative technique will be used at the second appointment .
      Injection with the aid of DentalVibe tool will act as the experimental group while the
      control group will be the use of topical analgesic (benzocaine 20%).
