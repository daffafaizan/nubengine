      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. This will allow us to visualize and study
      the function and structure of the heart in greater detail so as to improve the diagnosis and
      treatment of patients with various cardiac conditions. The aim of the study is to optimise
      new CMR sequences, allowing the development of imaging protocols in future research studies.

      This study will hence recruit 800 subjects for each of the following sub-studies:

        1. Sub-study 1: Normal CMR protocols for assessment of cardiac function and morphology

        2. Sub-study 2: Exercise stress protocols with a CMR-compatible supine bike.

      For the first sub-study, 400 healthy volunteers and patients with cardiac conditions or
      suspected to have cardiac conditions will be recruited. The testing and optimising of CMR
      sequence settings are crucial to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the scan before using
      the scan as a clinical diagnostic tool.

      For the second sub-study, 400 healthy volunteers of different fitness levels and and patients
      with cardiac conditions or suspected to have cardiac conditions will be recruited. An
      exercise stress protocol will then be developed for future studies in patients with suspected
      coronary artery diseases. For this protocol, participants will be asked to cycle on a supine
      exercise bike to assess the effects of exercise and free breathing on the stability of the
      CMR imaging sequences.
