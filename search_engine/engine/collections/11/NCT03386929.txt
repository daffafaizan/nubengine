      doses following a specific dose-escalation scheme (3 + 3 model) in order to establish the
      safety and identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RP2D) for the
      Phase 2. The phase 2 will confirm the safety and will assess the clinical utility of the
      tri-therapy approach in the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC (100 patients). The study
      will also explore the clinical utility of the Simplified Interventional Mapping System
      (SIMS), a new tool/algorithm enabling matching of NSCLC patients with combination therapy.
      For this purpose tumor/metastasis and matched normal tissue biopsies will be requested in
      order to obtain sequencing and expression profiles.
