      The excited state this drug transfers energy or electrons to ground state molecular oxygen
      producing cytotoxic effects on cell. There are productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      and disrupts several of the cell's functions. This results in bacterial disinfection. In
      order to perform the PDT on the oral cavity, a device based on blue LED with transparent
      acrylic diffuser tip and cylindrical shape was developed.
