      surgery or biopsy, standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide were eligible.
      Patients included were treated with ortataxel 75 mg/mÂ² i.v. every 3 weeks until disease
      progression. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ortataxel in
      terms of progression free survival at six months after the enrolment (PFS-6).
