      individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. To our knowledge, there are no published
      studies evaluating whether twice daily administration of clozapine is better than once daily
      administration in terms of effectiveness and tolerability. Although this may seem trivial at
      first, when we consider that clozapine has a relatively short half-life and dissociates
      quickly from the dopamine D2 receptor, it justifies further consideration. It takes on even
      more significance knowing that the established threshold clozapine plasma concentration for
      therapeutic response (i.e., 350-420 ng/ml) was determined using steady-state trough plasma
      samples (i.e., approximately 12 hours after the evening dose) in patients administered
      clozapine twice rather than once daily.
