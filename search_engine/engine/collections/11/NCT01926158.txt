      denosumab on the biologic incorporation of cementless hip prosthesis. The study population
      consists of sixty-eight postmenopausal female patients, who are scheduled to have cementless
      total hip replacement (THA) for primary hip osteoarthritis. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive a subcutaneous injection of denosumab 60 mg or placebo four weeks before
      surgery and 22 weeks after surgery. The primary hypothesis is that denosumab is effective in
      preventing periprosthetic bone loss in the proximal femur as measured by DXA. The secondary
      hypothesis is that denosumab is effective in enhancement of bone bonding (osseointegration)
      of cementless femoral stems, as measured by model-based radiostereometric analysis.
