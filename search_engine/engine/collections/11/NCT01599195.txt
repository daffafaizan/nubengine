      are then compared to the findings on carotid ultrasoud as to degree of stenosis. Subjects
      with high grade stenosis in which no bruit was ascultated but in which carotid ultrasound
      data suggests a bruit may be present are studied for soft /inaudible bruits. When available,
      data will be correlated to CT/conventional angiographic studies.
