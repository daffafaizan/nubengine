      population, the prevalence of systemic hypertension is high and its adequate control can
      determinate the outcome.

      The first step for a good control of blood pressure is giving a dry weight for the patient.
      We can understand dry weight or target weight as that one which the patient feels comfortable
      and there aren't clinical signals of volemic overload as edema, dyspnea, orthopnea, jugular
      turgency, hepatomegalia. Classically, the dry weight is assessed based on clinical
      examination, blood pressure and experience of hemodialysis staff.

      The electrical bioimpedance is a very simple method that possibilities access the corporal
      compartments, including the body water, using a small and not expensive portable device.

      Trying to study new forms for getting the ideal dry weight, we design a randomized clinical
      trial for evaluating two ways of getting a dry weight for hemodialysis patients.

      One group will be dry weight fixed by bioimpedance data and in another group the dry weight
      will by a clinical protocol.

      We will take a 24h ABPM basal from all patients before the randomization. Then, 2 weeks later
      the dry weight be revised, a second ABPM will be taken. The results will be compared.
