      contrast agent can aggravate kidney function. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) refers to
      the clinical situation where decreased kidney function after use of contrast. CIN is the 3rd
      most common cause of acute kidney injury in the hospitals. There are a lot of reports that
      death rate is increased in patients with CIN.

      Erythropoietin is an agent that treat anemia. It also has been reported to have a
      tissue-protective effect in the animal experiments.

      In this study, we hypothesized that erythropoietin can reduce the incidence of CIN in
      patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography.
