      lower down the anxiety levels and the most important factor is to reduce the risk of COVID-19
      infection spread. This Triage system included Audio system to communicate with patients and
      access the COVID-19 infection status at recommended distance of 6 feet. The main disturbing
      factors that were noted on Visual triage system were, 1). Close contact of healthcare
      professionals with patients and attends, 2). Fear of transmission of infection lead to higher
      levels of anxiety. To assess the efficiency of AVT Anxiety level were analyzed by using
      Spitzer et al., 2006, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scoring system and outcomes were
      assessed where a score less than 5 is taken as no anxiety, 5-9 interpreted as mild anxiety,
      10-14 moderate anxiety, and â‰¥ 15 as severe anxiety levels.
