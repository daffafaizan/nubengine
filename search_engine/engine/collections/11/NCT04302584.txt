    
      Study which was performed on 90 adult of either sex in intensive care unit who developed
      septic shock.45 patients in each group according to the drugs used, by the single blind
      technique as the treating physician only is aware of the drugs used.

      Group 1: patients received IV Norepinephrine infusion starting with (0.1mcg/kg/min).

      Group 2: patients received IV Norepinephrine infusion (Starting with (0.1 mcg/kg/min).
      +Vasopressin infusion at the rate of (0.03 unit/min).

      A comparison was done between both groups as regard:Hemodynamics,Tissue perfusion, C-Reactive
      Protein (mg/L) ,WBC, UREA (mg/dL),CREATININE (mg/dl), NGAL (Neutrophil gelatinase associated
      Lipocalin) (ng/ml). Comparison was done at baseline, then every 6 hours for 48 h as regard
      hemodynamics and tissue perfusion, and at base line then, 24 h and 48 h as regard sepsis
      biomarkers and renal biomarkers.
