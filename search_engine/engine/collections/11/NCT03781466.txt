      birth in twin pregnancies. There is limited evidence for the use of vaginal progesterone and
      cervical cerclage, and the cervical pessary is currently only used within a research setting.
      There are no reported trials comparing the effectiveness of each of these interventions
      against each other, whether in isolation or in combination. Research is needed to further
      evaluate the benefit of the cervical pessary and the use of cervical cerclage in twins of
      women with a short cervix. A recent article by Stock et al.concludes by advising clinicians
      to share with women the uncertainty of methods to prevent PTB in multiple pregnancies, and
      offer the opportunity to participate in clinical trials. So the objective of the present
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage each
      alone and in combination in improving gestational age in twin pregnancy and its subsequent
      impact on perinatal outcome.
