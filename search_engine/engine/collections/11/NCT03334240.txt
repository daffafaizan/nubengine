      potential treatment for benign and premalignant HPV-induced genital lesions in
      immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. This includes 3 different patient populations:
      i) immunocompetent patients with anogenital warts (AGWs), ii) immunocompromised patients with
      anogenital warts and iii) immunocompromised patients with vulvar high grade squamous
      intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL), formerly referred to as usual type vulvar intraepithelial
      neoplasia (uVIN). Since digoxin / furosemide ICVT's mode of action is in part independent of
      the immune system and directly targeted to eradicate the causative HPV, we hypothesize this
      therapy to be of value in this specific group of individuals.
