      study is to determine the incidence of short-term POCD and long-term cognitive status in the
      elderly patients who use Aspirin atleast three months before knee replacement.And then, the
      study evaluates the effect of Aspirin on the incidence of postoperative delirium. In
      addition, it also shows the risk factors for POCD such as postoperative delirium, pain, C
      reactive protein and so on in the elderly patients who undergo knee replacement.
