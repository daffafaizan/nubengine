    
      This is a randomized controlled trial that will randomize medical students to practice on a
      robotic simulator or a laparoscopic simulator. The investigators will first obtain baseline
      data by having the study participants perform one task (peg transfer exercise) on a
      laparoscopic simulator (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS), VT Medical Inc, Waltham,
      MA), and a similar task on a robotic trainer (Mimic da Vinci Simulator, Intuitive Surgical,
      Sunnyvale, CA). Participants will then be randomized to practice on the robotic simulator or
      practice on the laparoscopic trainer for at least 10 repetitions. After the participants
      complete 10 repetitions, they will be evaluated again on both the laparoscopic and robotic
      simulator using time to task completion and Mimi DV trainer motion metrics. Two expert
      laparoscopic and robotic surgeons will also evaluate participant performance using previously
      validated global rating scales for robotic and laparoscopic surgery.
