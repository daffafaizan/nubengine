      understand pathophysiological underpinnings of different disorders managed with
      neuromodulation. There is a paucity of information, however, on dystonia, likely due to its
      rarity of cases and variability in phenomenology to allow generalization of findings.
      Possible abnormal brain signals, such as high activity in theta band (defined as rhythms in
      the 4-12Hz range ), have been proposed by small case series. The development of newer
