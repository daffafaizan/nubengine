        -  Children with brain tumors are generally followed for response or progression by imaging
           studies, such as CT or MRI.

        -  While these imaging studies help delineate the anatomical location and extent of a tumor
           within the CNS, they give no information regarding the biologic or metabolic activity of
           the lesion.

        -  Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging ((1)H-MRSI) is a non-invasive
           method of detecting and measuring cellular metabolites in vivo, providing biochemical
           information in conjunction with the spatial information obtained by MRI.

        -  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique that also provides data on metabolic
           activity of brain lesions.

        -  A comparison of these two methods in determining a lesion s metabolic activity has not
           been reported in children with brain tumors.

      Objective:

      -To compare (1)H-MRSI and [(18)F-]-FDG PET scanning percentage (%) of agreement between
      supratentorial and infratentorial tumors, and between brainstem and cerebellum intratentorial
      tumors.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age: greater than or equal to 1 year and less than to 21 years

        -  Patients must have a brain tumor that is measurable or evaluable on standard MRI or CT.

      Design:

        -  Patients referred for this study will have both (1)H-MRSI and (18)F-FDG PET imaging
           performed within 2 weeks of each other at the NCI

        -  Patients will remain on study for 5 years or until one of the off-study criteria have
           been met (whichever occurs first)
