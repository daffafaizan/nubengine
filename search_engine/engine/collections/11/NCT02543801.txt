      site injection of a local anesthetic or drug cocktail. There are many formulations used for
      this purpose. A formulation documented in the literature was implemented by this institution
      which has dropped the average length of stay dramatically. Concern over the limited half-life
      of the administered anesthetic and the continued need for opioid administration has led to a
      search for better drug formulations and administration vehicles. Recently, the FDA approval
      of an extended release bupivacaine called liposomal bupivacaine was thought to extend the
      effective half-life of the anesthetic agent and thereby prolong post-operative anesthesia.
      Use of liposomal bupivacaine in total joint surgery was almost universally adopted after its
      recent approval and has been an integral part of the "same day total joint" movement.

      Studies have suggested improvement in pain control and shortened hospitalizations with the
      use of liposomal bupivacaine. Other studies have raised questions about the effectiveness of
      this agent. Recently a randomized double blind study was performed with total knees which
      demonstrated no improvement in pain management with the addition of liposomal bupivacaine to
      the multimodal pain management protocol. This study has not been performed in the hip
      arthroplasty population.
