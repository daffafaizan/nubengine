      identification of the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of AF using ECGI. To achieve
      this goal, the investigators will analyze the efficacy of different treatment options in
      persistent AF patients as a function of the results of the ECGI. Mainly, patients will be
      evaluated attending to the complexity of the patterns obtained. Moreover, the investigators
      will evaluate the treatment benefit of performing guided-ablation in conjunction with
      pulmonary vein isolation as compared to pulmonary vein isolation only. These analyses will be
      performed in patients with persistent AF arriving at the clinic to determine treatment
      options. AF outcomes following the treatment assigned therapy will be evaluated at 6 months
      and 1 year after.

      These parameters are obtained from the ECGI map: histogram of rotors (number of rotors and
      location), Highest and Lowest Dominant Frequency (Hz), rotor duration (ms), simultaneous
      rotors (number of rotors) and signal entropy (normalized).

      Wide antrum circumferential pulmonary vein isolation with demonstration of bidirectional
      block will be performed using standard cooled-tip radiofrequency catheters or cryoballoon
      catheters.
