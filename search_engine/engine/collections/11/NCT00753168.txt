    
      Glaucoma is a group of diseases of the eye that can result in irreversible vision loss due to
      damage to the optic nerve. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is one factor associated with
      glaucoma. Currently-available medication used to lower IOP includes beta-blocking agents,
      which can have undesirable side effects on the cardiac and respiratory systems.

      The OT-730 ophthalmic solution contains OT-730, a prodrug that, when applied as an eyedrop,
      metabolizes to OT-705, an active beta blocker. The OT-730 ophthalmic solution is being
      studied to see how well it lowers IOP in patients with a diagnosis of open angle glaucoma or
      ocular hypertension. It will be compared with a well known beta blocker, timolol maleate
      ophthalmic solution, and with a placebo eye drop, in order to assess its ability to lower IOP
      without the typical side effects of other beta blockers.
