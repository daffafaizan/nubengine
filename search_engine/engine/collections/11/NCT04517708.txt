    
      A quasi-experiment with intervention and control groups for pre- and post-intervention
      assessment was carried out at the Department of Oncology and Palliative Care - Medical
      University Hospital from 2016 to 2019. 60 gastrointestinal cancer patients were recruited in
      each group. At stage 1, we selected patients of the intervention group who met the inclusion
      criteria to receive nutritional counseling and diet at the hospital. At stage 2, we chose
      patients who were eligible but did not accept the nutritional counseling and diet at the
      hospital. Participants in both groups were paired together according to the following
      criteria: 1) Age group: <40 years old, 40-65 years old and >65 years old; 2) Gender: Male and
      female; 3) Types of cancer: stomach cancer and colon cancer; 4) Disease stages: stage 1-2 and
      stage 3-4.
