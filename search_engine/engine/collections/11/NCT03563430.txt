      training for their next training/competition. The recovery period is very significant in
      terms of removal of blood lactate and body dynamics as soon as they return to their original

      low-intensity aerobic exercise, self-massage with foam roller methods, which have been proven
      their effectiveness in the literature, have been compared with each other.
