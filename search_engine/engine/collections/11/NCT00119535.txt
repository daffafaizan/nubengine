      detection and treatment. Although VA and HEDIS quality criteria now allow some individuals
      with diabetes to have biannual examinations, current diabetes eye care policies continue to
      emphasize routine, annual eye exams for most diabetes patients. Strong evidence suggests that
      the current �one-size fits all� method wastes resources while ignoring an opportunity to
      substantially improve outcomes for high-risk patients.

      Recent research shows that patients referred for screening examinations (i.e., those without
      retinopathy) require different follow-up then those referred for surveillance examinations
      (i.e., those with retinopathy). Using a more targeted, risk-based criteria for scheduling eye
      examinations together with system level interventions designed to assure their application
      may lead to improved healthcare outcomes. Although, the efficacy of such approaches have been
      demonstrated in other systems and organizational research, it has not yet been demonstrated
      for diabetes eye care.

      Therefore, we propose to conduct and evaluate a prototype translational research project
      examining the impact of the Proactive Diabetes Eye Care Program, a coordinated and targeted
      system-level intervention, on: 1) the optimal timing of photocoagulation; 2) the optimal
      timing of eye care visits; 3) patient and provider satisfaction; 4) health care resource use;
      and 5) the overall cost-effectiveness of a targeted eye care program.

      The primary intervention will involve the use of an innovative �Progressive Reminder and
      Scheduling System� in which intensity of the reminders is based on the patient�s degree of
      risk for developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy or macular edema. At the intervention
      sites, there will be separate clinics for screening (those whose last examination was normal)
      and surveillance (those with known retinopathy). This two-year prototype translational
      project will have a quasi-experimental design. Six facilities will be recruited: three will
      receive the intervention without the system design components. The control and intervention
      sites will be matched for comparability to baseline screening rates and similar patient
      populations. The intervention will be evaluated using historical controls (pre-post analyses)
      and by comparison to control sites.

      Data will be collected from three sources. We will use the VISTA database to determine
      resource use, patients demographics, co-morbidities and medications. Trained medical
      personnel will conduct chart reviews on a random sample of patients undergoing
      photocoagulation to determine whether it was sub-optimally timed (i.e., the patient already
      had a major retinal hemorrhage or advanced macular edema at the time of the procedure). A
      random sample of patients will be surveyed, at baseline and after 12 months, about non-VA eye
      care services they received and their attitudes and satisfaction toward eye care. We will
      also survey health care providers regarding diabetic eye care services.

      If successful, this program will serve as a model for disseminating diabetes eye care best
      practices throughout the VA system and could provide further information about the best
      approaches to managing other diseases in which patients may benefit from risk stratification
      rather than being treated according to a single standard.
