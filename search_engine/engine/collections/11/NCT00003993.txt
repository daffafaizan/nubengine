        -  Determine the safety and side effects of bryostatin 1 and interleukin-2 in patients with
           refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose for interleukin-2 with bryostatin 1 in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether bryostatin 1 and interleukin-2 increase the expression of recognition
           and costimulatory molecules on human monocytes and their ability to act as antigen
           presenting cells.

        -  Assess any anti-tumor response in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-2.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8, and interleukin-2
      subcutaneously on days 1-5 and days 8-12. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-2 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study in less than 2
      years.
