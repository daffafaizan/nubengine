      resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP). It is unknown
      to which extent macitentan has an effect, if any, on BCRP transporters, especially intestinal
      BCRP. The primary purpose of this Phase 1 study is to investigate the effect of macitentan on
      the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a model BCRP substrate.
