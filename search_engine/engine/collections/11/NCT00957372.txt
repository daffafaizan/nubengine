      randomized, placebo-controlled design consisting of an 8 week baseline period, a 2 week
      double-blinded titration period, 12 week maintenance period, and a 4 week tapering-off
      period. After completing the baseline period, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1
      of the 2 ESL daily dose levels (1200 or 800 mg) or placebo.

      Part II was a 1-year open-label extension for patients who had completed Part I. Starting at
      800 mg/day, the dosage could be titrated at 400 mg intervals down to a minimum of 400 mg/day
      or up to a maximum of 1200 mg/day. Patients who completed Part II could participate in a
      study extension and continue treatment with ESL until marketing authorization is obtained or
      clinical development is discontinued, with visits scheduled at the discretion of the
      investigator but at least every 6 months.

      Results from Part I & II were presented in two separate reports.
