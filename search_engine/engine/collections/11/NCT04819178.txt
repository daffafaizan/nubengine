      inhibitors affect renal glucose transport and promotes glucose excretion in the urine. This
      have attractive effects, notably by lowering of blood glucose without any increased risk of
      hypoglycemia as well as a reduction in body weight. Since the risk of hypoglycemia and weight
      gain during intensification of insulin treatment is a significant barrier for optimal
      glycemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors could be an attractive adjunct therapy in type 1 diabetes.
      Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects in persons
      with type 2 diabetes. This may also benefit persons with type 1 diabetes. However, the major
      limitation for an universal use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 1 diabetes is a substantial
      increase in ketogenesis and the risk of DKA. DKA remain a substantial cause of morbidity and
      mortality in persons with type 1 diabetes.

      Since no data exist on the risk of DKA during SGLT2 inhibition outside the randomized
      controlled trials, the investigators will initiate a nationwide monitoring study on the use
      of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 1 diabetes. This will ensure follow-up on the efficacy, safety
      and patient-reported outcome measures for SGLT2 inhibitors treatment of type 1 diabetes in
      real-world clinical practice.
