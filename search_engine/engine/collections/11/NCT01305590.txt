      insights from behavioral economics and financial incentives. We will conduct a survey with
      HIV/AIDS patients at Ponce Clinic (Infectious Disease Program of Grady Memorial Hospital,
      Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). The patients will be low-income persons
      living with HIV/AIDS and possessing varying degrees of medication adherence. We want to
      better understand how this particular population would react to commitment devices designed
      to increase medication adherence. We will survey participants to see if they would prefer
      more commitment, in the form of a "Take-Medication-Get-Paid" plan; less commitment, in the
      form of an "Attend-Clinic-Get-Paid" plan; or if they would prefer to designate their own
      levels of commitment.
