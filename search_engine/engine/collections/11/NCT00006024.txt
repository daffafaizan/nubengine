        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide when administered with lomustine in
           patients with high-grade malignant gliomas.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of radiotherapy after this treatment regimen in this patient
           population.

        -  Evaluate the radiographic responses in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temozolomide.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 and oral lomustine on day 1. Treatment
      continues every 28 days, if blood counts have recovered, for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5
      weekly for 6 weeks. Patients continue the same chemotherapy regimen for up to 6 more courses
      beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
