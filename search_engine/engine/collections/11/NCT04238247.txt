      children in the United States (U.S.) and racial/ethnic minority children are
      disproportionately impacted as suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors are more prevalent
      in some communities. Existing universal approaches to promote child passenger safety have
      fallen short of ensuring that all child passengers are correctly using size-appropriate child
      passenger restraints according to guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics
      and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Precision prevention programs are
      urgently needed to improve child passenger safety behaviors among caregivers who have not
      been responsive to guidelines, laws, and public education campaigns. The proposed research
      will test the efficacy of Tiny Cargo, Big Deal (TCBD), an emergency department (ED)-based
      precision prevention intervention grounded in Self-Determination Theory. TCBD integrates
      personalized counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing (MI) and eHealth
      components including a tailored educational mobile-friendly website "site" and short message
      service (SMS) communications with the goal of improving child passenger safety. We
      hypothesize that by providing tailored child passenger safety education and personalized
      skills for restraint use in a manner that supports autonomous motivation the TCBD
      intervention will be more efficacious than universal approaches (laws/guidelines) for
      realizing correct use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints.
