      social phobia fear many activities that are part of everyday life and suffer from problems
      such as headaches or stomachaches, panic, avoidance, general anxiety, depression, loneliness,
      and a very restricted range of social relationships. Recent findings indicate a new
      psychosocial treatment called Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) is effective
      in treating children ages 8-11, resulting in reduced emotional distress and improved social
      functioning. Treatment effects have been maintained for up to 6 months. This study will
      examine SET-C in children ages 8-15. Because available data suggest that the drug fluoxetine
      is a promising treatment, SET-C will be compared to fluoxetine in this trial. Durability of
      treatment will be monitored over a 1-year follow-up period.
