      the fetal larynx in an axial plane through the mandible and observed the fetal deglutition
      movements .We encountered two cases of hydramnios were no deglutition movements could be
      noted. In all other cases the deglutition was normal. The motivation to conduct the current
      observational prospective study was to assess whether there is a link between absence of
      fetal deglutition and CNS pathology of the fetus. In the first case the fetus deceased at 35
      weeks of gestation; obduction was declined by the parents. In the second case caesarian
      section at 33 weeks was carried out recently due to fetal distress. The infant is still in
      uncapable of swallowing and there for is under investigation at the neonatal center of our
      hospital.
