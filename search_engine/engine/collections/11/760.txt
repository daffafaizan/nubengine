postnatal changes in the portal circulationduring foetal development a large portion of theoxygenated umbilical blood flows through theumbilical recess directly into both main portalbranches.  accordingly, these are exposed to theumbilical blood pressure and have a wideby contrast, the trunk of the portal vein is narrowand there is probably only a small blood flow throughit from the inactive digestive tract, though thepressure in it is approximately the same as in theumbilical vein or perhaps somewhat higher.immediately after birth the liver is deprived of thesubstantial umbilical blood flow.  the portalvenous pressure falls to about one-quarter of theumbilical venous pressure at birth.  however thepressure gradient between the portal veins andinferior vena cava remains constant.
