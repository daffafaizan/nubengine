      combined preoperative oral antibiotics (metronidazole and erythromycin) and perioperative
      intravenous antibiotics (cefmetazole) (oral+intravenous group) or to perioperative
      intravenous antibiotics (cefmetazole) alone (intravenous group). The primary endpoint is the
      overall rate of SSI.
