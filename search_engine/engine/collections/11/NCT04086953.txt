      fifty subjects with heart failure will be recruited for the same protocol.

      During the first visit, the subject will realize two 6-MWT and a cardiopulmonary exercise
      test on ergocycle with the measure of cardiorespiratory parameters. We will evaluate the
      physical activity during daily life using an accelerometer and we will use several
      questionnaires to measure the quality of life, the motivation to physical activities and
      symptoms.

      During the second visit, the subject will realize a 4-meter walk test, two incremental
      shuttle walk tests (ISWT), an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) and a test with dynamometer
      to measure the quadriceps strength.

      During the third and fourth visits, the subject realize two or three endurance walking tests
      (Walk-Time Limit Test - WTLT) at a walking speed equivalent to the mean speed realize during
      the better 6MWT (visit 1)
