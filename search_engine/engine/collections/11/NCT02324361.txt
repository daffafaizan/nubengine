    
      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and effectiveness of
      two platforms, text messaging and Facebook, for delivering an evidence-based, family-centric
      childhood obesity intervention to parent/guardians of children between the ages of 3-6 with a
      BMI of 90th percentile and above. The investigators hypothesize that the use of both
      platforms for delivering a childhood obesity intervention will help establish healthier
      family routines and be equally engaging and accepted by parent/guardians and children.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effect of the intervention on:

        -  Parent/guardian knowledge of healthy family routines (i.e., nutrition, frequency of
           family meals, child's screen time, bedtime routines, physical activity, and sleep hours)
           and of parenting strategies that are preventive of child overweight and obesity

        -  Parent/guardian readiness, confidence, and perceived self-efficacy to make and maintain
           changes in family routines known to be associated with healthy weight outcomes

      The secondary aims of the study are to assess the effect of the intervention on:

        -  The adoption of healthy family routines and parenting strategies that are preventive of
           child overweight and obesity

        -  Daily objective physical activity in the index child by accelerometry (using a physical
           activity tracking device)

        -  Index children's BMI percentile, using data collected during regular clinic visits from
           the electronic medical record

        -  To assess the level of engagement with the intervention, measured via daily activity
           tracker wear by the index child, parent/guardian views of Facebook posts or responses to
           2-way text messages
