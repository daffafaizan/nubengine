      releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist or orchiectomy. Study drug was administered
      until disease progression. Disease progression was defined as a composite endpoint consisting
      of either clinical deterioration, radiographic progression or prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      progression according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2)
      criteria.
