      genetic and acquired. Hepcidin deficiency related to genetic desease is one of them.

      This study concerns specifically this cause, and seeks to characterize these iron overloads
      on clinical, biological, genetic and functional point of view.

      A significant number of patients with chronic iron overload, present a phenotype of hepcidin
      deficiency. This profile is characterized by an elevated plasma iron increased serum
      transferrin saturation, a transferrin saturation, and a parenchyma distribution of iron
      overload. These diseases either remains unexplained or are associated with mutations in the
      gene involved in iron metablism regulation.

      The main objective of this study is to characterize these iron overloads with phenotype of
      hepcidin deficiency not related to homozygosity C282Y (clinical, biological and genetic).
