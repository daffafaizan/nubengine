      developing countries. The use of regular and frequent blood transfusions in patients with
      beta thalassemia major has improved patients' life spans and quality of life, but can lead to
      chronic iron overload. Many factors contribute to the functional abnormalities found in beta
      thalassemia patients such as decreased red cell life span, rapid iron turnover, tissue
      deposition of excess iron and also, specific iron chelators can affect kidneys. The success
      in management of patients of beta thalassemia has led to chronic hemosiderosis in different
      organs like liver and heart and long-term complications in other organs like pancreas and
      kidneys have recently been studied. The evidence of proximal tubular damage has been observed
      in beta thalassemia patients. Also, low-molecular-weight proteinuria has been found in almost
      all patients. Unlike other organs, it is unclear whether kidney damage results solely from
      intravascular haemolysis, chronic transfusion or as a complication of iron chelation therapy.
      Although the early identification of patients at high risk of renal impairment is of great
      importance as it may allow specific measures to be taken to delay renal impairment, there are
      limited studies about renal dysfunction in pediatric thalassemic patients. Thus, in this
      study we will use different measurements for early detection of renal impairment even if the
      patients have no symptoms to handle with the disease in its reversible stage before being
      irreversible. Beside the usual investigations of renal function we will measure cystatin c
      and beta2 microglobulin as early markers of renal impairment.
