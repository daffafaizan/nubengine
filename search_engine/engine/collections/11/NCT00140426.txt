      early promising findings in case reports (Risperidone and Olanzapine) and one open study of
      olanzapine have led to increased use of these medications for individuals with AN. This
      double-blind placebo controlled study of risperidone will attempt to determine if risperidone
      is effective in decreasing core symptoms of anorexia nervosa and decreasing the length of
      time required to reach and maintain at or about 90% Ideal body weight. The safety of
      risperidone in this population will also be examined through monitoring of Extrapyramidal
      Symptoms, Tardive Dyskinesia, Electrocardiograms's, Resting Energy Expenditure, liver enzymes
      and other blood chemistry. Other possible variables which may mediate the recovery process or
      be impacted by risperidone,such as leptin and anxiety symptoms are also being measured.
