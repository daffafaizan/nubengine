      supplement (resistant starch) coupled with moderate intensity endurance training over 16
      weeks leads to reductions in key inflammatory markers in stage 3-4 predialysis CKD patients
      and whether this reduction is associated with favorable changes in vascular function and
      indicators of stress and emotional reactivity.

      The investigators hypothesize that supplementation with the prebiotic (resistant starch) will
      lead to normalization of the microbiome of our sample of patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) and reduce key markers of inflammation. Reductions in these biomarkers will be
      associated with favorable changes in cardiovascular variables along with indices of stress
      and emotional reactivity. Moderate intensity aerobic training will have an additive
      anti-inflammatory effect along with the consumption of the resistant starch.
