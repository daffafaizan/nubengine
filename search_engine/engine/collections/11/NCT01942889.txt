      is characterized by peripheral dysfunction of skeletal muscle which is associated with major
      clinical outcomes (prognostics, symptoms, and health related quality of life). Muscle and
      systemic oxidative stress has been incriminated in this peripheral muscle
      dysfunction.Exercise training constitute the main validated therapeutic intervention leading
      to significant muscle function and clinical improvement.Our preliminary results have shown
      that COPD patients experiment dietary and enzymatic antioxidants defects.Yet, generic
      antioxidant supplementation has not shown significant muscle function improvement.Therefore,
      we aim to test the effects of an antioxidant supplementation targeted on the antioxidant
      defects associated with exercise training on the peripheral muscle function, exercise
      tolerance and health quality of life in COPD patients.At the cellular level, this muscle
      dysfunction is related with a fiber atrophy and a metabolic switch (reduce proportion of
      oxidative fiber).This study will compare the effects of an antioxidant supplementation on the
      peripheral muscle function and skeletal muscle cellular properties in association with
      exercise training during a pulmonary rehabilitation course.Volunteers will be randomised in 2
      groups: - 1 group treated with the antioxidant supplementation ( 28 days)- 1 group treated
      with the placeboIntervention will be allocated by chance and a double blind manner.
      Antioxidant supplementation will associate vitamins and trace elements that won't exceed the
      maximal nutritional dose recommended.
