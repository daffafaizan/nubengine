    
      FLOW Trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded phase II trial evaluating the
      efficacy of coupling antidepressant therapy (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor -
      fluoxetine) with exercise rehabilitation across multiple Canadian sites in 176 stroke
      patients. 88 patients will be enrolled in each arm of the study. Both groups will receive an
      exercise program in addition to standard of care rehabilitation, but only one group (the
      intervention group) will receive the active drug fluoxetine.

      Study participants will be evaluated at baseline, post-exercise program and 6-months
      post-exercise program. While enrolled in the study, participants will be required to take
      part in a 12 week, 3 times per week exercise program. Evaluators and patients will be blind
      to the treatment administered. The trial is constructed with randomization to remove
      selection and allocation biases and to ensure greater validity in observed differences in the
      outcome measures. The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) in Toronto will act as the
      coordinating and analysis center.
