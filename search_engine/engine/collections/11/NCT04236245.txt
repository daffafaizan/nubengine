    
      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will undergo a procedure using the Venclose
      Radiofrequency (RF) System to treat the great saphenous vein.

      The technique involves percutaneous access and insertion of the endovenous sectional
      radiofrequency (EVSRF™) catheter into the target vein under ultrasound guidance and relies on
      the use of local anesthesia and thermal energy, from a radiofrequency generator, applied to
      the target vein. After each treatment, the EVSRF™ catheter is withdrawn a single length of
      the heating coil and another treatment is performed, until the entire vessel has been
      treated.

      After the treatment procedure, subjects will be evaluated four (4) times to assess vein
      recanalization and reflux, and to determine the incidence of adverse events.
