      delaying PACU discharge. In multiple studies, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine and
      dexmedetomidine reduce both the incidence of PONV and post-op pain, as well as requirements
      for postoperative analgesics. These actions are mediated via central alpha-2A receptors
      (A2AR). Of the A2AR agonists, guanfacine, though a weak antihypertensive agent, has the
      highest selectivity for the A2AR, but to date is untested for its potential to treat either
      PONV or post-operative pain.
