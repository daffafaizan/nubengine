      initiated when an OHCA occurs, then the two latter units will be first at scene, before the
      ambulance crew, in â‰¥30% of the cases. We anticipate therefore that overall 30-days survival
      will increase on a national level from 9% to 12%.

      Method During the period 110901 to 141231 all OHCA cases will be analyzed were the emergency
      medical communication centre (EMCC) has dispatched ambulance, firefighters and/or the police.
      Participating in the Saving More Lives in Sweden (SAMS) project are the following counties:
      Stockholm, Sodermanland, Jonkoping, Vastra Gotaland (VG Region), Halland, Dalarna, Jamtland,
      Kalmar and Uppsala. Data is collected by the units being dispatched and thereafter sent on
      line to a database managed by Registercentrum in Gothenburg (http://www.registercentrum.se/),
      administrators of the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Register.

      Parameters obtained are:

        -  Time for dispatch of fire fighters and/or police (recorded digitally).

        -  Time for arrival to the patient.

        -  Verification if cardiac arrest or not.

        -  CPR performed by fire fighters or police before arrival of EMS.

        -  Automated External Defibrillator (AED) connected to the patient.

        -  If yes, was the first recorded rhythm shockable, i.e. ventricular fibrillation (VF) or
           pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).

        -  Time to defibrillation.

      Survival data during from the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Register (SCAR) will be obtained during
      the same time period from nine comparable Swedish regions not participating in the SAMS
      study.
