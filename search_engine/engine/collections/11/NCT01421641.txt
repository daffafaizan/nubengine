      join this study assessing two pain control interventions at the time of tenaculum application
      to the cervix during office gynecologic procedures. Only healthy women ages 18 and over with
      an indication for endometrial biopsy or IUD placement will be recruited. The participants
      will be randomized to one of two arms: an intracervical lidocaine injection versus topical
      lidocaine gel. They will be asked to indicate their level of pain and level of satisfaction
      using a Visual Analog Scale. The primary outcome, pain with tenaculum placement, and the
      secondary outcome, satisfaction with the experience of tenaculum placement, will be compared
      between the study groups.
