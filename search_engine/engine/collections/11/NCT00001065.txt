      patients is limited but encouraging.

      Patients swish and swallow amphotericin B oral suspension after each meal and at bedtime for
      14 days, at which time they are deemed a responder, nonresponder, or failure to induction
      therapy. Responders receive maintenance twice daily, while nonresponders receive 14 further
      days of initial induction. Failures discontinue the study. Responders after 28 days of
      induction are placed on maintenance. After successful completion of initial induction,
      patients remain on study for 6 months.
