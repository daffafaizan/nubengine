      multi-center study. This study consists of two parts, Phase I and Phase II. In Phase I,
      approximately 9 participants will be enrolled ie, 3 participants for dose level 1 (15 mg/m2
      of JNJ-30979754) and 6 participants for dose level 2 (20 mg/m2 of JNJ-30979754). Once the
      tolerability of 20 mg/m2 is confirmed additional 30 participants will be included to receive
      20 mg/m2 and approximate total participants in Phase II will be 36. This study will include
      screening period (within 14 days prior to the day of initial administration of Cycle 1) and
      dosing period (1 cycle consists of administration of study medication for first 5 consecutive
      days + rested for 23 days; ie, total 28 days). Cycles will be reapeated in participants in
      whom decitabine was expected to be effective. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, vital signs, body weight, clinical laboratory tests: hematology, blood
      biochemistry and urinalysis, cardiopulmonary function tests: ECG, chest X ray and oximeter
      analysis.
