      Traditionally, HSCs have been obtained directly from the bone marrow. Transplants using cells
      obtained this way are referred to as bone marrow transplants. HSCs also circulate in the
      blood. Transplants using cells obtained from the blood of children and adults are referred to
      as peripheral blood stem cell transplants. The blood of fetuses is especially rich in HSCs
      and these cells can be easily collected at birth from the placenta. Transplants using these
      cells are called cord blood transplants. Although HSCs can be collected from various sites,
      all HSC transplants, regardless of the source, are given to recipients by intravenous
      infusion. The transplanted HSCs then migrate to the bone marrow.

      Over the past ten years unrelated cord blood transplantation has become an accepted
      alternative to bone marrow transplantation. African-Americans and other minorities, who are
      underrepresented in the National Marrow Donor Program, have benefited particularly from this.
      In infants and young children cord blood transplantation appears to be as effective as bone
      marrow transplantation. In older children, adolescents and adults, however, cord blood
      transplantation has not been as effective, primarily because most cord blood units provide an
      insufficient number of cells to ensure prompt and reliable engraftment ("taking" of the
      transplanted cells in the recipient's bone marrow).
