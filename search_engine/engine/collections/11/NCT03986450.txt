      stay in various kinds of surgical procedures. This study aimed to investigate whether ERAS
      protocol has an impact on healthcare costs in patients undergoing a laparoscopic
      hysterectomy. Patients scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy will be allocated to one of
      the study groups: ERAS group patients will receive ERAS protocol during the perioperative
      period; Conventional care groups will undergo standard abdominal hysterectomy without the
      implementation of ERAS protocol. The groups will be compared with respect to the length of
      hospital stay, rehospitalizations, and healthcare costs.
