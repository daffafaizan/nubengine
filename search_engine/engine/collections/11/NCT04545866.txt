    
      From a study of 9575 extremely preterm (22-28 weeks gestational age and 401-1500g birth
      weight) infants born between 2003 and 2007 and enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver
      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network
      (NRN), it is anticipated that 93% of extremely preterm infants will develop respiratory
      distress syndrome, 68% will develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), 16% will develop severe
      intraventricular hemorrhage, and 36% will develop late-onset sepsis (PMID: 20732945).
      Furthermore, in 2014 20% of the infants enrolled in the NRN Generic Database (GDB) died (8%
      by less than 12 hours, 12% between 12 hours and 120 days, and 1% after 120 days) and 47% of
      infants who survived to 36 weeks' post-menstrual age (PMA) developed physiologic BPD (NRN GDB
      data). BPD is therefore one of the most common morbidities in extremely preterm infants.
      Death is a competing outcome for BPD, as infants who die before ascertainment of BPD at 36
      weeks' PMA cannot be diagnosed with BPD even though they may have been at the highest risk.
      As children get older, BPD has been shown to be associated with worse cognitive outcomes in
      school age and with abnormal pulmonary function in adolescence and adulthood (PMID: 14595077;
      15499947; 2247118).

      Recent randomized trials have indicated a lower incidence of BPD/death with the use of a
      combination of budesonide with surfactant (budesonide + surfactant) compared to surfactant
      alone when administered soon after birth. Therefore, after obtaining informed consent and
      confirming eligibility for the trial, infants are randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to
      either the budesonide + surfactant arm or the surfactant alone arm within 48 hours of birth.
