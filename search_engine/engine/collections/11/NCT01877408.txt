      transmission. Currently, the most widely used VMMC technique in South Africa is open surgical
      circumcision.

      According to the Framework for Clinical Evaluation of Devices for Adult Male Circumcision
      (WHO, 2011): "WHO and other health authorities wish to identify one or more devices that (a)
      would make the VMMC safer, easier, and quicker; (b) would have more rapid healing than
      current methods and/or might entail less risk of HIV transmission in the post-operative
      period; (c) could be performed safely by health-care providers with a minimal level of
      training; and (d) would be cost-effective compared to standard surgical methods for male
      circumcision scale up."

      This randomized controlled trial compares the open surgical technique to an alternative
      minimally-invasive technique using a disposable Unicirc device with tissue adhesive. The
      investigators postulate that VMMC using the Unicirc device meets WHO criteria for the ideal
      method to scale up: it is an easier technique to learn and perform, requires less
      intraoperative time, is safer for both surgeons and patients, heals quicker, and is more cost
      effective than other currently available techniques. The disposable nature of the device is
      an immense advantage as it eliminates the need to sterilize and can therefore be used in
      resource-limited settings. It also reduces the chances of infection caused by contaminated
      instruments.

      The study will randomly assign participants to one of two groups:

        -  Unicirc device with tissue adhesive: 100 men

        -  Open surgical circumcision: 50 men

      The participants will be evaluated during follow-up visits at 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28
      days after surgery.
