      been developed in collaboration with the patient advocacy group Melanoma UK.

      Eligible participants install a study app on their smartphone or tablet. Researchers access
      aggregated, anonymised data via a cloud-based research portal.

      The platform provides benefits to participants, which it is hoped will encourage persistence
      with data submission; these include options to upload electronic documents such as scans, and
      access an online melanoma community.

      The aggregated data are available in close to real time via "dashboards" and can be analysed
      according to a number of pre-set criteria (e.g. disease stage, age, geographic location).

      State-of-the-art technologies and security policies are used in the platform to ensure
      industry-standard data storage and privacy for all users. Participants' personally
      identifiable information will remain confidential at all times, and researchers will not be
      able to identify individuals.
