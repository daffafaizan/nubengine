        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine in
           patients with recently diagnosed, gemcitabine-naive, locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic carcinoma or other potentially responsive solid tumor.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective antitumor response rate and response duration in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression and duration of overall survival in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-7 and oral erlotinib once
      daily beginning on day 3 of week 1 and continuing for 8 weeks (course 1). Patients receive
      subsequent courses of therapy comprising gemcitabine once weekly for 3 weeks and erlotinib
      once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional
      patients are accrued and treated at the MTD as above.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months.
