    
      Challenged by public opinion, peers and the Congressional Budget Office, a number of
      specialty societies have recently begun to develop "Top Five" lists of relatively expensive
      procedures that do not provide meaningful benefit to at least some categories of patients for
      whom they are commonly ordered. The Choosing Wisely® campaign is the most visible example.
      The extent to which the development of these lists has influenced the behavior of physicians
      or patients, however, remains unknown.

      In this study, investigators partner with the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality
      (WCHQ), a statewide consortium of hospitals, medical practices and health systems, to examine
      the effectiveness of two organizational interventions in reducing unproven or ineffective
      breast cancer care. Two interventions will be tested: (a) A "basic" public reporting
      intervention which summarizes on a public website practice-level statistics regarding use of
      targeted ineffective or unproven interventions for breast cancer and (ii) an "enhanced"
      intervention, augmenting public reporting with a smart phone-based application (App) that
      gives providers just-in-time information, decision-making tools, and personalized patient
      education materials that support reductions in the use of breast cancer interventions
      targeted based upon Choosing Wisely® or national oncology society guidelines. Specifically,
      the aims are: (1) To examine whether basic public reporting reduces use of targeted breast
      cancer practices among a contemporary cohort of patients with incident breast cancer in the
      intervention state relative to usual care in comparison states, using Marketscan and Medicare
      claims data while adjusting for possible confounders and temporal trends; (2) To examine the
      effectiveness of the enhanced intervention relative to the basic intervention; and (3) To
      simulate cost savings forthcoming from nationwide implementation of both interventions
      (relative to each other and to usual care) and to describe the implications of these findings
      for reimbursement policy and program initiatives.

      The results will provide rigorous evidence regarding the effectiveness of a unique all-payer,
      all-age public reporting system for influencing provider behavior that may be easily
      exportable to other states. Findings will be further relevant to the ACO environment, which
      is expected to provide financial disincentives for providing ineffective or unproven care.
