      subjects will begin JZP-258 treatment at the beginning of this period and continue through
      Week 12. They will be treated with JZP-258 alone for the final two weeks of this 12-week
      period. Once the JZP-258 dose has been optimized per the Investigator's judgment, these
      subjects may enter the 2-week Stable-Dose Period with that dose. Subjects are eligible to
      enter the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period if the dose of JZP-258 remains unchanged
      during the Stable-Dose Period and, in the judgment of the Investigator, no clinically
      significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant adverse events due to
      JZP-258 treatment have occurred. Subjects will return for a Safety Follow-up visit 2 weeks
      after the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period. Subjects who complete the double-blind
      treatment period during the Main Study are eligible to enter a 24-week Open-Label Extension.
      During this period subjects will receive open label JZP-258. Subjects will return for a
      Safety Follow-up visit 2 weeks after the Open-Label Extension Period.
