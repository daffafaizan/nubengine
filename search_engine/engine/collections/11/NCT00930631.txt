      who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects will receive 100
      (±20) μCi of [3H] BMS747158. Subjects will undergo blood, urine, and fecal collections to
      evaluate [3H] activity for a minimum of 7 days post-dose. Safety will be assessed by
      monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory
      tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).This Phase I, nonrandomized, open-label study will
