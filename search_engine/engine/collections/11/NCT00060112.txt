      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of oblimersen and
      gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumor or lymphoma.

      II. Determine the effect of oblimersen on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      gemcitabine in these patients.

      III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-5 and gemcitabine IV over 2-3 hours on
      day 5. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oblimersen and gemcitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 additional
      patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-8
      months.
