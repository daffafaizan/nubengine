    
      Patients will be followed for 2 years, with molecular monitoring, every month in the first
      year and then every 2 months. Imatinib will be restarted if the major molecular response
      (RM3log) is lost during the study or if the subject withdraw the informed consenting.

      The primary objective is to measure the number of subject that sustain the major molecular
      response (RM3log or BCR-ABL level below 0.1%) after 2 years of follow-up.

      BCR: breakpoint cluster region

      ABL: abelson murine leukemia

      RM3log: major molecular response, BCR-ABL level below 0.1% (IS)
