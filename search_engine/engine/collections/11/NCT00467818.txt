      therapy for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to a new population, that of children and
      adolescents with autism. It will analyze the possible relationship between dosage of omega 3
      fatty acids and treatment outcomes. Finally, it will attempt to identify which specific
      subgroups of subjects will respond to this intervention, which components and associated
      features are most responsive and whether this impacts subjects' quality of life. The data
      generated by this study is intended to support the rationale for a full scale, large
      multi-site clinical trial.
