    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, international, randomized controlled, post-market trial.

      The primary objectives of the trial are to demonstrate clinical non-inferiority and
      hemodynamic superiority of the Evolut PRO/PRO+ System when compared to subjects treated with
      the SAPIEN 3/3 Ultra System at 12 months post-procedure.

      Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive TAVR with either a Medtronic SE
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve (TAV) or an Edwards BE Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV). Data will
      be collected at pre- and post-procedure, at discharge, at 30 days, and once a year until the
      5-year follow-up is completed.
