    
      An implementation study- a prospective cohort study with pre- and post-intervention by
      retrieving economic and therapeutic outcome data from MHS databases. The intervention group
      will be the Central District of MHS, among 220 primary care practitioners (100 Physicians and
      120 physiotherapists) and their patients (n=7,000) who suffer from back pain and receive
      treatment. We will investigate the relationship between the care received and outcomes in
      terms of healthcare utilization, costs, and patient-relevant outcomes.
