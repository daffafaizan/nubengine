    
      This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study of
      novel HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor tucatinib in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor
      palbociclib and aromatase inhibitor letrozole in subjects with HR+/HER2+ locally advanced
      unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll post-menopausal women and
      premenopausal women if on treatment with or willing to be treated with standard ovarian
      suppression. The phase Ib part of the study will determine safety and tolerability of the
      combination of tucatinib, palbociclib and letrozole to confirm that current RP2D of tucatinib
      and FDA approved dosing of palbociclib remains the same in the triplet combination. The dose
      of letrozole will be constant through the study period. Once the safety of the combination is
      established, we will move to the phase II part of the study in the expansion cohort of
      subjects at RP2D for the purpose of assessing efficacy while further refining assessment of
      safety of the combination treatment.
