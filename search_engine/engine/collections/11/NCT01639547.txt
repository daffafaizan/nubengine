      However, the adverse effects and sufferings are lots. Response-guided, personalized treatment
      is current principle. In patients of CHC, GT1 PR treatment for 24 weeks is established in
      rapid virologic responders (RVR) who have low viral load before treatment. As to patients
      with RVR but high viral load (HVL), the treatment duration is 48 weeks that is the same as
      patients with complete early virologic response (cEVR). Is a shorter duration of treatment
      feasible for those with a good virokinetic response? The ideal treatment duration for
      patients of chronic hepatitis C, GT-1, high viral load with RVR has had no enough data yet.
      Is it really necessary to double the treatment duration (48 weeks) for patients of chronic
      hepatitis C, GT-1, high viral load with RVR? Is 36-week adequate for them? A multicenter
      trial of INDIV-2 was presented at EASL 2010. They treated CHC patients of na√Øve GT1 HVL and
      RVR for 30 weeks and got similarly good SVR as those treated for 48 weeks (85% vs. 82%).

      Therefore, investigators design a randomized controlled study to investigate the SVR rates
      between treatment for 36 weeks and for 48 weeks in patients of CHC, GT1, HVL and RVR.
