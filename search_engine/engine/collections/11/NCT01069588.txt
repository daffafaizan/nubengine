      Spindler's ACL reconstructed patients in order to examine long term healing of two types of
      bioabsorbable screw. We will use a 2-4 yr time point to look at patient reported symptoms of
      pain and swelling from the surveys and use the x-rays and MRIs to look at absorption of the
      screw, healing of the graft, and body reactions to the screw.
