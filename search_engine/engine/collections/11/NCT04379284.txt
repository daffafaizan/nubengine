      and outcomes of a COVID19 positive pregnancy, and how the virus can be passed from mother to
      infant in the pregnant population at Mayo Clinic Rochester MN. Assessments will include the
      viral detection and viral load in maternal and fetal specimens collected from COVID19
      positive mother-baby dyads, presence of maternal and fetal inflammatory markers in blood and
      tissues, anti-COVID IgG and IgM in maternal and neonatal blood, viral load and viral antigens
      in maternal and fetal specimens. placental gross and histopathologic changes in COVID19
      infected mothers, stratified by gestational age and disease severity, compared to control
      samples.
