    
      Ragweed MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for
      patients with proven type I hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen. MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A),
      a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota, is
      included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the
      product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to a TH1-like profile.

      The ragweed pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient,
      an allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities is not seen.

      The purpose of this study is to assess residual allergenicity of the modified ragweed pollen
      in Ragweed MATA MPL using skin prick testing.
