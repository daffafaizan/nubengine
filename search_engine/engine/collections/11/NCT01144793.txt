      of nine biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP), protein C, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10,
      IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and intercellular adhesion
      molecule-1] using a multiplex ELISA array platform every 6-8 hours in patients undergoing
      myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.
