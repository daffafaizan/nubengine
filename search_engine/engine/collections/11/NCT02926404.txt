      sagittal spinal realignment in adult spinal deformity is achieved in only 38% of patients
      which reflects an inadequacy of the approach currently used.

      Patient specific rods were created by Medicrea to address this gap and support surgeons in
      achieving what they planned to perform in terms of spinal correction based on preoperative
      X-rays analyses.

      Beside to help surgeons in planning and to improve performance, the avoidance of manual
      bending is supposed to save time during surgery and to limit notches which should then reduce
      rod fractures responsible for surgical revisions.

      A European register-like study has been set-up to assess radiological performance, clinical
      outcomes and revision rate following implantation of patient-specific rods in adult spinal
      deformities
