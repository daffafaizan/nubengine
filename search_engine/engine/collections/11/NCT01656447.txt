    
      What will be asked of you:

        -  Completion of 2 health questionnaires

        -  Donation of research bloods. This is optional, but encouraged (if possible).

        -  We also encourage patients who come for initial visits to return so follow-up data can
           be collected.

      Benefits to Patients:

        -  The HSS Scleroderma Registry gives patients the opportunity to participate in
           observational research with the goal of improving the lives of patients in the future.

        -  By donating research bloods and providing clinical information, patients will help
           generate new knowledge about Scleroderma that can guide the treatment and care of
           patients afflicted with this rare disease.

        -  Patients will also receive a comprehensive, medical evaluation from an HSS physician who
           specializes in treating Scleroderma. He or she will provide guidance on treatment
           options and recommendations for current or upcoming clinical trials.

        -  Physicians will also make patients aware of the resources available to them, including
           support groups and educational programs.
