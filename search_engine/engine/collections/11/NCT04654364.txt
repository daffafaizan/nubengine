    
      This registry is designed as multicenter observational cohort of patients with lung cancer.
      Patient medical, testing and treatment information will be obtained through extraction of
      data from existing patient medical charts. Longitudinal follow-up data, including survival
      and tumor progression, will also be extracted from patient medical charts. This patient
      follow-up data will be obtained until patient death or loss to follow-up.

      For documentation in the registry, no further diagnostic or therapeutic measures are required
      than those already necessary in general. Participation in the registry must not interfere
      with treatment routines. Only routine data, which has already been recorded in the patient's
      medical chart, is transferred to the electronic Case Report Forms. To maintain patient
      confidentiality, each patient will be assigned a unique patient identifying number upon
      enrollment; this number will accompany the patient's medical and other registry information
      throughout the lifetime of the registry.

      A written consent must be obtained prior to the input of data. No informed consent is
      required from deceased patients.

      Data will be collected from all sites willing to participate.
