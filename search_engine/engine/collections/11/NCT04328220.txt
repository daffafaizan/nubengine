      ultrasound examination of the patient by the physician in charge, has been increasing in
      paediatric patients for the investigation of pulmonary, pleural and diaphragmatic disease,
      following its use in adult patients, in whom the technique has been developing for more than
      a decade, and whose ultrasound semiotics can be safely extrapolated to the paediatric age
      group. The unossified costal cartilage and sternum and thinner adipose subcutaneous tissue in
      children provide ideal acoustic windows.

      This study aims to compare the use of bedside lung US to portable chest X-ray regarding
      sensitivity, specificity, safety and accuracy in identifying the etiology of respiratory
      distress among children admitted to the PICU.
