    
      This is a phase 2a, proof-of-concept, 26-week, double-blind, multicenter, randomized,
      parallel group, placebo-controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with
      SUVN-502 to placebo treatment in subjects with moderate Alzheimer's disease receiving
      donepezil HCl (10 mg qd) and either memantine HCl (10 mg twice daily [bid]) or Namenda XR®
      (Extended Release, 28 mg qd) or the combination therapy, Namzaric™

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a serotonin receptor
      subtype 6 (5-HT6) antagonist, SUVN-502, compared to placebo, as adjunct treatment in subjects
      with moderate Alzheimer's disease (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score of 12 to 20)
      currently treated with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil hydrochloride (HCl), and
      the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist, memantine HCl. Efficacy will be assessed by
      the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale for Cognitive Behavior (ADAScog-11) after 26
      weeks of treatment.
