      or two months after randomization, whichever occurred first. During a migraine headache,
      subjects rated their baseline headache pain severity in a Migraine Study Diary using a
      4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) and applied the study patch only
      if their score was 2 or 3 (i.e., qualifying migraine headache). In addition to headache pain
      severity, subjects also recorded the presence or absence of aura, nausea, phonophobia, and
      photophobia, as well as the location of their headache (unilateral or bilateral) and whether
      their headache increased with movement.
