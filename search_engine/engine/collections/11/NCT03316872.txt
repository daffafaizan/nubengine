      every 21 days, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

      Stereotactic radiotherapy will commence on day 2 of the first cycle of pembrolizumab, and
      will be delivered in 5 fractions over 8-15 days in accordance with institutional protocol.

      Subjects will be re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan,
      confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4-8 weeks following initial documentation of
      objective response.

      Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using both RECIST 1.1and (iRECIST)
      guideline (Seymor 2017).
