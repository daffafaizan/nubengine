      following Chiropractic Manipulative Therapy (CMT) using a randomized controlled trial in
      members of SFQ or SOAR. This population is faced with simultaneous physiological and
      cognitive demands. The ability to give an accurate and appropriate motor response in a short
      time is required for successful completion of the types of missions they are expected to
      undertake.

      It is possible that chiropractic care can improve performance in reaction and response times
      in populations that have low back pain and in populations that are asymptomatic. One possible
      theory for improvement, even in asymptomatic persons, is that they may have experienced an
      insult or stress to the body which is subclinical but alters their ability to function in an
      optimal manner. Thus a person may be asymptomatic and able to accomplish many activities in a
      normal manner, but when stressed to the limits of maximum capability, the effects of
      subclinical abnormalities may cause that person to function at a less than optimal level. If
      CMT is able to restore normal, more efficient mechanisms of functioning, it is therefore
      possible that the performance of challenging tasks could be improved.
