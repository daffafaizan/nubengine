      patients have an increased risk of bleeding and the clinical symptoms are petechia,
      ecchymosis, organ hemorrhage and even life-threatening bleeding. The mortality rate in ITP is
      increased approximately 60% compared with age- and sex matched comparisons, bleeding is one
      of the leading causes of death, thus treating and preventing bleeding is particularly
      important for those patients. In most cases, platelet count is negatively correlated with the
      severity of bleeding. Correcting low platelets is the main measure to prevent bleeding in
      patients with ITP. Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO), a full-length glycated TPO, is a
      recombinant form of c-Mpl ligand that competes with endogenous TPO for binding to TPO
      receptors (TPO-R, c-Mp0), many clinical trials have shown that rhTPO can efficiently and
      safely stimulate platelet production, increase peripheral blood platelet count. The State
      Food and Drug Administration approved the drug as the second-line treatment for patients with
      ITP in 2005. Eltrombopag is an oral, synthetic non-peptide small molecule human
      thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved by the US FDA in November 2008 for the treatment of
      patients with chronic ITP, which were inefficiently by use of glucocorticoids, immunoglobulin
      or splenectomy. However, pharmacokinetic study of eltrombopag showed that Asians have twice
      the drug exposure rate than non-Asians, so eltrombopag may have different effects in
      different populations. Therefore, this trial will compare the efficacy and safety of
      intravenous rhTPO or oral use of eltrombopag after 14 days of treatment in Chinese ITP
      patients.
