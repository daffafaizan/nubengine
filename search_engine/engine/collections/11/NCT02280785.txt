      rates. Overall disease control rates will be calculated as the percent of patients that have
      confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) by
      radiographic response including CT and/or PET scans. We assume a P0 as 20%, and designate a
      target rate (P1) as 40%. Under the error probabilities (α=0.05, β=0.20), eighteen patients
      will be enrolled in the first stage. If overall disease control rate is ≤ 4/18 in the first
      stage, this study will be stopped. If not, this study will recruit patients up to 33
      considering 20% of drop out rate.

      Intent-to-treat analysis will be applied to all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.
      Response rate will be analyzed based on the response criteria according to Cheson 2007
      (Cheson BD, et al. J Clin Oncol 2007; 25 (5):579-586), and data related to overall response
      rate will be analyzed by statistical analysis including Chi test to evaluate predictive
      factors for response to study drug.

      Overall rate of disease control : CR, PR and SD Progression-free survival : Time between the
      date of treatment start and the date of death due to any cause or date of disease progression
      (Up to 36months) Data related to survival rate for all patients will be analyzed based on
      log-rank test by the Kaplan-Meier method.
