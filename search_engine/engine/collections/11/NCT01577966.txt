      administered sulfasalazine has on glutamate levels as measured by MRS and on epileptiform
      spiking as measured by simultaneous MEG/EEG. The intent of the dose escalation is to
      determine an Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) based on changes in tumor glutamate levels. The
      OBD is defined as the dose that has the maximal reduction in tumor glutamate levels after
      normalization to uninvolved brain.
