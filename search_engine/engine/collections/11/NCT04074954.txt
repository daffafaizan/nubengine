      such as exposure to ultra violet light and diet. Additionally, metabolic disorders, such as
      diabetes can lead to an earlier development of cataracts. As cataracts develop, a patient's
      vision can be affected. Reduced vision can limit activities of daily living and may even
      reduce a patient's mobility. When this occurs, cataract surgery should be considered to help
      restore a patient's vision. With the obesity and diabetic epidemic, proper diet and exercise
      is a major health initiative to control these diseases. If a patient's mobility is reduced as
      a result of poor vision - their ability to achieve adequate daily physical activity may also
      be effected. It is thought that improvement in vision may increase their activity levels and
      help combat these health issues. This study will investigate the activity level of patients
      before and after undergoing cataract surgery to determine how improved vision quality from
      removal of the natural lens inside the eye and replacement with an artificial intraocular
      lens effects their activity level.
