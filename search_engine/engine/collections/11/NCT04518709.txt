      postoperative residual lesions (49% of the total cases). Residual lesions after mitral valve
      repair are associated with morbidity and complications in the form of hemolysis and could
      affect the postoperative reverse remodeling process. Surgery techniques for mitral valve
      repair in children have fewer choices than adult patients because of the smaller and thinner
      valve structure. Besides, the weakness of the mitral valve repair technique that often occurs
      in large left ventricles with severe mitral regurgitation, after repairing with ring
      annuloplasty, there is usually a mild residual regurgitation due to posterior mitral leaflet
      that tends to become restrictive due to being attracted by the left ventricular wall that
      remains big. No technique has been found to overcome the problem of mitral regurgitation
      residuals that occur postoperatively.

      Therefore, by analyzing postoperative mitral valve structural abnormalities with conventional
      techniques, an additional posterior mitral valve elevation technique was designed. The
      posterior annulus elevation technique is a technique that is carried by lifting the posterior
      mitral annulus towards the cranial so that the posterior mitral leaflet can meet perfectly
      with the anterior mitral leaflet indicated by a larger coaptation area. This technique can be
      applied after repair with conventional techniques done optimally to reduce the possibility of
      postoperative residual lesions.

      The hypothesis in this study is that pediatric patients with mitral regurgitation who undergo
      mitral valve repair surgery with posterior annulus elevation techniques can reduce residual
      mitral regurgitation, improve clinical and metabolic outcomes of postoperative heart failure,
      and reduce the risk of postoperative hemolysis.
