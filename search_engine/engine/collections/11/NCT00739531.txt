    
      A non-randomized, prospective study of up to 150 subjects with asthma. Patients will perform
      eNO testing with the Apieron INSIGHT(tm) eNO system and the NIOX eNO system at the
      physician's office/clinic after a short demonstration and training by a healthcare
      professional trained in the use of the devices. Exhaled NO testing involves inhaling to lung
      capacity, and then performing a controlled exhalation into a mouthpiece connected to each of
      the Apieron INSIGHT(tm) and NIOX systems. Patients will perform an eNO measurement with the
      Apieron INSIGHT(tm) system and with the FDA cleared NIOX system for the accuracy portion of
      the study. Patients will perform 2 sequential eNO measurements on each system for the
      precision part of the study. Subjects that measure eNO values over 100 ppb will be asked to
      repeat 2 sequential eNO measurements on each system.
