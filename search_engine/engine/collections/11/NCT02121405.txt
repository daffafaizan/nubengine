      for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. However, the necessity of radiotherapy has
      been questioned for a long time especially for patients with enough circumferential margins.
      Moreover, indiscriminate radiotherapy will result Irreversible ovarian dysfunction for
      female. In the past decade, there were two major progresses for colorectal cancer. Firstly,
      oxaliplatin with fluorouracil has become the standard adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced
      colon cancer. Oxaliplatin improved the survival of colon cancer patients than single
      fluorouracil. Our experience showed that oxaliplatin with fluorouracil could improve the
      prognosis of rectal cancer without radiotherapy. It has been proven that oxaliplatin should
      not add to radiotherapy for rectal cancer. However, whether oxaliplatin can replace
      radiotherapy for certain rectal cancer patients is still unknown. Secondly, Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been proven that can predict the circumferential margin status
      for rectal cancer. Now, preoperative MRI scan can recognize the rectal cancer patients with
      low recurrence risk. The radiotherapy may be omitted to the patients with low recurrence
      risk. This study is a randomized controlled trial to compare the 3-year disease-free survival
      (DFS) differences of group of experiment (the patients receive primary surgery followed
      selective radiochemotherapy) and group of control (the patients receive indiscriminate
      preoperative radiochemotherapy followed surgery) for locally advanced rectal cancer with
      negative MRI circumferential margin.
