      there is no pharmacokinetic data to guide dosing of ertapenem in postpartum women. The
      physiologic changes of the postpartum period make it likely that this special population
      requires dosing modification to achieve desired therapeutic targets. The objective of this
      study is to obtain a detailed knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of ertapenem during the
      postpartum period that will result in improved guidelines on maternal dosing and neonatal
      exposure. This is a prospective, open-label, single center, pharmacokinetic study of
      ertapenem in women diagnosed with postpartum endometritis. Subjects will include up to 24
      women receiving treatment for a diagnosis of postpartum endometritis with ertapenem in the
      Duke University Hospital Labor & Delivery Unit. Each patient will participate in the study
      for approximately 7 days, though the total study duration is expected to be approximately 12
      months. Descriptive statistics for the subjects will be calculated. The appropriate
      non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed, including AUC24, AUCss, Cmax,
      CL, Vss, t1/2. All subjects who receive one dose of study drug will be followed for safety,
      with planned internal review of safety data following the completion of 12 patients. Nursing
      infants of study subjects will also be followed for safety due to the potential for exposure
      to study drug through breastmilk.
