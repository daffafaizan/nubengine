interpretation within the metaphoranalytic investigation of the use of the metaphor was first given impetusby ella freeman sharpe (1950), who explored the symbolicmeaning of particular metaphoric phrases with reference to the bodyand libidinal needs.  currently, interest has become focused upon theuse of the metaphor as a self-conscious, rational therapeutic techniqueof communication, of particular value with those patients who havereached "the borderline of sanity".  ekstein (1961) and ekstein andwallerstein (1957) have emphasized that the use of the metaphorshould be regarded as an essential technique for gradually establishingcommunication and initial insight with borderline and schizophrenicpatients but that it must not be regarded as a treatment techniquein itself.  it is but a preliminary approximation to the final therapeuticact, which ultimately will consist of a classical interpretationat the level of the secondary process.  the use of the metaphor derivesits primary value from maintaining contact with patients who areconstantly in danger of being inundated by a break-through of primary-process material.
