      vertebra (SBAC-L1) and fractal analysis, markers of bone fragility on computed tomography
      (CT), compared to bone mineral density (BMD) to detect vertebral fractures in rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA).

      Patient and methods: Rheumatoid arthritis patients followed from 2009 to 2019 in Nancy
      University hospital who met the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA and examined using
      thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT (TAP-CT) and BMD (spine, hip) within a period of up to 2 years
      were included. Scanographic bone attenuation coefficient and fractal dimension of the first
      lumbar vertebra (SBAC-L1, FD-L1) were measured on CT. Vertebral fractures of the
      thoracolumbar spine were evaluated on CT according to an adaptation of Genant's scoring
      method.

      Demographic characteristics (age, sex, smoking), clinical data (disease duration, DAS-28),
      biological data (C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, ACPA) and treatments (n proton pump inhibitor,
      corticosteroid, TNF-inhibitors (TNFi) and others biologics, calcium, vitamin D,
      antiresorptive agents) were collected from the complete medical record. Univariate and
      multivariate analysis were performed to determine if these variables were associated or not
      with bone fragility (vertebral fracture, SBAC-L1, FD-L1).

      We evaluated the performance and diagnostic complementarity as well as optimal diagnostic
      thresholds of SBAC-L1, FD-L1 and BMD (gold standard) to detect vertebral fractures in these
      patients at risk of osteoporosis.

      Intra and inter-readers reproducibilities of the scanographic screening methods (SBAC-L1,
      FD-L1) were also studied.
