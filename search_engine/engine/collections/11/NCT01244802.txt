      received yellow fever vaccine. The project is designed to study the magnitude and persistence
      of both humoral, and cell-mediated immune memory generated post-vaccination. Since aging has
      an effect on the immune system (eg. decreased thymic output, replacement of hematopoietic
      cells in the bone marrow with adipocytes), the researchers will analyze the young adults
      (aged 18-45 years) and the older vaccinees (55 years or older) in separate groups.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        -  Determine the phenotypic and functional characterization of memory T cell responses to
           yellow fever vaccination

        -  Determine neutralizing antibody titer after yellow fever vaccination
