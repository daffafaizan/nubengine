    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the effects of trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) on topoisomerase 1 cleavable
      complex (Top1cc) formation in biopsy specimens from patients with HER2-expressing advanced
      solid tumors, at early and late post-treatment time points, thereby establishing the degree
      and duration of DS-8201 target engagement.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess any associations between serum concentrations of DS-8201a and the effects of
      DS-8201a on Top1cc formation in tumor biopsy specimens.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of DS-8201a administered intravenously every 3
      weeks, in 21-day cycles, at a dose of 5.4 mg/kg.

      III. To determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR])
      for patients administered intravenously with DS-8201a every 3 weeks, in 21-day cycles, at a
      dose of 5.4 mg/kg.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of DS-8201a on CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in tumor,
      tumor PD-L1 and HER2 expression, and DDR signaling (gamma H2AX, RAD51, and phosphorylated
      [p]NBS1) in biopsy specimens.

      II. To examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) that may be associated
      with DS-8201a response or resistance.

      III. To examine any associations between baseline tumor HER2 amplification or HER2 expression
      level and response to DS-8201a.

      IV. To evaluate the effects of DS-8201a on tumor levels of HER2 and DDR-associated proteins.

      V. To examine any tumor genomic alterations that may be associated with resistance to
      DS-8201a.

      VI. To evaluate anti-drug antibodies following administration of DS-8201a.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 40 days.
