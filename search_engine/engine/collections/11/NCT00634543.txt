      told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded"), multi-center and
      randomized (study drug is assigned by chance) study to compare the effectiveness and safety
      of tramadol HCl 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg with gabapentin in participants with diabetic
      neuropathy. The study will consist of 4 periods: Screening period (up to Day -14),
      Randomization period (Day 1), Dosage adjustment period (Day 15) and Maintenance period (Day
      43). The participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups: tramadol HCl
      37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg or gabapentin. Tramadol Hcl/acetaminophen group will receive 1
      tablet for 3 days, then 1 tablet twice daily for 4 days followed by 1 tablet thrice daily for
      next 7 days. If there is no pain relief, the dosage can be increased up to 8 tablets per day
      for Day 15 to 28, and then the increased dosage will be maintained for Day 29 to 42.
      Gabapentin group will receive 300 mg on Day 1, 300 mg twice daily on Day 2, and 300 mg thrice
      daily for Day 3 to 7. Then for Day 8 to 14, participants will receive 300 mg in the morning,
      300 mg in the midday and 600 mg in the evening. If there is no pain relief, gabapentin can be
      increased up to 3600 mg per day for Day 15 to 28, and then the increased dosage will be
      maintained for Day 29 to 42. Primarily, efficacy will be evaluated by pain intensity using
      numeric rating scale (NRS). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
