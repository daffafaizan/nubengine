      total body surface area (TBSA) burned (no more than 40% vs more than 40%).

      Patients receive standard inpatient burn care. During hospitalization, patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms:

      Arm I: Patients receive testosterone intramuscularly (IM) weekly for 2-3 weeks during
      hospitalization.

      Arm II: Patients receive standard care only during hospitalization.

      After hospital discharge, patients with burns covering no more than 40% of TBSA are
      randomized to arm III, IV, or V, whereas patients with burns covering more than 40% of TBSA
      are randomized to arm III or V.

      Arm III: Patients receive testosterone IM every 2 weeks for 2 months.

      Arm IV: Patients receive testosterone as in arm III. Patients perform progressive resistance
      (weight lifting) exercises 3 times a week for 2 months concurrently with testosterone
      therapy.

      Arm V.: Patients receive standard convalescence care only.
