      nature of persistent HIV infection in patients successfully treated with potent
      antiretroviral therapy and to develop strategies to promote the clearance of these reservoirs
      or at least long-term suppression of these reservoirs. If latently infected cells are able to
      persist for a long period (despite effective suppression of de novo infection) primarily
      because immune clearance is not being adequately stimulated by viral antigen, then
      HIV-specific immunization is a reasonable strategy to enhance the clearance of these cells.
      Stimulating effective HIV-specific cellular immune responses at a time when plasma viremia is
      maximally suppressed also may contribute to the long-term containment of HIV replication on
      potent antiretroviral therapy. A second component to be evaluated in this trial is whether
      broad, cyclical activation of T cells with IL-2 will increase the activation of HIV proviral
      gene expression and thereby render target cells susceptible to immune-mediated clearance.
      This pathogenesis-based clinical trial will explore the potential for these novel treatment
      strategies (HIV-specific immunization and IL-2, alone and in combination) to complement the
      effects of potent antiretroviral therapy by promoting more effective immunologic control of
      HIV-1 replication.

      This study is divided into 3 steps.

      STEP I: Patients continue to receive their stable potent antiretroviral therapy and are
      randomized to 1 of 4 arms:

      Arm A: Vaccine placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC]; Arm B: Canarypox HIV-specific
      immunogen [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC-HIV] (vCP1452); Arm C: 8-week cycles of IL-2 plus
      vaccine placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC]; Arm D: 8-week cycles of IL-2 plus
      canarypox HIV-specific immunogen [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: ALVAC-HIV] (vCP1452).

      Patients receive vaccine (or vaccine placebo) injections at Weeks 0, 8, 16, 24, and 48. IL-2
      injections are synchronized with vaccine injections. IL-2 is given open-label while vCP1452
      is double-blinded. Patients must be on Step I for a minimum of 51 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT
      08/23/01: prior to entry into Step II].

      STEP II: Patients stop study medications and interrupt potent antiretroviral therapy for [AS
      PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: "6 to 16" has been replaced by the following text: a minimum of 12]
      weeks. Patients whose viral load during Step II remains [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: at or]
      below 5,000 copies/ml [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01: and whose CD4 count is 200 cells/mm3 or
      more] are encouraged to remain off antiretroviral medications and continue viral-load
      monitoring for up to an additional 10 weeks. These patients are followed [AS PER AMENDMENT
      08/23/01: "for up to 16 weeks" has been replaced by the following text: through Week 74] on
      Step II and must register to Step III only if their viral load increases to 50,000 copies/ml
      or greater, their CD4 count decreases to below 200 cells/mm3, or if their primary care
      physician recommends resuming antiretrovirals.

      STEP III: Patients resume their original potent antiretroviral therapy regimen for 6 to 10
      weeks and are monitored for a minimum of 6 weeks. If patients do not achieve a viral load
      below 50 copies/ml during those 6 weeks, they continue to be monitored for up to an
      additional 4 weeks until this degree of suppression is achieved with the same potent
      antiretroviral therapy regimen or another appropriate regimen.
