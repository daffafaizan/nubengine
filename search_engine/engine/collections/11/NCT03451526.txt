      patients with N2 non-small cell lung cancer enrolled from 2014 to 2017 who received radical
      resections of lung cancer and adjuvant chemotherapies will be included in the study and the
      study data on patient demographic/tumor biological characteristics and clinical treatment
      will be collected to evaluate compare effectiveness of radical resection of lung cancer plus
      adjuvant chemotherapies and perioperative chemotherapies after surgeries.
