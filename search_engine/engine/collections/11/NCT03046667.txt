      the small intestine." The relatively undigested β-glucans have the ability to increase
      satiety and stimulate digestion, ensuring regular bowel movements and relieve sluggish bowel
      movements, including constipation and constipation. β-glucans are fermented down in the large
      intestine, resulting in production of short-chain fatty acids which inhibit the biosynthesis
      of cholesterol, hence blood cholesterol levels are lowered (not the goal here). Subsequently,
      β-glucans may also affect blood pressure. As a direct result of the effects in the intestine,
      there will be an improvement in the quality of life for people with stomach upsets and maybe
      a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease.
