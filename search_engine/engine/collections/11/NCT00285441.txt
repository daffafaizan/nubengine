      TB than patients with normal immune functions. Especially two patient categories are at risk:
      HIV positives and patients receiving TNF-a blocking medication. Existing methods of diagnosis
      and surveillance of latent TB infection can not identify who will develop active TB and who
      can control the infection. There is a need for better understanding of TB specific immune
      functions,as we believe deficient TB specific immune reactions is a key in reactivation of
      latent TB infection.

      In this study we follow groups of latent TB infected patients with either rheumatoid
      arthritis or HIV. We follow the patients during treatment with TNF-a blocking medication,
      HAART treatment or prophylactic TB medication. Results are correlated to patients with active
      TB, latent TB and healthy controls.
