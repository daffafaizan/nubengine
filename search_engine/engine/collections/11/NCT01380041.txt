      treatment could allow better prognosis for the patients in the long term by reducing relapses
      rates and neurological palsy. However, individual prognostic biomarkers are still needed to
      adapt the treatment to a given patient. CSF is a strategic body fluid to explore in
      neurological diseases. In MS, it contains an elevated IgG index and/or oligoclonal bands
      reflecting the intrathecal synthesis of Igs around the brain. The levels of other
      inflammatory molecules such cytokines and metalloproteases are also known to be elevated in
      MS (GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-2, MMP9, TIMP-1, TNF-Î±, RANTES, MCP-1 and MIP-1). These
      molecules can now be easily measured by protein arrays.The aim of this study is to measure
      the level of 40 cytokines and 10 MMPs by means of protein arrays in the CSF from clinically
      definite MS (CDMS) patients, control patients and patients with a clinically isolated
      syndrome (CIS). The best MS markers will be determined using multiple ROC curves. Markers of
      rapid conversion to CDMS after a CIS will also be looked for.The best MS candidate biomarkers
      will be analyzed by ELISA in a new cohort of patients being recruited.
