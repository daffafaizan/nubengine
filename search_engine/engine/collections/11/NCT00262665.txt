      illness. Major depression contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. Available
      pharmacotherapies for major depression are suboptimal in terms of speed of onset, efficacy,
      and tolerability. Current medications for severe, chronic mood disorders are not based on
      pathophysiological models of illness, but rather are variation of monoaminergic-based
      therapies. Org 24448 represents a new treatment approach for depression, by potentiating the
      AMPA receptor subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors. This drug has been shown to have
      antidepressant features in preclinical models, as well as cognitive-enhancing qualities.
