      population. The disease results in penile curvature and significant psychosocial bother.
      Current preferred therapies for PD include repeated penile injections with bacterial enzymes
      and surgery. However, these therapies are expensive and in some cases result in permanent
      reductions in penile length and sensation. Penile traction therapy (PTT) is a relatively
      newer treatment which has been proposed as a treatment for PD with preliminary data
      suggesting a potential role. However, currently available PTT devices are primarily designed
      for penile lengthening and have many significant limitations including a requirement of use
      for 9 hours daily and significant difficulties in personal application. Given these
      limitations, a new penile traction device (RestoreXÂ® ) was created and funded through Mayo
      Ventures and was specifically designed to treat men with PD. The primary objective of the
      current study is to evaluate safety of the device using various dosing schedules, with
      secondary endpoints designed to assess efficacy and subjective outcomes. To accomplish the
      study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic with PD will be enrolled and will be randomized
      to utilize the device for varying amounts of time. Outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6, and 9
      months, and results are to be used with the intent to publish in a scientific journal.
