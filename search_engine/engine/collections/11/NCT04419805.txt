      Department and those currently awaiting treatment. Those that meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be invited to participate. After obtaining consent they will be
      allocated to receive one of the two interventions. The two interventions represent the
      currently available options for treatment of mild - moderate (1-6mm) anterior open bite in
      the Orthodontic Department and as such patients will be receiving routine treatment
      regardless of the arm they are randomised to. In order to assess the more effective
      intervention additional records will be taken during the treatment involving additional
      cephalometric radiographs, additional intra-oral scans or dental impressions (See later for
      details). Primary outcome is at the end of intrusion with TADs after 9-12 months, but
      participants will be followed until completion of treatment for the secondary outcome of
      stability of intrusion and overbite correction
