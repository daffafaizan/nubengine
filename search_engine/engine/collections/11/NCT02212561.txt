      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose of selinexor when given in combination with
      fludarabine and cytarabine.

      Selinexor will be given twice weekly (on days 1 and 3) and escalated or de-escalated based on
      tolerability. The rolling-6 design will be used for this study. Only cycle 1 of therapy will
      be used to evaluate the DLT. Two to six participants can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose
      level, dependent on 1) the number of participants enrolled at the current dose level, 2) the
      number of participants who have experienced DLT at the current dose level, and 3) the number
      of participants entered but with tolerability data pending at the current dose level. Accrual
      is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.

      Once the recommended Phase II dose is determined, additional patients will be enrolled, if
      necessary, so that at least 6 subjects are treated with the recommended Phase II dose to
      determine MTD. After the MTD is determined, 12 additional patients will be treated at this
      dose level for further evaluation of tolerability and response.
