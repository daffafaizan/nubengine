      United States. While the use of highly effective forms of birth control, such as the
      long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARC) have been found to be more effective in
      decreasing pregnancy rates than non-LARC methods of birth control, knowledge and use of LARC
      has been shown to be low in this vulnerable population. We are interested in better
      understanding the influence peers may have on contraceptive decision making among
      adolescents. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a peer mentoring
      intervention on adolescent contraceptive decision making, specifically with regard to
      increasing long-acting, reversible contraceptive uptake. The main study intervention will
      consist of randomization to usual contraceptive counseling versus peer-mentoring plus usual
      contraceptive counseling. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires will be used to better
      understand peer influence on contraceptive decision making, and to assess the peer
      mentor-teen intervention interaction.
