      been used to visualize the laryngeal response patterns during non-invasive therapeutic
      interventions, as during Mechanically Assisted Cough in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis. The examinations revealed that the larynx adducted during the application of
      positive pressures, which restricted the airflow and reduced the efficacy of the treatment.
      The higher treatment pressures resulted in ineffective interventions as a result of the
      adducted vocal cords obstructing flow. This knowledge has changed the treatment approach for
      patients with possible upper airway instability by individualizing the treatment pressures
      and flow due to laryngeal responses.

      TFL may cause slight discomfort when placing the laryngoscope. Diagnostic ultrasound is
      non-invasive easily applicable technique that has gained increasing popularity in diagnosing
      cardiopulmonary and laryngeal conditions during the recent times. The aim of the study is to
      investigate whether the diagnostic ultrasound of the larynx can be as accurate as TFL during
      Mechanically Assisted Cough and Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). The present study will
      include healthy participants. Hypothesis is that diagnostic ultrasound of larynx can provide
      clinical valuable information of the laryngeal response patterns during Mechanically Assisted
      Cough and NIV.

      The aims of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of diagnostic ultrasound imaging of the larynx, and to
           compare to the gold standard of TFL used during ongoing NIV and Mechanically Assisted
           Cough in healthy subjects.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of ultrasound imaging if the diaphragm during ongoing NIV
           and Mechanically Assisted Cough in healthy subjects.
