    
      This study was designed to evaluate the symptomatic effects of Coenzyme Q10 nanodispersed
      solution in middle-stage non-fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (Hoehn&Yahr II to
      III). The treatment phase includes three months period of 300 mg Coenzyme Q10 per day or
      placebo.

      The design of the study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind
      placebo-controlled protocol. The intervention includes 100 mg Coenzyme Q10 nanodispersion
      (Nanoquinon solution) tid or matched placebo for three months.

      Participating study centers include Neurological University Outpatient Clinics and
      Neurological Departments of Community-based Hospitals experienced with PD patients.

      The primary outcome measure was the combined Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
      Part II and III.

      The hypothesis of this study was that Coenzyme Q10 improves the energy status of the diseased
      dopaminergic neuronal cell type and thus producing more dopamine leading to an improvement of
      parkinsonian symptoms in PD patients.
