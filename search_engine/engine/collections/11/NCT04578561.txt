      controversial. The present study aimed to analyze the long-term results of prophylactic mesh
      used for preventing incisional hernia after emergency midline laparotomies.

      Methods. This study was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent an emergency
      midline laparotomy between January 2009 and July 2010 with a follow-up period of longer than
      2 years. Long-term outcomes and risk factors for the development of incisional hernias
      between patients who received a prophylactic reinforcement mesh (Group M) and suture (Group
      S) were compared.
