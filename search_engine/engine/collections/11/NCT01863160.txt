        -  Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of skin irritation score.

        -  Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of type and severity of
           reported adverse events.

        -  Tolerability evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream tolerability in terms of treatment
           compliance by the treated volunteers.

      The secondary endpoints of this study are:

        -  Systemic absorption PK profile.

        -  Dermal absorption PK profile (Optional).

      Subject safety will be assessed following treatment by ZEP-3 cream, using measurements of the
      following variables:

        -  Dermal reaction parameters

        -  Physical examination

        -  Vital Signs (HR, BP, RR, Body temperature)

        -  12 lead ECG data

        -  Laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistry, coagulation functions, urinalysis)

        -  Adverse events recording

        -  Change in concomitant medications
