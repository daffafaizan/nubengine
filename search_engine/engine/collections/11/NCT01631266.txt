      QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube, in combination with a double-blind randomized split-body safety
      assessment of C-Tb versus Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI.

      The trial is designed to address the fundamental issue that in the diagnosis of latent
      tuberculosis (TB) infection, no gold standard exists. Thus, no existing test for latent TB is
      100 % sensitive and specific - including the Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold
      In-Tube.

      This will be addressed by evaluating C-Tb positive response rates in 4 groups defined by
      their estimated risk of infection with MTb. The groups will consist of paediatric and adult
      participants selected as being either occasional or close contacts to an active pulmonary TB
      case. In addition a group of confirmed TB cases and a group of participants with no history
      of exposure to MTb will be included as control groups.

      50 participants in the negative control group will be tested with C-Tb alone in order to
      evaluate whether concomitant administration of C-Tb and Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI could
      conceivably result in larger or smaller areas of induration to one or both tests as a result
      of expanding the clone of sensitised T-cells i.e. since Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI includes
      among several other antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 and C-Tb also contains both these antigens.
