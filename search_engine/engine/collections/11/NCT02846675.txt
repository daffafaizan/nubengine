      of the SVF in 2 ml saline, with at least 50 million nucleated SVF cells and a mean viability
      of 85%, injected per single knee and the other knee treated with placebo.

      Cell suspension and placebo will be injected using ultrasound guidance. Safety and knee
      function will be evaluated by questionaires monthly and MRI in every three months post-op.
