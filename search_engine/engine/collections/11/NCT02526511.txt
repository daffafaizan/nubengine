      I. To investigate the utility of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) as a diagnostic
      biomarker for the prediction of malignant vs. benign organ confined renal masses.

      II. To investigate the utility of pMRI as a therapeutic biomarker for monitoring tumor
      progression in patients undergoing treatment (ablation, surgery, specific systemic treatments
      such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) or vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]/vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]/mechanistic target of rapamycin [mTOR] targeted
      therapies) or active surveillance for organ confined or metastatic renal tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the utility of pMRI to predict tumor grade and histologic subtype of organ
      confined kidney cancers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), or
      arterial spin labeled (ASL) pMRI within 30 days of biopsy or surgery. Patients with organ
      confined tumors selected for active surveillance or surgery and patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma undergo follow up pMRI at 1-6 months.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 48 hours.
