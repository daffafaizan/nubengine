      combined in pre-treated RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Tumor
      measurements by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be
      performed every 8 weeks from the beginning of treatment to determine response to treatment.
      Response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1
      (RECIST 1.1).

      Treatment will continue until disease progression, significant clinical deterioration,
      unacceptable toxicity, any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or trial drug is
      fulfilled. Treatment may continue past the initial determination of disease progression per
      RECIST 1.1 if the subject's performance status has remained stable, and if in the opinion of
      the Investigator, the subject will benefit from continued treatment and if other criteria are
      fulfilled as outlined in the protocol.
