      the cohort during their hospital stay for acute respiratory failure. The cohort will undergo
      testing including cognitive testing, MRI imaging, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) analysis at 3 months following hospital discharge. The study will examine the
      association of delirium duration during the hospital stay and cognitive impairment at 3 month
      follow-up with CSF levels of amyloid- Î²42, tau, and phospho-tau. Measures of delirium will
      also be related with structural/functional MRI dependent measures. The goal is to design a
      larger prospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between AD imaging and CSF
      biomarkers with delirium and post-ICU cognitive impairment. The results of this pilot study
      with provide important information with regard to future study design including: (1) ratio of
      eligible to recruited patients (2) retention rate; (3) safety and feasibility of protocol;
      and (4) preliminary effect size estimates.
