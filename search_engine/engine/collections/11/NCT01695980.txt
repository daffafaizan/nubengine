    
      The laryngeal mask airway (LMA)is a device used to secure the airway of patients during
      general anesthesia. This device is routinely used for anesthesia in elective head and neck
      surgeries, including adenotonsillectomy. In this study, the efficacy of the LMA will be
      studied as it pertains to operative times and cost.

      The child will be randomized into either the LMA group or the ETT group.
