        -  A Calibration stage that will allow to evaluate the correlation between the clinical
           tumor response parameters (i.e. TV/AP features) and the radiobiological parameters
           issued from the A/MS bioassays in order to develop a mathematic model defining the UTCR
           parameter

        -  A Validation stage in order to assess the validity of A/MS bioassays towards clinical
           tumour response parameters (i.e. both TV/AP features and UTCR).

        -  A Precision stage will be performed either to improve the precision of the predictive
           performance of the A and MS bioassays or to establish a new mathematical model
           describing the correlation between clinical and radiobiological parameters. The
           objective of this precision stage will depend of the results of the calibration stage
           (see below).

      This prospective clinical study will be conducted in a population of patients with different
      tumor types in order to explore a large range of tumor radiosensitivity including sarcomas,
      rectal carcinoma and esophagus tumor.
