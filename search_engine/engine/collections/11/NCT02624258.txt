      at least 1 of the 6 RNA CART19 doses at the protocol-specified level. Important safety data
      can be collected even if a patient receives only one RNA CART19 dose. Subjects (n = 10) will
      receive up to six IV doses of 8x105-1.5x106 RNA CART19 cells/kg/dose for subjects<80kg and
      1x108 RNA CART19 cells/dose (±20%) for subjects ≥80kg.

      The RNA CART19 doses and mid-treatment single dose cyclophosphamide will be administered on
      Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays. Dosing can be initiated on any of those days. Subjects will
      be infused in a staggered fashion at two week intervals; that is, the next subject cannot be
      infused prior to two weeks since the last infusion of the previous subject.
