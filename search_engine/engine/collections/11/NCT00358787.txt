      criteria will be invited to participate in the study by the on call orthopaedic surgeon. All
      patients will be required to provide informed consent. Patients will then be randomized
      through a random number software package and will commence immediately after confirmation of
      inclusion into the study. The fracture is reduced and fixed percutaneously either with
      crossed or lateral K wires, according to which group the subject was randomized to. Post
      reduction antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of the elbow are done in the operating
      room. Above elbow cast is applied. Radiographs are taken at follow-up visits to the clinic.
      The radiographs are measured to determine loss of reduction between immediate post-op films
      and films taken immediately prior to pin removal.
