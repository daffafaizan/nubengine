      woman's anxiety to hurt herself and her baby direct her and her relatives to try
      complementary therapies. Women should prefer natural ways in coping with these postpartum
      problems rather than seeking medical advice.

      When yoga and meditation, which are included in the group of mind-body-based complementary
      therapies, are performed in the postpartum period, they will help to relieve tensions and
      distresses that accumulate during birth, strengthen the pelvic floor, heal perineum, bring
      reproductive organs back to their prepregnancy condition healthily, provide the mother and
      the infant a sleep pattern, and have an easier transition to sleep.
