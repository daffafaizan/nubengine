    
      A prospective randomized controlled trial phase 1 using a standard 3+3 design, followed by a
      randomized controlled phase 2 to determine dosage, safety, and efficacy of intratympanic NAC
      to treat hearing loss in head & neck patients receiving high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy.
      Participants will complete various pre-treatment hearing tests. One ear will be randomly
      chosen for the experimental treatment and the other ear will serve as the control ear.
      Participants will receive intratympanic NAC injections 60 minutes prior to their scheduled
      chemotherapy sessions in the experimental ear. The control ear will not receive any
      injection. Follow up hearing tests will be performed 2 months following completion of their
      primary cancer treatment.
