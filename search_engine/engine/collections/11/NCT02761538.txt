    
      Method : Overweight & obese patients with associated comorbidities (hypertension,
      prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep disorders, past history of CVDs > 6 months,
      stable CVD, peripheral arterial disease) will receive a 24 months follow-up to assess the
      impact of the use of the online platform Aviitam®.

      Practitioners will be randomized by lot between an Aviitam® group and a control group (usual
      care).

      A medico-economic analysis will be conducted with a cost-effectiveness analysis and a budget
      impact analysis.

      With no hypothesis on the primary endpoint, the calculation of the required number of
      subjects was based on the quality of life. 150 patients will be included per group, for a
      total of 300 patients.
