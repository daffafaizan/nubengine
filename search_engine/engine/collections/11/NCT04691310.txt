      issues. The lymphedema can be treated using such as therapies, drugs or surgeries. There are
      few techniques for treatment of neck lymphedema and also in our best knowledge the kinesio
      taping therapy on lymphedema following neck cancer therapy had not been investigated or
      published. The study will assess the efficacy of kinesio taping in neck lymphedema with
      manual therapy after the head and neck cancer treatment.
