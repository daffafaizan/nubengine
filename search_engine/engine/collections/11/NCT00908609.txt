      Objective 1: Validate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative
      predictive value of optical tomography/US for distinguishing benign and early stage malignant
      breast tumors. Approximately 300 patients who will undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy are being
      recruited to this study from the University of Connecticut Health Center and Hartford
      Hospital. The total hemoglobin concentration and blood oxygen saturation will be the measured
      indices and the biopsy results will be used as the 'gold' standard.

      Objective 2: Perform pilot studies of optical tomography/US to assess chemotherapy response
      and evaluate treatment efficacy. Patients diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancers
      (size greater than 3 cm) who will undergo chemotherapy will be enrolled to this study.
      Approximately, 20 to 30 patients are being recruited to the study from the University of
      Connecticut Health Center and Hartford Hospital.
