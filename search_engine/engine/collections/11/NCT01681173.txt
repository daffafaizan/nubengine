      can reduce the progression of impairment of glucose metabolism in a high risk population with
      impaired glucose metabolism. Large prospective cohort studies clearly show that mainly
      insoluble cereal fiber from whole grains is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease. However, there is a lack of evidence from prospective
      intervention studies targeted to evaluate the potential of dietary fibers to reduce diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease as recently stated by the Cochrane Foundation. Dietary fiber
      intake is generally much lower than currently recommended, which may in part be related to
      side effects of whole grain nutrients and their gustatory properties. Intestinally
      uncomfortable effects are at least partly related to fermentation which is much less induced
      by insoluble non-fermentable fibers than by soluble fermentable fibers. The prospective
      demonstration of beneficial effects of insoluble fibers in preventing diabetes type 2 will
      allow detailed nutritional recommendations. This may serve to support the consumption of
      metabolically beneficial constituents of fiber-rich diets and help to increase fiber intake
      by high fiber natural nutrients or everyday nutrients enriched in insoluble natural fibers.
