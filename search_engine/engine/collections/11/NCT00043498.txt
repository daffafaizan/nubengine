      to common urban pollutants on neurobehavioral development and asthma in a sample of children
      living in three low-income, minority communities of New York City (Central Harlem, Washington
      Heights and the South Bronx). Using a molecular epidemiologic approach with monitoring,
      biomarkers, and clinical assessments at serial time points, we will extend our study of
      African-American and Latina urban mothers and children in order to follow the cohort through
      child age 11 years to assess the longer-term impact of exposures on child health and
      developmental outcomes.
