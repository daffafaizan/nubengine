    
      This pilot reader study was to determine the following:

        1. the radiologist's performance metrics for the two reading modalities, i.e., "FFDM read
           on the Aspire Bellus workstation" and "FFDM read in conjunction with DBT read on the
           Aspire Bellus workstation",;

        2. the magnitude and direction of differences between performance metrics for the two
           modalities; and

        3. variance components and correlations that would influence samples sizes and case mix for
           the subsequent pivotal reader study comparing performance metrics between the two
           modalities.
