      substrate but does not affect CYP3A itself. It is also a moderate inhibitor of various
      membrane transporters such as organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) ,
      p-glycoprotein (P-gP), and organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2.

      Metformin is used to treat diabetes mellitus. It is an OCT-2 and OCT-1 substrate and when
      combined with daclatasvir increased levels of metformin may occur, with risk on hypoglycaemic
      episodes. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of daclatasvir currently does not
      mention this potential drug-drug interaction.

      HCV is associated with insulin resistance (IR) which may develop to diabetes mellitus (DM).
      The prevalence of IR in HCV infected patients is estimated varying from 30% to 70%. Several
      studies showed that IR has a negative impact on the achievement of an undetectable HCV viral
      load after completing 12 weeks of treatment (Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)).

      This study aims to provide clinical information on a potential drug-drug interaction between
      daclatasvir and metformin.
