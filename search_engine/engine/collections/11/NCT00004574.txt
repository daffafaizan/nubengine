      and incorporated into fat-rich particles called chylomicrons made in the intestinal wall.
      Chylomicrons are secreted by the intestine into the bloodstream. In a rare lipid metabolic
      disorder called abetalipoproteinemia, a defect in the assembly of the fat and vitamin
      containing particles prevents the formation of chylomicrons resulting in the malabsorption of
      fat and fat-soluble vitamins. A similar assembly defect of fat and fat-soluble vitamins
      occurs in the liver and prevents the secretion of these particles. Severe fat-soluble vitamin
      deficiency results even despite mega doses of oral fat-soluble vitamins. Clinically, the
      subjects develop neurologic and ophthalmologic symptoms similar to those in Vitamin A and E
      deficiency. This study is designed to determine whether short-term intravenous fat-soluble
      vitamins and fat emulsion can reverse the neurologic and ophthalmologic complications of
      fat-soluble vitamin deficiency based on noninvasive procedures routinely employed in clinical
      practice.
