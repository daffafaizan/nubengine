    
      The purpose of this psychophysical and pharmacologic study is to determine if meditation
      induced pain relief is mediated by endogenous opioids in response to intravenous (IV)
      administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone during a pain evoking straight leg raise
      test in response to double-blind intravenous administration (IV) of naloxone/placebo-saline.
      The aim of this study is to determine if mindfulness-based analgesia is associated with the
      release of endogenous opioids.
