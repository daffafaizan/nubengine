      Covid-19 patients with bacterial co-infections due to A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa or S.
      aureus. Patient bacterial isolates will be tested to determine phage susceptibility prior to
      and during phage therapy.

      The primary objectives are to determine the feasibility of developing, producing and
      providing a personalized intravenous phage for Covid-19 patients who have pneumonia,
      bacteremia or septicemia due to A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa or S. aureus and to evaluate the
      safety of intravenous phage in Covid-19 patients along with anti-microbial treatment for
      pneumonia, bacteremia or septicemia due to A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.
