    
      Cluster headache is an unilateral headache with periodic attacks, that usually lasts for 6 to
      12 weeks. The pain is usually unbearable. The attacks are treated with injections of
      sumatriptan (migraine medication)and inhalation of oxygen.

      The most common prophylactics today has limited effect and a risk of side effects.

      Candesartan has in one study shown a clinically significant effect in migraine prophylaxis.

      The angiotensin II receptor blocker, candesartan is well tolerated with side-effects not
      significantly different from placebo and with few drug interactions. We therefore wish to
      investigate the prophylactic effect in treatment of cluster in headache patients.

      This will be a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel study where the prophylactic
      effect of candesartan is compared to placebo in a period of 3 weeks. First week 16 mg and the
      following 2 weeks 32 mg.
