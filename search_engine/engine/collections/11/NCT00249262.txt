      metastatic malignant melanoma who have not received cytotoxic agents for advanced disease.
      Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents including IL-2 and
      vaccines. Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of 500mg/m2 intravenously by
      1-hour infusion weekly for the first five weeks of a six week cycle. Treatment will continue
      until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, refusal of continued treatment by patient
      or Investigator decision.
