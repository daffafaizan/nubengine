    
      This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the
      assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same
      medication on the same days) to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being
      investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of glyburide (a blood glucose-lowering agent used to treat patients with
      diabetes). The study will consist of 3 phases; a screening phase, an open-label treatment
      phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. During the open-label treatment phase, each
      volunteer will receive a single 1.25 mg dose of glyburide on Day 1, followed by 200 mg
      canagliflozin once daily on Days 4 through 8. On Day 9 volunteers will receive both glyburide
      1.25 mg and canagliflozin 200 mg. Each volunteer will participate in the study for
      approximately 40 days.
