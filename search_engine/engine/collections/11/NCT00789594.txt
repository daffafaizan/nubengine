      ambulatory setting and constitute an important target for patient safety and quality
      improvement. Laboratory monitoring to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy and
      the timely management of abnormal results of laboratory testing have been increasingly
      recognized as important areas for improving patient safety in ambulatory care. Promising
      interventions have been developed for practices affiliated with hospitals and integrated
      delivery systems, but efforts to date have not adequately reached physicians practicing solo
      or in small practices in the community. The Massachusetts e-Health Collaborative (MAeHC;
      www.maehc.org) provides an important opportunity to study implementation of healthcare
      information technology innovations in a community setting. In 2007, the MAeHC will complete
      the implementation of commercially available electronic health records (EHRs) for 441
      physicians in more than 200 office practices in three diverse communities in Massachusetts.
      In this group of small-to-medium sized office practices in both urban and rural regions of
      the State, we will: 1) identify the barriers to and facilitators of laboratory monitoring and
      timely follow-up of abnormal laboratory results, especially for elderly patients and clinical
      scenarios common to this population; 2) design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of
      clinical decision support (point-of-care alerts) for laboratory monitoring in a widely used,
      commercially available EHR; 3) design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a results
      management system to improve the timely follow-up of abnormal laboratory test results in
      office practice; 4) develop a practical dissemination guide to assist other practices and
      communities interested in implementing similar interventions. The results of this study will
      be important because they will demonstrate and accelerate the dissemination of clinicians'
      use of healthcare information technology to improve patient safety and healthcare quality
      beyond integrated delivery systems and should be broadly generalizable to small- and
      medium-sized office practices in community settings.
