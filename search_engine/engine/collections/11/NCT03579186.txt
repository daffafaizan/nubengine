      improves gait in patients with gait abnormalities, specifically vestibular induced gait
      disorders. The study population will consist of patients already receiving a gait assessment
      through the Brain Fit Club (BFC) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This gait
      assessment involves walking and posture evaluations. Patients will complete a gait assessment
      as part of their normal BFC evaluation. Those who consent to participate in the study will
      then complete a gait assessment while receiving optokinetic stimulation. The investigators
      will compare baseline gait and postural control before and during OKS stimulation.
