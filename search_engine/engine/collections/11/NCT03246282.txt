      subjects presenting with pain will be enrolled into a single treatment group The purpose of
      the study is to evaluate the feasibility of Polychromatic Light Emitting Diode System (PLEDS)
      for Peripheral Intravenous (PIV) catheter light delivery for pain reduction, through change
      between baseline average pain and final average VAS score. The absence of a control group is
      based on the following reason: The purpose of this investigation is to further the
      understanding of the feasibility of PLEDS for PIV catheter light delivery for pain
      management. Further, the results of this investigation will be used (internally only) to
      determine if subject-perceived reductions in pain warrant proceeding with more controlled,
      targeted and possibly randomized studies.

      PIV therapy has been used for decades as an effective therapy to maintain proper hydration
      and electrolyte levels. Additionally, PIV therapy can be infused with various agents,
      including supplements and pharmacological agents. Low-energy light therapy has been
      established as an alternative treatment for a myriad of medical conditions including
      reduction of pain. The concurrent administration of low-light therapy and PIV therapy may
      serve as a viable therapy for the treatment of pain associated with various medical
      conditions. Accordingly, this study is designed to assess the feasibility of low light
      therapy via PLEDS integrated into a standard PIV catheter for the purposes of reduction of
      pain.
