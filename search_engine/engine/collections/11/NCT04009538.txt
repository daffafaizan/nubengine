      increases exercise capacity, improves quality of life, and reduces psychological symptoms.
      Unfortunately, these gains are not permanent, but disappear within 12-24 months. The aim of
      this study is to compare the gains of the second PR program with the first program.

      Patients with COPD who participated in the second rehabilitation program in the Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation unit will be included in the study. Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood
      gases, mMRC dyspnea perception, 6-minute walking distance, disease-specific (SGRQ) quality of
      life and hospital anxiety depression scale values will be compared.
