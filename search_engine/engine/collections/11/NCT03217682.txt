      therapy can be effective therapeutic tools for relief of pain and non-pain symptoms in
      hospice and palliative care patients. Massage and music therapies can provide comfort,
      relaxation, and improve quality of life for patients. The investigator's primary aim is to
      compare the effects of massage and music therapies on the quality of life of hospice
      patients. The overall goal is to further improve pain, depression, anxiety, and poor
      well-being or quality of life in hospice patients through the use of integrative therapies,
      specifically massage and music therapies, as add-on to standard hospice clinical care.
      Patients will be assigned to either the massage therapy or music therapy cohort.
      Questionnaires will be utilized before and after each massage or music therapy intervention
      to quantify symptom and quality of life levels.
