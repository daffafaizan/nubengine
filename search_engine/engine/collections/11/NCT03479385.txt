      in support provided to survivors from the medical team as well as family and friends. In
      addition, cancer associated symptoms and impaired quality of life remain significant problems
      for patients despite advances in cancer treatment. Few effective treatment options exist for
      these symptoms. Integrative medicine is rising in popularity in the United States; however,
      few integrative medicine modalities have been rigorously studied. Ayurveda, a whole system of
      medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent, has its own system of diagnostics and
      therapeutics, and among its strengths are wellness and prevention. In the Integrative
      Medicine intervention, Ayurvedic nutrition and lifestyle guidance will be presented, along
      with instruction in Yoga. In the Health Education intervention, informative content on issues
      relevant to breast cancer survivors will be presented including the physical, social and
      emotional impacts of survivorship. The investigators aim to perform a pilot RCT in breast
      cancer survivors with impaired quality of life. Specifically, the investigators aim to assess
      feasibility of randomization, adherence and retention to the Integrative Medicine and Health
      Education interventions.
