      outcomes of cardiac surgery. MicroRNAs are non-coding RNA sequences that act as regulators of
      gene expression. Investigators conduct a study to determine the role of microRNAs in
      cardioprotection mediated by dexmedetomidine.

      Methods: In this study 3 patients were selected. The blood sample were taken before
      administration of dexmedetomidine.Investigators infused loading dose of dexmedetomidine for
      10 minutes and maintaining dese of dexmedetomidine for 20 minutes.Thirty minutes after the
      administration, another blood samples were taken and stored in the liquid nitrogen and both
      the samples were marked. Those sample were analyzed for differentially expressed microRNA
      with Exiqon miRNA Array.
