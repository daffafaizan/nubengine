    
      Human pancreatic cancer overexpresses a number of important tyrosine kinase (TK) growth
      factors receptors and ligands, including expression of both PDGF and PDGF receptors. Drugs
      that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in pancreatic cancer. Masitinib
      is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-Kit (mast cell growth factor
      receptor), PDGF receptor, FGF receptor and to a lower extent the FAK kinases. Pre-clinical
      and clinical studies have shown that masitinib can reverse resistance of pancreatic tumor
      cell lines to gemcitabine. Based on pre-clinical and phase 2 clinical studies, masitinib can
      be considered as a good candidate to use in combination with gemcitabine in the treatment of
      pancreatic cancer.
