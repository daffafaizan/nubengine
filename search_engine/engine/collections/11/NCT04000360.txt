      to examine the disease-altering capabilities of a 12 month aerobic exercise program for
      individuals with PD. A total of 250 individuals with PD will be randomized into 1) a
      home-based aerobic exercise program, or 2) a usual and customary care (UCC). Subjects in the
      home exercise group will receive a commercially available Peloton indoor stationary bicycle
      delivered to their home for a 12 month exercise period. Individuals in the UCC group will
      continue their current level of physical activity. Both groups will undergo a series of motor
      and non-motor assessments at enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months to measure disease
      progression of the 12 month period. Additionally, data will be used to develop a prognostic
      model to predict 12-month change in Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale III (MDS-UPDRS III) for patients participating in a home-based high-intensity
      aerobic exercise program.
