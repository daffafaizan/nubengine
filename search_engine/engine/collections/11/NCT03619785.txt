      agree to participate will be randomized 1:1 to either the control group or the experimental
      group. Those in the control group will receive the usual oral and/or IV pain medication as
      needed. The experimental group will receive an ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane
      block. Numerical pain rating scale scores at rest and when taking a deep breath will be
      recorded pre-intervention and at times 0, 20, 40, and 60. At time 60, patients who received
      the SAPB will receive sensory testing. Patients will be offered additional pain medication as
      needed at times 20, 40, and 60.
