      predictive of the occurrence of thrombotic events but not all. The investigators can
      therefore ask the question of the benefit of adaptation of antiplatelet therapy by biological
      monitoring to prevent the recurrence of thrombotic events. The platelet aggregation tests
      used mainly concern aspirin, via stimulation with arachidonic acid, or anti-P2Y12
      (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel), via stimulation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP). For
      the latter, a test via the measurement of the phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic protein called
      "VASP" is also used routinely, making it possible to further clarify the existence of
      platelet resistance to anti-P2Y12. Within the vascular medicine department, any discovery of
      a potential resistance to the anti-platelet treatment of a patient requires a therapeutic
      adaptation to overcome this phenomenon of "resistance", and to improve the phenomenon of
      anti-aggregation
