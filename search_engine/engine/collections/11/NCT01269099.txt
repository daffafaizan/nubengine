      postoperative pain. The increase in stress hormone level and hyperventilation caused by the
      postoperative pain may contribute to the development of hypokalemia during postoperative
      period. Hypokalemia is a risk factor for postoperative arrhythmia. Therefore, if the
      postoperative pain is well controlled by the IV-PCA, the plasma potassium level during the
      postoperative period may be not affected by stress response, and the incidence of hypokalemia
      may be reduced. The researchers tried to investigate the effect of IV-PCA on potassium
      regulation during the postoperative period.

      The researchers divided the patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy into two groups
      of IV-PCA group and control group. The researchers compared the plasma potassium
      concentration from the preoperative to postoperative period.
