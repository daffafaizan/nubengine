      intake cause seriously body mas reducing. Although blood and urine analyses support high
      glucose, lipid and middle protein catabolisms, but the mechanism was unclear. There are some
      diseases according to blood elementary deficiencies, like hypothyroidi in hypoiyodinemia,
      hiperparathyroidi in hypocalcemia, etc. We hypothesised that hypoboronemia may be corralated
      to body mass index level.
