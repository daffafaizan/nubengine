    
      The objectives of this performance study are to:

        -  Non-invasively measure carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the exhaled breath of study
           subjects using two different types of measurement devices.

        -  We will assess the correlation between the measured CO levels (in parts per million, or
           ppm) of the study CO breath sensor (Carrot Inc.) and a similar device.

        -  assess user documentation comprehension

        -  obtain feedback on the Pivot Breath Sensor via rating scales.
