    
      1. Purpose: To demonstrate that combined Radiotherapy (RT) and intravenous corticosteroid
           (CS) is more effective than iv CS alone in preventing severe motility disruption
           (including strabismus and primary diplopia) and new-onset dysthyroid optic neuropathy in
           early progressive thyroid orbitopathy.

        2. Hypothesis: Combined RT and iv CS are more effective than iv CS alone in preventing
           motility problems (reduced field of single binocular vision, reduced ductions,
           strabismus and worsening diplopia) and in preventing new-onset dysthyroid optic
           neuropathy in patients with early progressive thyroid orbitopathy.

        3. Justification: Standard therapy for progressive TED is iv CS, occasionally supplemented
           with RT if complications develop in spite of appropriate iv CS therapy. A single
           retrospective study suggested that early combined treatment may prevent more serious
           visual complications; this would be the first randomized controlled prospective trial to
           see if this finding is true.

        4. Objectives: Demonstrate a statistically significant reduced rate of new onset optic
           neuropathy and double vision in patients with progressive TED with combined therapy
           versus traditional monotherapy.

        5. Research Method: Multicentre, institutional based, randomized controlled trial.

        6. Statistical Analysis:

      Subjects: 100 patients with early progressive TED randomized equally into two groups:

        1. Therapy: iv MP 500 mg iv weekly for 6 weeks, then 250 mg iv weekly for 6 weeks

           + XRT 100 Rads to each orbit x 10 doses

        2. Control: Same iv MP dose + no XRT
