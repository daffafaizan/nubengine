    
      This is an open-label, Phase I-II study of post injection pain and inflammation after
      intravitreally administered Ranibizumab and Aflibercept in 100 subjects with Neovascular
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration. We will enroll both treatment experienced ( patients who
      were treated with Lucentis or Eylea, but not Avastin in the past) and treatment naive
      patients ( new onset Neovascular AMD with no history of intravitreal injections).

      The treatment experienced patients will be treated with the intravitreal medication other
      than what they were receiving in the past, for example, patients treated with Lucentis will
      switch to Eylea for study purposes and vice versa.

      Consented, enrolled subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injection of either 0.5mg
      Ranibizumab or 2mg Aflibercept. A standard intravitreal injection protocol will be followed.
      Patients will be reevaluated between 24-48 hours and 5-7 days post injections. A
      non-injecting physician will evaluate the patients for anterior chamber inflammation; this
      physician will be blinded about the specific treatment. Anterior chamber inflammation is
      described as any cell or flare in the anterior chamber. These will be evaluated using
      Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group classifications.

      Pain score will be evaluated using a Numerical Rating Scale. Each patient will have a
      standard script verbally read to them at their visit, and asked to rate their pain based on
      this scale.
