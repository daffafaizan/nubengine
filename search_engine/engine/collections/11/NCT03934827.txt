    
      This is a first in human, single centre study in two parts, which aims to determine the
      safety and tolerability of the novel biotherapeutic compound, MRx0518, to examine its use as
      an anti-cancer and immune system modulating agent in patients with a range of solid tumours,
      over 2 years.

      MRx0518 is composed of a proprietary strain of bacterium (Enterococcus species) which is
      found in the gastrointestinal tract of approx. 25% of humans and is predicted, from
      preclinical studies, to produce beneficial effects in humans.

      Patients who have been diagnosed with melanoma, breast, ovarian, uterine, prostate, urethra,
      bladder, renal, lung or head and neck cancer, who are amenable to surgical resection, will
      receive MRx0518 (part A) or MRx0518/placebo (part B) orally twice daily for 2-4 weeks until
      surgery to remove the tumour. In part A, 20 patients will receive open label MRx0518 as part
      of a preliminary safety assessment. Following surgery, patients will attend a 30 day, 6
      month, 12 month and 24 month follow up visit.

      Following successful evaluation of part A data by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee
      (IDMC) the study will continue to recruit a further 100 patients to Part B of the trial. Part
      B will be placebo controlled, in which patients will be randomised in a double blinded
      fashion in a 4:1 ratio of MRx0518:placebo. In total, 120 patients will be recruited into the
      study (20 from part A and 100 from part B).
