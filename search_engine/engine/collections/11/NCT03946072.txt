      effectiveness trial of a transseptal approach to left ventricular ablation compared to a
      retrograde aortic approach to prevent cerebral emboli and neurocognitive decline in adults
      with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
      Participants will be followed for 6 months post-study procedure. This study will be conducted
      at up to 12 clinical sites in the United States. A total of one-hundred and fifty (150)
      participants will be enrolled and randomized.
