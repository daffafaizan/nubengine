      is an important public health problem, due to its association with vertebral and nonvertebral
      fractures leading to increased morbidity. Vertebral fractures are accompanied by kyphosis,
      reduced pulmonary function, loss of height, and are often associated with elevated pain while
      they may also lead to subsequent vertebral fractures. Osteoporotic individuals exhibit
      kyphosis in the erect standing position, which, in turn, is compensated by the deformation of
      other parts of the body. Improvement of postural alignment may lead to less stress on the
      spine, facilitate posture and proper body mechanics and may improve balance. The aim of the
      present study was to assess the effectiveness of Motor Control Exercise on pain, postural
      alignment and spinal curvatures in women with osteoporotic vertebral fracture against the
      results of a control group that received the basic therapies for osteoporosis.
