    
      The study consists of two phases: Phase A (pharmacokinetics phase) and Phase B (treatment
      phase).

      Upon enrollment, each patient will be enrolled into either a crossover cohort or a dose
      escalation Cohort of Phase A (PK phase) based on the time of enrollment in the study.

      Upon completion of Phase A, each patient will have the option to continue treatment in Phase
      B (treatment phase).

      Patients enrolled in the crossover cohorts will be parallelly enrolled and randomized into 1
      of 4 treatment sequences. In each treatment sequence, daily dosing (q.d.) or twice-daily
      dosing (b.i.d.) will be administered for 14 days and crossed over after a 14 day washout
      period.

      Patients enrolled into dose escalation cohorts will be enrolled according to a 3+3 standard
      dose escalation design. Three to six patients will be assigned to receive provisional doses
      of TT-00420 on a twice daily dose schedule for 28 days.

      Upon completion of Phase A, if the patient can tolerate TT-00420 treatment and have no
      disease progression, the patient may continue TT-00420 treatment in the Phase B treatment
      phase. In phase B treatment stage, patients will receive daily treatment of TT-00420 in
      28-day treatment cycles with the dose determined by investigator, medical monitor, and the
      Sponsor.
