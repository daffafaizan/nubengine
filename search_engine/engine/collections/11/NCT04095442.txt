    
      Study Visit One:

      During an initial visit, subjects will complete the informed consent process, be instructed
      on the requirements of the study, and practice the exercise protocol (see below).

      Study Visit Two:

      Subjects will be tested after they have avoided exercise, caffeine, alcohol, chewing gum, and
      foods high in nitrate (e.g., spinach, beets, collard greens) for at least 24 hours. They will
      also be asked to not use any mouthwash products during this period. They will then provide
      provide a saliva sample for subsequent measurement of nitrate and nitrite concentrations and
      have their breath nitric oxide levels measured using a portable analyzer. The maximal knee
      extensor speed and power of their knee extensor muscles will then be measured using an
      isokinetic dynamometer. This machine can control the speed of movement while measuring the
      maximal force (torque) that a subject can voluntarily produce.

      Subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive either an antibacterial mouthwash
      (Cepacol©, Reckitt Benckiser, Parsippany, NJ) or, as a control solution, an alcohol-free
      "natural" mouthwash (Tom's of Maine©, Kennebunk, ME). Participants will be asked to rinse
      their mouth as directed on the product's packaging for 30 s twice per day for 7 (+/-2) days
      and to record the usage of the mouthwash on a provided form. Subjects will then return for
      Study Visit 3 (see below). This is considered a single-blind study, which means that the
      investigators will not know what type of mouthwash a subject is receives.

      Study Visit Three:

      At the end of the treatment period, subjects will be asked to return to undergo the same
      procedures as described for Study Visit Two.
