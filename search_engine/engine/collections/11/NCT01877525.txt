      but have low risk for harboring advanced villous or dysplastic components and for developing
      into colorectal cancer. "Resect and discard" (RD) is a new paradigm for management of these
      diminutive polyps wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are
      then resected and discarded rather than sent for histopathological review.

      Aim: The aim of this study were to compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and
      the standard of care where polyps are sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of
      academic and community gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an
      RD program for management of diminutive polyps.

      Methods: This is a prospective, observational study conducted in a single outpatient
      endoscopy center over 12 months. Screening and surveillance colonoscopies were performed by
      four academic and two community gastroenterologists. All diminutive polyps (defined as ≤5 mm)
      were endoscopically imaged and histology predictions (adenoma vs. non-adenomatous polyp) were
      made using high-definition white light (HDWL) with/without narrow band imaging (NBI) at the
      discretion of the endoscopist. Diagnostic performance and accordance of recommended
      surveillance intervals from endoscopic imaging were compared to histopathological review of
      the polyps.
