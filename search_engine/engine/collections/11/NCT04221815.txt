      IVUS-guided coronary stent implantation vs. angiography-guided coronary stent implantation in
      a 1:1 ratio.

      The clinical investigation will be conducted at approximately 120 centers in the US, Canada,
      and Europe. Approximately 2,500-3,100 randomized subjects and up to 3 roll-in subjects per
      site will be enrolled in this study. Subjects participating in this clinical investigation
      will be followed for 2 years. The expected duration of enrollment is approximately 2.5 years.
      The total duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be approximately 4.5 years.
