      infertile couple occurs. This laboratory holds many variables such as incubator type, air
      quality, brands of culture media, culture temperature and the pH of culture medium. Despite
      the importance of the culture medium pH, there is no single RCT has examined its effect on
      live birth rate post in vitro fertilisation. The investigators of this study believe that
      leaving this crucial element to the wishes of large companies and media designers is unwise.
      This RCT aims to provide a conclusive answer on pH effect on live birth rate of in vitro
      cultured human embryos.
