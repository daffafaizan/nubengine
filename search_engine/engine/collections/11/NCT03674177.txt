    
      Healthy non-pregnant women 18-45 years of age will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to
      receive one of three dose levels (30, 60, 120 micrograms [Âµg]) of the investigational RSV
      maternal vaccine (GSK3888550A) or placebo, administered as a single intramuscular injection
      (IM).

      There will be a screening visit and five study visits scheduled at Day 1 (study vaccination),
      Day 8, Day 31, Day 61, and Day 91 to evaluate the primary and secondary objectives of
      safety/reactogenicity and immunogenicity profiles of the 3 dose levels. Subjects will also be
      contacted at Day 181. During this contact, the investigator (or delegate) will ask the
      subject if she has experienced any serious adverse events (SAEs) and or any adverse events
      (AEs) leading to study withdrawal since the last study visit (Day 360), as well as if she has
      become pregnant during the post-vaccination period. The investigator (or delegate) will also
      ask the subject about concomitant vaccinations/products/medications that she has received
      since the last study visit (D91). Contact should be performed preferably via telephone. Other
      means of contact (email/other) may be acceptable provided the required information can be
      fully collected.
