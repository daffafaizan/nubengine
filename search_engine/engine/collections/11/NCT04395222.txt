      potential alternative to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in haplo-cord transplantation. It is a
      single-center study based at Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork Presbyterian Hospital.

      The hypothesis is that tocilizumab is a safe and effective alternative to ATG in haplo-cord
      transplantation, facilitating transient engraftment of the haplo-identical stem cell graft
      without prolonged neutropenia or second nadir prior to durable cord engraftment while also
      preventing graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      This study plans to enroll patients with hematologic malignancies in need of alternate donor
      transplant. All subjects will be conditioned with fludarabine, melphalan and total body
      irradiation (TBI), followed by a single dose of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg on Day -1. Patients will
      be enrolled into 4 successive cohorts, initially administering the current standard 3 doses
      of ATG 1.5 mg/kg (total 4.5 mg/kg). In the absence of safety signals, we will drop one dose
      of ATG in successive cohorts until the drug ultimately has been eliminated.

      The primary endpoint of the study is successful haplo-derived neutrophil engraftment.
      Treatment will only be of interest if there is evidence that this rate is greater than 60%.
      If there are 4 or fewer successes, that dose group will be deemed unacceptable and the next
      higher ATG dose for which there were 5 or more success will be expanded.
