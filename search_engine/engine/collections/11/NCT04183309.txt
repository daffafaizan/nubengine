      during pneumoperitoneum. The investigators will studied 15 mechanically ventilated pediatric
      patients schedule for abdominal laparoscopy surgery under general anesthesia.

      Lung mechanics will be assessed during laparoscopy. Esophageal pressure will be measured by
      an esophageal ballon to measure transpulmonary pressure. Lung collapse will detected when
      transpulmonary pressure became negative and using lung ultrasound images. A lung recruitment
      maneuver will be applied if these patients present atelectasis during surgery. The optimal
      level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) if defined as the PEEP level when
      transpulmonary pressure remains positive during the PEEP titration trial of the recruitment
      maneuver.
