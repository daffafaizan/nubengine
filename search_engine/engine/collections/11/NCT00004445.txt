      pelvis and legs. Electrode leads are inserted into a receiver/stimulator implanted in a
      subcutaneous pocket in the abdomen. Following implantation, patients undergo training in
      standing, transfers, and other advanced mobility skills using the functional neuromuscular
      stimulation system. Restricted activity continues for 2 weeks after surgery, followed by 8
      weeks of exercise. Standing training then begins, and continues for up to 6 weeks. Home-based
      training follows prior to discharge with the system for spontaneous use.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months, then annually thereafter.
