    
      50 mechanically ventilated patients above 18 years of age and with presence of clinical
      features of bronchospasm requiring treatment with nebulised short-acting beta-2 mimetic.

      Participants will be randomly allocated into two equal groups: a group that was to receive
      the dose of 2.5 mg and a group that was to receive the dose of 5 mg of nebulised salbutamol.
      The duration of nebulisation will be set for 20 minutes and Holter ECG data are to be
      recorded for 60 minutes from the initiation of the nebuliser. The acquired Holter ECG data
      will be analysed at 10 time points: before salbutamol administration and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
      30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes following initiation of nebulisation. Changes in QT interval,
      corrected QT intervals calculated using Bazett's correction and the Framingham formula and
      transmural dispersion of repolarization TDR will be assessed.
