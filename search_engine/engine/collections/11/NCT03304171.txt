      breast cancer among 96,959 women in the California Teachers Study, in which 4,826 women were
      diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up (1995-2011). Participants' dietary habits were
      recorded at baseline (1995) using a 103-item Block95 Food Frequency Questionnaire to allow
      for the assessment of overall diet quality. Specifically, diet quality was characterized by
      the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010),
      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Paleolithic Index scores. Associations
      between diet quality and the risk of developing breast cancer were examined using
      multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models to provide hazard ratios and
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
