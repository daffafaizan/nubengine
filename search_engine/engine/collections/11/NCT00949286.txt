      separately as they were for the main trial. This study will clarify and quantify the
      long-term, post trial (often referred to as legacy) effects of these two interventions in a
      broader population of patients with type 2 diabetes from high and low to middle income
      countries, and in the setting of comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor treatment. With the
      ADVANCE trial infrastructure and surveillance system already in place, the implementation of
      extended follow-up will be feasible. The conclusions of this follow up study will have
      profound clinical implications for the care of patients with type 2 diabetes around the
      world.
