      is associated with peripheral biomarkers indicating abnormal activation of the innate immune
      system余 and (ii) that peripheral inflammation, defined by blood levels of C-reactive protein
      (CRP), is associated with central nervous system inflammation and abnormal brain structure
      and function.

      The objectives are to test these two hypotheses by collecting clinical, immunological and
      neuroimaging data on patients with depression (DEP+) recruited from a network of clinical
      research sites in the United Kingdom.

      Primary objective:

      To measure peripheral immunophenotypes in healthy volunteers (at least N=50) and 3 groups of
      depressed patients, categorised by their exposure and therapeutic response to monoaminergic
      antidepressants (up to N=200):

        -  Incompletely responsive patients (approximately N ~100) who are currently depressed
           after greater than 6 weeks of treatment with one or more monoaminergic antidepressants
           (DEP+MA+)余

        -  Responsive patients (approximately N~50) who are not currently depressed after greater
           than 6 weeks of treatment with a monoaminergic antidepressant (DEP-MA+)余

        -  Untreated patients (approximately N~50) who are currently depressed but have not been
           treated with monoaminergic antidepressants in the previous 6 weeks (DEP+MA-)余

        -  Healthy volunteers (approximately N~50) who have no personal history of depression
           requiring treatment with either monoaminergic antidepressants or other clinical
           interventions including psychotherapy (DEP-MA-).

      Secondary objective:

      To measure brain and cognitive phenotypes in a subsample of up to N=100 depressed patients
      recruited, preferably from the primary cohort, on the basis of their CRP levels:

        -  Low CRP patients (N~45) will have CRP <= 3 mg/L

        -  High CRP patients (N~45) will have CRP > 3 mg/L

        -  Healthy volunteers (at least N=45).

      All subjects in this sample will be assessed using structural and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and subjects providing additional specific consents will also be
      assessed using positron emission tomography (PET-MR), and/or lumbar puncture (LP) for
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling.
