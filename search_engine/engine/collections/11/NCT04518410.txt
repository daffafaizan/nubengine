    
      This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational
      agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly
      enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression.

      The study includes both infused and non-infused agents. For infused agents, enrollment will
      be restricted to participants at higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Non-infused
      agents will be open to participants at both "higher" and "lower" risk of progression to
      severe COVID-19.

      For infused agents, the study begins with a phase II evaluation, followed by a transition
      into a larger Phase III evaluation for promising agents. Phase III evaluation is a
      continuation of the phase II trial for agents that meet study-defined criteria for further
      evaluation and for which sufficient investigational agent is available. An infused agent may
      also enter directly into phase III evaluation based on Trial Oversight Committee (TOC)
      assessments.

      For non-infused agents, the same phase II study will be undertaken as for infused agents.
      Following design of the phase III evaluation for non-infused agents in a subsequent version
      or amendment of the protocol these may also enter directly into phase III based on TOC
      assessments.

      Investigational agents will be selected by the TOC for phase II evaluation based on the
      presence of in vitro data demonstrating promise as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics in
      pre-clinical testing, and for which there are suitable pharmacokinetics and safety data from
      phase I testing, or through clinical or research testing for a different indication, and
      agent availability.
