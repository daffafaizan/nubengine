      maintenance of remission, as simple as it sounds, maintenance of remission requires
      remission. Biological medications using a single monoclonal antibody directed target, seem to
      be effective only for a segment of the population with Crohn's disease Dietary therapy is
      highly effective in children and induces remission in approximately 60% of young adults with
      uncomplicated luminal disease. It was shown to shift the microbiome away from Proteobacteria
      towards Firmicutes, and to decrease intestinal permeability (i.e improvement in leaky gut).

      Dietary therapy is widely used in children and both exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and the
      Crohn's disease exclusion diet were highly effective for induction of remission and reduction
      in inflammation in children in a multinational randomized controlled trial (Levine A,
      Gastroenterology 2019). Recently a prospective randomized controlled trial in biologic na√Øve
      adults demonstrated clinical remission in 62% of adults by 6 weeks (Yanai H, UEG Week 2020).
      A two week course of EEN in adults was effective for improvement of symptoms and reduction in
      inflammation (Wall CL Inflamm Intest Dis 2018). Xu et al demonstrated clinical remission in
      52 and 47% of two adult cohorts (n=104) using EEN for induction of remission (Xu Y, Therap
      Adv Gastroenterol 2019). Taken together, these studies suggest that dietary therapy could act
      as a bridge to biologic effect and have a synergistic effect on the disease.
