      virtually delivered, live-online 16-week group model of Internal Family Systems (IFS) for
      individuals with PTSD, called the PARTS program, on PTSD symptoms measured by
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5).

      Secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of the PARTS program measured by a
      Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire.
      Secondary clinical outcomes include the effects of the PARTS program on self-report PTSD and
      disturbances of self-organization (DSO). Exploratory aims of the study are to investigate the
      effects on emotion regulation (DERS), self-trauma fusion (iPRISM-trauma), disassociation
      (MDI), depression (CAT-DI), self-compassion (SCS-SF), perceived stress (PSS), mindfulness
      (TMS), and interception (MAIA-2). Additional exploratory outcomes include changes in outcome
      variables among PTSD subjects with baseline DSO and those without DSO as defined by the
      International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ).
