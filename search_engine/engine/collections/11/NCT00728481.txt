        1. There is a subset of patients with the diagnosis of EE who also have GERD.

        2. Patients with both EE and GERD will respond symptomatically and histologically to
           aggressive gastric acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor as monotherapy.

        3. Swallowed budesonide suspension is effective in treating patients with EE who do not
           have evidence of GERD.

      Participants were randomized based on results of a 24 hour pH study, which determined the
      average percent time the distal esophagus was exposed to a pH of less than than 4. Subjects
      with a positive pH result were randomized to esomeprazole or randomized to budesonide, if
      there was a negative pH result. Studies were interpreted by a single gastroenterologist
      experienced in reading esophageal pH studies. The percent time the pH monitor detected a pH
      less than 4 was recorded and an esophageal pH of less than 4 for 4% or greater of the study
      time was considered abnormal. Note: pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity (lower numbers
      are more acid, higher numbers are more alkaline).

      Those subjects with GERD (positive pH result) received gastric acid-suppressing medication
      (esomeprazole 40 mg, twice daily) for 6 weeks. Subjects who did not have GERD (negative pH
      result) were treated with a corticosteroid designed to coat the esophagus (budesonide
      suspension 1 mg twice daily) for six weeks. Response to treatment was assessed by esophageal
      histology and symptoms.
