      - 2 mg/kg (approximately 130 - 260 ml fresh coffee). Such doses produce well characterised
      effects; including increased 'alertness', and improvements to measures of reaction time and
      sustained attention. A previous study has demonstrated improvements to performance following
      9 mg caffeine, which represents the lowest known psychoactive dose of caffeine. A number of
      these effects, including elevated salivary caffeine levels, were still apparent at 6 hours
      post-caffeine consumption (9). Findings showing effects of 12.5 and 9 mg caffeine are
      important as these are approaching the levels found in decaffeinated beverages, which are
      assumed to have no behavioural or physiological effects. However, despite extensive research
      in this area, the lower threshold for psychoactive effects has not been established. A
      randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced crossover study was undertaken. 20
      young men and women (13 female, mean age 20.7 years, standard deviation 2.4) undertook
      computerised assessments of memory and attention and rated subjective mood. Autonomic
      activity and salivary caffeine were co-monitored. Assessment took place at baseline, 1, 3, 6,
      and 9 hours post-administration of placebo, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg caffeine (on separate days)
      administered in 150 ml fruit juice.
