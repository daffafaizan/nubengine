    
      Approximately 10% of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's
      Disease, have a family history of ALS or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia
      (FTD). In most of these familial cases, and a significant number of "sporadic" patients with
      no family history, a mutation is present in one of a growing number of genes that have been
      associated with ALS and/or FTD.

      The ALS Families Project will study unaffected carriers of ALS/FTD-associated gene mutations
      to investigate the first steps in the disease process that leads to motor neuron
      degeneration, with the goal of identifying early disease targets and points of intervention
      to slow or stop disease onset and progression.

      Unaffected individuals who have either a family member with a known ALS/FTD-associated gene
      mutation or have a strong family history of ALS and FTD are invited to participate in the ALS
      Families Project. For those who enroll, research visits will occur every 6-12 months.
