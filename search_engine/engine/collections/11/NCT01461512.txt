      protective effects during prolonged ischemia in animal studies. The investigators previous
      data confirmed strong HO-1 induction following heme arginate infusion in healthy humans.
      Therefore, the investigators next approach is to evaluate the direct effects of heme arginate
      on short time Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in healthy humans. This will be done by the
      following surrogate markers of IR injury.

      Functional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can measure
      alterations in tissue oxygenation in a high spatial and temporal resolution. This
      non-invasive methods therefore represent a promising technique to evaluate the effects of
      HO-1 induction on energy metabolism and oxygen saturation during ischemic stress and short
      time reperfusion in skeletal muscle.

      As additional outcome, levels of myoglobin and creatine-kinase will be measured in plasma
      according to standard laboratory procedures.
