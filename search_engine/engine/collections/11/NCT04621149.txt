      treatment of non-hospitalized adults recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This will be a
      randomized, blinded placebo-controlled study with respect to the active treatment (chlorine
      dioxide) vs placebo, and randomized open-label with respect to a non-prescription medication
      (famotidine) and supplements including zinc, EGCG and lactoferrin. Treatment will last for 7
      days.
