      Primary

        -  Compare the benefits, in terms of progression-free survival, of maintenance therapy
           comprising erlotinib vs observation in patients with responding or stable disease after
           first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy for high-risk stage I or stage II-IV ovarian
           epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety of erlotinib in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (I-II vs III-IV), participating center, age (â‰¤ 65 vs > 65), response to
      first-line therapy (no evidence of disease/complete response vs partial response vs stable
      disease), and first-line therapy (platinum-based vs platinum/taxane combination vs
      platinum-based triplet). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily for up to 2 years in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation as per standard of care. Quality of life is
           assessed at baseline and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 830 patients will be accrued for this study.
