      biofilm remains the primary etiologic agent of disease; colonization of non-shedding tooth
      surfaces greatly contributes to initiation and progression of gingivitis, for example.
      Although there are currently available chemotherapeutic agents to supplement daily oral
      hygiene measures, one continuous issue is patient compliance. Chewing gum represents a unique
      delivery device for not only drugs and other agents, but food additives that might aid in
      reducing bacteria plaque colonization on tooth surfaces. For example, chitosan and
      chitosan-related food additive preparations have been shown to have some antimicrobial-like
      properties, possibly in the disruption of bacterial colonization (not -cidal).

      NOTE: ALL INGREDIENTS of the "test" chewing gum, and the placebo chewing gum, are generally
      regarded as safe ("GRAS" label by the Food and Drug Administration), as they are common food
      components. For example, chitosan is listed in the GRAS database
      (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/?set=SCOGS). See item GRN No. 397.

      This study aims to determine whether adjunctive use of functional chewing gum will improve
      gingival inflammation status-retaining clinical gains initiated by professional tooth
      cleaning and at home brushing over a 12 week period in gingivitis patients.

      Eligibility criteria and outcome measures are described in the next section.
