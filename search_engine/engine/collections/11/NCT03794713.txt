      risk of cardiovascular events, rehospitalization, and death effectively. Using beta blockers
      is an efficient therapy to management the HR in SAP patients. However, the recent
      epidemiological studies have provided evidences that the rate of beta blocker prescribed and
      used was inadequate, as the first-line therapy to CAD patients with the usage rate less than
      30%. Several studies showed that with a reminder supported by smart phones and wearable
      devices, the adherence of management of patients with chronic disease could be improved
      significantly.Thus,the present study aims to enhance the adherence of beta-blockers by
      Patient Support Tool through a smart phone application and a wristband, subsequently reduce
      the risk of angina attacks.
