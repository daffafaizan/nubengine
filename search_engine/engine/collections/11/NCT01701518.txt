      mitigate much of the residual swelling and retinal thickening that is seen after vitrectomy
      for epiretinal membranes. The unique pharmacokinetics of the sustained released dexamethasone
      implant (Ozurdex®) makes it an ideal delivery system to use post-vitrectomy for epiretinal
      membrane surgery. Its duration of action and its drug delivery characteristics over 6 months
      approximately match the post-operative time course of healing and remodeling in an edematous
      retina.

      This is a prospective, multicentre, pilot study evaluating the efficacy of an intravitreal
      sustained release dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®) injected at the conclusion of surgery in
      15 patients undergoing vitrectomy and membrane peeling for idiopathic epiretinal membranes.
