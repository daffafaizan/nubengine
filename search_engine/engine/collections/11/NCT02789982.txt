      France since World War II. A large number of persons are likely to develop PTSD or
      trauma-related disorders, especially victims directly involved, their families, as well as
      the the first responders. In this context, there is an urgent need to enhance treatment
      resources. Psychotherapy is known to be effective but it is costly, and require qualified
      professionals. Pharmacotherapy (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,SSRIs) is also
      considered effective. However, side effects often lead patients to abandon their treatment.
      An alternative evidence-based intervention is the use of the Î²-adrenergic blocker propranolol
      used to interfere with the reconsolidation of a recalled traumatic memory, so as to reduce
      its strength over time. This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of reconsolidation blockade compared to treatment as usual. The study
      involves four assessments: pre- and post-treatment and 13 weeks and 1 year follow up. The
      outcome measures include: PTSD symptoms, socioeconomic variables, quality of life and social
      functioning measures. The investigators hypothesize that all patients will improve. However,
      patients receiving reconsolidation blockade will recover faster than treatment as usual.
      Finally, investigators hypothesize that reconsolidation blockade will be well accepted both
      by the professionals and the patients.
