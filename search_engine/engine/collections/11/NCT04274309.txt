      temperature. The light is a quartz-tungstene-halogeno (QTH) source and the collected beam is
      filtered to illuminate in different precise wavelength bands in the short wave domain.

      We will use it on tonsil tissue just after tonsillectomy and just before the histological
      analysis.
