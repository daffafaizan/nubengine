      hospital with a problem other than a diabetic emergency. Patients will be included, who have
      a blood sugar > than 17mmols. They will be randomised to one of two groups and either given
      intravenous or subcutaneous insulin. Outcome measures are length of stay, glucose control and
      comparison of the two regimens. Cost implications will also be analysed.
