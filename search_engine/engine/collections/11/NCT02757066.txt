      trial. The trial has five phases; the pre-screening phase, the screening phase,
      double-blinded treatment phase, open label treatment phase and post-treatment phase. The
      screening phase comprises a screening visit where subject's initial eligibility will be
      evaluated. During double-blinded treatment phase, patients who meet all entry criteria for
      the trial will be randomized into three groups, and they will be assigned NPC-15 1 mg, 4 mg
      or placebo before going to bed for 2 weeks. During open label treatment phase, all patients
      will be administered NPC-15 1 mg, 2 mg or 4 mg on the basis of their doctors' judgements.
