      to the COVID-19 pandemic will be invited to provide informed consent to participate in this
      sub-study. Once having consented, participants will be invited to complete the core
      questionnaires by logging into their personal and secured account. Participants will have a
      three-week period to complete the questionnaires, from April 16 to May 7, 2020.

      Core questionnaires in NutriQuébec assess lifestyle habits including eating habits, physical
      activity habits, sleep quality, tobacco, alcohol and drug habits as well as pandemic
      behaviors, personal characteristics, food insecurity, health status and health-related
      quality of life. Most of these questionnaires are based on a one-month recall timeframe, with
      the exception of the eating habits questionnaires, which is in the form of repeated 24-h
      recall. For the purpose of this NutriQuébec substudy, questionnaires were adapted to focus on
      habits during the last 7 days of questionnaire completion, to reflect more specifically the
      confinement period.
