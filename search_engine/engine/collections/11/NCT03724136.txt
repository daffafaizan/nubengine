      and higher order associations including social interactivity that all take place in the
      brain. It requires sufficient health and interactivity of neurons in the brain including
      their ability to form and maintain synaptic connections.

      Cognitive impairment results from the loss of these abilities. ACIST will test the hypothesis
      that the delivery of Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells (BMSC) via the methods in the study with
      or without the addition of Near Infrared Light will improve cognition through the ability of
      BMSC to positively affect the health and function of neurons and the brain.

      Patients enrolling with cognitive impairment will require assessment with the Mini-Mental
      Status Exam (MMSE). A score of 24 or less will be required. Progressive dementias such as
      Alzheimer's Disease (ALZ) show a decline of 2 to 4 points per year on MMSE. The goal for
      ACIST in progressive and stable dementia will be stability over the 1 year follow up and
      ideally an improvement of 3 points on MMSE.

      Patients enrolling with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) will be required to be adults (over 18
      years of age) and to have a score on the Autism Spectrum Quotient of 20 or above. The goal
      will be a decrease of 5 or more on the scale over the 1 year follow up period.
