      cadavers included in the study according to eligibility criteria. After signing of written
      consent form, the participants will be randomized on the height of the block (vertebral level
      - T3, T12 and L4) and the volume to be injected (10, 20 and 30ml). The block will be
      performed by experienced physicians on the technique by ultrasound guidance and fixed
      pressure measured with an in-line pressure monitor (15 psi) with the cadaver in the lateral
      position. The cadavers will be submitted to autopsy by standard thoracoabdominal midline
      incision, with the viscera removed for analysis. The cadavers will have their paraspinal
      muscles removed (quadratus lumborum and psoas major), the medial parietal pleura opened and
      the number of levels with colored solution registered, noting the spread to ventral rami of
      spinal nerves and to the paravertebral space.
