    
      This randomized clinical trial is designed to compare the outcomes of a prescriptively
      applied non-thrust manipulation to a pragmatically applied non-thrust manipulation on
      subjects with mechanical low back pain. The study has two primary aims. Specific Aim 1
      examines immediate effect differences between a pragmatically applied localized non-thrust
      manipulation versus a prescriptively applied, non-localized non-thrust manipulation in
      subjects with mechanical low back pain. Specific Aim 2 examines longer-term differences
      between a pragmatically applied localized non-thrust manipulation versus a prescriptively
      applied, non-localized non-thrust manipulation in subjects with mechanical low back pain. The
      investigators hypothesize there will be no differences between the two applied treatment
      techniques in immediate and longer-term assessments.
