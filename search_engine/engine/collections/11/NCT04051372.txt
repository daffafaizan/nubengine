    
      一) Adult patients with hematology disease under allo-HSCT at any phase of treatment are
      enrolled according to the following criteria:

        1. lung infiltration detection at computed tomography (CT) scan.

        2. Patients with fever, cough, respiratory symptoms. According to the investigators, the
           patients fulfilling these criteria undergo BAL as soon as possible

      二) The BALF samples were tested using such methods

        1. classic microbiological cultures designed for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria.

        2. Detection of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EB virus in serum and BAL was tested using
           a Real-time PCR kit.

        3. Detection of aspergillus galactomannan antigen 1,3-beta-D-glucan in serum and BAL was
           performed using an enzyme immunoassay method.

        4. Cytological and pathogenic microscopic evaluation in BALF

        5. Flow cytological analysis of T lymphocyte subsets in BALF and serum

        6. Cytokine detection in BALF and serum

        7. Microbiology detection in BALF by mNGS

      三) Pathogenic spectrum analysis and Targeted etiological therapy
