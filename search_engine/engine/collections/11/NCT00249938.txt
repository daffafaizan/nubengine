      States. Lowering LDL cholesterol in both patients with and without CHD reduces coronary
      events and death. Statin medications are the primary mechanism of lowering LDL cholesterol,
      but some patients do not reach their goal LDL with maximum tolerated statin doses and must
      utilize combination therapy to further lower cholesterol. Additionally, some patients prefer
      to utilize "natural" mechanisms to lower cholesterol. This prospective, double-blinded,
      randomized study will compare plant sterol (natural cholesterol treatment) with placebo in
      patients treated with combination statin and colesevelam therapy.
