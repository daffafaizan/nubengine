      surgery leads patients to experience changes in food intake and behavior. The aim of this
      study was to assess alimentary habits, food intolerances and gastrointestinal symptoms in
      patients who underwent bariatric and metabolic procedures: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,
      biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal exclusion. We studied 34 patients of both sexes, from
      outpatient clinics in Surgery of Obesity and the Metabolic Surgery at University of Campinas.
      They were submitted to bypass gastric in Roux-en-Y (n=15), biliopancreatic diversion (n=9)
      and duodenal exclusion (n=10). Validated questionnaire for assessment of food tolerance was
      applied in patients with more than six months of follow-up after surgery addressing diet and
      gastrointestinal symptoms. The descriptive and comparative analyses were performed by
      analysis of variance and bivariate correlation. In patients who underwent to bypass gastric
      food intolerance was greats regarding to ingestion of rice (33%) and red meat (33%) in
      comparison to others groups. The flatulence and diarrhea were more prevalent in patients who
      underwent biliopancreatic diversion. The vomiting was more prevalent in patients who
      underwent gastric bypass. Each procedure presents peculiarities to the anatomical and
      functional changes that affect the food absorption. This may have negative effects on the
      nutritional status of patients and affect the quality of life. The nutritional therapy for
      each individual procedure may assist in the management of clinical concerns of operated
      patients
