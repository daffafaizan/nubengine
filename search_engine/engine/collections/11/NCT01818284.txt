    
      Stem Cell Transplant:

      You will receive blood stem cells from a donor on this study. You will sign a separate
      informed consent for the transplant procedure.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      About 1, 3, and 6 months after the transplant, an extra sample of bone marrow (about 2
      teaspoons) will be collected at the same time as the standard of care bone marrow
      aspiration/biopsy procedures. This bone marrow sample will be tested to find out how well the
      donated stem cells have been accepted by your body. However, you will not have a separate
      bone marrow aspiration/biopsy only to collect bone marrow for this testing.

      When you return to the clinic at 6, 9, and 12 months for routine transplant follow-up visits,
      the study staff will try to get information on your health status from the clinic notes in
      your medical record. If this is not possible, you may receive a phone call from the study
      staff to check your health status. These calls will last about 10 minutes.

      Length of Treatment:

      You will be on study for about 1 year after the transplant (including follow-up contact by
      phone, if needed).

      You may be taken off study early if you are not able to follow study directions or if you
      decide to leave the study.

      This is an investigational study. Filgrastim is FDA approved for use in stem cell collection.
      Plerixafor is FDA approved for use in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      Up to 30 donor and recipient pairs will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson.
