    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival (PFS) time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS) time. II. Transplant related mortality (TRM). III. Graft versus host
      disease (GVHD). IV. Infection

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 preparative regimens.

      MYELOABLATIVE REGIMEN 1: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin intravenously (IV) over 4
      hours on days -9 and -8, fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour, clofarabine IV over 1 hour,
      and busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -4. Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI)
      on day -3.

      NON-MYELOABLATIVE REGIMEN 2: Patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)20 positive
      malignancies receive rituximab IV over 6 hours on day -9. Patients receive anti-thymocyte
      globulin IV over 4 hours on days -8 and -7, fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -6
      to -3, and cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on day -6 and undergo TBI on day -1 at the
      discretion of the investigator(s).

      REDUCED INTENSITY REGIMEN 3: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours on days
      -7 and -6, fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV over 30
      minutes on day -2.

      UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo umbilical cord blood transplantation on day
      0.

      NK CELLS INFUSION: Patients receive NK cells IV over 30 minutes between days 30-180.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 7, 14, 28, 45, 60, and
      100 days, and at 6, 9, and 12 months, and then yearly for up to 4 years.
