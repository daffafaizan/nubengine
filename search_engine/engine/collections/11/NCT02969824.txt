      sports-related concussion. The current return to play (RTP) protocol advises complete
      physical and cognitive rest following SRC until patients are completely free of these
      symptoms (i.e. asymptomatic) in order to avoid making symptoms worse and furthering the
      injury. While this initial, post-injury rest period is generally assumed to be beneficial,
      there is currently no scientific evidence supporting this recommendation. In fact, a growing
      body of evidence suggests that prolonged rest may actually hinder the recovery process.

      Emerging research is beginning to show that light-to-moderate aerobic exercise (AE) actually
      provides a positive benefit on the injured brain, thereby helping the recovery process.
      Research has shown this benefit in concussion and other injuries such as stroke, whiplash,
      and low back pain. In fact, a standardized aerobic exercise protocol has been shown to
      improve recovery for individuals with persistent symptoms for an extended period of time.
      While preliminary human investigations using AE interventions after concussion have shown
      promise, these studies are either retrospectively designed, or have focused on individuals
      with persistent symptoms (> 3 weeks).

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a standardized, subacute AE
      intervention in adolescents after SRC, on time to recovery compared to usual care. This study
      will provide meaningful information regarding the utility of AE intervention after
      concussion. Findings from these works may inform future usual care procedures post-injury,
      potentially providing the first known treatment to improve recovery after concussion.
