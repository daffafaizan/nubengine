      platinum-resistant, recurrent or refractory, ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer
      who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols. II. Determine the nature and degree
      of toxicity of docetaxel in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel as a 1 hour continuous intravenous infusion. Courses are
      repeated every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or
      disease progression. All patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for
      3 years, and then until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-56 patients will be accrued for this study.
