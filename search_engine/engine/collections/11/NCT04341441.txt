      Hospital System, the Detroit COVID Consortium in Southeast, Michigan. The participants will
      be randomized in a 1:1:1 blinded comparison of daily HCQ, weekly HCQ, or placebo. A fourth
      non-randomized comparator group of HCW, NHW, DDOT bus drivers, and FR who are currently on
      standard HCQ therapy will be recruited to assess the impact of weightbased daily dosing of
      HCQ as compared to the randomized arms.

      Eligible participants who are asymptomatic for pre-specified signs and symptoms suggestive of
      COVID-19 infection will have a whole blood specimen obtained at study entry.

      Participants will be provided with weekly dosing of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400mg po q
      weekly, daily dosing of HCQ 200mg po q daily following a loading dose of 400mg day 1, or
      placebo. Participants will receive monitoring at each study week visit to assess for the
      development of COVID-19 related symptoms, COVID-19 clinical disease, and medication side
      effects. At week 8 or if diagnosed positive, participants will provide additional samples of
      whole blood and complete the final study questionnaire.

      Data including demographic, clinical results, work duties, location of main work area and
      possible exposures in the community will be collected through questionnaires and EMR review.
      Disease-specific, immunologic, and other serologic marker data will be obtained from stored
      samples.
