      radioactive Iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer(RAIR-DTC). Arm B will recruit the
      advanced medullary thyroid cancer(MTC). Arm C will include the advanced anaplastic thyroid
      cancer(ATC). Arm D will include the differentiated thyroid cancer that unsuitable for 131I
      treatment.

      This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design.

      For arm A, the first stage needs 8 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire remission,
      the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 16 patients to achieve a total
      number of 24 participants enrolled.

      For arm B, the first stage needs 8 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire remission,
      the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 16 patients to achieve a total
      number of 24 participants enrolled.

      For arm C, the first stage needs 13 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire
      remission, the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 30 patients to
      achieve a total number of 43 participants enrolled.

      For arm D, the first stage needs 8 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire remission,
      the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 16 patients to achieve a total
      number of 24 participants enrolled.
