      or without claw toes and striatal foot, is especially common. There is a weak to moderate
      evidence in favor of the use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in the equinovarus foot,
      stiff-knee and in other patterns that may interfere with gait ability. Specifically, BoNT/A
      increases walking speed in stroke patients with spastic equinovarus foot.

      Repeated use of BoNT/A may lead to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies, so its effect
      may decrease over successive infiltrations. Among the differential characteristics of
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) there is a reduced inactivated botulinum neurotoxin content and
      the lack of complexing proteins, which would diminish antigenicity and not suppose a decrease
      of the effect before successive infiltrations.

      The objective of this project is to determine the effect on walking speed of repeated use of
      BoNT/A in post-stroke spinal equinovarus foot in three consecutive injections at 6-month
      intervals and to investigate whether the sustainability of the effect is greater in
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) than in onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®). All patients will receive
      200-300 units of BoNT/A (Xeomin ® or Botox ®) that will be distributed according to the
      individual clinical pattern of spastic equinovarus foot.
