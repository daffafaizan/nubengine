      common occurring mandibular fractures.

      When open treatment is selected, several surgical approaches can be used to expose, reduce,
      and stabilize the fracture site, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
      Surgical approaches to the fractured mandibular condyle are broadly classified into intraoral
      and extraoral approaches. Intraoral approaches can be performed with or without endoscopic
      assistance. The most common extraoral approaches are submandibular, Risdon, preauricular,
      retroauricular, and retromandibular through parotid or through masseter approaches.

      An intraoral approach is time consuming and requires special instruments such as an
      endoscope, and additional training. Furthermore, cases of high fractures and/or medially
      displaced condylar fractures are technically difficult to manage through an intraoral
      approach, incorrect anatomical reduction, condylar head resorption, myofascial pain, and
      malocclusions have been reported to be more common complications following the intraoral
      approach when compared to extraoral approaches.

      In contrast, extraoral approaches are commonly used because they produce better visualization
      of the fracture site and therefore facilitate fracture reduction and fixation. However,
      extraoral approaches are complicated by the risk of injury to the facial, great auricular,
      and auriculotemporal nerves, visible scars, sialoceles, Frey syndrome and salivary fistulas.
