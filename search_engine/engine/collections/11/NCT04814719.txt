    
      This is a follow-up extension study to determine duration of treatment effect and assess
      long-term safety and response to re-treatment with PPS in participants with knee OA pain who
      completed the parent study study (PARA_OA_002).

      Study PARA_OA_006 consists of Follow-up Part 1 and Part 2 and a Treatment Part

      Eligible participants will be enrolled in Study PARA_OA_006 at the completion of the parent
      study and will enter the 6-month Follow-up Part 1. At the end of Follow-up Part 1,
      participants will begin the Treatment Part of the study, continue to Follow-up Part 2, or end
      the study depending on the treatment received in the parent study, their response to
      treatment during the parent study, and/or their response status at the end of the Follow-up
      Part 1

      Participants in the Treatment Part will be administered twice weekly subcutaneous (SC)
      injections for 6 weeks:

        -  The PPS dose regimen will be 1 of the 3 dose regimens evaluated in Stage 1 of the parent
           study and selected by the independent data monitoring committee (DMC).

        -  Placebo will be 0.9% w/v sodium chloride injection.

      The maximum duration of study participation will be approximately:

        -  28 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Part 1 and are not eligible to continue
           to Follow-up Part 2 or the Treatment Part

        -  56 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Part 1 and the Treatment Part

        -  68 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Part 1, Follow-up Part 2 up to Week 40,
           and the Treatment Part

        -  80 weeks for participants who complete Follow-up Parts 1 and 2 or Follow-up Part 1,
