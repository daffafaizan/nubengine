      aid use among adult hearing aid patients, for the first time. I-PLAN is the first
      intervention in audiology that has been developed using the behaviour change wheel. It
      consists of three components; i) provision of written information regarding consequences of
      using a hearing aid and not using a hearing aid, ii) the provision of a physical prompt for
      the purpose of prompting or cueing the behavior (hearing aid use) development, and iii)
      creation of a written behavioural plan for hearing aid use.
