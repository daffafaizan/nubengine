    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S): Gain initial experience imaging head/neck cancer patients using a novel
      PET camera comprising two opposing panels with 1 millimeter spatial resolution.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

        1. Determine the radioactive dose and scan time required for this novel 1 millimeter (mm)
           resolution clinical PET camera.

        2. Images obtained with the 1 mm resolution PET camera will be compared to conventional PET
           imaging (which will serve as gold standard) for image quality and lesion/node
           visualization.
