      biological mechanism tapping the fight-or-flight-response via activation of the sympathetic
      nervous system. When exposed to stress during prolonged periods of time, the immune system is
      affected, leading to physiological as well as psychosocial problems. The consequences of
      untreated high stress can not only turn into reduced job capacity, and work roles conflicts,
      but also into cardiovascular disease, and mental illness such as an anxiety disorder or/and
      depression.

      One common and recommended strategy to manage stress is to exercise regularly. Yoga is an
      umbrella term for a wide variety of physical, mental, and spiritual practices with its roots
      in ancient India. Most previous research on the health effects of yoga has demonstrated
      benefits on psychological health factors including mental stress, anxiety, depression and
      sleep problems.

      The aim of the study is thus to investigate the effects of two types of yoga intervention on
      psychological and physiological health.
