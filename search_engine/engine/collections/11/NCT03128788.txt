      intraoperative or postoperative pain management using continuous thoracic epidural
      catheterization is suggested good option to prevent this potential complication.

      The spread of local anesthetics is influenced by various factors including volume, location
      of needle insertion, speed of injection, patient position, age, weight and height. However,
      there are few studies about the effect of different patient position affeting the epidural
      pressure and the extent of spread of contrast medium during thoracic epidural
      catheterization.

      Studies of lumbar epidural blockade have shown that lateral position can produce 0-3 segment
      more to the dependent position compared to the supine position. When the same amount of local
      anesthetic was injected in supine of sitting position, the most cephalad level of spread was
      indifferent. Recent studies showed that neck flexion demonstrated significant cephalad spread
      of contrast dye in high thoracic epidural blockade. The purpose of this study was to compare
      and evaluate the changes of epidural pressure with extent of spread of contrast medium
      between different posture
