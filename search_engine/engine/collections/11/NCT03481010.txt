      abnormal stresses inside the hip joint and leads to painful arthritis at a young age. Many
      patients develop painful symptoms in their hip before advanced arthritis occurs.

      The periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a surgical procedure that reorients the acetabulum to
      reduce the stresses inside the hip joint. The PAO is very effective at improving symptoms and
      quality of life. However, some patients may have residual symptoms.

      Frequently, people with hip dysplasia will have an MRI done before their surgery, which helps
      to identify other the abnormalities inside their hip joint (e.g., labral tears). These
      abnormalities inside the joint cannot easily be addressed through PAO alone, however they can
      be addressed with hip arthroscopy. Hip arthroscopy is a separate minimally invasive surgical
      procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of the hip joint with a small camera
      and address any abnormalities.

      At present, it is not clear whether performing a hip arthroscopy at the same time as a PAO
      improves patient outcomes after surgery compared to a PAO alone.

      This research project will randomize patients to receive either a PAO alone, or a PAO and a
      hip arthroscopy at the same time. Patients will be followed for 2 years after surgery.
      Symptomatic differences between the two patient groups will be assessed to determine added
      benefit of the hip arthroscopy.
