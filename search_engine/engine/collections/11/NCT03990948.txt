      participation by the sub-investigator. Interested patients will receive information regarding
      the study and receive the information sheet containing the informed consent form. After
      signing the informed consent form, general information will be collected regarding medical
      and demographic data using a short questionnaire. Additional questionnaires regarding
      demographics and menstrual cycle will be collected. Anthropometric measurements will be
      collected for the determination of the length, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference
      and body composition. Finally, blood samples will be collected for the determination of iron
      and inflammation related markers.
