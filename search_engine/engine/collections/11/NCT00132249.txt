      devoted to examining, cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience issues and will utilize state of
      the art technologies to address basic research questions in the following areas: (1)
      Functions of the human prefrontal cortex; (2) Cognitive neuroplasticity in the aging brain;
      (3) Memory; (4) Long-term behavioral and psychosocial outcome; and (5) Neurological studies,
      including an evaluation of post-traumatic epilepsy and repeat clinical measures from Phase -
      II. This testing will be complemented with structural neuroimaging, electroencephalogram
      (EEG) and molecular genetics. The goals of the VHIS - Phase III include providing clinicians
      and scientists new insights into the long term recovery of function following brain injury,
      the role of the prefrontal cortex in executive functions, better predictors of long term
      outcome (including cognitive, neurological, and genetic factors), and the effects of head
      injury incurred in youth on aging and the development of dementia.
