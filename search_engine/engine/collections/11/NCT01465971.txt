      cycle in high altitude is accelerated. If the conscious breathing control vanishes during
      sleep a periodic breathing with alternating episodes of hyperventilation and apnea is the
      result. This circumstance causes repetitive arousals that do not allow a normal sleep
      pattern. The associated adverse effects are fatigue, slow or failed acclimatization,
      weakening of the immune system, lack of motivation and the disability to make rational
      decisions.

      Sleep deprivation is a common reason for the abortion of a trip, accidents and severe forms
      of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS).
