    
      Objective A cross-over study is designed to elucidate if oral vitamin C supplementation can
      reduce inflammation status in maintenance dialysis patients with low vitamin C level and high
      CRP level.

      Patients, Methods and Expected results Patients About 100 dialysis patients were recruited.
      Patients will be divided into two groups, and will be followed for at least 6 months.

      Methods Arm 1(50cases): is given oral vitamin C 200mg per day in the first 3 months, then
      stop oral VitC for the next 3 months.

      Arm 2(50cases): is not given vitamin C in the first 3 months, then switch to receive oral
      VitC 200mg per day in the next 3 months.

      The demographics were recorded. Plasma Vitamin C was measured by high-performance liquid
      chromatography. Serum albumin, prealbumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP),
      ferritin, hemoglobin will be measured.

      Expected results There may be positive effect of vitamin C supplementation on inflammation in
      maintenance dialysis patients with vitamin C deficiency and high CRP level.
