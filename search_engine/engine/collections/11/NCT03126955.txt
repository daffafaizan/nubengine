      localize the side of their symptoms in HELPS syndrome while others are unable to. The purpose
      of this study is to prospectively study which of the following is the diagnostic test of
      choice for patients who are unable to localize their HELPS: 1. CISS MRI sequences, 2.
      interictal laryngoscopy, and 3. unilateral and contralateral Botox injections separated
      3-months apart.

      Both neuroradiologist and otolaryngologist will be blinded to the outcome of surgery and be
      asked "based on your diagnostic test, which side do you believe we should perform MVD
      surgery?"
