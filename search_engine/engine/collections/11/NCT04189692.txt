      remission. Fatigue in patients with chronic diseases can be objectified by the FACIT-F scale.

      Recent publications have tried to assess the prevalence and factors related to fatigue in
      patients with IBD.

      In 2017 one study evaluated the prevalence and predictive factors of fatigue in out-patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease. Fatigue was associated with depression, low quality of life
      and female sex. No association was found with micronutrients or levels of interleukins.

      As there are no effective treatments for fatigue in IBD, another study, recently published a
      study evaluating the role of electroacupuncture in 54 patients with quiescent IBD and
      fatigue, observing that both electroacupuncture and sham acupuncture improved fatigue
      compared to the control group.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the evolution and possible factors associated with the
      persistence of fatigue in patients with quiescent IBD and fatigue included in the two
      previous studies.

      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and fatigue (FACIT-F score < 40) included in these
      two previous studies who agree to participate will fill in questionnaires to assess fatigue,
      anxiety, depression and quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, the
      relationship of other biological factors with IBD-related fatigue will be determined.
