        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with
           gemcitabine with or without capecitabine.

        -  Compare the clinical benefit response, objective tumor response, duration of response,
           and time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      metastases (yes vs no), pain (yes vs no), Karnofsky performance status (60-80% vs 90-100%),
      and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients initially receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 7 weeks.
           After 1 week of rest, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 3
           weeks. Treatment then repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly for weeks 2-7, and then before each
      gemcitabine administration.

      Patients are followed every 9 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
