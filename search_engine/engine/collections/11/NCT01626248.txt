    
      Patients at various timepoints in their MS treatment or who are beginning certain MS
      treatments will be consented and have blood specimens collected to allow for an immunological
      comparison. The decision to treat with disease modifying therapies is made independently from
      this observational study.

      Primary endpoint: To further understand the delineation of lymphocyte cell adhesion marker
      down regulation within a treatment na√Øve patient population and at various stages of
      treatment.

      Secondary endpoint: To understand the correlation between natalizumab pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacokinetics and lymphocyte cell adhesion marker down regulation.

      The results of various biomarkers and immunological testing (including CD62L, LFA-1, sCD62L,
      sLFA-1, sVCAM, VLA-4 saturation, IgG4, CBC with absolute differential) will be compared
      amongst the groups consented. The treatment naive group will be compared longitudinally.
