    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the CFS intervention in patients with advanced
      lung and gynecologic (GYN) cancer (stages III or IV) who have clinically significant levels
      of fear of cancer progression (FOP) or cancer-related distress.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess preliminary effects of the intervention on FOP, cancer-specific distress, anxiety,
      depression, overall symptom distress, metacognitions, and mindfulness.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients attend CFS psychosocial intervention consisting of 7 nurse-led sessions (session 1
      in-person and sessions 2-7 via video conferencing) over 45 minutes each for 8 weeks. Patients
      also complete home practice assignments comprising attention training technique and
      mindfulness practice sessions after each session.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at week 12.
