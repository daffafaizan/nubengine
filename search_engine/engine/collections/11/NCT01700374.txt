      adversity on fetal and infant neuroendocrine development. This study utilizes 3-D ultrasound
      to measure fetal adrenal gland volume, a battery of psychosocial/behavioral assessments to
      determine the degree of maternal stress and prepubertal adversity, and an acoustic startle
      paradigm and Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to assess maternal arousal. This study also
      utilizes an infant stress test to assess infant arousal.
