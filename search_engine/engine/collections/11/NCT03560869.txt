      control at rest and during static exercise. Additionally, we will determine whether or not
      the sympathetic nervous system has a role in mediating blood pressure control at rest and
      during static exercise. This protocol will test healthy young and older adults in a normally
      hydrated and dehydrated condition. This will allow for a within participant comparison.
      Additionally, we will later determine if age alters blood pressure control at rest or during
      static exercise.
