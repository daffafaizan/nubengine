      program (Exergame). Subjects will perform progressive balance exercises such as ankle
      reaching or weight shifting, obstacle crossing, and ankle trail making task (i.e.
      motor-cognitive task). Real-time visual/audio lower-extremity joint motion feedback will be
      provided using wearable sensors (LEGSys, Biosensics LLC, Cambridge, MA, USA) to assist and
      encourage subjects to accurately execute each exercise task. The same wearable sensor
      technology is also used to quantify changes in balance and gait.

      Changes in balance, gait, fear of falling, physical activity, pain, and quality of life
      parameters will be assessed at the beginning and conclusion of the training program.

      Subjects will perform sensor-based interactive balance training (on computer screen), 2 x
      week, for a period of 6 weeks. The training consists of three balance tasks shown on a
      computer screen (1. ankle reaching task or weight shifting , 2. obstacle negotiation task,
      and 3. ankle trail making task (i.e. motor-cognitive task) intended to improve postural
      stability.
