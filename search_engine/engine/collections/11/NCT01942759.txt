      standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) with clinicopathological prognostic factors and compare the prognostic
      value of these indexes in breast cancer in this study. The evaluated and compared parameters
      are SUVmax and ADC according to age, tumour size, lymph node metastasis, receptor status,
      histologic grade, modified Nottingham prognostic index.
