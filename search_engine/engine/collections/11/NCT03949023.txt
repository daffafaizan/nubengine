      vessel measurements, as these measurements guide device selection when interventions are
      warranted.

      The data will be used to determine if there is a significant change in vessel diameter with
      intra-arterial injection of contrast material in cerebral angiography, how changes in force
      of contrast injection augments the significance of the changes in vessel geometry, and the
      extent of propagation downstream from the catheter tip that such changes in vessel diameter
      are detected and found to be significant, as these changes could potentially lead to less
      optimal device selection by providing an overestimation of true vessel diameter.
