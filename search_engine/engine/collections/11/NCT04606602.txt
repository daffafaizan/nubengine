    
      This first-in-human (FIH) study will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of SLN360 after single ascending s.c. doses and multiple doses
      in healthy male and female subjects.

      Up to 9 cohorts of 88 patients with elevated Lp(a) will be enrolled. Each patient will
      receive single or multiple doses of SLN360 or placebo given by subcutaneous (s.c) injection.
