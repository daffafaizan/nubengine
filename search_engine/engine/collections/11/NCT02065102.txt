      will be recruited. Rotational atherectomy and stent implantation will be performed as part of
      routine clinical care. Immediately following stent implantation paired intravascular images
      of the implanted stent will be obtained using both intravascular ultrasound and optical
      coherence tomography. The stent will then be further dilated at high pressure with a non
      compliant balloon and the intravascular images repeated with both intravascular ultrasound
      and optical coherence tomography. The images obtained will be available to the operator to
      guide further treatment.
