      2010 in consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a high volume
      Institution. Patient compliance for each item has been assessed. Each ERAS patient was
      matched with a patient who received standard perioperative care. Match criteria were age,
      gender, malignant / benign disease, and PD prognostic score.
