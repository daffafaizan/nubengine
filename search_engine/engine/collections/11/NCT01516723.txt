    
      A total of 330 patients are randomized to either hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent or
      everolimus-eluting stent after successful recanalization of TCO. Clinical follow-up at 1, 6,
      12 months, 2, 3, 4, 5 year with angiographic follow-up at 9 months. In 60 patients a optical
      coherence tomography is performed during the 9 months follow-up angiography. Quantitative
      coronary and optical coherence tomography analysis is performed by two independent core
      laboratory. The primary end point is in-segment late luminal loss at 9 month angiographic
      follow-up. Secondary angiographic end points include the following; in-stent luminal loss,
      acute recoil, acute gain, net luminal gain, late loss index, minimal lumen diameter,
      percentage of diameter stenosis, in-stent and in-segment binary restenosis and reocclusions
      at 9 months angiographic follow-up. Secondary clinical endpoints include a composite of major
      adverse cardiac events (death, MI and clinically driven target lesion revascularization);
      clinically driven target vessel revascularisation (TVR), target vessel failure (cardiac
      death, MI, clinically driven TVR) and stent thrombosis up to 5 year clinical follow-up.
      Tertiary optical coherence tomography end points at 9 months follow-up are the following:
      Percentage of uncovered stent struts, percentage of malapposed stent struts, tissue strut
      thickness, absolute and percentage of intimal hyperplasia.
