    
      This study is considered the third part ("Phase 3") of a larger study where parts one and two
      were designed to utilize elicitation focus groups to develop effective intervention materials
      (Phase 1) and then refine the developed materials through structured interviews (Phase 2).
      Phase 3 will test feasibility and assess early signs of efficacy of writing interventions. To
      do this, participants will be randomized to one of three arms (one arm will serve as
      control). Those that choose to participate will be asked to complete outcome measures
      (depressive symptoms, suicidality, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, HIV risk behavior) and
      measures of proposed mediators (self-reported and biological stress, behavioral and emotional
      self-regulation) and moderators (e.g., social support, identity centrality) at baseline,
      post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. In addition, structured interviews with 15
      intervention participants will be used to refine study procedures as the investigators scale
      up this intervention for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).
