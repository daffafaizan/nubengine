      preschoolers and disproportionately impact lower socioeconomic status (SES) children. Despite
      a robust evidence base, behavioral sleep interventions are rarely tested with lower-SES
      children or in primary care, an accessible service delivery setting. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the whether the Sleep Well! behavioral sleep intervention is
      feasible and acceptable to families. We will also examine the direction and magnitude of
      change in child sleep from pre-intervention to post-intervention. This is a preliminary open
      trial of the Sleep Well! program with pre-intervention and post-intervention
      assessments.Caregiver-child dyads (child ages 1-5 years with a sleep problem) will be
      recruited from CHOP urban primary care sites.

      Sleep Well! is a brief, behavioral sleep intervention for toddlers and preschoolers who have
      a caregiver-reported sleep problem or who are not getting enough sleep. The intervention
      includes evidence-based behavioral sleep approaches and strategies to engage and empower
      families. The primary outcomes for this open trial are feasibility (number of caregivers
      recruited, engaged, and retained in intervention; participant intervention attendance rate)
      and caregiver acceptability, assessed via a questionnaire and qualitative post-intervention
      interview. Secondary outcomes are the direction and magnitude in any pre- to
      post-intervention change in child sleep.
