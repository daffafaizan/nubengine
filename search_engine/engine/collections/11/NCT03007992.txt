      need for new treatment options after failure of hormonal treatment that prolong the interval
      to the start of intensive cytotoxic therapy, which is commonly associated with impaired
      quality of life (QoL) and potentially serious side effects. In this respect, metronomic
      treatment with daily administration of oral vinorelbine could provide an efficacious
      treatment option with limited toxicities.

      Accordingly, this national, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm phase II trial aims to
      investigate a truly metronomic schedule with daily oral vinorelbine in HR+/HER2-patients with
      metastatic breast cancer resistant to endocrine therapy, by assessing efficacy and safety.
      Oral vinorelbine will be administered at a daily dose of 30 mg (flat dose without any
      adaptation to body weight or body surface area) without breaks. Treatment will continue until
      disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, patient's refusal or investigator's
      decision to stop the treatment.

      In the course of the study, the following interim and final analyses will be done:

      i) 1st interim analysis (safety): This analysis will be performed on the basis of 10
      patients, who were initially included into the study and who are eligible for safety
      evaluation; frequency statistics of (serious) adverse events will be analysed.

      ii) 2nd interim analysis (efficacy): This analysis will be performed at the completion of the
      1st Simon stage.

      iii) Final analysis (complete): This analysis will be performed after completion of the
      follow-up phase (6 months of follow-up after Last Patient Last Treatment).
