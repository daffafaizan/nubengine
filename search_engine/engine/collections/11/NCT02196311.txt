      fixation for supracondylar humerus fractures in children ages 12-18. We are asking parental
      permission to collect information about their child's injury, x-rays, obtain ROM measures,
      collect input from questionnaires, and review other medical information relating to the
      injury.

      The study is NOT about randomizing subjects to treatment, rather we are asking permission to
      keep track of the decisions that are made about our population's treatment and how it impacts
      their recovery.

      The eligibility criteria is subject's between 12 and 18 years, if supracondylar/periarticular
      humerus fracture needed operative fixation, and the fracture is unable to be treated with
      percutaneous skeletal fixation. Patients will be excluded if they have had a previous elbow
      injury, Osteogenesis imperfecta or another fragile bone disease, elbow stiffness from another
      cause, or any pre-existing arm weakness.

      The outcome measures all enrolled subjects will complete are the QuickDASH and the Pediatric
      and Adolescent Outcomes Instruments (PODCI). The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH
      (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Outcome Measure which is intended to measure
      symptoms and functions in people with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The
      QuickDASH is valid and reliable and is used for clinical and research purposes. The PODCI is
      designed to assess patients overall health, pain and ability to participate in normal daily
      activities in patients under 19 years of age. We will only distribute both questionnaires to
      the subjects and we are not collecting parent perception.
