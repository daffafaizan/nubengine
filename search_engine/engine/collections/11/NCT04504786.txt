      program on ADL and functional fitness (lung capacity, body flexibility, range of the joint's
      motion, and muscle endurance) of institutional older adults with sarcopenia. Using
      convenience sampling, 12 long-term care facilities with 114 older adults were recruited, and
      then cluster-randomized by the facility to a VA experimental or a control group. The
      experimental group received the VA program led by certified instructors 3 times per week and
      40 minutes per session for six months; the control group continued with their regular daily
      activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, were conducted.
