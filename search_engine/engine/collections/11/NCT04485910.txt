    
      Purpose:

      To evaluate PGTai results for embryos cultured in sequential versus single step media.

      Method:

      Injected oocytes will divided between Continuous Single Culture-NX media (CSC- NX) with 10%
      SSS the first group (Irvine, USA) and the other group will be cultured in sequential cleavage
      and blastocyst media with 10% SPS (SAGE, Denmark).

      All blastocytes with 4BB quality and better according to Gardner's criteria 1999 will go
      through PGTA procedures with PGTai confirmation.
