      therapeutic modality demonstrated overall positive results in terms of effectiveness (Whiting
      et al. 2001). Previous studies have evaluated the effects of essential fatty acids, vitamins,
      minerals and/or enzymes, with findings do not support the use of a broad-spectrum nutritional
      supplement in treating CFS-related symptoms (Brouwers et al. 2002). Considering the fact that
      patients with CFS have lower levels of high-energy compounds (e.g. phosphocreatine, adenosine
      triphosphate) (Block et al. 1998), effective dietary treatment of CFS should be focused on
      providing compounds that facilitates cellular bioenergetics. Besides other candidate agents,
      guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) could be of particular interest since it occurs naturally in the
      human body and acts as an immediate precursor of creatine (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000).
      Due to its low cost and high bioavailability (Baker 2009), if proven effective dietary GAA
      may be suitable for use in broad CFS population.
