      dexterity are the major problems for motor disability of upper extremity (UE) in patients
      with CP. This study propose two novel treatment protocols: sensory electrical stimulation
      (SES) and virtual reality constraint-induced therapy (VRCIT) to improve function of UE in
      patients with CP. Investigators hypothesize that combined SES and VRCIT treatment have better
      effect than single therapy (SES or VRCIT).
