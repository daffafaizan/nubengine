      of the exclusion criteria. All subjects were scheduled to undergo surgical procedures
      outlined in the inclusion criteria. These surgical procedures were chosen as the patient
      population for this study because these procedures require similar personnel and may require
      access to similar or the same spaces as the ASD procedure.

      The entire ASD study research system was removed prior to proceeding with the subject's
      planned surgery per standard medical practice, which then proceeded according to the standard
      of care.

      Subjects were followed through their routine post-surgery follow-up visit.

      At the time of completing the follow-up visit, the subjects' participation was complete and
      the subjects exited the study.
