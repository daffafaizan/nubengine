    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), open-label (all people involved
      know the identity of the intervention), active-controlled (patients are assigned to either a
      recognized effective treatment or the study medication), parallel-group (each treatment group
      will be treated at the same time), multicenter study comparing DRV/r PEP (DRV/r administered
      with 2 NRTIs selected at the discretion of the investigator) to standard of care PEP (as per
      German-Austrian guidelines) in patients at risk of HIV infection due to HIV exposure through
      occupational injury and non-occupational exposure. This study consists of screening period,
      treatment period and a follow up period. HIV PEP will be administered for a total of at least
      28 days and maximum of 30 days during treatment period, including any prestudy HIV PEP
      initiated before screening. Approximately 318 patients will be screened and enrolled to
      ensure that at least 131 patients are randomly assigned to receive DRV/r PEP or standard of
      care PEP. Safety will be evaluated during the entire study period. Data relating to a
      patient's functional impairment in conjunction with HIV PEP will be collected on Day 1 as
      baseline data, and further on Days 14 and 28 as well as at Month 3.
