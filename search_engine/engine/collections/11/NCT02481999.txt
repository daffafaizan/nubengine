      EEG derived monitoring of the frontal brain waves) can reliably measure the depth of
      anesthesia [MÃ¼nte et al. 2009; Weber et al. 2005].

      Depth of anesthesia in adults is significantly correlated with the incidence of postoperative
      delirium and longer lasting cognitive deficits [Radtke et al. 2013; Chan et al. 2013;
      Whitlock et al. 2014].

      We know from animal experimental studies that anesthetics have a potential toxic effect in
      the developing brain. [Sinner et al 2014].

      After two years (approximately 1/3 - 1/2 of the total sample) an interim analysis with
      recalculation of the case numbers is carried out, if the initial effect sizes differ
      strongly.
