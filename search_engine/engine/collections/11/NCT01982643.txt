    
      Stage 1 will include 20 individuals with severe stimulant use disorder (methamphetamine type)
      enrolled across three study sites. Following a maximum 30-day screening period to establish
      eligibility, participants will receive a monthly injection of extended-release depot
      naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol®) plus once-daily bupropion extended-release tablets (BRP; as
      Wellbutrin XL®) for 8 weeks. Take-home oral study medication (BRP) will be dispensed weekly
      for dosing on non-clinic days. Participants will be asked to attend clinic twice weekly for
      observed BRP dosing, collection of urine samples, assessments, and medical management.
      Following the 8-week active medication phase, participants will complete a follow-up phase,
      including a medication taper and post-medication phase follow-up visit during Week 9. If
      Stage 1 data document success (see criteria below) in at least 3 "responder" study
      participants, Stage 2 will follow utilizing the same protocol as in Stage 1, to enroll an
      additional group of 29 participants. Using the same criteria of "responder" success, if the
      combined stages document success in at least 9 of 49 study participants, the combination
      medication will be considered to have shown sufficient potential to advance to a large-scale
      placebo-controlled trial.
