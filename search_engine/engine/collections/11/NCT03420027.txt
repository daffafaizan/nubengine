    
      All patients who will have to undergo emergent tracheal intubation for any reason in the
      prehospital context or at the emergency department at a single 1100-bed regional and teaching
      hospital in France, will be included in this observational, prospective study, provided that
      neither the patient him/herself, if capable, or next-of-kin if present have declined
      participation.

      Items of the MACOCHA score will be recorded before intubation by investigators, who are all
      certified emergency physicians skilled with urgent tracheal intubation.

      For any intubation procedure, either in the out-of-hospital context or in the Emergency
      Department, one of these emergency physicians is always present.

      The feasibility the quick MACOCHA score calculation before urgent intubation will be assessed
      by the number and percentages of patients for whom all the seven items of the score have been
      collected.
