      this hm-P bandage by using an earlier time for removal of the bandage (e.g. 60 minutes) than
      the current standard of care (e.g. 90-180 minutes) while also reducing the inflated pressure
      of the band, and hence the compressive force put on the wrist of the patient, in increments
      of the % of inflation as per current protocol, with N=20 @ 100%, N=20 @ 75%, & N=20 @ 50%.
      This study will be completed while maintaining vascular integrity and patency through
      visualization in patients undergoing angiographic procedures via anticoagulated, percutaneous
      radial arterial cannulation.
