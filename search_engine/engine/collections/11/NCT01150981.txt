      excess calories in the form of triglycerides, and secreting cytokines that control systemic
      fuel utilization. Sustained excess calorie consumption results in adipocyte hypertrophy and
      hyperplasia, and like any expanding tissue, requires increased capillary expansion to nourish
      the enlarged adipose tissue mass. Recent reports indicate that decreased capillary density in
      adipose tissue of obese individuals correlates with insulin resistance, suggesting that an
      imbalance of angiogenesis and adipogenesis may underlie this condition. To determine whether
      improvement in insulin sensitivity is related to changes in adipose tissue capillary
      development, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine
      capillary density, angiogenic growth potential, and metabolic parameters in healthy human
      volunteers before and after treatment with rosiglitazone, a potent insulin sensitizer.
