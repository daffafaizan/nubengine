      its diagnosis, several physiopathological changes are already taking place, such as insulin
      resistance of target tissues and the progressive inability of pancreatic beta cells to
      produce insulin. The objective of this study is a better understanding of the prediabetic
      stage and mechanisms involved in the possible development of T2D, by way of a five-year
      follow-up cohort study in 207 prediabetic subjects.
