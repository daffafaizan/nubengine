    
      The present study will recruit participants based on a set of defined eligibility criteria,
      in adaptive sports clubs teams and in groups or associations of individuals with an acquired,
      and permanent, physical disability. Based on the presence or absence of a regular sport
      practice undertaken by the subjects who give their written consent to participate in the
      study, they will be divided into two groups: one where individuals regularly practice an
      adaptive sport, and one where they do not.

      A set of defined outcome measures (detailed in the "Outcome Measures"section) will be
      assessed in both groups, only on one occasion. There will be no intervention or longitudinal
      follow-up.

      The outcomes measures will be analysed statistically, using SPSS software. Depending on the
      nature of the variables (qualitative or quantitative), different tests will be performed.
      Normality will also be verified and will determine which statistical analysis will be carried
      out.
