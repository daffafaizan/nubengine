      strategies exist to promote patients' interest in them. Strategies should be developed for
      racial/ethnic minority women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM), who face
      exceptionally high risk for chronic diabetes. We previously found that a theory-based
      outreach message containing a streamlined values affirmation-two sentences prompting
      individuals to reflect on core personal values-increased women's likelihood of demonstrating
      interest in a preventive program. Extending this work, this pilot trial tests whether the
      values affirmation outreach message is as acceptable as (non-inferior to) a standard outreach
      message among African-American and Latina women.

      Methods: Two-arm, parallel-group, randomized trial among English- and Spanish-speaking
      minority women with prior GDM and overweight/obesity in a healthcare system. Within an online
      survey, participants are randomized to read an outreach message promoting an existing
      preventive program. The message contains either a values affirmation (intervention condition)
      or no affirmation (control condition).
