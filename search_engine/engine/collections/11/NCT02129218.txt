      I. To determine the feasibility of following a low or medium glycemic load diet in patients
      with stage I-III (local-regional) colon cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine patient-reported acceptability of diet. II. To determine nutritionist
      resources utilized. III. To evaluate the effect of lowering dietary glycemic load on body
      mass index (BMI), lipid metabolism and pro-oncogenic intermediaries of cellular metabolism.

      OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially enrolled in 1 of 4 possible cohorts as needed based on the
      feasibility of the prior cohort.

      COHORT 1: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention
      (contact with nutritionist in person every 2 weeks with phone contact on the alternating
      weeks) for 12 weeks.

      COHORT 2: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention
      (contact with nutritionist in person every week) for 12 weeks.

      COHORT 3: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention for
      12 weeks.

      COHORT 4: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention
      for 12 weeks.
