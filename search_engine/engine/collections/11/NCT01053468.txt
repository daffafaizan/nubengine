      To compare the effects of an evidence-based intervention consisting of targeted breast-cancer
      specific PA print materials (i.e., Exercise for health), a step pedometer, a step-walking
      guidebook (i.e., Step into survivorship), and a physical activity and step journal (INT) to a
      comparison group receiving a generic, two-page public health PA resource (Standard Material:
      SM).
