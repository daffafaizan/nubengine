      of UCLA employees who report mild to moderate stress. UCLA employees will be randomized to
      either 8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available
      application Headspace) or a waitlist control condition.

      Participants who are assigned to the intervention group will be asked to download and use the
      Headspace mobile application for at least 10 minutes per day for 8 weeks. All participants
      will be asked to fill out short (no longer than 25 minutes) questionnaires at baseline, week
      4, week 8 (post intervention), and a 4-month follow up period. Among participants who are
      randomized to the digital meditation intervention, they will also take part in a 1-year
      follow up. All activities will take place online (via computer or smartphone).

      Prior to randomization, participants will complete an eligibility screening and complete the
      baseline questionnaire battery. The entirety of the study is digital and there are no
      in-person assessments. Adherence will be tracked remotely. The goal is to recruit as many as
      1000 participants (500 per condition).
