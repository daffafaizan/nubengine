    
      Objective: The aim of this study is to verify safety and tolerability of the immediate switch
      from rasagiline to safinamide trough monitoring of BP by 24-hour Holter recording. The
      primary objective of the study will be achieved if the mean BP will not increase by >10 mmHg
      in the studied population.

      Methods: This is an open-label, single-centre study conducted at IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana.
      Study population included patients with idiopathic PD in the mid-late stage of the disease,
      suffering from motor fluctuation, on stable treatment with rasagiline and Levodopa (alone or
      in combination with other anti-parkinsonian medication). The protocol contemplates five
      visits during six weeks, with two 24-hour Holter recording (first in rasagiline and second in
      first-day of safinamide therapy), monitoring typical symptoms of the serotonin syndrome.
