      Regenerative Endodontic Procedures (REPs) as infection prevents regeneration, repair and stem
      cell activity . A suitable material for using as intra-canal medicament seems to be
      antibiotic. Triple antibiotic paste (TAP) containing metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and
      minocycline has been reported to be a successful regimen in controlling the root canal
      pathogen and in managing necrotic young permanent tooth .

      Recently, new disinfection methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of
      conventional disinfecting protocols that they may neither reduce the number of bacteria to a
      satisfactory level nor minimize the toxicity to periapical stem/progenitors . Other concerns
      regarding the use of TAP are tooth discoloration after treatment and bacterial resistance.
      Photo-activated oral disinfection is a novel disinfection method which present a great
      solution for the problem associated with triple antibiotic paste
