      health problems in the United States resulting from unprotected sexual activity. Women with a
      history of incarceration are at increased risk for these problems given the high rates of
      substance abuse and commercial sex work in this population. This proposal is designed to
      evaluate an innovative intervention Motivational Interviewing with Computer Assistance (MICA)
      designed to improve contraceptive use for incarcerated women who do not want a pregnancy and
      are soon to be released into the community. The investigators will utilize the Title X
      program which, in conjunction with RI Department of Corrections (RI DOC), provides
      reproductive health services in jail and then transitional services in the community after
      release. The investigators plan to recruit 400 women from the RI DOC women's jail and
      randomize them to two interventions: two sessions of personalized MICA or two sessions of
      Didactic Educational Counseling (DEC), both delivered individually by trained counselors. The
      two counseling interventions will be similar in length and timing, but will vary in content,
      counseling style and the individualized computer generated feedback that is reviewed with the
      counselor.
