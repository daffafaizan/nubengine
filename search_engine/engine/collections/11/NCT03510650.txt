      with suspected or diagnosed HLH/sepsis) to determine a cytokine panel (c reactive protein
      (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IL-33, tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) α, interferon (IFN) ɣ, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), the EBV and CMV
      viral loads, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies and -antigen, perforin,
      fibrinogen, triglycerides, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, liver transaminases, sodium,
      serum albumin, electrophoresis, glycosylated ferritin, the microRNAs miR-205-5p, miR-194-5p
      and miR-30c-5p, perforin, CD107a and high immune status (differential blood count, T cells, B
      cells, NK cells, T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, CD4 / CD8 ratio, HLA-DR of CD8 +, CD11a
      of CD8, CD57 of CD8, CD28 of CD8 +, HLA-DR of monocytes, CD56bright and CD69 of NK cells).
      The results of this study serve the development of new clinical concepts in order to safely
      diagnose HLH at an early stage, to distinguish from sepsis and to reduce the fatal
      consequences.
