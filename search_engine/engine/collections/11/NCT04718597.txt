      repair from 17% to 6% since the introduction of robotic assisted surgery. This reflects a
      change in indication for complex hernias from an open to a minimal invasive approach. One of
      the typical indications for open approach before adopting the robotic platform were groin
      hernias after previous abdominal prostatectomy. Since prostatectomy results in scarring of
      the retropubic area where we need to dissect during MIS groin hernia repair, an open anterior
      approach is often suggested. With the enhanced view and instrument dexterity of the robotic
      platform, the investigators have now changed to a minimal invasive approach in these
      patients.

      Therefore, this study will evaluate the clinical outcome after robotic assisted repair of
      groin hernias in patients who previously underwent an abdominal prostatectomy in comparison
      to open groin hernia repair.
