      volunteers:

        -  To capture residual concentration of antibiotics in colon without interfering with their
           systemic pharmacokinetics parameters.

        -  To explore the influence of DAV132 to prevent the modification of gut flora due to
           antibiotic.

      In addition, the security and acceptability of DAV132 used during 7 days will be evaluated.

      The proposed study is prospective, randomized, controlled, four parallel groups, repeated
      doses, open-label study blinded to analytical and microbiological evaluations.
