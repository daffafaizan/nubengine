      success rates to abdominal sacrocolpopexy (93-99%) for the surgical treatment of pelvic organ
      prolapse, it has not been widely adopted due to the increased operating time and steep
      learning curves associated with laparoscopic suturing and knot-tying. For these reasons,
      robotic systems have been advocated for this technique. The objective of this study is to
      conduct a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial of robotic assisted versus
      traditional LscASC in the treatment of patients with apical vaginal prolapse stages II-IV
      (prolapse from 1 cm proximal to the hymen to all points distal).

      This is a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Robotic assisted LscASC
      will be performed using the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA,
      USA) in a similar manner as that described above for conventional laparoscopy. Data points
      recorded during the procedure will include: operating room time of entry and exit, time from
      incision to closure and time taken for the suturing aspect of the case. From this
      information, the operating room costs and anesthesia costs, i.e., the amount that a provider
      must pay for goods or services, will be calculated. Estimated blood loss, perioperative and
      post-operative complications, and number of days in the hospital will be studied as will
      cost-effectiveness and impact on HRQOL
