      provides opportunities for novice endoscopists to learn basic ERCP skills without a patient.
      In two randomized controlled trials (RCT), coached EMS practice increased selective bile duct
      cannulation success rate of novice endoscopists. Surgical trainees do not have sufficient
      endoscopy experience to meet the perceived basic requirement for ERCP training. However, ERCP
      is done with a side-viewing scope and even experienced GI trainees have difficult initially
      mastering the basic skill with scope manipulation and cannulation. It is not known whether
      EMS can provide additional benefit to novice surgical ERCP trainees.
