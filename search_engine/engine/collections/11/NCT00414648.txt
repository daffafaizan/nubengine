      It is believed to be caused by defects within cellular pathways that regulate nutrient
      uptake, cell size, cell migration, and cell proliferation. The disease is caused by mutations
      in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes. Individuals with LAM often experience pneumothorax
      and chylothorax, as well progressive loss of lung function. LAM is frequently fatal and
      existing therapies for the disease have not proven effective. Lung transplantation can be
      considered as a last option, but alternative treatments are needed. Sirolimus is an
      immunosuppressive drug that is often used in people who have had kidney transplants. It
      directly affects the genetic pathway that causes LAM. This study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of sirolimus in stabilizing or improving lung function in people with LAM.

      Individuals interested in participating in this 2-year, double-blind study will first report
      to the study sites for pulmonary function testing to determine their eligibility for
      participation. Participants deemed eligible will be randomly assigned to receive either
      sirolimus or placebo for 1 year. Sirolimus or placebo will be administered in 2 tablet doses
      (2 mg for sirolimus) for the duration of the study. Study visits will occur at baseline, Week
      3, every 3 months for 12 months, and Months 18 and 24. Study visits will include a physical
      exam, questionnaires, a pregnancy test, blood and urine collection, and functional lung
      tests. A 6-minute walk test will occur at most study visits; a chest x-ray will be taken at
      baseline and Month 24; and a volumetric computed tomography scan will occur at baseline,
      Month 12, and Month 24. Adverse events, medication side effects, and lung function will be
      assessed at each visit.
