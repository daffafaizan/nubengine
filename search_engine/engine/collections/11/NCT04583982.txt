      of the current pandemic. Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (Adaptive) has developed an
      immunosequencing technology, called immunoSEQ®, which utilizes polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and quantify rearranged T-cell
      receptor (TCR) gene sequences from peripheral blood, collectively referred to as the T-cell
      repertoire. The T-cell repertoire can be further analyzed using indication-specific
      algorithms that are based on disease-associated TCR sequences.

      Adaptive has developed a clinical test called T-Detect™ SARS-CoV-2, which is intended to
      identify a T-cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, indicating recent or prior infection. In
      this investigational study, Adaptive plans to clinically validate samples acquired from
      patients with COVID-19 and present results for an eventual EUA-submission for the T-Detect™
      SARS-CoV-2 Assay. T-Detect™ SARS-CoV-2 is a single-site assay performed at Adaptive
      Biotechnologies Corporation.
