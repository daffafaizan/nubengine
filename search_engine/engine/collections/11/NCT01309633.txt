    
      -  Primary objectives

             1. To determine the pathological CR* rate of intermittent sunitinib or bevacizumab
                administered with combination cisplatin and gemcitabine as systemic therapy for
                locally advanced or metastatic NPC.

             2. To determine the safety and tolerability of intermittent sunitinib or bevacizumab
                administered with combination cisplatin and gemcitabine as systemic therapy for
                locally advanced or metastatic NPC.

        -  Secondary objectives

             1. To determine the clinical RR (complete and partial response)+ of intermittent
                sunitinib or bevacizumab administered with combination cisplatin and gemcitabine as
                systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NPC.

             2. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects (imaging, circulating and tissue) of
                intermittent sunitinib or bevacizumab administered with combination cisplatin and
                gemcitabine as systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NPC.

             3. To evaluate the early pharmacodynamic effects (imaging, circulating and tissue) of
                2 loading doses of sunitinib (ie., 12.5mg or 25mg) and 2 dose level of bevacizumab
                (ie. 7.5mg/kg or 2.5mg/kg) given 1 week prior to administration of cisplatin and
                gemcitabine chemotherapy.
