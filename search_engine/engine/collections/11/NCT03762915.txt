    
      A randomized controlled clinical trial of a control (SRP) group and an experimental (SRP with
      minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg) group is planned.

      The intervention of minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg will be administered in the
      experimental group at baseline and the three month periodontal maintenance visit. Saliva
      samples, GCF, and blood serum will be collected at four time points (baseline, 1, 3, and 6
      month follow up). Saliva will be analyzed for overall pathogen burden. GCF will be analyzed
      for Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Serum will be analyzed
      for C-reactive protein (hsCRP), haptoglobin (Hp), hemoglobin A1c (Hgb A1c), IL-1, IL-6, and
      TNF-α.
