      mixed. One approach to stemming the development of obesity in childhood is to alter
      children's choices and environments in ways that promote food literacy, acceptance of healthy
      foods, physical activity and self-regulation. Research on factors that influence the
      development of obesity in children has identified factors in children's environments that are
      potential targets for prevention programs. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy
      of components designed for a preschool-based approach to preventing obesity in children.
      Using an innovative approach to optimizing behavioral interventions, the multiphase
      optimization strategy (MOST), we will examine the effects of a 28-week, randomized set of
      experiments designed to (1) increase children's nutrition knowledge, (2) increase physical
      activity in childcare settings, (3) increase emotional, behavioral and eating-related
      regulation, and (4) provide guidance to parents/caregivers about appropriate parenting and
      child-feeding strategies that promote healthy eating behaviors, dietary patterns and physical
      activity in preschool-aged children. Participants will include over 1300 predominantly
      low-income preschool children ages 3 to 5 years attending center-based childcare settings in
      Pennsylvania (~100 classrooms). The proposed study will provide information on the most
      efficacious components that produce measurable changes in children's nutrition knowledge and
      obesity-related behaviors. The results of this study will be used to inform the design of a
      randomized controlled trial to prevent obesity in children.
