    
      This is a multicenter, randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      sponsor, physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned study drug), Phase III study to
      compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of TMC435 (in development for treatment of
      chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection) versus placebo (a preparation containing no drug
      used as control) as part of a treatment regimen including peginterferon-alpha (PegIFNα-2a)
      and ribavirin (RBV) (both current therapies for HCV) in adult treatment-naïve patients
      (patients who have never taken HCV medications) with genotype 1 Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection. The study will consist of a screening period with a maximum duration of 6 weeks, a
      response guided 24- or 48-week (TMC435 treatment groups) or 48-week (control group) treatment
      period, and a post-therapy follow-up period up to 72 weeks after the start of treatment.
      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive TMC435 or placebo,
      stratified by HCV genotype 1 subtype and IL28B genotype within each country. In the first 24
      weeks, patients will receive 12 weeks TMC435 100 or 150 mg or placebo once-daily (q.d.) plus
      PegIFNα-2a plus RBV, after which they will continue with PegIFNα-2a and RBV. Response-guided
      treatment criteria will be used to determine PegIFNα-2a and RBV total treatment duration of
      24 or 48 weeks for patients in the TMC435 treatment groups. In the control group, all
      patients will be required to complete 48 weeks of treatment with PegIFNα-2a and RBV. In all 3
      treatment groups, there will be a post-therapy follow-up period up to 72 weeks after the
      start of treatment. The total study duration for each patient will be a maximum of 78 weeks
      (including the 6-week screening period).
