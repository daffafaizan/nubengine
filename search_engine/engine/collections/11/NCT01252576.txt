      be carried out in parallel by two independent, native Italian-speaking professional
      translators, with English as their first foreign language. A first consensus meeting, which
      will involve the two translators and the research group, to compare the Italian versions and
      yielded a first-consensus Italian version of the scale. After this first phase the study will
      conduct in multiple Italian centres located in Northern, Central and Southern Italy. At each
      centre, the FSFI will administer to a female population of subjects with and without sexual
      dysfunction. Women will be administer the questionnaire at baseline and 2 weeks later, so as
      to evaluate the test-retest reliability. The patients will ask whether encountered any
      difficulty (ease of completion, comprehension, problems, etc). The number of patients who
      will encounter problems in correctly understanding questions and precoded answers will be
      recorded and discussed. Will also ask the women to indicate the way to ameliorate the test,
      and, if possible, the changes will be performed. A back-translation of the Italian consensus
      version will be carried out by a native American English-speaking professional translator,
      with Italian as her first foreign language, to control the adherence of translation with the
      original one. The final Italian version of the FSFI will be obtained.
