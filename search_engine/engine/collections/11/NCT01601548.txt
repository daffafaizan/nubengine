      conducted in eight weekly class sessions that are 2-2.5 hours in length. During class
      sessions, participants are presented with mindfulness meditation techniques and share their
      experiences related to these meditation practices. There is a home practice component with an
      expectation of regular home meditation practice of 45 minutes per day. In addition to home
      meditation practice there are often reading assignments and reflective exercises that relate
      to mindfulness. A full day retreat generally occurs in the second half of the course,
      providing an opportunity for class participants to gain extended experience with mindfulness
      techniques.
