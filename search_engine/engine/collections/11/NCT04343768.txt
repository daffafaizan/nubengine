      safety profile. Based on possible therapeutic effects, We decided to lead An Investigation
      into Beneficial Effects of Interferon Beta 1a, Compared to Interferon Beta 1b And The Base
      Therapeutic Regiment in Moderate to Severe COVID-19. In a 2003 study, SARS was treated with
      different human interferons and found that IFN-β was 5 to 10 times more effective than other
      types of interferons and the strongest antiviral drug possible against SARS-CoV.

      The present study is a randomized clinical trial, with the approval of the ethics committee
      will be conducted on patients who have a positive test confirming COVID-19 in Loghman Hakim
      Medical Education Center in Tehran.

      Patients will be allocated to three therapeutic arms (Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir /
      Ritonavir + Interferon-β 1a group and Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir / Ritonavir +
      Interferon-β 1b group and the Base Therapeutic Regiment Group, i.e., Hydropinchloroquine + /
      Ritonavir. For this purpose, we will use the method of Balance Block Randomization for three
      groups.

      After completing the course of treatment and collecting and analyzing the necessary
      information from each patient, the results of the study will be published both on this site
      and in the form of an article in a reputable international journal.
