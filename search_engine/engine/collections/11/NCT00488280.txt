      walking. It is based on animal studies investigating walking recovery after spinal cord
      injury and the nervous system's control of walking. Normal walking is achieved through the
      interaction of multiple levels of the neural axis (cortex, brain stem, spinal cord). However,
      a basic rhythmic walking pattern is generated by central pattern generators (CPGs) located
      within the spinal cord. Investigations of central pattern generators indicate that sensory
      input specific to the task of walking can enhance the firing of these spinal neuronal
      centers. Thus, LT is an intensive walking program designed to provide sensory input to the
      spinal cord so that the neural output from the spinal CPGs can be maximized. In addition, LT
      uses a treadmill and a harness to provide partial body weight support enabling persons with
      injury to repetitively practice walking in a safe, enabling environment.

      Children enrolled in the study (after medical clearance and consent to participate) will
      undergo extensive testing and complete 12 weeks of locomotor training. Testing will examine
      the child's neurologic and functional status. Tests to examine functional status include:
      ASIA evaluation of sensory and motor function, gait analysis, comprehensive strength tests,
      and assessment of skills such as cycling, stepping, and kicking. Tests to examine the child's
      neurologic injury include: MRI, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), and reflex testing.
      Locomotor training will be conducted daily (5 days/ week) for a total of 60 sessions over 12
      weeks. During training children will work closely with therapists, researcher, and trainers
      to practice walking skills on the treadmill and over-ground.
