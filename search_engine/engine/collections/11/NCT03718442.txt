      However, those devices use high thermal energy that might impact the margin cellular
      architecture and as such the quality of margin assessment by the pathologist. Moreover,
      recently, modern low thermal energy dissection devices have been introduced to the market.
      However, the impact of those devices on reducing the thermal injury/artifact on surgical
      margin has not been well investigated. 4,5 While Ruidaz et al. 2011 data suggest that using
      the traditional electrosurgical device in place of the low thermal-injury device results in
      48% of the close margin samples being negatively converted to false-positive, and in 11%
      converting from close to false-negative, there is still a need for more studies to further
      characterize the utility of those devices. 6 PhotonBlade (Invuity, San Francisco, CA, USA)
      has been approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). PhotonBlade is a
      dynamic precision illuminator with enhanced energy delivery dissection device. The dynamic
      precision illumination is a thermally cool illumination technology that allows a uniformal
      illumination without glare or shadow. 7 The enhanced energy delivery technology allows low
      thermal spread, surgeon controlled edge temperature, and wet field use.7 As such,
      PhontonBlade allows better blade control for achieving adequate visualization, hemostasis,
      with a minimum collateral damage to the surgical margin tissue. The use of PhotonBlade
      demonstrated the least penetrating thermal tissue damage/spread when compared to other modern
      dissection devices (Valleylab Pencil, Valleylab EDGE Coated Pencil, PlasmaBlade 3.0S and
      PlasmaBlade 4.0).8
