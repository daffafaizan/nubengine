      contusion of the spinal cord, which extends from foramen magnum to cauda equina.These
      patients experience various complications and organ system damage in the chronic period.Their
      self-dependence is affected by the level of injury. One of the most important factors
      affecting the self-dependence of people with SCI is the strength of the upper
      extremity.Strong upper extremities are needed for independent transfer from bed.

      SCI patients member of Turkish Spinal Cord Injury Association, according to the criteria for
      inclusion in the study patient list was created. In accordance with the sample size with the
      random numbers prepared with a computer program from this list, 18 people were planned to be
      included in the study. The patients were planned to be randomly divided into the study and
      control groups.Reformer pilates was planned, suitable for the disabled, with an instructor
      for the patients in the study group for 8 weeks; A home exercise program with telephone
      monitoring was planned for the patients in the control group for 8 weeks.It was planned to
      record the demographic data of the patients (age, gender, occupation, additional disease).It
      was planned to fill the SF-36 form to measure the quality of life of the patients, SCIM-III
      forms to evaluate functionally and measure the upper extremity muscle strength with a hand
      dynamometer.

      At the end of 8 weeks, the patients were called for an examination, and SF-36, SCIM-III forms
      were filled and muscle strength was measured, and the comparison was aimed within the group
      and between the groups.In our study, our aim is to demonstrate the applicability of the
      reformer pilates program in SCI patients. In addition, to show the effects of home exercise
      program and reformer pilates programs on upper extremity muscle strength in SCI patients with
      multiple comparison tests.
