      is recommended to add hysteroscopy to the routine infertility work-up to achieve a better
      assessment of infertility cases.

      In 2016, hysteroscopy as a predictor test of tubal patency and tubal peristalsis was
      introduced. It is concluded that hysteroscopic bubble suction test is a good initial
      screening test for tubal patency nearly comparable to HSG and DL. It should be attempted in
      every case of OH prior to referral for more invasive HSG or laparoscopic chromopertubation
      test.

      Thereafter, some authors tried the same idea of bubble suction test and were
      over-enthusiastic with this test and considered it superior to hysterosalpingography (HSG) in
      detection of tubal patency in infertile women. They wrongly described HSG as a historic tool
      despite being recommended as a basic infertility test by many organizations. Some authors
      criticized the results of these studies and underestimated their clinical implication. One of
      the objections were lack of differentiation between normal tubes and damaged or narrowed but
      still patent tubes.

      Aim of the work:

      To test whether bubble suction test and osteal peristalsis are preserved or lost in cases
      with hydrosalpnix.

      Design: A prospective double blinded randomized controlled trial.
