      osteoporosis, but the effects are small. When estrogen replacement is given to
      post-menopausal women the effectiveness of exercise training for improving bone mineral
      density is increased. Currently many women are concerned about the risks of taking
      hormone-replacement therapy and are seeking alternative therapies. The purpose of our study
      therefore is to use an estrogen-like dietary supplement derived from soy called a
      phytoestrogen (soy isoflavone) combined with exercise training for improving bone mineral
      density.

      Comparisons: Four groups are being compared: 1) Exercise training (i.e. weight lifting 2
      times per week and walking 4 times per week) plus soy isoflavone (90 mg aglycone equivalents
      per day); 2) Exercise training plus placebo; 3) Exercise placebo (flexibility exercises four
      times per week) plus soy isoflavone; 4) Exercise placebo plus placebo.
