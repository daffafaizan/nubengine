      of quetiapine as compared to placebo in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. This
      will be an 8-week open-label sertraline trial followed by a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group prospective study. Participants will first receive
      sertraline (25-200 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Patients who remain symptomatic - are considered
      refractory - and meet inclusion criteria will be randomized and enter the double-blind phase.
      They will receive either adjunctive quetiapine (25-400 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The
      primary outcome measures are change in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale(LSAS) and Clinical
      Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The proposed sample size is 80 subjects.
      Patients will be discontinued from the study if needed due to ineffectiveness or excessive
      side effects. Measurements of changes in efficacy and side effects will be carried out every
      weekly visit. Enrollment will occur over 12 months.
