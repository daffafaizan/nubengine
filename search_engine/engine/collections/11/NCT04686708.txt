    
      The volume and disease severity of emergency general surgery admissions between the first
      six-month period of the pandemic and the similar time period in the prepandemic period in
      2019 will be compared.

      Patients admitted during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 11 to
      September 11, 2020, will be included. As a comparison group, similar data will be collected
      on patients admitted to the general surgery department during the same period in 2019.
      Patient and disease characteristics, including demographics, initial leukocyte and C-reactive
      protein levels, diagnosis, treatment strategies, complications, duration of hospital stay,
      30-day rehospitalization rate, and 30-day reoperation rate will be reviewed. Complications
      will be classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification. Tokyo Guidelines 2018/2013 will
      be used to assess the severity of the acute cholecystitis.

      After the patients are divided into two groups: (1) prepandemic period and (2) pandemic
      period, descriptive statistics will be presented as the medians and ranges, and frequencies
      (%). Associations between variables will be evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test (for
      continuous variables) or Pearson's chi-square and Fisher exact tests (for categorical
      variables), where appropriate.
