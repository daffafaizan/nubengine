      with preserved systolic ventricular function and AV block. Through this study, investigators
      intend to elucidate the best post TAVI pacing strategy, comparing the effect of right apical
      pacing vs. physiological pacing on the evolution of both echocardiographic and clinical
      parameters.

      Investigators will include 24 patients without ventricular dysfunction (LVEF> 50%) and with
      AV block pacing indication after TAVI.

      Patients will be randomized to 2 types of pacing (parallel randomized trial): physiological
      or right ventricular pacing (conventional).

      PHYS-TAVI trial will analyze the following parameters in the 2 groups: survival; NYHA class;
      distance in the 6-minute walking test; hospital admissions; left ventricular function;
      echocardiographic asynchrony (strain and flash septal); NTproBNP; and quality of
      life/symptoms with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire test (KCCQ-12)

      Clinical, and echocardiographic follow-up will be performed for 1 year.
