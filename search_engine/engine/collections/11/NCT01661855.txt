      with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The data for pharmacologic treatment of repetitive
      behaviors in this disorder has also become difficult to interpret given that the last two
      large multisite trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism are
      reported to be negative for the treatment of repetitive behaviors. Only the associated
      symptom of irritability has 2 drugs with FDA indications whereas no systematic data exists on
      the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety in ASD, and response to rates to stimulants for
      hyperactivity are lower than what is seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      In addition, there are no biological markers of treatment response identified in this
      population at this point. This study will examine the potential efficacy and safety of
      riluzole for core and associated symptom domains of autism and will explore biological
      markers of safety and treatment response.
