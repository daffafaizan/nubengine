    
      Echocardiography is performed prior to measurement to exclude patients with heart valve
      abnormalities.

      Patients without spontaneous ventilation ( deeply unconscious, sedated or sedated and
      paralysed), ventilated with controlled mechanical ventilation mode with tidal volume 6-8
      ml/ideal body weight, resulting in EtCO2 35-45 mmHg, with PiCCO catheters implemented have
      additionally NICCOMO device attached. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set to achieve
      saturation >96% at positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 cmH2O.

      Measurement of cardiac output are performed on expiration at PEEP 0, 5, 10, 15 20 cmH2O and
      at optimal PEEP (obtained from P-V curve). Simultaneously CO value from impedance device is
      noted. Other haemodynamic parameters, calculated by both devices are also noted - stroke
      volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance
      (SVR), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI).
