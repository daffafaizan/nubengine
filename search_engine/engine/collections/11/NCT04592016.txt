      6 healthy adult volunteers. The pilot study aims to develop the optimal study design for the
      pivotal study by defining the dose of the reference product (diclofenac sodium gel 1%) and by
      evaluating the absence of significant systemic cross-talk (systemic redistribution) and
      lateral diffusion (cross-talk between adjacent treatment sites), which could increase
      background drug levels in the dermis that might confound the discrimination of dermal PK
      profiles between different products. Additionally, the suitability of a non-equivalent test
      product to serve as negative control for BE relative to the reference product will be
      evaluated.

      The pivotal study will involve 20 healthy adult volunteers. In each volunteer the dermal PK
      profile of three different diclofenac products will be assessed in 6 topical treatment sites
      using dermal open flow microperfusion (dOFM), where the diclofenac penetration will be
      measured from baseline to 12 h post-dose. BE of the reference product against a generic test
      product (positive control) and against a non-equivalent test product (negative control) will
      be evaluated.
