      challenge and public health problem resulting in significant hospitalization rates, mortality
      and morbidity, and huge personal and societal costs. This project involves research for
      better public health and health outcomes acknowledging the need for improvements in the
      health-care services in the prevention of risks and harm and better risk-factor management.
      We will conduct a randomized control study in four GP practices with ≥3 GPs and ≥one nurse
      among 154 people at risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) or manifest disease,
      and 154 people in the control group. Inclusion criteria are Diabetes Risc Calculator
      (FINDRISC) ≥ 15 or HbA1c ≥6,5 % or specific need for individualized follow up such as Body
      Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30. In addition, we will conduct a feasibility study among 30 people with
      risk for Chronic Pulmonary disease (COPD) or manifest disease. The study has the following
      two objectives: 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of a team-based follow-up program among
      people with risk for T2DM or manifest T2DM with the use of Guided Self-Determination (GSD) as
      an empowerment approach for patients in general practice, 2) to test the feasibility and
      pilot a team-based follow-up program among people with risk for COPD or manifest COPD with
      the use of GSD as an empowerment approach for patients in general practice.
