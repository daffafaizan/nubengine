      social, emotional, and vocational function, and preserving the structure and integrity of
      joints. While disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have long been the cornerstone
      of RA therapy, the limitations of DMARDs have become increasingly apparent and investigators
      continue to gain insight into the pathogenesis of this disease. Recent evidence suggests that
      treatment earlier in the disease process with more aggressive approaches results in superior
      long-term outcomes compared to less intensive treatment regimens. Specifically, there is
      growing interest in the possibility that early "aggressive" treatment with combinations of
      DMARDs as initial treatment in efforts to potentially reduce the proportion of patients that
      advance to severe disability.
