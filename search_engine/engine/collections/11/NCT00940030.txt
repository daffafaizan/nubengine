      intraabdominal abscess) are associated with increased mortality, postoperative hospital stay
      and costs. From a recent metanalysis and randomized clinical trial there is the emerging
      evidence that mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) before elective colorectal surgery is not
      associated with reduction of SIS, although it causes high discomfort for patients. On the
      same way other more recent studies show that MBP may cause an higher incidence of SIS, and
      that MBP may alter the bowel mucosa morphology. Other Authors report an increased incidence
      of anastomotic leakage requiring surgery for patients undergoing a single preoperative
      phosphate enema whereas but an higher cardiovascular mortality for patients undergoing MBP.
      Two recent studies do not clarify the usefulness of MBP for reducing SIS after colorectal
      surgery and one stage anastomosis. For these reasons a more precise understanding of the
      relationship between MBP and SIS could increase patients satisfaction and decrease
      unnecessary procedures and costs. At this point MBP represent the clinical standard for
      patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery at the European Institute of Oncology.
