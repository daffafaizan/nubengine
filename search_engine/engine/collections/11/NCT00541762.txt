      double blind, crossover studies.

      Subjects and Methods: CCK and neurotensin release were quantified in: 1) 12 subjects
      receiving an ID fat infusion with or without 60 mg orlistat, an irreversible inhibitor of
      gastrointestinal lipases, in comparison to vehicle. 2) 12 subjects receiving ID long chain
      fatty acids (LCF), ID medium chain fatty acids (MCF) or ID vehicle. 3) 10 subjects receiving
      ID LCF with and without the CCK-1 receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide (DEXLOX) or ID vehicle
      plus IV saline (placebo). Hormone concentrations were measured by specific RIA systems.
