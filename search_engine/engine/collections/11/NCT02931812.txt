      prevalence and greatly increases the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Malnutrition
      results of numerous causes including intestinal malabsorption, increased energy resting
      expenditure, metabolism disturbances, impaired sensory taste and changes in food preferences
      which might participate to a reduction in food intake. The aim of this study was to determine
      the relationships that may exist between taste sensitivity and food preferences on the one
      hand, eating habits, nutritional status, energy balance and biological parameters including
      amino acids on the other hand in patients with end-stage cirrhosis and in patients with renal
      failure.

      Fifteen end-stage cirrhotic patients and 15 renal failure patients will be included and
      matched with 30 healthy subjects. The following parameters will be evaluated during a morning
      testing session: gustatory sensitivity using a triangular detection threshold method for
      sweet, salty and umami solutions; preferences for fat- and carbohydrate-rich foods using the
      PrefQuest score; liking for six foods (protein-, carbohydrate- and fat-rich foods) and
      wanting for 18 foods (photographs); hunger sensation; energy intake (24 h ingested food);
      body composition (BMI and impedancemetry); resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry)
      and physical activity (questionnaire). Several plasmatic parameters (amino-acids, leptin,
      ghrelin, lipid profile) will be also determined.
