      (specific type) and of Bifidobacterium Lactis (specific type). These subspecies of probiotics
      bacteria have been shown to be effective in improving the immunity. Several trials are
      currently underway, in order to evaluate the effects of probiotics as potential novel
      therapies in addition to traditional therapeutic approaches. Although probiotics do not play
      an anti-tumor action per se, these agents may significantly contribute to decrease the
      typical side effects due to traditional anti-tumor treatments, such as gastrointestinal
      symptoms, immunity deficit, as well as the alterations in the gut lymphoid tissue.

      It is therefore expected that CITOGENEX may have several significant beneficial effects in
      patients under anti-tumor treatments. In order to test this hypothesis, we will perform a
      randomized, single-blind, two-arms, prospective study in patients with colon-rectal cancer.
