      treatments, and is largely genetically determined. It is believed that an elucidation of the
      genetic component in the prognosis of weight management could assist in the development of
      more effective and individually tailored treatments. However, current research on the genetic
      component of weight management, and in particular weight regain, is still limited and data
      available are sometimes inconsistent. The current research proposal aims to identify groups
      with a high, low or medium predisposition for weight regain, based on a genetic profile and
      to demonstrate differences in the response of these subjects to a weight maintenance period
      after weight reduction in terms of body composition, physical activity, adipogenic capacity
      and energy expenditure.
