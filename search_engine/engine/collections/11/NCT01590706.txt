    
      -  The protocol of this study was developed as the first assessment of the three to four
           series of clinical research on senescence.

        -  This design of the study is a non-interventional, single-center, single-visit design for
           investigating the cognitive decline and cardiac function including heart muscle enzyme
           activity, which have been considered one of the key points in aging process.

        -  Volunteers visit the study site during the screening period, informed consent for study
           participation and blood draw are given respectively, then, the eligibilities are met,
           participants visit the study site just once within two weeks.

        -  The participants undergo the following five procedures for 2-3 hours; out-patient visit,

             1. additional demographic interview including covariate factors (depression status,
                marital status

             2. vital sign check

             3. the questionnaire for cognitive function

             4. blood draw for genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses (10 milli Liter), urine
                collection (20 milli Liter)

             5. electrocardiogram (ECG), then they are discharged.

        -  Their safety follow-up is monitored in a week (Â± 1 day) by a phone-call from the study
           associates.

        -  To evaluate cognitive function, several cognitive batteries were used, 3MSE
           (Modified-Mini Mental State Examination), ADAS-cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
           Scale-cognitive subscale); for cognitive biomarkers, Apolipoprotein E, Type-3
           metabotropic glutamate receptors.

        -  To evaluate cardiac function including its enzyme activity: HRV (heart rate
           variability), CRP (c-reactive protein); Cardiac Troponin T.
