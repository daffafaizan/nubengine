    
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, unblinded, active and historical-controlled trial in
      which approximately 875 seniors undergoing urgent PCI from approximately 70 centers will be
      enrolled. All consented subjects will undergo attempted radial arterial access.

      For DES (Drug Eluting Stent) eligible patients without randomization exclusion criteria and
      with multi-vessel disease identified during initial angiogram will be randomized by site in a
      ratio of 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or iFR-guided complete revascularization. After
      randomization, subjects with stable TIMI-3 flow established in the IRA using the protocol
      specified treatment will proceed with the randomized procedure. Subjects in whom IRA
      reperfusion with TIMI-3 flow is not achieved will be treated according to clinical best
      practice standard of care independent of randomized procedure assignment and will not be
      considered protocol violations. These patients will be followed identically to all study
      patients.

      After stent implantation, subjects will be contacted for follow-up at 30 days by the
      enrolling site and at 1 year by the DCRI Call Center.

      Primary endpoint results will be reported after all subjects have completed 1 year (12
      months) of clinical follow-up.

      STEMI patients eligible for radial access:

        -  DES Eligible with single vessel Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) will receive DES to IRA

        -  DES Eligible with Multi-vessel CAD will randomize 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or
           Instantaneous Wave Free Radio (iFR)-guided complete revascularization
