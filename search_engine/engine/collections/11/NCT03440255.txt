      period and a 2-month follow-up. Groups (GAD, CP, IBS) were assessed using questionnaires:
      Anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD-7); CP (Brief Pain Inventory Short Form
      Questionnaire) and IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System). TaVNS was
      performed using a standard transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device and ear
      clip electrodes plugged into the concha area of the left ear. All participants received a
      bi-weekly 30 minutes stimulation (8 sessions). We defined three different TaVNS parameters
      for each group in hertz (Hz) and microsecond (µs), (GAD: 20Hz-80µs), (CP: 5Hz-200 µs), (IBS:
      3Hz-250µs).
