    
      The goal of the present study is to assess the validity of PVI in predicting the response to
      a fluid challenge during scoliosis surgery in children.

      During this observational non-interventional study, each fluid challenge will be monitored by
      esophageal Doppler and PVI (Massimo Radical 5).

      Anesthesia, surgery and intraoperative fluid administration id standardized according to our
      clinical protocol.

      An increase in indexed Stroke Volume (iSV) by more than 15 % will define the positive
      response to the fluid challenge.

      Fluid challenges will be performed in the supine position and in the prone position.

      Statistical analysis will performed using the Receiving Operator Characteristics (ROC) curve
      with determination of the gray-zone allowing an error tolerance of 10 %.
