      There is a strong rationale for combining the PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab
      with radiochemotherapy (RCT) in patients with ASCC. First, although primary RCT with
      concurrent mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil (MMC/5-FU) is the standard treatment for ASCC, the
      3-year DFS in patients with locally-advanced disease is only in the range of 60%. Second,
      approximately 80-90% of patients with ASCC are human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive, which is
      associated with higher tumor "immunogenicity" in this malignancy that is known to correlate
      with better response to RCT as well as PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Also, PD-L1
      expression was observed in 33%-62% of patients with locally advanced non-metastatic ASCC that
      correlated with tumor stage. Third, inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis showed encouraging
      responses in recurrent/metastatic ASCC in two phase Ib/II trials. Fourth, several data
      indicate complementary roles between R(C)T and immunotherapy. Fifth, R(C)T can induce PD-L1
      upregulation with resulting dysfunction in CD8+ T-cells, and addition of anti-PD-L1 to R(C)T
      can overcome T-cell suppression to reinvigorate immune surveillance. First clinical studies
      have demonstrated promising findings for the combination of RCT and immunotherapies. Thus,
      based on the above data, RCT combined with durvalumab is expected to be more effective than
      primary RCT alone. Altogether, the hereby proposed RADIANCE multicenter, randomized phase II
      trial aims to improve the current standard treatment by incorporating durvalumab to the
      primary MMC/5-FU-based RCT in patients with locally-advanced ASCC (T2=>4cm Nany, stage
      IIB-IIIC).
