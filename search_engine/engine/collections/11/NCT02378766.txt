      Interested participants are invited to visit the study's Website at www.lhivehealthy.ca

      The study's Website contains video clips explaining the study. After accepting the conditions
      and consenting, participants will enroll in the study by providing an email address and a
      pseudonym. Each participant will be validated through an email address check. After their
      enrolment, participants will receive a hyperlink via email to invite them to complete a
      baseline questionnaire.

      After completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomly assigned by the
      computer system either to an experimental group (TAVIE en sant√©) or to a control group (list
      of 5 websites).

      Three and six months after the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete the online
      questionnaires again.
