      rest of the developed world at great cost to society. Contraceptive failure has been
      attributed to poor compliance with contraceptive methods and results in unintended
      pregnancies. This study will evaluate the 3-month continuation rates among women using the
      oral contraceptive pill and Depo-Provera. It will also assess the continuation rates of Ortho
      EvraÂ®, which has not previously been studied in the adolescent population. This study will
      provide information with regard to pregnancy rates and 3-month patterns of use of
      contraception among women seeking first-trimester abortion. It will also assess other factors
      contributing to successful contraception such as the use of emergency contraception and
      concomitant condom use. The results of this study will be used to inform the practice of
      providers who provide reproductive health care to women and add to the sparse body of
      literature available comparing the success of different contraceptive methods used by women.
