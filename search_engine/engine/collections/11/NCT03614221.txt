      Topical corticosteroids are typically used to treat AD. However, many patients have concerns
      about the safety of long-term use, and seek alternative therapies such as traditional Chinese
      medicine (TCM). In TCM, indigo naturalis has been used to treat various infectious and
      inflammatory skin diseases for hundreds of years. The investigate also found that the results
      of indigo naturalis ointment treatment in other trial were comparable to the results of
      calcineurin inhibitor (such as Tacrolimus) treatment, and would like to verify this
      assertion. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of Lindioil ointment with that of
      ProtopicÂ® (Tacrolimus ointment 0.1%) in treating AD.
