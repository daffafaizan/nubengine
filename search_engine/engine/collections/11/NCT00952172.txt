      cardiopulmonary fitness condition and sleep condition in patients with obstructive sleep
      apnea syndrome (OSAS). The quasi-experimental, two group repeated-measures study design was
      used. Patients meet the following criteria were invited to participate in this study: being
      diagnosed with AHI (Apnea-hypopnea index)>15/hr and ODI (oxygen desaturation index)>10/hr by
      Polysomnography, aged 19 or older. Eighteen patients with OSAS treated in the outpatient
      department of Chest Medicine were recruited, included study group and control group .The
      study group patients performed stair stepping exercise training daily for eight weeks at
      home. Outcome measures included cardiorespiratory fitness condition assessed by the 3-Minute
      YMCA Step Test, in which including physical fitness index and gross oxygen consumption (VO2),
      and sleep condition assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and
      Polysomnography. Data were recorded just prior to the stair stepping exercise at Day 1 as
      baseline, at the end of the fourth week, and at the end of the eighth week. Results of this
      study showed, physical fitness index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale , AHI, Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index and symptom scale-snoring were significantly improved. Differences in the
      effect of stair stepping exercise for other outcome variables were either minimal or not
      statistically significant. Eight weeks of stair stepping exercise training could be useful in
      increasing cardiorespiratory fitness condition and improving sleep condition on patients with
      OSAS.
