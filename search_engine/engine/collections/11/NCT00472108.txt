      BCC lesions within a patient will get the same treatment. All patients will get two
      consecutive treatments one week apart. At the 3-months follow-up visit, lesions with no
      clinical response or progression will be surgically excised. Lesions with partial response
      (50% or greater reduction on lesion area) will be re-treated; if they do not show complete
      response three months later, they will be surgically excised. Lesions with complete response
      will be surgically excised 6 months after the first or second PDT cycle. All excised tissue
      specimens will be histologically examined.
