      markers will be placed around their tumor which will guide the delivery of proton beam
      radiation to their with more precision and accuracy.

      Subjects will receive a CT scan to obtain images to plan radiation treatment. Proton
      radiation will be delivered daily (4 or 5 consecutive days) on an outpatient basis at
      Massachusetts General Hospital.

      After the final dose of proton radiation subjects will be followed for 5 years. Subjects will
      be asked to return at 3 months, and then every 3 months until 2 years, and then every 6
      months until 5 years. Subjects will receive a chest CT, tumor assessment by CT or PET, chest
      x-ray, pulmonary function tests and a physical exam.
