      for curable treatment option is actively developing. Multimodal advanced MR imaging
      (contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, chemical exchange
      saturation transfer imaging, and perfusion imaging) on 3 Tesla have shown potential in
      patients with glioma to monitor treatment response with quantitative assessment. To find
      suitable imaging biomarker for treatment response, assessing clinical and radiologic outcome
      for long-term is essential. The creation of a registry for brain glioma in long-term follow
      up provides an overview of the clinical, relevant treatment standards, advanced MR imaging
      information, and survival data of patients and thus create opportunities for imaging
      biomarker research.
