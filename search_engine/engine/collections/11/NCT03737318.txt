      outperform traditional speech therapy for children with RSE, but the research base to date is
      limited to small-scale studies that do not reach the level of evidence needed to support
      large-scale changes in practice. The primary objective of the C-RESULTS RCT is to test the
      working hypothesis that a group of individuals randomly assigned to receive
      biofeedback-enhanced treatment will show larger and/or faster gains in /r/ production
      accuracy than an equivalent group receiving the same dose of non-biofeedback treatment. To
      test this hypothesis, n=110 children will be randomly assigned to receive a standard course
      of intervention with or without biofeedback. Acoustic and perceptual measures will be used to
      test for differences in both short-term learning of treated targets (Acquisition) and
      longer-term carryover of learning to untreated contexts (Generalization). In addition, a
      survey assessing participants' socio-emotional well-being will be collected from caregivers
      both pre and post treatment.
