      the risk for breast cancer, and retinoblastoma of the offspring, in folic acid supplement
      users. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate present in fortified foods and supplements
      that must be converted to tetrahydrofolate by DHFR to enter the metabolism. Individuals
      homozygous for DHFR 19bpdel have higher prevalence of unmetabolized folic acid in plasma and
      lower incorporation of folic acid into tissues. How the DHFR19bpdel (17% homozygosity in US)
      affects DHFR activity and folate metabolism to increase cancer risk is not understood.
      Studies on this topic are urgent in the light of mandatory folic acid fortification in the US
      and other countries. The objective of this project is to characterize the effect of DHFR
      19bpdel on DHFR activity and folate pathway reactions and to determine if the effect of DHFR
      19bpdel can be alleviated with folinic acid, which is a folate source that need not be
      converted by DHFR. The specific aims of this project are to 1] Determine expression of DHFR
      mRNA and protein, splicing of intron 1 and enzyme activity in white blood cells from 3 DHFR
      genotypes. 2] Determine the effect of DHFR 19bpdel and folic acid or folinic acid
      concentration on cell growth, and folate pathway reactions in white blood cells in
      homozygotes for DHFR 19bpdel and those who lack the polymorphism. Results of this study will
      guide measures to reduce this modifiable cancer risk associated with DHFR 19bpdel.
