      plants, including lycopene and multi-carotenoids, may reduce the risk of prostate cancer,
      especially those of lethal cancer. Studies have also shown that multi-carotenoids may reduce
      serum PSA levels in prostate cancer patients. MCS is a patented, multi-carotenoids-rich,
      purely botanic agent. The investigators' previous Phase II and III clinical trials (US FDA
      and TFDA, 600 subjects, studies finished, data in analysis) have shown that there were no
      MCS-related serious adverse events (SAE). MCS may relieve urinary symptoms in men with BPH
      and PSA was reduced in men with elevated PSA. So, the investigators are initiating a large
      multi-center phase II randomized study (MCS-8, N=702) in Taiwan, to study if MCS can reduce
      the risk of prostate cancer. High risk patients will be assigned to take oral daily 30, 15,
      and 0 (placebo) mg of MCS (1:1:1). The investigators will compare the cumulative prostate
      cancer incidence among groups and the change from baseline in serum carotenoids levels.
