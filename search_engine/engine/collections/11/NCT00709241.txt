      costs of care in patients with chronic heart failure in some populations, but such data in a
      French population are missing. On the other hand, little is known of the impact of other
      psychosocial dysfunction whereas the pathophysiology of this association remains
      hypothetical.

      Main objective: to confirm the impact of depressive symptoms on cardiovascular death in
      ambulatory heart failure patients

      Other objectives:

        -  to study the impact of depressive symptoms on sudden death, non cardiovascular death,
           and hospitalization rates;

        -  to study the role of other psychosocial patterns or personality traits such as anxiety
           disorders, locus of control, perceived social support, anger, hopelessness, optimism and
           type D personality in cardiovascular and total mortality;

        -  to study the interaction with patient behaviors (drug compliance, addictions);

        -  to explore some pathophysiological pathways (chronic inflammation and chronic loss of
           myocytes),

        -  and to evaluate the impact of psychosocial distress on health care costs. Design:
           multicenter observational study with a minimum of 2 year follow up Population: 700
           ambulatory patients, aged above 18 y.o., with acute heart failure within the last 24
           months

      Methodology:

        -  psychosocial patterns and personality traits are assessed using validated
           self-administered questionnaire; use of the Beck Depression Index in this population is
           validated against the Montgomery & Asberg Depression Rating Scale evaluation

        -  cardiac condition is evaluated at pre-defined time period by B-natriuretic peptide
           levels, echocardiography and 6'-walk test

      End-point criteria:

        -  primary : rate of cardiovascular death

        -  secondary : rate of total mortality and sudden death, rate of rehospitalization for
           heart failure and for any cause, total and specific health care costs.
