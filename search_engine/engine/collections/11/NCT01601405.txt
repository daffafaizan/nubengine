      On the basis of the pre-clinical studies, the original target disease for YF476 was
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), not only because of the excellent anti-secretory
      activity of YF476 but also because of its potential for increasing gastric emptying. But loss
      of the anti-secretory effect of YF476 in healthy subjects after repeated dosing excludes its
      use as an anti-secretory agent in patients with GORD. However, there is some evidence from
      within our repeated-dose studies in healthy subjects that gastrin receptors are blocked
      despite loss of the anti-secretory activity of YF476. Further evidence that repeated doses of
      YF476 cause sustained blockade of gastrin receptors comes from several types of study in
      animals. First, in the 13-week toxicology studies, all dose levels of YF476 reduced the ECL
      population, unlike other anti-secretory agents, histamine H2-antagonists and proton-pump
      inhibitors, which increase the ECL population. Second, YF476 at doses of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg
      subcutaneously twice daily for 14 days in rats abolished the increase in gastric output
      induced by pentagastrin on Days 1, 7 and 14.

      This protocol describes a study in healthy subjects using inhibition of pentagastrin-induced
      gastric acid output as a surrogate marker of efficacy of YF476. Pentagastrin has been used
      for many years to test gastric function in healthy subjects and patients. Intravenous
      infusion of 0.6 micrograms/kg/hour is a submaximal and well-tolerated dose.
