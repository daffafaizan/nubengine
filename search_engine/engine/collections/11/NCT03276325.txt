      intraoperative analgesic effective dose 0.8 mg and the least side effect producing dose 0.4mg
      with the addition of epidural dexamethasone could augment the postoperative analgesia and
      reduce the unwanted side effects. Epidural dexamethasone in a full dose of 8 mg is probably
      more effective than lower doses to control moderate to severe post-operative pain.
      Dexamethasone 8mg dose is surgically safe neither produced delayed wound healing nor elevated
      blood glucose level.
