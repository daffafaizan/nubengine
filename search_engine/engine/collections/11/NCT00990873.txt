    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether the 64-gene signature can accurately predict the prognosis for
           survival of patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      OUTLINE: RNA is purified from tissue samples obtained by the CALGB Lung Cancer Study
      (CALGB-140202). The RNA samples are used for gene expression analysis using the 64-gene
      signature and an Affymetrix-HG_U133A array. Reverse-transcriptase PCR may also be performed
      on selected samples.
