    
      Pregnant women in the last trimester and age-matched healthy controls have an Optical
      Coherence Tomography (OCT) image taken on the OCT SpectralisÂ® device.

      A map of the choroid in the macular area is constructed automatically. Choroidal thickness
      and volume are calculated for the 9 subfields defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).

      A comparative analysis between the two groups will be performed. As a secondary outcome
      measure, the change in choroidal thickness of the pregnant group of women will be assessed at
      6 months postpartum by comparison to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.

      The OCT is a non-invasive examination that poses no risk to the mother or the fetus.
