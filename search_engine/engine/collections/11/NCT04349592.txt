      Observational data suggests HC and AZ may reduce the viral load. In this study we will
      randomise ambulatory patients with Covid 19 (confirmed by PCR in combination with clinical
      symptoms) to receive HC/AZ or HC/placebo or placebo for 7 days. On days 2-14, participants
      will be reviewed by a member of the research team and samples will be obtained for viral
      load, an ECG recorded and physical examination performed. On days 15-20, participants will be
      reviewed by telephone using a semi structured questionnaire. On day 21 participants will be
      examined in person and an oronasopharyngeal swabs obtained for PCR analysis. Participants
      will be followed for 6 months via their medical records.
