      can measure the plasma activity of 18 F-fludeoxyglucose (18-FDG) at time of injection and
      determine if that peak activity in the artery can be distinguished from peak activity in
      malignant tissue to provide enough information to obtain the arterial input function.

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate changes (baseline to post treatment) in tissue uptake at
      first pass (AUC and time to peak blood flow) and during the 60-minute period (metabolic
      activity) leading to the , positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This data is to be
      collected from the Lucerno Device placed over the carotid and femoral arteries monitoring 18
      F-fludeoxyglucose (18-FDG) activity in blood and malignant tissue throughout the pre positron
      emission tomography (PET) scan period.
