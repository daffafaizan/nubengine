      with regard to subject acceptability, comfort, and effect on exercise and activities of daily
      living tolerance.

      Primary Hypothesis:

        1. When using the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System during simulated activities of
           daily living (ADL), Subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD will be comfortable and report
           acceptability.

           Secondary Hypotheses:

        2. When using the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System during simulated ADLs, Subjects
           with moderate-to-severe COPD will experience tolerable dyspnea as measured using the
           Borg Dyspnea Score (BDS) and a visual analog Comfort Scale (VACS).

        3. Subjects will prefer using the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System over standard
           oxygen therapy during exertion and during ADLs after using the ventilator therapy for
           five days.
