      contribute to significant health care burden. Viral infections are important cause of acute
      exacerbation of COPD and asthma.

      Hypothesis to be tested: 1. Assess infective etiologies by Multiplex Molecular Detection of
      nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) of patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and asthma; 2.
      Identify the human rhinovirus (HRV) (the commonest virus causing exacerbations) subtypes
      involved; 3.Assess if the infective etiologies have associations with clinical outcome of the
      patients.

      Design and subjects: Prospective observational study. Patients admitted to hospital for acute
      exacerbation of COPD and asthma. Stable COPD and asthma patients will be recruited as
      controls.

      Study instruments: Multiplex Molecular Detection of respiratory pathogens from NPA. Clinical
      data of the patient will be collected and spirometry will be performed.

      Interventions: NPA collection from subjects. Main outcome measures: Primary aim is assessment
      of the prevalence of different viruses in relation to acute exacerbation of asthma and COPD.
      Secondary aim is to assess if a certain pathogen is associated with clinical outcomes
      including duration of hospitalization and 30 and 60 day readmissions and mortality Data
      analysis: Data will be analyzed by the Statistical Package of the Social Science Statistical
      software for Window, Version 22 (IBM SPSS Inc, IL, USA). Statistical methods including
      chi-square test, student t test and ANOVA will be used as appropriate.

      Expected results: Understanding the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in COPD and asthma
      exacerbations allows further investigations of treatment options and gives information about
      the prognosis.
