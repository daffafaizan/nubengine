      metastatic tumors express mutations to PIK3CA. Once the MTD has been determined, the
      expansion part will begin. Patients will be addd to one of three arms based on the disease
      type and genetic changes. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are not eligible for
      participation in the expansion part.
