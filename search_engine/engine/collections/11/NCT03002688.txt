      anesthesia with local anesthetic eye drops and minimal sedation- one on each eye. The
      surgeon, basic surgical procedure, anesthetic technique, and approximate length of procedure
      are reasonably similar and the patients act as their own control. Subjects in the study will
      answer very brief questions regarding anxiety and comfort about their surgery before and
      after each procedure, and on the day after their second surgery.
