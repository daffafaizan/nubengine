      exclusion criteria will be invited to a screening study visit. At screening, informed consent
      will be obtained. The study team will then collect the following to determine study
      eligibility: basic demographic information (age, ancestry, and education); medical history;
      medication and supplement use; and blood for screening 25(OH)D and calcium tests. At
      baseline, participants will be randomly assigned to the control or dosing algorithm group.
      Both participants and study staff who have contact with the participants will be blinded to
      group assignment. Follow-up visits will occur at three and six months. At baseline and
      follow-up visits, height and weight will be measured and blood will be drawn for the vitamin
      D panel, calcium, and PTH. Blood for DNA and body composition will only be obtained at the
      baseline visit. Participants will be asked to return all unused study supplements and
      compliance will be assessed at each follow-up visit by pill count. The control group will
      receive 2500 IU of vitamin D3 daily while the dosing algorithm group will initially receive
      1000, 2500, or 4000 IU daily, with the initial dosing based on the 25(OH)D at baseline, and
      the dosing may be adjusted at the 3-month visit.
