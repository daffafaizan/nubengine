      contributed to inconsistent drug concentrations, particulate formations on the balloon
      surface and their shedding during the interventional procedures. As a consequence
      developments of new PCB coatings have been proposed to address consistency, uniformity, small
      particle drug coverage, which may potentially contribute to improved vessel healing profile
      and improved clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, data on the safety and efficacy of this novel
      coating developments in the clinical setting remain limited. Previously in the experimental
      model, the investigators reported that delivery of paclitaxel via a novel mcPCB resulted in
      low long-term tissue retention of paclitaxel, however displayed reduced neointimal
      proliferation and favorable healing profile. Therefore in current clinical trial the
      investigators will address the feasibility and safety of the mcPCB (PAK, Balton) in the
      treatment of femoropopliteal restenotic disease in a prospective, randomized manner when
      compared to plain balloon angioplasty (PBA). The efficacy analysis will be observational and
      evaluated post-hoc, with no prespecified criteria.
