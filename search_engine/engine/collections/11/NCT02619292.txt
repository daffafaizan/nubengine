      treatment is over. Some research shows that practicing mindfulness, and movement types of
      activities such as qi gong or yoga may lead to improvements in emotional and physical
      well-being, including improved immune function. Immune function can be negatively affected by
      stress and worry, and this has an unknown effect on the risk of cancer recurrence.
      Psychological and physical interventions that help enhance an individual's wellbeing and
      reduce stress and worry may have a positive influence on immune function and in turn, reduce
      the risk of cancer recurrence. While there is limited research in this area, and none with
      dance therapy, little attention has been given to older BCS. However, understanding of immune
      function suggests that older women may be the best group to target for such interventions.
      Previous research with BCS age 50 or older who participated in a 12-week program combining
      mindfulness practice with dance/movement therapy (Mindful Movement Program) demonstrated
      positive effects: participants were more mindful in their day-to-day living and had less
      worry about the cancer coming back. Participants also reported through focus groups that the
      Mindful Movement Program (MMP) had improved their overall well-being. No laboratory tests of
      the body's immune response to MMP were included.
