      rational immunologic priming strategy to expand antigen primed T cells under the growth
      promoting effects of Interleukin-2 therapy.

      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the combination of the T cell cytokine
      Interleukin-2 and the checkpoint inhibitor Ipilimumab in sequential combination following a
      course of hypofractionated palliative radiation therapy. The addition of single dose
      Ipilimumab offers rational timing of CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade to decrease activity of
      regulatory and suppressor T cell subsets following IL-2 based immunotherapy.
