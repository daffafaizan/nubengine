      continues growing. There is thus an urgent need for additional HIV prevention methods. One of
      the possibilities is the use of microbicides, i.e. chemical products which may be used in the
      vagina or rectum with the potential to prevent HIV infection.

      Cellulose sulfate is an HIV entry inhibitor with an in vitro effect on N. gonorrhoeae (NG)
      and C. trachomatis (CT) and other sexually transmitted organisms.

      The study assess its effect on the vaginal transmission of HIV, NG and CT among women at high
      risk of heterosexual STI infection (defined as having had more than two partners in the last
      three months and an average of three sexual acts per week).

      The study is randomized, triple-blinded, placebo controlled.
