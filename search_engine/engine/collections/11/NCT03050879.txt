    
      Indocyanine Green Tracer is often applied in surgery for early gastric adenocarcinoma. Its
      application in laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for gastric adenocarcinoma
      is at the stage of cases accumulation, method studying and clinical research. There is no
      prospective studies to identify the clinical outcomes of Indocyanine Green Tracer using in
      laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for gastric adenocarcinoma.

      On the basis of more than 3000 cases of laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection
      for gastric adenocarcinoma, we want to apply the Indocyanine Green Tracer, a cheap, easy to
      operate and no radiation pollution way, to predict the positive lymph nodes in gastric
      adenocarcinoma, to guid the scope of laparoscopic lymph node dissection for gastric
      adenocarcinoma.
