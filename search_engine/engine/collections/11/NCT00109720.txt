    
      This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of a diabetes Self-Management Consultant
      (SMC) intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes with unsatisfactory glucose control (i.e.,
      HbA1c â‰¥ 8%--the value chosen as "high risk" by the Diabetes Quality Improvement Project which
      is an initiative of the Health Care Financing Administration, the American Diabetes
      Association, and the Foundation for Accountability) to a control group selected using the
      same criteria. The SMC intervention will be implemented and evaluated in two different health
      care systems serving two distinct populations of patients with diabetes. After signing the
      Informed Consent document, subjects will be randomized to the SMC intervention or a control
      group. All subjects in the study will complete a baseline assessment of their diabetes care
      and health status.

      Subjects randomized to the SMC intervention will have an individual meeting with the SMC to
      review and refine a self-management plan based on the subject's priorities and goals. These
      subjects will receive individual follow-up and support during the year, through monthly phone
      calls and an annual meeting with the SMC and their primary care physician. Subjects
      randomized to the control group will receive usual care following their baseline and their
      12-, 24-, and 36-month assessments. Unlike most nurse-manager studies, the SMC's interactions
      with patient care will use a theory-based behavioral approach with which we have extensive
      experience. The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SMC intervention
      compared to usual care.

      All records will be handled confidentially. Lab results and personal data will be linked by a
      research specific identifier code.
