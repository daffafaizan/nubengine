      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when administered with carboplatin in
           patients with recurrent stage IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is phase I, dose-escalation study of docetaxel followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who demonstrate
           continuing tumor shrinkage after 6 courses receive 2 additional courses beyond their
           best response.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive docetaxel and carboplatin as in phase I at the MTD determined
           in phase I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before every other course of treatment, and at the
      end of study treatment.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-64 patients (3-24 for phase I and 16-40 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 2 years.
