      in SCI patients as seen in rodent models. We will test whether the quantitative decrease in
      axial (λ║) diffusivity (a biomarker of axonal injury), will predict long-term functional
      outcomes for patients with a SCI.

      Specific Aim: To examine patients after an acute SCI using DTI and to correlate the extent of
      acute decrease in λ║ with the presenting ASIA motor score and long-term functional outcome of
      the patient.
