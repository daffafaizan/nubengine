    
      This is a Phase 2, prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of abiraterone
      acetate plus prednisone in men with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) who have a rising PSA despite castrate levels of testosterone. The study consists of
      Screening Phase (up to 4 weeks), Core Study Treatment Phase (comprised of six 28-day cycles),
      a Pre-metastatic Disease Follow-up Phase, an Optional Drug Holiday Phase; and a 30-day Safety
      Follow-up Visit. Each treatment cycle will last 28 days. Participating participants will
      receive study agents (Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg/day plus prednisone 5 mg/day, orally)
      continually during the study. If the partcipants elects to participate in the Optional Drug
      Holiday Phase, participants will discontinue abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT.
      Participants will have the option to return to study medication during the first year of the
      Optional Drug Holiday Phase if there is evidence of rising PSA but no metastasis based on
      study imaging. If participants do no elect to participate, they will continue with the core
      study treatment as per protocol. The study will end when all participated participants have
      disease progression or end of the 2-year period (if participants participated in the Optional
      Drug Holiday Phase). Participants will be required to return to the study site 30 days after
      receiving the last dose of abiraterone acetate for safety follow-up.
