      often coexist. Previous literature suggest that panretinal photocoagulation may somehow lead
      to optic disk cupping. Therefore, evaluation of the optic disc cupping and of possible
      glaucomatous damage in patients with diabetic retinopathy can be difficult, especially after
      PRP treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term effect of PRP on optic
      disc topographic parameters in non-glaucomatous patients with PDR using Heidelberg retina
      tomograph (HRT) parameters and stereo photography. The Investigators found that PRP does not
      cause morphological optic disk changes in diabetic PDR patients after one year of follow-up.
