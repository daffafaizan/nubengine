      intervention for lung cancer survivors and their caregivers. A single group before and after
      intervention study design will be used for this pilot feasibility trial. Brochures and
      information about the study will be distributed at the Cross Cancer Institute, and interested
      individuals will be screened for eligibility. A convenient sampling technique will be used to
      recruit individuals with lung cancer and their caregiver. Participants deemed eligible to
      take part in the study will provide written informed consent to participate in the study and
      will undergo baseline testing. The intervention will be carried out over a period of 8 weeks.
      The feasibility outcomes will include eligibility rate, completion rate, adherence rate and
      adverse events. Dyspnea will be the primary self-reported outcome to be measured for
      individuals with lung cancer. The secondary outcomes will include fatigue, shoulder range of
      motion, chest expansion, and muscular strength. The outcome measures for the caregivers will
      include quality of life (QoL) and muscular strength.
