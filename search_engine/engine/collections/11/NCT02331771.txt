      conditions. An electrical current is distributed throughout the brain (Lisanby 2007) inducing
      seizure activity in a controlled setting using neuromuscular blocking agents (Mirzakhani
      2012) while the patient is under anesthesia (Deiner 2009). ECT is approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the following conditions: unipolar and bipolar depression,
      manic and mixed states in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
      schizophreniform disorder and catatonia (FDA executive summary). ECT is often used after
      trials of psychotropic medications have failed (Kellner 2012).

      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is commonly associated with cognitive side effects that range
      from anterograde and retrograde amnesia to issues with executive function, attention and
      declines in information processing. Problems with autobiographical memory and recall for new
      information appear to be affected the most. In addition, data suggests that the loss of
      memory of autobiographical events may persist as long as six months. These issues may cause
      patient adherence problems and potential relapses into previous psychiatric conditions.

      Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor indicated for Alzheimer's Dementia and has
      been shown to slow the progressive decline in cognition and memory in Alzheimer's Dementia.
      It is hypothesized that donepezil will help to preserve memory and minimize the decline in
      memory that is associated with the administration of ECT.

      This study aims to determine if donepezil can minimize deficiencies in autobiographical
      memory 4-5 weeks after ECT treatment has been started.
