      leukemogenesis , which their alterations disrupt normal regulatory processes such as
      self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in target cells. Among those genes
      FoxO3a gene and PU.1 gene.

      FoxO(Fork head box ,class O) transcription factors function as a tumor suppressor gene and
      are important for stem cell maintenance.They are key regulators of the cellular
      differentiation, growth, survival, cell cycle, metabolism, and cellular stress. There are
      four members of the foxO transcription factors in humans : foxO1, foxO3a, foxO4, foxO6
      .FoxO3a is expressed in various tissues including B - and T-lymphoid cells. Over expression
      of FoxO3a in B and T cell lines induces cell cycle arrest in G1 phase , so it inhibits cell
      proliferation . FoxO3a is an important target of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,which is
      hyperactivated in various types of cancers .Hyperactivation of this pathway in leukemia leads
      to inactivation of foxO3a in leukemic cells and enhances tumor growth .

      PU .1(Purine-rich box 1) is a member of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) Family . Normal
      hematopoiesis is securely controlled by asmall number of lineage-specific transcription
      factors, so that the disturbed expression or function of this group may be involved in the
      development of leukemia . PU.1 plays an important role in hematopiotic stem cell (HSC) self
      renewal and in myeloid and B-lymphoid differentiation. It controls the expression of several
      genes involved in hematopoiesis.
