      of either no treatment or use of twice daily chlorhexidine mouthwash leading up to the
      endoscopy. There will be 2-3 study visits, at Day 0 and Day 21, and for those subjects in the
      mouthwash arm, a final visit 1-2 weeks following the Day 21 visit. Subjects will be required
      to fast overnight prior to the visits on Days 0 and 21.
