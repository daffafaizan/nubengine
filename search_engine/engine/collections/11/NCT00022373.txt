      patients undergoing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for head and neck cancer. II.
      Compare the effects of these treatments on mouth pain, ability to swallow, weight loss, and
      the distribution of oral mucositis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to radiotherapy (conventional fractionating radiotherapy vs
      hyperfractionating or concurrent boost radiotherapy) and concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. Arm I: Patients rinse with iseganan HCl oral solution
      6 times daily. Treatment continues for the duration of the scheduled radiotherapy. Arm II:
      Patients rinse with oral placebo 6 times daily. Treatment continues for the duration of the
      scheduled radiotherapy. Arm III: Patients receive standard-of-care supportive treatment. Oral
      cavity pain, ability to swallow, and weight loss are assessed twice weekly and on follow-up
      days 28 and 56. Patients are followed on days 28 and 56.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 504 patients (252 for arm I, 168 for arm II, and 84 for arm
      III) will be accrued for this study.
