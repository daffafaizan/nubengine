      communication problem, isolation from the community and depression. Moreover, hearing
      impairment may potentially affect the patients' cognitive function as demonstrated in the
      above mentioned published papers.

      Communication problems that arise from a hearing loss alone can also interfere with
      administration of cognitive test battery, as a previous study showed that re-administered of
      MMSE test with assistive listening device can immediately improve the test score among
      elderly (1).

      Therefore, special adaptation of the cognitive test battery to address the needs of hearing
      impaired older adult is necessary. This is to ensure that the test result reflects the exact
      cognitive state of the older adult with hearing impairment, not effected by hearing loss.

      Moreover, appropriate cut-off point scores for hearing impaired population should be
      identified for these new cognitive screening tools. This is to ensure appropriate referral
      for further diagnosis and prompt management for cognitive impairment/dementia among older
      adults with hearing loss.

      In addition, since hearing loss can potentially lead to deterioration in patients' cognitive
      function over time (2). Follow up assessments of cognitive function among older adults with
      hearing impairment can determine the rate of deterioration in retrospective trial(2). This
      prospective trial follow up of cognitive function among hearing loss participants may uncover
      additional risk factors associated with the deterioration. Better understanding of these risk
      factors can potentially lead to further intervention in order to delay decline in patients'
      cognitive function.
