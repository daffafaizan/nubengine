      and serum Helicobacter pylori antibody would predict the risk and cell type of gastric
      neoplasm. However, in endemic regions of H. pylori infection such as in East Asian countries
      (Korea, Japan, and China), most of the aged population are have current or had past H. pylori
      infection. Therefore, in this study, we are going to uncover whether the risk of gastric
      neoplasm is significantly higher in the atrophy(+)/H. pylori(-) group followed by
      atrophy(+)/H. pylori(+), atrophy(-)/H. pylori(+), and atrophy(-)/H. pylori(-) groups. In
      addition, we are going to investigate whether those slow-growing gastric neoplasms such as
      differentiated gastric cancers with Lauren's intestinal type and gastric adenoma are more
      commonly developed in atrophy group following the Correa's hypothesis, whereas rapid-growing
      gastric neoplasms such as poorly-cohesive carcinoma or undifferentiated gastric cancers with
      Lauren's diffuse type are more commonly developed in the subjects without atrophy. Taken as a
      whole, our study result will provide an evidence whether this biomarker strategy are useful
      for the detection of individuals at increased risk of gastric neoplasm.
