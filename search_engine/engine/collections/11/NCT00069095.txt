    
      This study was conducted in 2 parts: An initial 2-arm part in which patients were randomized
      to 1 of 2 different treatment groups (XELOX or FOLFOX-4), and a subsequent 2 x 2 factorial
      part, added to the study through a protocol amendment, in which additional patients were
      randomized into one of 4 different treatment groups (XELOX + placebo, FOLFOX-4 + placebo,
      XELOX + bevacizumab, or FOLFOX-4 + bevacizumab). Due to the comparison of the oral agent
      capecitabine with bolus and infused fluorouracil, the study was not blinded with respect to
      these 2 treatments. The study was double-blind with regard to the administration of
      bevacizumab, ie, there was a placebo control for bevacizumab in the second part of the study.

      The study consisted of 3 phases, a Primary Study Treatment Phase, a Post-Study Treatment
      Phase, and a Follow-Up Phase.

      Primary Study Treatment Phase

      Patients were to receive up to 16 cycles (2-arm part of the study) or 24 cycles (4-arm part
      of the study) of treatment during the Primary Study Treatment Phase (48 weeks).

      Post-Study Treatment Phase

      Patients who completed the 48-week primary study treatment phase without progressive disease
      were eligible to enter the post-study treatment phase at the discretion of the investigator
      and the sponsor. Patients who entered this phase were to continue treatment on the same
      regimen to which they were initially randomized until either progression of disease was
      documented, unacceptable toxicity occurred, or the patient withdrew consent.

      Follow-up Phase

      Patients who terminated study treatment during the primary or post-study treatment phase were
      followed until disease progression or death.
