      cell factor (r-metHuSCF), also involves two other institutions. The primary objective is
      determination of the safety of administering multiple doses of r-metHuSCF in the setting of
      acquired aplastic anemia and evaluation of the effect of r-metHuSCF on peripheral blood
      counts. Potential effects of r-metHuSCF on frequency of need for red cell or platelet
      transfusions and on bone marrow morphology/cellularity will also be evaluated.
