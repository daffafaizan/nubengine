      program lasting 8-weeks and taking place on a simplified research version of the Happify
      platform. Well-being programs include the unchanged Happify platform, a version of the
      Happify platform that is designed to engage with specific activities but does not aim to
      promote positive emotion or reduce negative emotion (i.e., Placebo condition), and a version
      of the Happify platform that encourages thinking about well-being through quizzes and polls
      without providing any instructions for promotion (i.e., Wait-list Control). Participants will
      be asked to complete questionnaires before and after the 8-week program, as well as a 1-month
      follow-up questionnaire after the program is complete, at which point study participation
      will end.
