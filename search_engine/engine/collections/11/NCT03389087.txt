      with a poor prognosis. 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, untreated patients with an
      average survival of only 2-4 months. The investigators consider to add apatinib,a tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor of VEGF,to the therapy of these patients. The investigators designed the
      study to explore the possibility of apatinib Plus Etoposide Capsule as the Therapy of
      Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer.
