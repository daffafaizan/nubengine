    
      There will be 200 participants, ages 12-65 years old who are receiving reconstructive plastic
      surgery with split-thickness skin grafts from the lateral thigh at 1 hospital in Ukrain. The
      first 100 will receive the standard pain regimen Analgin/Metamizole 1 g IM; Ketorolac 3%- 30
      mg IM and the following 100 will receive catheters with continuous procaine infusion for 48
      hours with the standard pain regimen available for breakthrough pain. All participants must
      be expected to remain inpatient for 48 hours post-operatively.

      Participants receiving continuous infusion of local anesthetic via a wound catheter will have
      the ON-Q PainBuster Post-Op Pain Relief System (I-Flow Corporation) tunneled subcutaneously
      while the patient is intra-operative. Catheter insertion sites will be covered with
      Steri-strips and covered with a transparent dressing to facilitate inspection of the
      insertion site for any erythema or discharge. Catheters will have a 10mL procaine 0.5% bolus
      intra-operative followed by an infusion delivered at 4-5mL/hr delivered by an elastomeric
      pump. Historically patients' pain complaints arise from skin graft donor sites rather then
      recipient sites.

      Patients will be assessed for pain scores on a scale of 0-10 (0= no pain and 10= worst
      possible pain) prior to dressing changes, during and 1 hour after dressing changes.
