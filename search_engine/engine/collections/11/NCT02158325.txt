      capsulorhexis edges covering IOL optic surface because it can inhibit the proliferation and
      migration of remnant lens epithelial cells (LEC). But there are no reports investigating the
      relationship between the capsulorhexis size and the capsular outcome after pediatric cataract
      surgery. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to prospective evaluate the capsular
      outcomes of three controlled groups receiving different anterior capsulorhexis sizes
      (3.0-3.9, 4.0-5.0, 5.1-6.0 mm in diameter).
