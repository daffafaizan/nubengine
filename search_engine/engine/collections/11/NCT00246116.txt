      the assessment of local effects, both relating to tumor control and adjacent tissue toxicity.
      For example, response rates were generally incomplete to the therapy, especially at the lower
      dose level cohorts, and it was not clear if those patients had residual viable tumor capable
      of sustaining growth. Repeat biopsies in this population are prohibitively toxic. We
      generally followed these patients with chest x-rays and CT's until there was evidence of
      progression. At that point, we would perform a PET scan and repeat systemic staging. Since
      the majority of patients will retain residual "abnormalities" worrisome for residual disease,
      ideally, there would be data or testing capable of characterizing these abnormalities earlier
      in the post-treatment course. In the same token, several patients in the phase I study had
      post treatment imaging changes around the tumor targets. If these patients had symptomatic
      decline, it was never clear if the treatment effects around the target were actually involved
      in the overall decline. Certainly, the patient population selected has other medical problems
      that will continue to cause poor health. Ideally, though, we would refer to data indicating
      the degree of damage to surrounding normal lung from the ESR such that a realistic assessment
      of percentage of overall organ damage from the therapy can be ascertained.
