      baseline, post-8 week behavioral treatment (CBT-I or SHE), as well as at 6 and 12 month
      followups. This information will provide novel information about the neural structures and
      functional networks associated with chronic pain, and their manipulation through a cognitive
      behavioral intervention to improve insomnia. Demonstration that a relatively brief
      intervention can reverse or resolve pain related maladaptive neural plasticity, and improve
      or resolve clinical pain symptoms would have immediate and far-reaching implications for
      millions of chronic pain sufferers as well as for the US healthcare system and economy.
