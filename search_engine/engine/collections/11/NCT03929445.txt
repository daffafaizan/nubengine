      facilitate intubation and improve success rate when blind intubation through both devices
      fails.

      Study objectives

        -  To make a comparison between Air-Q intubating laryngeal mask and Fastrach intubating
           laryngeal mask by using bougie assisted endotracheal intubation through both devices in
           patients undergoing elective surgeries in Suez Canal Hospitals.

        -  To assess the first trial success rate, the total success rate, time to tracheal
           intubation, the number of attempts, hemodynamics and adverse events.
