      were administered in a randomized crossover design to 11 healthy people, 13 IGT and 12 type-2
      diabetes, judged by the postprandial state after in taking the two test meals in a random
      order with a washout period of one week. On the day prior to the test day, subjects were
      asked to stay at the same facility and to take the same supper with 450 kcal controlled,
      after 21:00 with only water allowed as ad libitum and not do any exercise. Each participant
      was taken a fasting blood sample, and then requested to consume one of is energetic test
      meals (200 kcal per serving) Inslow or standard balanced formula at 7:00 AM. Subsequent blood
      samples were collected at 30,60,90,and 120 min after meal consumption. The plasma
      concentrations of glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids were measured for each blood sample.
      Plasma glucose was measured by hexokinase method, plasma insulin by serum radioimmunoassay
      method and plasma free fatty acid by enzyme chemical method.Routine blood test and
      biochemical test were performed using the same blood sample only at fasting stage,including
      RBC, WBC, TP, ALP, T-Cho, etc., to confirm the status of each subject. Collected blood was
      applied to analyses at Shanghai Meizhong Clinical Measurement Centre. The enteral nutrition
      meal Inslow was designed by palatinose, dextrin and fiber as carbohydrate for 56%,23% and
      15%, respectively. The standard balanced meal was included dextrin as the main carbohydrate
      for 85%, together with sugar and fiber.
