    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, Phase 3 multicenter study which will enroll
      patients with RRMM following 2-4 lines of prior therapy and who are refractory to
      lenalidomide in the last line of therapy as demonstrated by disease progression on or within
      60 days of completion of the last dose of lenalidomide.

      Patients will be randomized to either one of two arms:

      Arm A: Melphalan flufenamide (Melflufen) 40 mg on Day 1 and dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8,
      15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle.

      Arm B: Pomalidomide 4 mg daily on Days 1 to 21 and dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 and
      22 of each 28-day cycle.

      Patients â‰¥ 75 years of age will have a reduced dose of dexamethasone of 20 mg on Days 1, 8,
      15 and 22 for both Arm A and Arm B.

      Patients may receive treatment until such time as there is documented disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or the patient/treating physician determines it is not in the patient's
      best interest to continue.

      Dose modifications and delays in therapy may be implemented based on patient tolerability as
      detailed in the protocol. In the event of a cycle delay, unrelated to dexamethasone toxicity,
      it is recommended to continue dexamethasone weekly.
