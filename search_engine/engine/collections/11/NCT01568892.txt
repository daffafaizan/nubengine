    
      Study ING116529 is a multicenter, randomized, study with an initial 7 day placebo-controlled,
      functional monotherapy phase to assess the antiviral activity and safety of a dolutegravir
      (DTG, GSK1349572) containing regimen in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced adults with
      virological failure on an integrase inhibitor (INI) containing regimen.

      Subjects must have evidence of genotypic resistance to raltegravir [RAL] or elvitegravir
      [ELV] at Screening and documented current or historical genotypic or phenotypic resistance to
      at least two other antiretroviral therapy drug classes.

      The study is designed to provide an accurate measure of the intrinsic antiviral activity of
      DTG 50mg twice daily versus placebo both administered with the current failing regimen in a
      randomised double-blind phase to Day 8. This will be followed by an open label phase with all
      subjects receiving DTG 50mg twice daily with an optimized background regimen (containing at
      least one fully active drug) until subjects no longer derive clinical benefit or until DTG is
      locally available. Thirty subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either DTG 50mg BID
      (Arm A) or Placebo (Arm B) with the current failing regimen for 7 days (RAL or ELV should be
      discontinued prior to dosing at Day 1). At Day 8, subjects from both arms will enter an open
      label phase and receive open label DTG 50mg BID with an optimized background regimen
      containing at least one fully active drug The primary analysis will be conducted after the
      last subject enrolled has completed the randomised, double-blind phase at Day 8. Additional
      analyses may be performed prior to study closure when all ongoing subjects transition to
      locally available commercial DTG.
