      up to 6 months. Patients come to the clinic for routine monthly assessments for 6 months, and
      return to the clinic for evaluation within 24 hours of the first signs or symptoms of an
      ano-genital HSV recurrence. Once the clinician confirms the presence of at least the
      macular/papular lesion stage, double-blind suppressive therapy is discontinued and open-label
      treatment with a higher dose of Valtrex twice daily for 5 days is initiated. For the first
      recurrence, patients are instructed to return to the clinic for further clinical assessments
      on Day 5 of the recurrence. Patients who have not healed by Day 5 may be offered an
      additional five days of open-label treatment, as deemed appropriate by the clinical
      investigator. If an additional 5-day course of open-label treatment medication is dispensed,
      the patient returns to the clinic on Day 10 for evaluation. Patients who have not healed by
      Day 10 are managed as deemed appropriate by the investigator. Once treatment of the first
      ano-genital HSV recurrence is complete and the patient is healed, patients are switched to
      open-label suppressive therapy with Valtrex for the remainder of the study period (up to a
      maximum of 6 months). The total duration of the study for all patients is 6 months.
