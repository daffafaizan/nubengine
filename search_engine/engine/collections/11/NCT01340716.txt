      functional capacity expressed as a decrease in peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak). The impact
      of a Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) cardiac rehabilitation program for patients recovering from recent
      MI has yet to be assessed. Our goal is to evaluate functional capacity after a TCC-based
      cardiac rehabilitation program in patients with recent MI.

      Methods: A single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted. The researchers who
      performed the tests were blinded to group allocation. Between the 14th and 21st days after
      hospital discharge, all patients performed a cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a
      laboratory blood workup. Mean age was similar (56 ± 9 years in the TCC group and 60 ± 9 years
      in the control group). Patients allocated to the intervention group performed 3 weekly
      sessions of TCC Beijin style for 12 weeks (n = 31). The control group participated in 3
      weekly sessions of full-body stretching exercises (n = 30).
