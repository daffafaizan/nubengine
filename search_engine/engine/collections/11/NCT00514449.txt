      Valacyclovir (VAV), an antiviral medication, in the treatment of early course
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patients. Our main hypothesis is that the VAV add-on
      treatment will improve positive, negative and cognitive symptoms in herpes simplex virus
      (HSV) positive schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients. We hypothesize that the
      grey matter reductions in specific brain regions (such as prefrontal regions) will improve in
      patients on VAV + antipsychotic compared to those on placebo + antipsychotic and the
      improvements in positive, negative and cognitive symptoms will be correlated with the grey
      matter changes.
