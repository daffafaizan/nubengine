    
      A multicentre study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of
      nanofiltered Cetor® (called C1-esteraseremmer-N during the development phase) for the
      treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) will be performed. This study (KB2003.01) consists
      of three parts: Part A - pharmacokinetics (phase II); Part B - treatment of attacks of
      angioedema (phase III); and Part C - prophylactic use of C1 inhibitor (phase III). Parts B +
      C will provide data on the efficacy of C1-esteraseremmer-N.

      The changes within the manufacturing process of C1-esteraseremmer-N, compared to Cetor®
      nanofiltration and omission of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, most likely will not affect
      tolerability. The nanofiltration will provide more safety regarding viruses.

      In Part B of the study, 15 attacks of hereditary angioedema will be treated with open-label
      C1-esteraseremmer-N. Attack severity and duration will be monitored by the subjective
      experience of the patient himself (which has been shown to be the most sensitive way of
      monitoring attack severity) and compared with historical (and literature) data. If possible,
      some attacks of acquired angioedema will also be included.
