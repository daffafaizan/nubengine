    
      This study consists of Part 1 and Part 2. <Part 1> Part 1 will be conducted according to a
      single-centre, randomized, single-dose, 3-period, 5-treatment alternating crossover design in
      two groups of healthy post-menopausal women The pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      a single dose of AK159 (4 levels) will be investigated versus teriparatide acetate for
      injection as a control.

      <Part 2> Part 2 will be conducted according to a multiple-centre, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, repeated dose parallel design of healthy post-menopausal women The
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of AK159 (4 levels) for 8 weeks will be
      investigated versus teriparatide acetate for injection and placebo as controls.
      Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability following long-term application will also be
      investigated.
