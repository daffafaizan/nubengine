      30/06/2021) via the Surveillance Unit for Rare Pediatric Conditions in Germany (ESPED -
      Erhebungseinheit für seltene pädiatrische Erkrankungen in Deutschland). The nationwide
      epidemiological data collection contents information about the incidence of omphalocele,
      associated malformations and risk factors for the occurrence of omphalocele, especially for
      pulmonary hypertension and its treatment.

      We use the following inclusion criteria: preterm and term babies' ≤ 28 days of life.

      The aim of our study is a reliable, population-related data acquisition about prevalence of
      omphalocele, associated malformations and possible risk factors and characteristic early
      warning symptoms regarding concomitant diseases. Thereby, in the future it will be possible
      to develop prevention strategies für early detection and treatment of omphalocele and the
      associated malformations/ diseases to improve outcome for these babies. A further aim is to
      follow-up the thriving and the psychomotor development of these babies in the age of two
      years.
