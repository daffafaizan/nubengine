      randomized into two groups, control group (n=12) and treatment group (n=12). At recruitment
      all subjects will be required to stop anti-allergic medicines and Chinese medicines as a wash
      out period for two weeks (week 1 and week 2). They will be required to keep a record of their
      symptoms and peak flow rates twice daily throughout the entire study. Skin prick test will be
      performed with a panel of commercially available skin test solutions for cod, shrimp and crab
      (ALK). Total and specific IgE as well as total and specific IgG4 for fish and shellfish will
      be measured (by the HKSH laboratory or CUHK laboratory). Graded open cod, shrimp or crab
      challenge will be performed as described later at HKSH in each patient to determine the
      baseline tolerance level to fish or shellfish, using freeze-dried cod, shrimp or crab as
      appropriate.

      After determining the baseline tolerance level, subjects in the treatment group will take 2
      grams of the CHFX or placebo daily for 8 weeks (week 4 to week 11). The placebo powder
      consists of food grade medicinal starch blended with coloring agent. After the 8 weeks of
      treatment, skin prick tests, blood tests as at baseline and oral challenges will be repeated
      (week 12). During the study subjects will be requested to consume their normal diet but
      avoiding fish and shellfish, with no consumption of any other Chinese herbal medication. They
      can take anti-allergic medicines as necessary but will note when medicines are taken in their
      symptom and peak flow diary.
