      I. Evaluate the effect of the support program for Latina breast cancer survivors using
      validated measures of health-related quality of life.

      II. Evaluate the effect of the support program for Latina breast cancer survivors using
      validated measures of general distress.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. A brief qualitative assessment will evaluate the perception of the program among
      intervention participants using a brief survey.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants attend support group sessions over 1-1.5 hours once weekly for 10 weeks.
      The sessions include facilitated discussions among participants about the following topics:
      stress management and emotional coping strategies, nutrition and physical activity, sexuality
      and body image, medical advocacy, self-care and social support. Participants receive a binder
      in which the rationale for each topic, techniques learned, and activities completed during
      each session will be summarized and are shown a Chair-robics digital video disc (DVD).

      ARM II: Participants receive one phone call to arrange a follow-up with the promotora, a note
      acknowledging their participation in the study, and a community resource booklet.
      Participants are then yoked into one of the 3 intervention groups and asked to attend a 30
      minute session similar to Arm I.
