      modalities in first line therapy of solid organ recipients with B-cell PTLD. The monoclonal
      antibody CD20 represents an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of PTLD.
      Unfortunately this effect seems to be of limited duration in some patients, who benefited
      from monotherapy with rituximab. The advantage of this therapeutic approach in PTLD is due to
      the low incidence of third to fourth degree adverse events. At diagnosis of PTLD a relevant
      proportion of these patients is not suitable for first line cytotoxic chemotherapy due to
      widespread disease, organ dysfunction or reduced performance state. Insufficiencies of kidney
      or bone marrow function are frequent in organ recipients due the toxic side effects of the
      immunosuppressive drugs. After pre-phase treatment with the monoclonal antibody rituximab the
      CHOP chemotherapy is suggested to be less toxic due to the lower tumor burden. Thereby
      treatment related severe or even lethal toxicities, frequently reported in patients with PTLD
      who underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy, may be prevented. Furthermore the total number of
      cytotoxic cycles of CHOP-therapy is reduced from 6 for 8 to 4 cycles and thus may result in
      an additional reduction of toxicity in the single patient. Because immunochemotherapy
      (R-CHOP) is clearly superior to CHOP with respect to progression free survival and relapse
      rates in patients with classical NHL and rituximab is very unlikely to add any further
      toxicity to CHOP the majority of patients will go on with four courses of R-CHOP. However,
      patients with a complete remission after 4 courses of single agent rituximab may have a very
      favourable risk profile and therefore will go on with rituximab single agent instead of
      R-CHOP.
