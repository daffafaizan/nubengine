      support group-based teen dating violence (TDV) and sexual violence (SV) prevention program on
      the primary prevention of serious (and potentially lethal) violence perpetration among middle
      school students (both male and female-identified) who have prior exposure to trauma and
      violence. Expect Respect gender-specific support groups are for youth with prior history of
      exposure to violence including witnessing domestic violence, loss of loved one to homicide,
      TDV, and SV.

      Expect Respect is a theory and research-informed program intended to alter norms condoning
      violence and rigid gender expectations that foster violence perpetration, promote bystander
      intervention, and reduce TDV/SV perpetration. Implemented by trained facilitators, the
      24-session curriculum focuses on gender equity and respect, recognizing abuse and impact on
      self and others, regulating emotions, skills for healthy relationships, and becoming active
      proponents of safe and healthy relationships.
