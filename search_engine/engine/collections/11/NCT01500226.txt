      study of rolapitant in subjects receiving MEC. Rolapitant or placebo will be administered
      orally 1-2 hours prior to the initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. Granisetron (2 mg PO) and
      dexamethasone (20 mg PO) will be administered approximately 30 minutes before initiation of
      chemotherapy. Subjects will continue to receive granisetron (2 mg daily) on Days 2 and 3.
      Subjects will record all events of emesis and the use of rescue medication for established
      nausea and/or vomiting, and will indicate the severity of nausea they experienced in each of
      the previous 24 hours in the Nausea and Vomiting (NV) Subject Diary prior to the MEC
      administration through Day 6 in Cycle 1. Health-related quality of life will be measured by
      the FLIE Questionnaire on Day 6 of Cycle 1. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by
      clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical and neurological examinations, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values including BUN and creatinine. All
      subjects are expected to complete Cycle 1 and will have the option of participating in up to
      five additional cycles. Blood samples may be collected and stored in this study and may be
      analyzed for future biomarker research related to safety and efficacy.
