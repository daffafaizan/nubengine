      ventilation during thoracic surgery, is a real challenge for the thoracic anesthesiologists.
      Optimal DLT depth, defined as the blue endobronchial cuff below the carina, would decrease
      the incidence of obstructing the trachea and the contralateral bronchus (Brodsky).
      Additionally, deep insertion of the bronchial cuff of the DLT would obstruct the upper lobe
      bronchus (Brodsky). The careful adjustment of the depth and optimal positioning of the DLT
      using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope need a skilled anesthesiologist to reduce the time
      to DLT intubation. (Charles D. Boucek et al)

      There are several methods have been described to predict the proper depth of DLT insertion.
      Chow et al. documented the validity of the developed formula based on the
      clavicular-to-carinal distance of trachea and height in 78% of patients studied. Brodsky et
      al. demonstrated that a height-and-gender-based formula could predict the depth of DLT
      insertion. Liu et al. reported an accurate depth of DLT insertion in 90% of patients studied
      measuring the distance between the vocal cord and carina according to the chest CT.
