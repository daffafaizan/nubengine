    
      CELEST trial is a controlled, randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority double-blind trial
      which aims to determine whether ECS applying 25mmHg of targeted pressure at the ankle are non
      inferior to ECS applying 35mmHg of targeted pressure at the ankle. Patients with a first
      acute symptomatic proximal DVT will be randomized to wear for two years either ECS applying
      25mmHg of targeted pressure at the ankle or ECS applying 35mmHg of targeted pressure at the
      ankle. All patients will be prescribed anticoagulants for at least three months. The primary
      outcome will be the rate of PTS assessed with the Villalta scale in both arms of the study
      during the 2 years study period. Rate of compliance,severity of PTS and quality of life in
      both groups will constitute the main secondary outcomes.
