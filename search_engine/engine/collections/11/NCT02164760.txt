      acknowledged therapy in burns and reconstructive surgery. Nevertheless, the ideal substitute
      is not available yet. We therefore want to investigate the use of an acellular dermal
      template (Novomaix), in combination with STSG, to treat these defects. Adult patients with
      acute (burn) wounds (group 1) and scars (group 2) will be included in this study. This phase
      I study aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of the use of this dermal matrix, with
      regard to graft take, epithelialisation and complications after transplantation. Moreover,
      scar quality will be evaluated.
