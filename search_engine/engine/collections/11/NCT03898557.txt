      interventions designed to increase usage of self-test and reporting of results by HIV
      self-tests recipients. Specifically, this study will examine the use of commitment and
      planning prompts to increase the uptake of HIV self-testing in the Tshwane district in South
      Africa. The intervention will build on the implementation procedures of STAR program (HIV
      Self-Testing Africa). The two arms in the study will be: 1) Usual care, "Promote": A card
      with information to report results via WhatsApp, similar to the existing card used in the
      STAR program. with a dedicated Usual care WhatsApp number (different from the existing
      campaign numbers). 2) Plan and Pledge: A card with the information from the Usual Care card
      plus a brief template to "make a plan" and "make a pledge" for test completion and results
      reporting, to take the test. The card will include a dedicated Pledge and Plan WhatsApp
      number.

      Self-test distribution team-day pair will serve as the unit of randomization (i.e. two pairs
      of STAR field staff will be randomized by arm and by day. Clusters of individuals will
      receive self-tests at a distribution site from a pair of STAR field staff on an individual
      day). Computer-generated randomization will be used to assign site-day clusters to the 2
      study arms. The study will take place at the STAR community fixed-point distribution sites in
      Tshwane District, South Africa.
