      that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) can reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and
      septic shock, which is included in the guidelines. However, recent studies suggest that EGDT
      does not reduce mortality. This may be related to the fact that EGDT only pays attention to
      systemic circulation and neglects microcirculation.

      In the past few decades, arterial blood pressure, blood lactic acid and other circulatory
      indicators have been the target of septic shock treatment, but normal systemic circulation
      does not mean normal tissue perfusion. Obstacles to tissue perfusion, oxygenation and
      microcirculation may still exist. At the same time, compared with systemic hemodynamic
      parameters, microcirculation parameters may play a stronger role in predicting the prognosis
      of sepsis patients. It is believed that the ideal goal of resuscitation therapy for sepsis
      should be based on whether microcirculation function has been restored or not.

      Objective:to observe the success rate of microcirculation imaging and oxygen saturation of
      peripheral tissues in sepsis patients under the guidance of current guidelines and
      procedures. At the same time, we compared the predictive value of microcirculation indicators
      to the prognosis of septic shock patients.
