    
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo (vehicle)-controlled,
      pivotal study that will be conducted in the United States to determine the efficacy and
      safety of VP-102 following treatment of molluscum lesions for up to 4 treatments, every 21
      days, with VP-102/placebo in 250 subjects. Subjects will receive active VP-102 or placebo in
      a 3:2 ratio. Study drug (VP-102 or placebo) will be supplied in single-use applicators.

      The film-forming Study drug solution will be applied and left on the lesions for 24 hours
      before the subject and/or parents/guardian washes the lesions. Study drug may be removed
      prior to the 24-hour time point in the event treatment-emergent AEs are experienced.

      Molluscum lesions will be treated without occlusion in all anatomic areas including the face,
      trunk, back, arms, legs, hands, feet, anogenital region and buttocks.
