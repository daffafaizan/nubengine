      motivations to have healthy babies in order to promote serostatus disclosure and early ART
      initiation. The intervention is based on a Safer Conception Conceptual Framework, which
      considers individual, dyadic, and structural factors that affect periconception risk
      behavior.

      The researchers will conduct an open pilot to refine the intervention. The study will enroll
      men who want to have children with uninfected or unknown status female partners. Men will
      participate in three study sessions offering motivational interviewing and problem solving to
      help men develop a plan to have a healthy baby. The counseling will explore safer conception
      options including safe disclosure, delaying conception attempts until on ART with viral
      suppression, STI testing and treatment, timing condomless sex to peak fertility. The primary
      outcome is HIV RNA suppression at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include acceptability,
      feasibility, early ART uptake, adherence, serostatus disclosure, couples HIV counseling and
      testing uptake, and limiting unprotected sex to peak fertility.
