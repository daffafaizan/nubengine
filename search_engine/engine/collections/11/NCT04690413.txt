      use authorized PCR test result. The intent is to show the rapid test device is comparable to
      a currently marketed device. The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is an in vitro lateral flow immunoassay
      intended for qualitative detection of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human whole blood
      (venous and fingerstick).

      The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an
      adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection. At this time,
      it is unknown for how long antibodies persist following infection and if the presence of
      antibodies confers protective immunity. Testing of human venous whole blood (EDTA) and
      fingerstick specimens are intended to be conducted in patient care settings authorized to
      perform CLIA waived tests.
