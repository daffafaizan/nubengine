      I. Compare endocrine therapy (ET) adherence at 12 months in diverse women exposed to text
      message reminders (TMR)-only, telephone-based motivational interviewing counseling (MI)-only,
      or both (TMR+MI), versus usual care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. Compare endocrine therapy (ET) adherence at 24 months in diverse women exposed to text
      message reminders (TMR)-only, telephone-based motivational interviewing counseling (MI)-only,
      or both (TMR+MI), versus usual care.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I (TMR): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of their
      ET medication. Patients also receive daily text message reminders to take their ET medication
      and monthly text messages about how they are doing with taking their ET medication. These
      text messages continue for 9 months.

      ARM II (MI): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of their
      ET medication. Patients also receive a total of 5 motivational interviewing counseling
      sessions via telephone over 30-90 minutes for up to 9 months. These sessions are designed to
      support patients while they take their ET medication, develop health goals, and stay on track
      in achieving those goals.

      ARM III (TMR + MI): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of
      their ET medication. Patients also receive text messages as in Arm I and motivational
      interviewing counseling sessions as in Arm II.

      ARM IV (ENHANCED USUAL CARE): Patients attend usual care clinic visits every 3-6 months and
      receive online educational information about ET at the start of their ET medication. Patients
      also receive optional online information about living a healthy life after breast cancer.

      After completion of study participation, patients are followed up for up to 24 months.
