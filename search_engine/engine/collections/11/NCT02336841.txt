      addition to treatment as usual (TAU) for individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Recovery
      MANTRA, a 6-week self-care intervention supplemented by peer mentorship, is a module
      extension of the Maudsley Model of Treatment for Adults with AN and targets the maintenance
      factors identified by the cognitive-interpersonal model of the illness.

      Patients accessing outpatient services for AN are randomised to either TAU or TAU plus
      Recovery MANTRA. Outcomes variables include changes in body weight at the end of the
      intervention (primary) and changes in body weight and eating disorder symptoms at immediate
      and extended follow-ups (6-months and 12-months; secondary). Change is also assessed for the
      domains identified by the theoretical model, including, motivation, hope, confidence to
      change, positive mood, cognitive flexibility, therapeutic alliance and social adjustment.
      Feedback from peer mentors is gathered to understand the impact of providing guidance on
      their own well-being.

      Results from this exploratory investigation will determine whether a larger clinical trial is
      justifiable and feasible for this affordable intervention which has potential for high reach
      and scalability.
