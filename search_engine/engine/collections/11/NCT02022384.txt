      new therapy options as well as new possibilities to determine prognosis and prediction more
      precisely are needed. One approach is the targeted activation of the immune system to
      recognize and eliminate tumor cells. Due to cerebral tumors the brain is no immune privileged
      organ anymore, so that immune cells may pass the haemato-encephalic barrier to attack tumor
      cells. This study aims to offer valuable clues about how the immune system is influenced by
      standard therapies (radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Just with the background knowledge of
      immune mechanisms and influencing factors by tumor therapy, an effective anti-tumor response
      can systematically be induced by modulating immune therapy. To analyze immunological changes,
      immunophenotyping by flow cytometry is performed with blood from patients with malignant
      gliomas during their therapy concluding chemoradiation and chemotherapy alone. Count, class
      and activation status of immune cells are detected by flow cytometry. Together with
      additional analysis methods, information about immunological mediators like cytokines,
      chemokines and danger signals can be received. For these purposes serum and plasma are
      generated from blood samples and stored for prospective questions. The explorative determined
      results may also help to discover new, immunological based, prognostic or predictive tumor
      markers.
