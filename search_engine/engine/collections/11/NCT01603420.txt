      radiation therapy and androgen suppression for 2-3 years. Recent studies have shown a
      survival advantage for chemotherapy for prostate cancer. Chemotherapy has already been
      successfully integrated in the treatment of other cancer types and is our belief that
      chemotherapy will prove to be beneficial for patients with high risk prostate cancer.
      However, a clinical study is necessary to compare the results good or bad of chemotherapy
      with radiation therapy.
