    
      To investigate possible effects of radio frequency electromagnetic fields on EEG activity
      during sleep and on Brain function during wake (EEG in the resting state condition, slow EEG
      potentials, auditory evoked potentials) and cognitive performance measures in test of
      selective attention, divided attention and working memory in healthy elderly females (60 - 80
      years).

      Subjects will be exposed with signals from mobile communication handheld devices for 7.5 h
      during the night and for the whole duration of the test session during the day. Exposures
      will be GSM (900 MHz), TETRA (400 MHz) and sham. Each subject is exposed with each exposure
      three times in addition to an adaptation/screening night and day to learn the test.

      The results have to be discussed in the context of possible health risks resulting from RF
