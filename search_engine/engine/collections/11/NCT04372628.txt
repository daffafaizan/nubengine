    
      We will conduct an investigator-initiated, multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir vs placebo for early treatment of
      adults with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting prior to hospitalization. Patients, treating
      clinicians, and study personnel will all be blinded to study group assignment.
