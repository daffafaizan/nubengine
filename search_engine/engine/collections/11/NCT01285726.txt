      (PD) patients. With the recent development of a new bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) device,
      the BCM-Body Composition Monitor (BCM), it is now possible to quantify deviations of
      hydration status and to define target weight directly.

      It has been observed that more than 50% of the PD patients are overhydrated, as compared to
      the healthy population. This overhydration seems to be associated with modifiable
      practice-related factors, such as correct PD prescription according to membrane transport
      status, and dietary fluid intake.

      The aim of this study is to assess the hydration status of incident PD patients, and diagnose
      the underlying reasons for incorrect fluid status. In addition, changes in fluid status,
      residual renal function and nutritional status, over a follow-up period of up to four years
      will be registered.

      The investigators assume that the use of the BCM-Body Composition Monitor (BCM) provides
      quantitative measurement of hydration status and thereby supports physicians in identifying
      patients who are not euvolaemic. Hence, the BCM allows an improved management of underlying
      causes of non-euvolaemic hydration state and appropriate monitoring of fluid status.
