      Charge HR, Mio Fuse, Basis Peak) worn by subjects while performing a graded exercise program
      on a treadmill. Investigators discovered that the Apple Watch and Mio Fuse had a correlation
      coefficient (rc) of .91, Fitbit Charge HR had an rc of .84, and Basis Peak had an rc of .83.
      That study has been submitted for publication.

      Reviewers of the first study raised an important question: how do commercial optical heart
      rate monitors perform when measuring heart rate during other popular forms of exercise? This
      study addresses that question.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of four heart rate monitors when used
      during three different exercises: treadmill, stationary bicycle, elliptical trainer.
