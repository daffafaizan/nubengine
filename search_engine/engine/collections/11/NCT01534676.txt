      certain hospitalized patients. Storage of red cells is associated with a storage lesion and
      the survival of transfused red cells decreases with increasing storage time, thus older blood
      is associated with an increased acute delivery of hemoglobin-iron to the reticuloendothelial
      system. The investigators have preliminary data in healthy human volunteers suggesting that
      delivery of a significant iron load to the reticuloendothelial system from aged red cells
      leads to the elaboration of a potentially toxic form of iron known as non-transferrin-bound
      iron.
