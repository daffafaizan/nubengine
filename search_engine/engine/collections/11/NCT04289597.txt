      will be included in the study. In the preoperative evaluation, demographic data of the
      patients, airway physical examination results (mouth opening, Mallampati score, thyromental
      distance, neck circumference (from thyroid cartilage level), abnormal upper tooth presence,
      neck movement restriction], presence of sleep apnea and STOP-BANG score will be recorded. In
      the patients taken on the operation table with supine position, ultrasound-guided soft tissue
      distances will be measured using ultrasound 6-13 Hz linear probe. The distance between the
      hyoid bone-skin (DSHB), the vocal cord anterior commissura-skin distance (DSAC), the minimum
      distance of the trachea to the skin at the level of the suprasternal notch (DST), the
      distance between the thyroid isthmus and the skin (DSI), and the distance between the
      epiglottis and the skin (DSE) will be measured and recorded. After standard monitoring and
      anesthesia induction, difficult mask ventilation will be evaluated with Han Scale [(1) can be
      ventilated with a mask; 2) can be ventilated with the airway (with or without muscle
      relaxation); 3) difficult mask ventilation (insufficient, unstable, two practitioners are
      needed); 4) cannot be ventilated by mask] and grade 3-4 will be recorded as difficult mask
      ventilation. Difficult laryngoscopy will be evaluated with Cormack Lehane Scale [grade 1:
      vocal cords appear; grade-2: posterior commissura and epiglottis visible; grade-3: only
      epiglottis are seen; grade-4: glottic structures are not visible] and grade 3-4 will be
      recorded as difficult laryngoscopy. Difficult intubation will also be evaluated with the
      number and duration of intubation attempts with the Macintosh blade. Tracheal intubation will
      be performed by an anesthesiologist who has at least two years of experience and unaware of
      ultrasound measurements. The duration of intubation (the time from the first handling of the
      laryngoscope until the capnography trace appeared) and the number of trials will be recorded.
