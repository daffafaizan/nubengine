    
      This is a Phase II trial designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      one or two doses of monovalent inactivated split influenza 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 virus
      vaccines (2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs) administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75
      or 15 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose), given with or without AS03 adjuvant, using
      different heterologous and homologous prime-boost vaccination schedules. Phosphate buffered
      saline (PBS) diluent may be used to achieve targeted dosages. This trial will enroll up to
      180 males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 50 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health
      and meet all eligibility criteria and who are influenza A/H7 vaccine/infection na√Øve by
      medical history. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment arms (30 subjects per
      arm) evaluating the interval between the priming (first) and boosting (second) doses and the
      presence of the adjuvant in the priming (first) and boosting (second) doses. The
      neuraminidase-specific antibody response and the neuraminidase content of the Inactivated
      Influenza Virus Vaccine will be determined using tests that are currently under development.
      Study duration is approximately 22 months with subject participation duration of
      approximately 18 months. The primary objectives of the study are: 1) to assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs given with or without AS03 adjuvant following
      receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and
      neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses following receipt of the second study vaccine. The
      secondary objectives are: 1) to assess unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following
      receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs),
      including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and potentially immune-mediated
      medical conditions (PIMMCs), following receipt of each study vaccine; 3) to assess the
      kinetics and durability of serum HAI and Neut antibody responses following receipt of each
      study vaccine.
