    
      The study is designed as an experimental single center, double-blind treatment, cross-over
      study with inert placebo, Tapentadol (Palexia Depot), and Tramadolhydrochlorid (Mandolgin
      Retard), with a minimum of 7days wash-out periods.

      At day 1 (Visit 1), baseline measurements are carried out before tablet administration.
      Immediately after baseline measurements one tablet is administered, and hourly measurements
      are performed for 6 hours. Subsequently all participants enter a minimum 7 day washout
      period, after which they return to the facility to repeat the procedures at Visit 2 (day 8+)
      and Visit 3 (day 15+). The order of treatments will be randomized (1:1:1).
