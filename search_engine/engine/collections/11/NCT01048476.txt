      age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Using the cluster sampling method, baseline
      characteristics screening will be performed in Han nationality men and women in the suburban
      areas of Beijing, ranging in age from 50 to79 years. According to clinical diagnosis standard
      of AMD, AMD (n=120) and normal subjects (n=40) will be randomly selected to measure serum
      lutein and nutritional status, and evaluate the relationship between lutein and AMD. Each
      subject of AMD will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: Group low lutein (Group LL); Group
      high lutein (Group HL); Group lutein/zeaxanthin (Group LZ); and Group Placebo to participate
      in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1 year intervention study, respectively.
      Macular pigment optical density,related symptoms and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG)
      will be measured at at weeks 0, 24 and 48, to compare their dynamic changes in response to
      supplements at baseline and each follow-up visit, observe time- and dose-response correlation
      of supplementation with lutein, assess the efficacy, dosage of lutein and/or zeaxanthin
      supplement.
