      be effective, an HIV vaccine will have to induce cellular and humoral immune responses that
      are durable and potent. Intra-muscular delivery of HIV genes enclosed within recombinant
      adeno-associated virus (rAAV) protein capsid has been shown to be a potent inducer of both
      antibodies and T-cell responses in animal studies. tgAAC09, consisting of single-stranded DNA
      from Clade C HIV-1 genes for the gag, protease and part of the reverse transcriptase proteins
      enclosed within a rAAV serotype 2 protein capsid, was developed as one component of a
      multi-component HIV vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of tgAAC09 in healthy, HIV-seronegative volunteers.
