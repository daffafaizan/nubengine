    
      This study will be a prospective, two-arm randomized and open-label, phase IV study to
      compare the drug compliance in patients under prolonged-release once-daily tacrolimus versus
      standard twice-daily tacrolimus based regimen after de novo renal transplantation.

      The investigators will evaluate the drug compliance of the patients under once or twice-daily
      tacrolimus-based regimen using the medication scale BAAISÂ® (basal assessment of adherence
      with immunosuppressive medication scale)
