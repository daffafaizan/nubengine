    
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety of bariatric surgery by
      estimating the prevalence of short term adverse outcomes in a multicenter cohort of patients
      undergoing bariatric surgical procedures and to determine the associations between short term
      adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery and both clinical/demographic patient
      characteristics and features of operative/perioperative care

      Funds are not available to pay for the surgery for patients, only to address research
      questions.
