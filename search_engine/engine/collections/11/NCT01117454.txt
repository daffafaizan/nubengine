    
      Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) is a genetic arrhythmia syndrome
      characterized by frequent ventricular ectopy and polymorphic, classically bidirectional
      ventricular tachycardia with physical or emotional stress, which also carries a risk of
      ventricular fibrillation and sudden death, despite no structural heart abnormality. Treatment
      consists of beta-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers, but up to 30% of patients require
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) due to recurrent symptoms on medical therapy.
      In an animal model, flecainide was found to directly target the molecular defect in CPVT. In
      a retrospective clinical study in patients with CPVT we have seen improvement of ventricular
      ectopy on exercise tests when flecainide is added to standard therapy. We propose a
      prospective trial of flecainide added to standard therapy in CPVT patients to test the
      hypothesis that flecainide will reduce ventricular ectopy on exercise testing compared to
      placebo plus standard therapy.

      This will be a single-blind (blinded subjects) randomized cross-over study, in which each
      patient will receive treatment A (flecainide or placebo) for at least 3 months and, after a 1
      week wash-out, treatment B (placebo or flecainide) for at least 3 months.
