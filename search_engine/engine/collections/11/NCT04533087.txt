      investigators will enroll patients with aspergillosis and healthy controls. Patients will be
      informed by study personnel. Samples for imune phenotyping will be obtained within 7 days
      after diagnosis of IFI. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) biopsy is taken at initial diagnostic
      bronchoscopy or other biopsy during surgical debridement whenever applicable and feasible.

      The following data items will be collected: Patient characteristics, details on invasive
      fungal infection (IFI), underlying disease, outcome after 90 days (response, remission,
      progress, death). All collected data will be interpreted at the end of the study. All
      patients must agree to participate and sign the informed consent form.

      The primary objective is to compare immune checkpoint expression in blood samples from
      patients with IFI against healthy controls. Exploratively, lymphocytic immune phenotypes in
      BAL or other biopsy samples from patients with IFI will be assessed. Further, cytotoxic T
      cell responses in blood samples from patients with IFI shall be investigated and the level of
      immune checkpoint expression correlated with mortality.
