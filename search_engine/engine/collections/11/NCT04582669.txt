    
      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study examining the relative efficacy of
      ILTAC-10, ILTAC-20, and ILTAC-40 versus placebo for acute flares of HS in subjects with
      moderate to severe HS. The duration of the study will be approximately 4 weeks for each
      enrolled patient and will include an initial screening/randomization/treatment visit and a
      4-week follow-up period. During the initial visit, subjects who meet the study's eligibility
      criteria will be randomized to receive either ILTAC-10, ILTAC-20, ILTAC-40, or placebo in a
      1:1:1:1 ratio. Study subjects will then receive treatment or placebo. The follow-up period
      will be of 4 weeks and will consist of 3 phone calls and 1 live visit, including an end of
      study visit on week 4 after randomization.
