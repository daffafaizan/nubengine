      in survival rates over best supportive care: the prognosis of patients remains poor and the
      side effects are considerable. Therefore, novel agents are urgently needed for this disease.
      One way to improve effectiveness of therapies is to use non-chemotherapeutic agents that act
      on biological targets and cause fewer systemic side effects. Erlotinib(Tarceva)is a
      biological therapy that in recent clinical trials has shown promise in first- and second-line
      treatment of advanced NSCLC.

      In this trial, patients will be randomized to one of two treatment strategies:

      - erlotinib taken by mouth daily; and, if disease progression occurs, to be followed by
      chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine at standard doses for 6 cycles

      OR

      - chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine given intravenously at standard doses for 6
      cycles; and if disease progression occurs to be followed by erlotinib taken by mouth daily

      The study is conducted with the partial support of Roche, S.p.A.
