    
      In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies and clinical trials have shown that EC-18 has a mode of
      action of improving neutropenia by promoting neutrophil production from hematopoietic stem
      cells and at the same time, efficiently controlling STAT6/Complement 3(C 3), suggesting its
      potential to be developed as an orally administered new drug for treatment of neutropenia
      resulting from decreased neutrophils caused by administration of an anticancer agent.

      This study is a randomized, open-Label, single -dose, crossover, phase I clinical trial to
      evaluate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EC-18 after
      oral administration in healthy volunteers
