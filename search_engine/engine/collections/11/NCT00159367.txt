      pulmonary rehabilitation yet some patients with severe COPD are unable to exercise with
      sufficient intensity, due to breathlessness, to achieve a true training benefit.

      Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve has been shown to improve
      quadriceps muscle strength, muscle mass, and performance in patients with severe COPD.
      Magnetic stimulation may be preferred because it offers the opportunity to train the whole
      muscle and because it is painless. In this pilot study we are investigating whether
      repetitive magnetic stimulation camn increase the strength of the quadriceps muscle and
      whether it confers any change in structure or metabolism of the muscle itself.
