      2010). Cigarette smoking is responsible for 85% of these cases (CCS, 2007). Exercise has been
      shown to be an effective adjunct to pharmacological cessation strategies (Ussher, Taylor, &
      Faulkner, 2008). A recent systematic review concluded that a single bout of low to moderate
      intensity exercise can help regulate cravings, withdrawal symptoms and negative affect
      associated with quitting (Taylor, Ussher, & Faulkner, 2007).

      Smoking satisfaction is an immediately reinforcing effect of nicotine. Smoking satisfaction
      may outweigh the temporally distant adverse health risks of smoking (Cappelleri, Bushmakin,
      Baker, Merikle, Olufade, & Gilbert, 2007). Varenicline, an alpha 4-beta-2 nAChR partial
      agonist, mimics the effect of nicotine by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms (Coe et
      al., 2005). A 12-week treatment period of varenicline has been shown to reduce smoking
      satisfaction (Jorenby et al., 2006). However, the effect of acute exercise on smoking
      satisfaction is not yet known.

      Smoking topography is a key facet of smoking behaviour. Smoking behaviour can be subjectively
      or objectively measured by quantifying puff volume, maximum puff velocity, inter-puff
      interval, puff duration, number of puffs per cigarette and time to smoke a single cigarette.
      Smoking topography can estimate exposure to carcinogenic toxins present in cigarette smoking
      (Djordjevic, Hoffman, & Hoffman, 1997). Evidence exists to support that exercise modifies
      smoking topography (Katomeri & Taylor 2006; Mikhail, 1983; Reeser, 1983; Zacny & Stitzer,
      1985).
