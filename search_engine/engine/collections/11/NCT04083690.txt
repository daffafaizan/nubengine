      guided by electrocardiography, improves echocardiographic and clinical outcomes among HF
      patients with a CRT device implanted for standard indications. All patients will have
      measurement of electrocardiograms at a range of device settings. Patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to either the active comparator arm (standard CRT programming), or the
      experimental arm (CRT device programmed by the information obtained by ECGs). Standard CRT
      programming used in this study is simultaneous biventricular (BiV) pacing with a fixed
      atrioventricular delay. At 6 months, control patients who were initially randomized to
      standard programming will have programming changed based on the ECG optimization information.
      Patients will be blinded to randomization. Change of LV size and function will be performed
      prior to randomization, and again ~6 and ~12 months following CRT implant in both subgroups.
