      I. Compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) versus (vs.) TIDVD +
      telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TIDVD + PN) vs. usual care (UC), to
      increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for breast
      cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) among 1058 women age 50 to 74
      living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana.

      II. Compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + PN intervention vs. UC, for
      adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients watch a tailored interactive DVD program and answer questions posed by the
      DVD program.

      ARM II: Patients engage in TIDVD and PN.

      ARM III: Patients receive brochures that explain and provide encouragement for cancer
      screening.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 2 and 12 months.
