      of life, reduced readmissions, earlier treatment for symptoms detected prior to schedule
      in-office follow-up visits, improved communications with care providers, increased
      participation in self-management of disease, and an improved knowledge of their medical
      conditions . In patients with PAH, daily activity level, as measured using a physical
      activity monitor for seven consecutive days, correlated with 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).
      The monitor used in the aforementioned PAH study was positioned on the patients' right upper
      arm with an armband, as opposed to the more popular and more comfortable wristbands used
      today, such as the Fitbit Flex. Although the aforementioned PAH study did show a correlation
      between activity level monitoring and 6MWD, the patients were monitored for only seven days.
      It is still unknown whether this correlation would exist over a longer trial period and
      whether patients, their caregivers, and clinicians would find activity level monitoring
      useful in helping manage PH.
