      response to substance P in the presence of ACE inhibition with enalaprilat and to BNP and
      GLP-1 even in the presence of ACE inhibition. The aim promises to provide important new data
      regarding the mechanism of action of DPPIV inhibitors and interactive effects of these two
      drug classes used in a growing population of diabetic patients.
