      GC prognosis is primarily determined based on the clinical data and pathological stages of
      patients at the time of diagnosis and treatment. However, successful management of GC
      patients is still hampered by lack of highly sensitive and specific biomarkers capable of
      predicting prognosis and likelihood of metastasis. GFRA1 hypomethylation along with SRF and
      ZNF382 hypermethylation were found to be potential synergistic biomarkers for the prediction
      of GC metastasis in our previous multi-center study. In addition, p16 and E-cadherin were
      also correlated with GC metastasis in Chinese cohort. To investigate the predictive value of
      those genes' methylation on metastasis potential in GC, we carried out the prospective cohort
      study.

      Methods: 198 early stage GC patients without lymph node or distal metastasis were included in
      the present study. Baseline information of E-cadherin, GFRA1, p16, SRF and ZNF382 methylation
      status of the GC from 191 cases was obtained by MethyLight. The follow-up examination was
      carried out in a double-blind study with a 6-month interval. The association between gene
      methylation and metastasis of GC was analyzed with SPSS16.0 software. All P-values were
      two-sided.
