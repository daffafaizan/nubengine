      is caused by ASNS mutation, is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder. It is
      characterized by severe developmental delay, congenital microcephaly, seizures. The
      investigators found a family with ASNS mutaion. The investigators propose to analyze a brain
      sample and/or peripheral blood by single cell RNA seq from aborted embryos with ASNS
      mutation.
