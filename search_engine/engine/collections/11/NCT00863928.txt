      July 30, 2009 were offered the opportunity to participate in a randomized double blind
      clinical trial. Operating surgeons were blinded to suppository placement which was
      administered after induction of anesthesia. All patients underwent a standardized anesthesia
      regimen. Post-operative pain was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) and post-operative
      narcotic use was calculated in intravenous morphine equivalents.
