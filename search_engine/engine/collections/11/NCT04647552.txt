      criteria. The patients with septic shock who needed a noradrenaline infusion rate of up to
      0.5µg/kg/min to maintain MAP>65 mmHg will be classified as control group (n=20) and the ones
      who required a noradrenaline infusion rate above 0.5µg/kg will be classified as
      hydrocortisone group (n=20). Blood samples will be taken for analysis of plasma angiotensin
      II, AT1, AT2 levels at the time of diagnosis, one hour after and on the 3rd day of the bundle
      and the hydrocortisone treatment. Hemodynamic parameters simultaneously obtain by continuous
      minimal invasive cardiac output measurement method will record.
