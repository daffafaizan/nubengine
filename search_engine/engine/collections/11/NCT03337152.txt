    
      Open label, randomized trial with 72 total participants assigned to one of two treatment
      arms. Each arm will have 36 participants comprised of 12 males hemizygous for wildtype G6PD,
      12 females homozygous for wildtype G6PD, and 12 females heterozygous for G6PD with a normal
      fluorescent spot test (FST) (G6PD genotype abnormal with G6PD activity ≥40% and ≤80% of
      normal). Arm 1a will receive primaquine for 14 days, and Arm 1b will receive chloroquine for
      3 days and concomitant primaquine for 14 days. All participants will be healthy volunteers
      without severe G6PD deficiency who will be followed for two weeks after completing their
      study drug dosing. Pregnant women and those breastfeeding will be excluded. Venous blood
      samples will be taken at regular intervals for haematologic measures, G6PD quantification,
      and drug level assays. G6PD levels will be measured both by spectrophotometry to provide
      whole blood G6PD levels normalized for hemoglobin, as well by flow cytometry to to provide
      red blood cell G6PD distributions throughout the treatment and post treatment. Changes in the
      G6PD distributions will be modeled, incorporating other critical haematological indicators
      collected throughout the study too.
