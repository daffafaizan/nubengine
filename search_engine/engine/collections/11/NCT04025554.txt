    
      Objective:

      The overall goal of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and radiological
      efficacy of up to 12 weeks of subcutaneous injection of anakinra in people with multiple
      sclerosis and evidence, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), of chronic active (also known as
      smoldering ) lesions in the white matter.

      Study population:

      5 people with progressive or stable MS, at least one paramagnetic rim lesion on 7-tesla MRI,
      and no new white matter lesion formation for at least 3 months or clinical relapse for at
      least 12 months, will complete the study.

      Design:

      In this open label, dose escalation study, participants will receive up to 12 weeks of

      subcutaneous anakinra with initial dose of 100 mg daily up to a target dose of 300 mg daily.
      Study visits will occur every 4 weeks while on treatment, with 2 follow-up visits at 4 and 12
      weeks after discontinuation.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measure is disappearance of one or more paramagnetic rims from white
      matter lesions identified at baseline. Secondary outcomes include safety and tolerability,
      clinical and radiological outcomes. Exploratory serological and CSF measures will also be
      obtained to investigate mechanism of action of anakinra and for biomarker development.
