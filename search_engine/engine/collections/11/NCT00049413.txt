        -  Determine the efficacy of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, in terms of
           response rate, time to treatment failure, time to disease progression, durability of
           response, and overall survival, in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or
           small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen, in terms of acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity,
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (no prior chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs prior purine analog-based therapy
      [fludarabine or cladribine] but no alkylator therapy vs prior alkylator-based therapy
      [chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide] but no prior purine analog therapy vs prior therapy with
      alkylators and purine analogs, but not as combination therapy).

        -  First course: Patients receive rituximab IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-3 and pentostatin
           IV over 10-30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

        -  All subsequent courses: Patients receive rituximab IV over 60 minutes, pentostatin IV
           over 10-30 minutes, and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160-240 patients (40-60 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
