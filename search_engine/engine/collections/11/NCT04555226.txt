    
      All eligible patients will be equally randomized between the 2 following treatment groups
      (stratified factors: whether para-aortic lymph nodes were image-positive):

      Standard treatment group: standard chemoradiation (Pelvic EBRT/Extended-field EBRT +
      concurrent platinum-containing chemotherapy+brachytherapy).

      Experimental group: open/minimally invasive pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection
      followed by chemoradiation. (Level of lymph node dissection: At least the inferior mesenteric
      artery. Chemoradiation will be performed postoperatively within 28 days.)
