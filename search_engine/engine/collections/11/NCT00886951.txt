      Î²-amyloid deposition in AD patients for assessing disease requires human validation studies.
      The purpose of this study is to develop and characterize 123-I MNI-388 and 123-I MNI-390 as
      objective biomarkers in AD. The significance of this work lies in applying state-of-art
      quantitative neuroimaging tools to develop a relevant biomarker in living AD patients. In
      this context we propose to investigate the feasibility of applying this technique as an
      imaging biomarker of disease in AD patients.

      Informed consent will be obtained for all subjects. All subjects will undergo a screening
      evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and
      neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be given a bolus
      injection of 123-I MNI-388 and MNI 390 in an antecubital vein. Subjects will undergo serial
      SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I MNI-388 and
      MNI 390 in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 8 hours. The
      quantitative and visual imaging analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist
      who will remain blinded to any clinical information.including diagnosis. The primary imaging
      outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue
      to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I MNI-388 and MNI-390. Time to the peak uptake and
      amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the
      AD patients and controls will be compared.
