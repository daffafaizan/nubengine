      Day -1. Each subject receives a single oral dose of enzalutamide on Day 1, under fasted
      conditions. They are discharged on Day 7; ambulant visits take place until Day 50. An End of
      Study Visit (ESV) occurs 7-10 days after the last PK sampling or early withdrawal.

      Full PK profiles are obtained for enzalutamide, metabolite 1 of enzalutamide (M1) and
      metabolite 2 of enzalutamide (M2) up to 1176 hours (Day 50) after administration.

      Safety assessments are performed throughout the study. For subjects with severe hepatic
      impairment, additional Child-Pugh classification and laboratory safety tests (including liver
      function tests) are performed regularly after administration.
