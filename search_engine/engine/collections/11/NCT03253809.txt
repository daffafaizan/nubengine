      implantation (including de-novo and upgrade from standard device, additional pacing within 3
      different coronary veins will be performed in combination with a previously implanted right
      ventricular pacing or ICD lead. The resulting electrocardiogram signal will be analyzed
      afterwards. A time-frequency analysis (TFA) of several ECG leads at each paced site will be
      performed and compared. The results of the TFA analysis will not be used to select pacing
      lead location in this study.

      The patient will then receive the left ventricular pacing lead in the standard manner.
