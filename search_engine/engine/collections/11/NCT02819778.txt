      study will be necessary to validate the routine use of this biomarker .The ultimate goal is
      to include serum S100B assay in the current recommendations for m traumatic brain injury
      (mTBI) management based on the study of Kupperman et al. (2009), as mTBI accounts for 5-8% of
      pediatric emergency admissions in France (60-100 per 100,000 children). The study of
      Kuppermann et al. strongly dictated the recommendations for mTBI management by the French
      Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU) . Then, from these 2 publications, the French Society of
      Pediatrics (SFP) redacted their recommendations after adjustment method recommendations for
      clinical practice, used by the French High Authority of Health (HAS) .

      The use of serum S100B assay as part of the management of pediatric mTBI should make it
      possible to reduce the number of additional examinations, in particular a 30% reduction in
      the number of CCT-scans, with a resultant reduction in radiation exposure, known to be a risk
      factor for cancer. The study protocol corresponds to a diagnostic prospective, controlled,
      multicenter study using a randomized stepped wedge cluster design, in which pediatric
      patients (aged â‰¤ 16 years) presenting to the pediatric emergency room for mTBI with a GCS
      score of 15 will benefit from usual care ("conventional management" arm) in the control
      group, and from S100B management in the interventional group.
