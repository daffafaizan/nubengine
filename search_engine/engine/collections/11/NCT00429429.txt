      foods in terms of persistence and severity of the reaction and appears to be a growing
      problem. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (IT) is currently being examined as a treatment
      option because of the persistence of this hypersensitivity reaction and the lack of effective
      treatment. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of peanut-specific IT is vital to
      ensure the eventual, successful treatment of peanut-allergic patients.

      The goal of this proposal is to develop peanut immunotherapy (IT) for patients with peanut
      allergic reactions. This innovative application is designed to utilize the extensive
      knowledge of the allergens involved in peanut hypersensitivity to devise an immunotherapeutic
      approach that would lower the risk of anaphylactic reactions and would down regulate
      peanut-specific T cells in peanut-allergic patients. Previous attempts to utilize
      peanut-specific immunotherapy have been unsuccessful primarily because of the severe side
      effects of therapy.

      The specific aim of the study is to desensitize/tolerize peanut-allergic subjects with peanut
      allergen-specific, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) and begin to determine the molecular
      mechanism of the peanut-specific T-cell response during SLIT.

      The hypothesis is that peanut SLIT will desensitize patients with peanut allergic reactions
      by the induction of peanut specific regulatory T cells resulting in immune modulation of the
      peanut allergic reaction.
