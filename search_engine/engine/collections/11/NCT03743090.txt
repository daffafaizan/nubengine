           extracorporeal circulation (ECC).

        -  2. OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) could be influenced by in intravenous perfusion.

        -  3. ECC could influence the amount of intravenous perfusion administered to the patient.

      The aim of this study was to examine the influence of ECC on the development of OSA. The AHI
      (Apnea Hypopnea Index) will be used to assess this potential influence.
