      inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, antimicrobial resistance and healthcare costs. Our
      group has internally and externally validated a novel penicillin allergy clinician decision
      rule (PEN-FAST) that is able to identify low risk penicillin allergies with a negative
      predictive value of 96% (95%; 94-98%). Therefore, whilst validated tools exist to enable
      inpatient penicillin assessment and de-labelling, limited evidence is available regarding the
      safety and efficacy in the outpatient clinic. The ability to deliver point-of-care penicillin
      allergy testing for a large cohort of patients, without skin testing, will improve patient
      access to testing and utilization of preferred penicillin antibiotics.
