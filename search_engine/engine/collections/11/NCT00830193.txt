      admission to participating ICUs. We included critically ill adult patients at least 18 years
      of age who consented to participate in the trial, had central venous access and a foley
      catheter, required a contrast-enhanced CT of any organ system(s), and were considered 'at
      risk' for the development of CIN. We defined 'at risk' to include patients with at least one
      of the following at the time of randomization (i) a serum creatinine of > 106 µmol/L and or
      urea > 6 mmol/L, (ii) urine output of < 0.5 cc/kg over > 4 hrs or (iii) an increase in serum
      creatinine of > 50 µmol/L in < 24 hours. We stratified based on the presence or absence of
      diabetes defined as a history of treatment with oral hypoglycemics or insulin.

      We excluded patients with a (i) CK > 5,000 or the presence of myoglobinuria, (ii) a known
      allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to radiographic contrast dye or NAC, (iii) serious
      illness with imminent threat of dying (low likelihood of survival within 48-hours) or poor
      prognosis, (iv) pregnancy, (v) patients with cardiogenic shock (NYHA class 3 or 4 symptoms),
      (vi) known or suspected nephritic, nephrotic or pulmonary-renal syndromes, (vii) a post renal
      etiology of renal impairment, (viii) previous renal transplant, (ix) known solitary kidney,
      (x) serum creatinine > 200 µmol/L or (xi) recent exposure to radiographic contrast within 14
      days of randomization.

      The primary outcome for the study was the development of CIN defined as a rise in serum
      creatinine of > 50 µmol/L from the time of randomization up to day 5 following contrast
      exposure.

      Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, ICU and hospital mortality and
      the requirement for renal replacement therapy. We recorded compliance with assigned treatment
      and assessed for development of severe unexpected adverse events defined as hypotension,
      bronchospasm and anaphylactic reactions.
