      compared responses to vaporized cannabis in heavy adolescent vs adult cannabis users and
      found that the adolescents were less sensitive to the drug on most measures. However, their
      findings were complicated by several factors: i) the study used vaporized cannabis, which may
      have other constituents and does not offer full control of the dose, ii) the participants
      were heavy users, making it difficult to determine the influence of prior drug exposure, and
      iii) the participants were not drug-free at the time of testing. Prior exposure to THC can
      lead to tolerance, and adolescents and adults may differ in the rate at which they develop
      tolerance, consistent with changes in CB1R receptor function. Our study will compare
      adolescent (here, aged 18 to 20) and adult (here, aged 30 to 40) responses to THC in
      relatively light cannabis users who are drug-free at the time of testing.
