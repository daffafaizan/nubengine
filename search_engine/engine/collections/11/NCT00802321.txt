      by which alcohol affects the nervous system are not well understood. Recent theories suggest
      that alcohol stimulates release of "neuroactive" steroid hormones which are important
      mediators of alcohol effects. This proposal seeks to identify the most appropriate dosage of
      an FDA approved medication, dutasteride, which blocks the metabolism of steroid hormones, so
      that we can use dutasteride as a pharmacologic probe of the biochemistry of alcohol effects
      in human subjects in a subsequent study.
