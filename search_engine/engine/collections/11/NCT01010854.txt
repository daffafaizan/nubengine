      in diagnosis and treatment have rendered a large proportion of these patients curable, many
      patients still present with either locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not
      amenable to potentially curative surgery. To enhance the chance of complete surgical
      resection of the tumor, patients with very large, locally advanced or inflammatory breast
      cancer will be offered neo-adjuvant therapy.

      The use of systemic chemotherapy after the surgical therapy for patients with operable
      disease has been associated with a 25%-35% reduction in the risk of systemic relapse (Early
      Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1998) Administration of chemotherapy prior to
      surgery, also referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is often used in patients with
      inoperable, non-metastatic breast cancer. However more recently, neoadjuvant therapy has
      become more commonly used as it allows the direct assessment of response to systemic therapy
      and the collection of biological markers of therapy that are otherwise difficult to obtain.
      Furthermore, the relative high response rate allows the ability to surgically remove the
      tumor and achieve adequate tumor-free margins.
