    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of whole-brain radiotherapy combined with either gefitinib or
           temozolomide, in terms of overall survival, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
           and brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the tolerability and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to neurological disease progression, time to extracranial disease
           progression, and time to overall disease progression, in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare adverse events in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare cognitive function and quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to extracranial disease (yes vs no), number of brain metastases (1-3 vs
      â‰¥ 4), prior chemotherapy (yes vs no), WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2), and participating
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12
           and receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Gefitinib treatment repeats every 28
           days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo WBRT as in arm I and receive oral temozolomide once daily on
           days 1-21. Temozolomide treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on day 1 of courses 2, 3, and 5.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-86 patients (15-43 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 3 years.
