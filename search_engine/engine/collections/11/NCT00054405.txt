      I. Define the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of interleukin-12 with or
      without interleukin-2 in patients with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma.

      II. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor effect of interleukin-12 with or without
      interleukin-2 in these patients.

      III. Evaluate the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-12 with or without interleukin-2
      in these patients.

      IV. Evaluate the antiangiogenic activity of interleukin-12 with or without interleukin-2 in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) IV over 5-15 seconds on days 1, 3, 5, 8,
      10, and 12.

      COHORT B: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes twice daily on days 1 and
      8 and IL-12 IV as in cohort A.

      Treatment in both cohorts repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients may receive additional courses at the
      discretion of the principal investigator.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in both cohorts receive escalating doses of IL-2 and IL-12 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 8 patients receives IL-12 and IL-2 at the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.
