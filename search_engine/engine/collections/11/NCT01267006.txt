      aged 40 to 64 years (inclusive) will be enrolled to evaluate both the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of twice daily oral administration of GSK1325756 compared to matching
      placebo. In Part B - Cohort 2, healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 80 years (inclusive) will
      be enrolled to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of twice daily oral administration of
      GSK1325756 for administered under fed and fasted conditions. Parts A and B may be performed
      in parallel.

      The approximate duration of the current study is expected to be between 64 and 74 days. The
      study will require subjects to complete a screening visit within 30 days, followed by Part A
      - Cohort 1 enrolment requiring 3 x (3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period) or Part B
      Cohort 2 enrolment requiring 2 x (3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period). All
      subjects will complete a follow up visit within seven to 14 days of last dose.
