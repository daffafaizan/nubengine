      birth. The nutrients (protein, triglyceride, phospholipid, oligosaccharides and probiotics)
      in the collected breast milk samples will be measured. These data will be used to establish
      the breast milk database in China. This databased will provide references for infant nutrient
      intake and for the formulation and revision of infant formula standards. It will also provide
      references for the development of new infant formula products in China.
