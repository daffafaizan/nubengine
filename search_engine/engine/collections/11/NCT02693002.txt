      replacement therapy or placebo for 12 weeks. Prior to randomization, each participant will
      undergo echocardiography, measurements of activity using the Duke Activity Status Index,
      measurements of quality of life and laboratory data, including b-type natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) measurements. Following the intervention for 12 weeks, these measurements will all be
      repeated.
