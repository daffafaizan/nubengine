    
      The ICE Study is a single institution pilot study designed to compare standard therapy (i.e.,
      thoracic epidural) versus a novel approach (i.e., Cryoanalgesia combined with thoracic
      epidural) to address the need for better management of acute and long-term pain in the
      general thoracic surgery patient population. The study's primary objective will be to
      demonstrate if the new intraoperative pain management approach [i.e., intercostal
      Cryoanalgesia in conjunction with thoracic epidural] provides superior short-term and
      long-term analgesia efficacy in patients undergoing unilateral thoracotomy as compared to the
      current institutional standard of care (i.e., thoracic epidural). Patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 design.
