        -  Determine the activity of perifosine, in terms of objective response, in patients with
           locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        -  Determine the response duration, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral perifosine every 6 hours for a total of 6 doses and then once daily in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-84 patients will be accrued for this study within 21 months.
