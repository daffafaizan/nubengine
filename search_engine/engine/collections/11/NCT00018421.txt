      cardiovascular fitness levels and reduces the excessive energy demands of hemiparetic gait,
      as defined by oxygen consumption levels based on open circuit spirometry during peak and
      submaximal exercise ambulation tasks; 2) increases free living physical activity measured by
      portable kinematic recording devices and quantitative in vivo determination of energy
      expenditure using stable isotopes; and, 3) improves the cardiovascular-metabolic risk factor
      profile including measures of key endogenous fibrinolysis regulatory enzymes [plasma tissue
      plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its main circulating inhibitor (PAI-1)], fasting lipoprotein
      lipid profiles, blood pressure, and oral glucose tolerance and insulin responses.
      Measurements of body composition at baseline and after training will further determine the
      effects of aerobic exercise training on muscle mass and central obesity.
