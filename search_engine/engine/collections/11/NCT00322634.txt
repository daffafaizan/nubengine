      estimates can assist patients in making decisions about how best to spend their time and
      energy. Survival estimates are also required when considering patients with incurable cancer
      for experimental treatments. However, such estimates are difficult to make. There is some
      data to suggest that a simple clinical measure, the performance status, combined with a
      laboratory blood test, the LDH, may assist in making the survival estimate more realistic.
      This study is designed to test if this is the case, using patients with metastatic lung,
      breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreatic cancer or patients with cancer of unknown primary
      who have exhausted life-prolonging therapy. These patients will be asked to consent to
      entering this study. Their performance status will be assessed by the Karnofsky and WHO
      scales, they will be asked to have their blood tested for LDH and they and their doctor will
      be asked to estimate their survival. After study entry they will be allowed to receive
      palliative radiotherapy, surgery or systemic therapy as indicated including protocol
      treatment. After study entry, the only other requirement is that the date of the patients
      death be reported so that the duration of survival can be compared with the doctors and
      patients estimate and correlated with the performance status and LDH.
