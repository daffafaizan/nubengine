      types: NSCLC, SCLC and Biliary Tract Cancer. All patients will have advanced or metastatic
      disease with primary or secondary resistance to standard therapy. In each tumor type the
      patients will be randomized to receive either therapy with CAP7.1 or best supportive care
      according to institution standards. Patient in the Control group who progress may cross over
      to CAP7.1, however these patients will be analyzed separately from the patients randomized to
      CAP7.1.
