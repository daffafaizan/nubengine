      the presence of latent trigger points in the gastro-sole complex, can affect performance, as
      well as being a predisposing factor to injury. Objective: To compare the effects of Dry
      Needling and Foam roller in healthy athletes with limited dorsal ankle flexion by the
      presence of latent trigger points. Material and methods: This is a clinical trial,
      single-blind experimental study. The sample will have a total of 44 students, volunteers,
      healthy of the degree of physiotherapy of the the investigator's university (UCV).
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in two groups: Group 1
      or Dry Needling (N = 22) and Group 2 or Foam Roller (N = 22). The range of motion of ankle
      will be assessed through the Leg Motion system (Check Your Motion®, Albacete, Spain).
      Assessed thought Ankle Test (post-intervention and 24 hours later). The reference values to
      consider the decreased ankle ROM will be <11.5 cm, <35º measured with Easy Angle® digital
      goniometer (Meloq AB, Sweden) and/or if it has a difference of 1.5 cm between both
      extremities. Thus, the effect on previous activity performance will be assessed thought the
      Counter Movement Jump. Data analysis: Once the distribution of the sample is determined, a
      descriptive analysis of the data will be carried out and an ANOVA of repeated measures. Will
      be used to compare the data found in the two groups that make up the study taking into
      account a 95% CI and an error less than 0.05.
