      women in three underserved communities in Miami-Dade County to determine optimal approaches
      to increase cervical cancer screening among Caribbean and other underserved women. The study
      is a three arm study with 200 women randomized at each site over 3 years. Women in the
      control group would be exposed to NCI approved culturally and linguistically appropriate
      outreach and educational materials on cervical cancer screening. Our two specific aims are 1)
      to determine if as compared to our control group, women randomized to the community health
      worker intervention group consisting one on one health education and facilitation of
      referrals to existing screening programs results in increase proportion of women who are
      screened 2) to determine if as compared to the CHW group, women randomized to a CHW
      intervention with the addition of a home based self-sampling strategy results in an
      additional increase in proportion of women who are screened versus the CHW group without HPV
      sampling. Secondary outcomes include comparisons of a) measures of access to care (health
      insurance, having a usual source of care, and visit to provider in six months) b) cost of
      providing the intervention in order to determine the cost of recruiting an individual woman
      into screening c) among women having abnormal screens, time to follow-up and further testing.
