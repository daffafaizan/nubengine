      head-to-head comparison of the eventual differential impact of intermediate-acting human
      insulin (NPH), insulin detemir and insulin glargine on the growth hormone-insulin-like growth
      factor-insulin-like growth factor binding protein (GH-IGF-IGFBP) axis is relevant to be
      conducted for the safety assurance of insulin analogues. Therefore, this study aims to
      investigate whether the serum insulin profile obtained by once-daily injection of long-acting
      insulin analog, insulin detemir or insulin glargine, has a different impact on IGFBPs
      production and IGF-I concentrations (total IGF-I) bioactivity and tissue-availability as
      compared to that seen during treatment with intermediate-acting human insulin, NPH insulin.
