      day dosing of 30µg, 60µg, 90µg, 120µg, and 180µg of BXCL501 or placebo. Male and female
      adults with opioid use disorder who are physically dependent on opioids will be enrolled to
      treat symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal following discontinuation of morphine maintenance.
      Patients will be domiciled in an inpatient unit to remain under medical supervision after
      deemed eligible for the study. Efficacy and safety assessments will be conducted periodically
      before and after dosing.
