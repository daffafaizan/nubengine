      changes accumulate before dementia is evident. Deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain
      is the earliest recognized biomarker of AD pathology, and, demographically, Aβ accumulation
      begins to accelerate at age 50, a period when the incidence of metabolic disturbance
      increases as well. Hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin receptor resistance has been
      associated with AD pathololgy, and metabolic disturbance in mid-life increases risk for
      subsequent dementia. There are indications that subjective memory complaints can be an early
      indicator of developing neuropathology and may be the first manifestation of future dementia.
      This research involve intervention studies in different samples of individuals from this
      population to investigate the extent to which berry fruit supplementation and ketone
      metabolism might improve memory performance in association with enhancement of metabolic
      function and related factors. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop interventional
      approaches that might be applied with at-risk individuals in the preclinical period of
      dementia to forestall or prevent progression of neurocognitive decline.
