    
      Phase 2, proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of ocular iontophoretic delivery of dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution compared to
      ocular iontophoresis with a placebo (100 mM citrate buffer of pH 5.7) in patients planning to
      have cataract surgery with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL). The
      population studied was comprised of males and females scheduled for unilateral cataract
      surgery with implantation of a posterior chamber IOL. Eligible patients were enrolled into
      the study and were randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio into one of the following two treatment
      arms. Treatments were administered on the day prior (Day -1) to cataract surgery (Day 0).
      Subjects were scheduled to return to the clinic on Days 1, 7, 14, and 28. All subjects were
      scheduled to exit the study on Day 28. Subjects were asked to complete a daily pain score
      assessment questionnaire for the first 14 days post-surgery (Days 0 - 14).
