      I. To evaluate the effect of prandial states on the pharmacokinetic parameters of GDC-0449
      (vismodegib).

      II. To evaluate the effect of fat content of meals on the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      GDC-0449.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of prandial states and fat content of meals on the safety profile
      of GDC-0449.

      II. To describe any anticancer activities of GDC-0449.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive a single dose of vismodegib orally (PO) on an empty stomach.
      Beginning 7 days later, patients receive vismodegib PO on an empty stomach daily on days
      1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive a single dose of vismodegib PO after eating a high fat meal.
      Beginning 7 days later, patients receive vismodegib PO on an empty stomach daily on days
      1-28.

      ARM III: Patients receive a single dose of vismodegib PO after eating a low fat meal.
      Beginning 7 days later, patients receive vismodegib PO after eating a meal daily on days
      1-28.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
