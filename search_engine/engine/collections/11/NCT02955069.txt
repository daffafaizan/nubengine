      study:

        -  Well-differentiated (G1/2), non-functional, neuroendocrine tumor of GI, pancreatic or
           thoracic (lung/thymus) origin who have progressed on prior treatment

        -  Poorly-differentiated GEP-NEC who have progressed on or after one prior chemotherapy
           regimen.

      The study was comprised of the following periods: screening, treatment, end of treatment
      (EOT), safety follow-up (30-Days, 60-Days, 90-Days, 120-Days, and 150-Days after the last
      dose of PDR001) and post-treatment efficacy follow-up. Subjects were treated with PDR001 as
      an infusion at a flat dose of 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Subjects were to continue study
      treatment beyond disease progression by RECIST 1.1 until disease progression as per irRECIST,
      as per BIRC, unacceptable toxicity, start of new antineoplastic therapy, withdrawal of
      consent, physician's decision, lost to follow-up, death, or study termination by the Sponsor.
