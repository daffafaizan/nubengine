        -  To validate the mass spectrometry profile that is predictive of survival benefit in
           patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with
           EGFR inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: Plasma and serum samples are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry and classified according to prognosis ("good" vs "poor")
      using a previously developed predictive algorithm.
