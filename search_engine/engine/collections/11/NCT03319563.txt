      epidural, caudal morphine, or local infiltrations techniques including ultrasound guided
      thoracolumbar interfascial plane block. however these techniques possess some limitations in
      scoliosis surgery. Local anesthetic infiltration was first applied over 35 years ago in
      lumbar spine surgery as a reliable technique for pain relief. However meta-analysis of data
      reviled inconclusive and heterogeneous efficacy results.This conflict arise from the
      differences in the technique and drugs.There are three levels of infiltration; subcutaneous,
      muscular and perineural. Its timing either pre-incision or post-surgery. Generally the
      preemptive and deep infiltration offer better analgesia when compared with post-surgical and
      superficial forms. Different drugs including local anesthetics, epinephrine and adjuvants can
      be given as a single injection or infusion. Doses and volumes are also different, usually
      ranging from 10 to 30 ml at a concentration of 0.25% Bupivacaine. the use of epinephrine
      helps bleeding control Concomitantly, unlike the other techniques, bupivacaine infiltration
      was combined at three levels in this study; subcutaneous, muscular and neural paravertebral
      to provide sensory, motor and sympathetic blockade all together. In addition, this drug
      combination may help to maintain spinal cord perfusion by avoiding deliberate hypotension.
      The high volume sufficient for proper tissue infiltration combined at three anatomically
      guided levels for three types of nerves has not been described so far. This research may
      benefit all spine surgery patients.
