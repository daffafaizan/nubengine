    
      Purpose:This study aim is effectiveness of 12 weeks quantitative weight-bearing progressive
      exercise training in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) with pre-sarcopenia
      promotion muscle strength and blood sugar control.

      Hypothesis:After 12 weeks of quantitative sandbag training , the experimental group can have
      a significant increase in the muscle mass of the upper and lower limbs、grip strength、5-time
      chair stand test、Lipid profile、glycemic control(HbA1c) and quality of life.

      Methods:This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Forty adult diagnosis with T2DM
      with pre-sarcopenia patient randomly assigned to experimental group and control group.
      Experimental group wearing 0.5 kg quantitative sandbag 12~15 Repetitions/set X 5 set X 3day.
      Weight adjustment: After the first month of intervention, if the experimental can perform for
      more than 20 repetitions/set , we will asked to increase the weight of the sandbag to 1 kg
      until the end of the experiment Conditions:The effectiveness of 12 weeks quantitative
      weight-bearing can improvement of Glycemic control and limb muscle strength.
