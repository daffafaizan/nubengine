           To see whether the % change in SUVmax of a tumor with FLT-PET or FDG-PET at 7 days after
           initiating erlotinib treatment compared with baseline SUVmax (ΔSUVmax) would predict the
           tumor's responsiveness. And the responsiveness will be decided with the CT scan after 6
           weeks of erlotinib treatment.

        2. Secondary objectives:

      To compare ΔSUVmax and the degree of tumor shrinkage in longest diameter during erlotinib
      treatment.

      To see ΔSUVmax in the tumors with stable disease. To see the time to progression and overall
      survival according to ΔSUVmax. To compare the result of FDG-PET and FLT-PET.
