    
      Eligible participants undergoing limb salvage procedures will be randomized to receive either
      tranexamic acid (TXA) or placebo peri-operatively.

      The initial dose of tranexamic acid/placebo will be given at the initiation of surgical
      preparation. The second dose will be given 6 hours after the first dose (either
      intraoperatively or post-operatively). All doses will be given intravenously. Doses will be
      double blinded and randomized for each surgical procedure.
