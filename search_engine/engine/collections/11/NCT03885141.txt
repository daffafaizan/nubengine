      insomnia. Several studies have emphasized the importance of using Zolpidem速 in small doses,
      in the orodispersible form, in the treatment of insomnia. Accordingly, Biolab Sanus is
      developing a product in the form of orodispersible tablet containing 1.0 mg, 1.75 mg and 3.5
      mg of Zolpidem速. Thus, it is intended to evaluate the efficacy of Zolpidem速 Orodispersible
      1.0 mg or 1.75 mg in women and Zolpidem Orodispersible 1.75 mg or 3.5 mg in men for the
      improvement of the maintenance insomnia disorder, through the evaluation of the Insomnia
      Severity Index, and using a Sleep Diary throughout the study, as well as to evaluate the
      latency of the sleep after a spontaneous or provoked wake up measured by polysomnography.
