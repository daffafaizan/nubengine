      Calcineurin Inhibitor (CNI), by activating NCC cotransporter, may be a major determinant of
      hypertension, included in a "Gordon like" syndrome. Gordon syndrome is a rare genetic
      disorder where NCC cotransporter is overactivated and cause hypertension, metabolic acidosis
      and tendency to hyperkaliemia. Few studies evaluated NCC expression by exosomes techniques in
      human kidney transplant, and mostly compared NCC expression in specific subpopulation (for
      example with or without hypertension). Thus, prevalence of NCC activation by CNI is unknown.
      To determine it, we will include prospective patients in Bordeaux and la RÃ©union who undergo
      urine and blood tests three months after transplantation, and a control group with no
      transplantation and no use of CNI. First, we will compare kidney recipients and control and
      use immunoblot to quantify NCC expression in urinary exosomes to identify the population of
      transplanted with a high activation. Then, we will analyze the relationship between NCC
      activation and clinicobiological features of Gordon's syndrome.
