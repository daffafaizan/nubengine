    
      AVE1642 will be administered as an IV infusion on day 1 and then every 3 weeks for at least 2
      infusions for evaluability requirements. Curative and / or prophylactic management of
      allergic reactions during infusion will be implemented when needed. The duration of the study
      for one patient will include a period for inclusion of up to 2 weeks, at least 2 cycles of
      treatment in dose escalation step (one cycle of AVE1642 alone and at least one cycle of
      AVE1642 in combination) and at least one cycle of the combination in the extension cohort,
      followed, when possible, by a minimum of 30-day follow-up after the last drug administration,
      in order to detect any potential immunogenicity. In the second step, the patients will
      continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or willingness to stop.

      The expected enrolment period is 15 months with at least 30 day follow-up after the last
      patient treated.
