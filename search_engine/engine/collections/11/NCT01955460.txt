    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of autologous transforming growth factor beta (TGFb)
      resistant (DNRII transduced) and NGFR transduced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in
      patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the survival and immune function of TGFb resistant (DNRII transduced) TIL in
      vivo.

      II. To assess the anti-tumor effects of TGFb resistant (DNRII transduced) TIL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TGFb DNRII-transduced autologous TIL and nerve
      growth factor receptor (NGFR)-transduced autologous T lymphocytes.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6,
      fludarabine phosphate IV daily over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1, and TGFb DNRII-transduced
      autologous TIL and NGFR-transduced autologous T lymphocytes IV over up to 4 hours on day 0.
      Patients then receive high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8-16 hours on days 1-5
      (up to 15 doses) and 22-26 (up to 15 doses).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, every 3
      months for 1 year and then yearly for 10 years.
