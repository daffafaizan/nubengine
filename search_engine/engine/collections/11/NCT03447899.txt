      Biobehavioral (ABC) intervention. One family discontinued participation. The data collection
      schedule was 1 month post-injury, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Outcomes in
      multiple dimensions, were assessed including clinical recovery, cognitive, language, and
      motor functioning, family functioning, caregiver mental health including anxiety, depression,
