      following surgical procedures. The common use of closed suction drains has been associated
      with infection risk, wound healing complications, additional scarring, and patient
      discomfort. Additionally, seroma formation after drain removal often requires invasive
      treatment. Therapies that can reduce fluid accumulation and decrease the need for drains will
      have a positive impact on surgical practice.

      Objective: To study the safety and the preliminary efficacy of a TissuGlu®, a novel surgical
      adhesive, in the management of wound drainage during abdominoplasty procedures.

      Material & Methods: A blinded prospective randomized trial compared drain fluid output
      (volume) and complication profile in 40 subjects undergoing abdominoplasty with (n=20) or
      without (n=20) the use of a urethane based adhesive. The TissuGlu® adhesive, which required
      no mixing or preparation, was administered to the abdominal wall using a custom drop tip
      applicator prior to closure of the abdominoplasty flap. Two Blake® drains connected to J-VAC
      suction reservoirs were placed in the wound.
