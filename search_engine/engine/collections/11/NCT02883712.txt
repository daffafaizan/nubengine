      a global analysis (i.e. whatever the anti epileptic drugs) and with a specific analysis (drug
      by drug with their specific metabolism pathways) from a cohort of 1000 patients. The response
      to the antiepileptic drugs modification will be analyse 3 months after the modification, with
      the analysis of the number of seizures, the quality of life, the Clinical Global Impression,
      the adverse events, the systematic dosage of all the molecules (residual concentration just
      before the taken) and the pharmacogenetic analysis of the main metabolism pathways and the
      main pharmacodynamic targets.
