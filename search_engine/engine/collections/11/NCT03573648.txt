      for 21 days, 7 days off ) for 1 cycle (1 cycle =28 days) and undergo a repeat biopsy, MRI,
      and blood draw at Cycle 2, Day 1. Afterwards avelumab will be added to both arms. Avelumab
      will be administered 10mg/kg IV every 14 days (1 cycle = 2 doses = 28 days). Patients will be
      treated for 3 cycles of avelumab with endocrine therapy +/- palbociclib (thus 4 cycles total,
      including run-in without avelumab).

      The kind of endocrine therapy given will depend on menopausal status and will be a standard
      treatment. For premenopausal women, the endocrine therapy will be daily tamoxifen (20mg taken
      orally daily for 28 days), plus either Leuprolide (3.75mg taken intramuscularly) or Goserelin
      (3.6mg taken subcutaneously) on Day 1 of each cycle. For postmenopausal women, it will be
      daily letrozole (2.5mg taken orally).

      Patients will be treated so long as there is no clinical evidence of progression and therapy
      is tolerated. Patients who experience progressive disease (25% increase) of their tumor will
      cease study treatment and undergo end-of-study assessment (including repeat MRI) and surgery.
      Otherwise, patients completing all 4 cycles of therapy will undergo MRI and surgery.
