      administered either alone or preferably with standard chemotherapy. The response to Rituximab
      of patients with CLL is inferior in comparison to other indolent B cell malignancies. The
      therapeutic approach of combining treatments with Rituximab and fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
      used by us first in one case and following the impressive response - in additional 2
      patients, was undertaken on the basis of two observations.

      We assumed, that the addition of FFP to Rituximab treatment would increase and/or restore the
      efficacy of Rituximab in advanced CLL patients that are resistant to therapy by correcting
      their abnormal complement system thus allowing improved complement activation and increase
      anti-leukemic activity.

      The major aims of the study are: (1) To establish the efficacy of the combination of FFP and
      RTX as determined by response rate. (2) To elucidate the effector mechanism responsible for
      the efficacy of the FFP-Rituximab combination. The secondary aims of the study are (1) To
      establish the response duration of the combination of FFP and RTX as determined by time to
      progression. and time to re treatment (2) To determine the safety of the combined treatment.

      The study is designed as a single-arm, phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      combined treatment with FFP and RTX in advanced refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
      along with an analysis of the complement system associated parameters.
