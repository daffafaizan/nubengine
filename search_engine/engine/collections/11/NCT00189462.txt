      has been associated with an alarming rise in prevalence. Certain children are prone to
      recurrent episodes of acute Otitis media (RAOM) and/or the development of chronic Otitis
      media with effusion (COME). Because medical therapy with antibiotics, antihistamines,
      decongestants and corticosteroids has no demonstrable efficacy, the mainstay of treatment is
      surgical intervention, which is quite expensive and exposes patients to risks of general
      anesthesia. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with
      montelukast as compared to placebo in the prevention of recurrence of acute Otitis media
      (AOM)
