      myocardial triglyceride content (defined as greater than 0.50%) on cardiac MRI with 4 grams
      of omega-3 fatty acids daily for six months with a primary end point of reducing right
      ventricular steatosis and a secondary endpoint of improving RV systolic function. The
      investigators hypothesize that right ventricular steatosis by cardiac MRI will be associated
      with the degree of right ventricular systolic function by cardiac MRI. In the subset of
      participants with elevated baseline steatosis who are treated with a lipoprotective strategy,
      the investigators hypothesize that six months of therapy with omega-3 fatty acids will reduce
      myocardial steatosis and improve right ventricular systolic function.
