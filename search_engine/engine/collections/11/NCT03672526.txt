      continuous measurement of the injection pressure of the local anesthetic at the needle level.
      On the day of the surgery, an anesthesiologist "operator" will realize the echo-guided
      regional anesthesia, qualifying aloud every injection realized (site or compartment of
      injection, and volume injected). An "observer" anesthesiologist will note the demographic
      data (age and weight), then the material data (minimum stimulation intensity, type and size
      of needles and syringes used), and finally he will note the maximum pressure levels reached
      during the injections performed.
