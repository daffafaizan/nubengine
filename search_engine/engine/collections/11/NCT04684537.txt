      due to myofascial syndrome of piriformis muscle, leading to piriformis muscle spasm,
      string-like taut band, and trigger point. Consequently, it may compresses the sciatic nerve
      which arise from sciatic notch and passes under the piriformis muscle. Conservative treatment
      of PS includes therapeutic exercise, diathermy, and local steroid injection. Among them, as
      radiology techniques advance, ultrasound-guided piriformis injection becomes popular for
      diagnosis block and treatment. Nowadays, extracorporeal shockwave therapy has widely applied
      in musculoskeletal disease such as plantar fasciitis, tennis elbow, and calcific tendinitis
      of the shoulder. However, to the investigators best knowledge, there is no study comparing
      the therapeutic effect between local steroid injection and shockwave. In this study, the
      investigators aim to compare the effect of extracorporeal shockwave therapy with
      ultrasound-guided piriformis corticosteroid injection.

      This is a randomized controlled trial. 70 participants will be randomly divided into
      shockwave group and injection group. The participant in the shockwave group will receive one
      time extracorporeal shockwave therapy, and injection group will receive one time
      ultrasound-guided piriformis muscle corticosteroid injection. After the intervention,
      participant in both groups will receive home-based stretch exercise. Evaluation will be
      performed at baseline, 1 week, and 5 weeks after intervention. Outcome measures include the
      pain visual analog scale (VAS), hip range of motion, change of pressure pain threshold, and
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
