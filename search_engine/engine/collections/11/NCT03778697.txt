      as a middle ground between safe, albeit poorly effective medical weight loss strategies and
      drastic but effective bariatric surgery. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a procedure
      that restricts the stomach to a sleeve-like configuration by utilizing full-thickness sutures
      that plicate the greater curvature of the stomach. Emerging data from adult populations shows
      an acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile. Based on analysis that confirmed the
      safety and efficacy of ESG in adult patients who undergo the procedure under a standardized
      protocol and clinical care pathway, the investigators planned to study its effects on
      adolescents in a specialized center that offers surgical, endoscopic, and medical management
      of obesity under a standardized protocol and care pathway.
