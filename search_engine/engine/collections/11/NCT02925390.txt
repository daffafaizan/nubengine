      with NPT will be recruited for participation in the study. No randomization will occur. If a
      couple agrees to participate, investigators will collect information in three ways:

        1. Questionnaires. (standard of care) These will be done at entry (SOC) to the study, on an
           annual basis for up to three years (research related), for any pregnancy, or whenever a
           patient exits the study. Questionnaires may be done by mail, email, or telephone. Each
           questionnaire has a woman's and a man's version, except the pregnancy questionnaire,
           which only has a woman's version. Each questionnaire will take approximately 30-45
           minutes to complete.

        2. The subject's own Creighton Model fertility charts. (standard of care)

        3. Information about NPT treatment and pregnancies from the medical records of their NPT
           physician(s). (standard of care)
