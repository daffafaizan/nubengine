      pressure levels and the risk of cardiovascular events, strokes and kidney disease.

      Diabetes and hypertension cause up to two-thirds of chronic kidney disease , chronic kidney
      disease is a common condition characterized by evidence of kidney damage or dysfunction.

      chronic kidney disease is currently classified based on a patient's estimated glomerular
      filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion rate , clinicians look for markers of renal
      damage (e.g., abnormalities of urinary sediment or organ structure) to diagnose chronic
      kidney disease in people with estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

      Age distribution for hypertension showed progressive rise in blood pressure with increasing
      age. Age-related hypertension appears to be predominantly systolic rather than diastolic. The
      third NHANES survey reported that the prevalence of hypertension grows significantly with
      increasing age in all sex and race groups. In another study, the incidence of hypertension
      appeared to increase approximately 5% for each 10-year interval of age Because Central blood
      pressure is considered better than peripheral blood pressure in predicting cardiovascular
      events, due to wave reflections and viscoelastic properties of the arterial wall Now a day
      several non-mercury techniques have been developed during the last ten years in order to
      gradually supplant the mercury-auscultatory method, such as the automatic electronic devices
      using algorithms based on the oscillometric technique.

      Over the last ten years , different protocols are used to validate the accuracy of blood
      pressure measuring devices , several automated devices have been successfully validated using
      established protocols.
