      chromosome positive (or chromosome negative and Bcr/Abl positive) chronic myelogenous
      leukemia. II. Determine the rate of hematological response to this treatment in these
      patients. III. Determine the improvements in symptomatic parameters with this treatment in
      these patients. IV. Determine the cytogenetic response to this treatment in these patients.
      V. Determine the time to treatment failure in these patients after receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral STI571 daily. Treatment continues for at least 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are considered to have
      benefited may continue treatment beyond 1 year.
