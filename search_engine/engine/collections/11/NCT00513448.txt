      physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis. The results also show that participants
      may benefit more physically from individualized physical rehabilitation and more mentally
      from group wellness interventions. Interventions that combine individualized therapeutic
      exercise with group health education might be most effective for persons with multiple
      sclerosis.
