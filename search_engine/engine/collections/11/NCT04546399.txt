    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative second remission (Rem-2) after
      up to two cycles of reinduction with blinatumomab versus (vs.) blinatumomab/nivolumab in
      Group 1 patients aged >= 1 to < 31 years old with first relapse of CD19+ B-ALL.

      II. To compare event-free survival (EFS) PI (EFS post-induction) between consolidation with
      blinatumomab vs. blinatumomab/nivolumab in Group 3 patients aged >= 1 to <31 years old with
      first relapse of CD19+ B ALL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of blinatumomab/nivolumab in patients aged >= 1 to
      < 31 years old with first relapse of CD19+ B ALL.

      II. To compare EFS post-induction between blinatumomab vs. blinatumomab/nivolumab in Group 2
      patients aged >= 1 to < 31 years old with first relapse of CD19+ B ALL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In Group 1 patients, compare EFS between blinatumomab monotherapy and
      blinatumomab/nivolumab arms as compared to similar patients treated on the predecessor trial
      AALL1331.

      II. In Group 1 patients, compare toxicity as defined by grade 3 or greater adverse events
      during the first cycle of blinatumomab or blinatumomab/nivolumab to similar patients treated
      with block 1 of cytotoxic chemotherapy on the predecessor trial AALL1331.

      III. In Group 2 patients with MRD >= 0.1% after vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone, pegylated
      asparaginase, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (VXLD), compare MRD negative second remission
      (Rem-2) rate after the first cycle of immunotherapy between blinatumomab monotherapy and
      blinatumomab/nivolumab arms.

      IV. In patients with Down syndrome (DS) with first relapse of B-ALL, describe the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy (as defined by MRD negative second remission, Rem-2) after up to
      two cycles of blinatumomab/nivolumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients >= 18 years old with marrow +/- extramedullary (EM) relapse of any duration
      after initial diagnosis, or patients < 18 years old with marrow +/- EM relapse < 24 months
      after initial diagnosis are assigned to Group 1. Patients < 18 years old with marrow +/- EM
      relapse >= 24 months from initial diagnosis, or all isolated extramedullary (IEM) relapses >=
      1 to < 31 years old are assigned to Groups 2-3 re-induction. Patients with DS are assigned to
      Arm G. NOTE: Patients in Group 1 and DS patients with white blood cells (WBC) >= 30,000/uL,
      CNS 2/3 disease, or testicular disease must first receive 1 of 3 pre-immunotherapy
      treatments.

      PRE-IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH WBC >= 30,000/uL: Patients receive methotrexate
      (MTX) intrathecally (IT) or cytarabine IT or intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) consisting of
      MTX, hydrocortisone sodium succinate, and cytarabine IT at the time of diagnostic lumbar
      puncture (LP) or on day 1 (if intrathecal therapy is given with relapse diagnostic LP < 7
      days prior to the start of protocol therapy). Patients also receive dexamethasone
      intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, vincristine sulfate IV push
      over 1 minute or via infusion on day 1. Patients with DS also receive leucovorin calcium PO
      or IV every 6 hours (q6h) for 2 doses on day 2 or at 24 and 30 hours after each MTX or ITT
      dose. Patients should proceed to the next cycle when CNS 1 and no testicular disease is
      present, no sooner than Day 8 and no later than Day 15.

      PRE-IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT FOR CNS 2/3 DISEASE: Patients receive MTX IT or cytarabine IT
      twice weekly (Q2W) for 5-7 doses or Intrathecal Triple Therapy (ITT) IT Q2W for 3-4 doses
      until patient is CNS 1. Patients with DS also receive leucovorin calcium PO or IV q6h for 2
      doses at 24 and 30 hours after each MTX or ITT dose. Patients should proceed to the next
      cycle when CNS 1 and no testicular disease is present, no sooner than Day 15 and no later
      than Day 24.

      PRE-IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT FOR TESTICULAR DISEASE: Patients receive MTX IT, cytarabine IT,
      or ITT IT on days 1 and 15 (day 1 may be omitted if intrathecal therapy is given with relapse
      diagnostic LP < 7 days prior to the start of protocol therapy). Patients with DS also receive
      leucovorin calcium PO or IV q6h for 2 doses on days 2 and 16 or at 24 and 30 hours after each
      IT MTX or ITT dose. Males with testicular disease at relapse undergo radiation once daily
      (QD) for a total of 12 fractions over 12 days. Patients should proceed to the next cycle when
      CNS 1 and no testicular disease is present, no sooner than Day 15 and no later than Day 22.
