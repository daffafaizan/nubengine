      the established pedCAPNETZ pilot cohort. The main objective is to improve knowledge on
      etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis and management of pediatric CAP in a developed country.
      pedCAPNETZ will enable the systematic and detailed characterization of pediatric CAP cases on
      an epidemiological, clinical and biological level.
