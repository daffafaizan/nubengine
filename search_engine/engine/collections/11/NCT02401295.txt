      To evaluate safety and tolerability associated with the combination of ATRA/
      celecoxib/itraconazole given after a salvage transplant for relapsed myeloma in 25 patients
      in a cycle schedule consisting of three weeks of treatment followed by a rest period of two
      weeks for a total of five cycles. Subjects will be evaluable only if they have received at
      least one dose of maintenance treatment. The salvage transplant is not part of this study.

      Secondary objective:

      To explore changes in frequency and molecular signature in the multiple myeloma stem cell
      (MMSC) fraction based on flow-cytometric assays and gene expression profiling before and
      after the experimental treatment and to correlate outcome with expression levels of RARÎ±2 at
      time of relapse.
