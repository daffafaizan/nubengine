      cancer. This study proposes to evaluate the novel combination of preoperative capecitabine,
      oxaliplatin, and cetuximab concurrently with radiation therapy. This will be followed by
      esophagectomy 6-9 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. Followed by further adjuvant
      chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that our novel combination of neoadjuvant capecitabine,
      oxaliplatin, and cetuximab combined with thoracoabdominal radiation therapy will be feasible
      and result in acceptable toxicity.
