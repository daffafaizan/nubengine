      with high-risk disease features who become resistant to conventional therapy.
      131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is a norepinephrine analog that concentrates in
      adrenergic tissue and therefore holds promise for cell-specific treatment of neuroblastoma.
      131I-MIBG is active against relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma and associated hematopoietic
      toxicity can be abrogated with autologous stem cell rescue. 131I-MIBG given in doses of 10-18
      millicurie (mCi)/kg with stem cell rescue, if necessary, is safe and effective palliative
      therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients.
