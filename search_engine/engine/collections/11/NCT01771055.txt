      used. These methods include giving blood and fluids and surgically repairing the vessels that
      are causing the bleeding which are standard ways physicians treat injuries with massive blood
      loss. A drain (a small plastic tube) will be placed inside the belly.

      Subjects will randomly (like flipping a coin) be placed into a group of patients who either
      get a sugar solution dripped into the belly after surgery or do not get this treatment. The
      drain will be used to drip a high glucose solution into the abdomen in patients be part of
      that group. The fluid will continue to be dripped into the belly until it is possible to
      close the skin and underlying layers.
