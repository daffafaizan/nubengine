      impairments in ambulation leading to use of canes, walkers, and ultimately wheelchairs.
      Treatment attempts for progressive MS have been disappointing. No therapeutic intervention
      has been shown to modulate disability in patients with SPMS. FES cycling has been shown to
      have multiple primary medical benefits including: increased muscle mass, improvements in bone
      density, enhanced cardiovascular function, improved bowel function, decreased spasticity and
      reductions in bladder infection rate. More importantly FES may modulate the inflammatory
      central nervous system (CNS) environment in progressive MS. The investigators are proposing a
      novel, and easy to implement intervention strategy of FES cycling to help improve gait
      function in individuals with SPMS. A successful outcome on a larger SPMS population would
      have significant impact towards changing MS clinical care. FES is easily transferable to
      clinical practice and could potentially ameliorate other complications associated with SPMS
      such as spasticity, mood and fatigue reducing the burden of health care cost. In addition,
      the investigators will gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these changes
      that could be used to design new therapeutic strategies.
