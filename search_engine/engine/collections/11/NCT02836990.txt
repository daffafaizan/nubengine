      products. Prevena is a negative pressure system which holds the wound together and removes
      exudate and debris from the site to prevent infection. Dermabond is a surgical glue which
      holds the wound together to prevents infection. Prevena is more expensive to apply. However,
      the hypothesis is that the Prevena System will decrease infection rates and therefore,
      decrease the ultimate cost of the health care needed after surgery.
