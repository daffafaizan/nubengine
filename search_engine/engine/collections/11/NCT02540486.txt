    
      INNOVATE is a 12 week, parallel, open-label, randomized, multi-center study evaluating use,
      safety and effectiveness of a web based tool (LTHome) vs. enhanced usual therapy (EUT) of
      glargine titration in T2DM patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness LTHome versus EUT of
      glargine titration in people with T2DM patients on basal insulin not meeting local targets or
      patients requiring basal initiation. Success will be measured by the percentage of subjects
      reaching Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) guideline targets.

      The efficacy objective is to demonstrate that the percentage (%) of subjects to reach FPG
      target by titration of insulin glargine using the LTHome tool with dose adjustment advice is
      not inferior to the % of subjects to reach FPG target using Enhanced Usual Therapy glargine
      titration during study participation (LTHome vs. EUT treatments).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess safety, effectiveness, satisfaction and
      adherence of LTHome use versus Enhanced Usual Therapy glargine titration.
