    
      This is a pilot study with an open-label, exploratory study design with the aim to document
      preliminary safety and performance of the SoftOx Wound Irrigation Solution while used as
      intended by the manufacturer, i.e. as an irrigation solution for mechanical rinsing of
      breached or compromised skin as a result from acute wounds. This first-in-man study will give
      valuable information on the feasibility of the treatment with the SoftOx Wound Irrigation
      Solution to prepare for continuous studies in clinically significant settings prior CE
      marking. The investigation population will consist of 12 subjects undergoing split skin graft
      transplantation for treating chronic leg ulcers and that are fulfilling the eligibility
      criteria for the clinical investigation. The SoftOx Wound Irrigation Solution will be applied
      on the donor site of the split skin graft which is a representative model of acute wounds in
      a controlled setting. All subjects will be followed up for 21 days. The duration of the
      investigation is estimated to 4 months.
