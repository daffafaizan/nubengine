      available. However, there is the potential for significant acute and longer term adverse
      cognitive effects with ECT and the antidepressant response requires multiple treatment
      sessions, increasing risk of adverse effects. Further, antidepressant response to ECT is
      often less than maximal and relapse is common. Growing preclinical and clinical evidence of
      the rapid-acting antidepressant properties of the anesthetic agent ketamine suggests the use
      of ketamine anesthesia as a strategy to increase rate of response and shorten treatment
      course in the administration of ECT. In addition, preclinical and clinical evidence suggests
      the potential of ketamine to decrease the adverse cognitive effects associated with ECT.

      The investigators propose a pilot study to measure both acute therapeutic efficacy and
      cognitive side effects of ECT using ketamine compared to methohexital in depressed patients.
      The investigators will also explore other parameters of ECT such as seizure duration and
      morphology, as well as hemodynamic and behavioral changes.
