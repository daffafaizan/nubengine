      reducing patients' exposures to potential pathogens. The neutropenic diet is one such
      intervention that was intended to reduce the introduction of bacteria into the host's
      gastrointestinal tract. This diet excludes foods considered to be high risk for bacterial
      colonization, especially raw fruits and vegetables. The only studies evaluating this diet
      have used this intervention in combination with germ free environments, which have been
      phased out of practice, and the independent effect of this diet remains unknown. In addition,
      pediatric oncology patients suffer significant gastrointestinal side effects secondary to
      cancer therapy, which are likely to affect their satisfaction with this dietary regimen.
      Qualitative data in these children suggests that decreased pleasure from food is a major
      concern for them and preliminary data on the neutropenic diet showed that although patients
      were able to stick to it, they found it difficult. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) offer more liberalized food safety guidelines for
      immunocompromised patients. We hypothesize that the neutropenic dietary restrictions offer no
      advantage over the FDA and CDC endorsed food safety guidelines and that the food safety
      guidelines will afford patients an improved quality of life through increased choice and
      control over their diet. The results of this study could potentially modify clinical practice
      to improve the quality of life of these patients without adverse effects on their rate of
      infection. Furthermore, the allowance of fresh fruits and vegetables back into the diets of
      these patients may have a positive impact on their health.
