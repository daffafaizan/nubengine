      progression at doses of 1.000 mg per day taken in fasting conditions. However, it has been
      described both the significant food-effect on bioavailability up to 5 to 10 times folder
      increase depending on the fat content of the diet. These data come from the analysis of a
      small number of patients in phase I studies conducted in the early stages of drug development
      and some exploratory study in healthy subjects. There is not prospective randomized study
      that has analyzed the real impact of the normal diet in the bioavailability of the drug (not
      a fatty diet like has been used in initial studies).

      Given the particular epidemiology of mCRPC (relatively frequent pathology), and taking into
      account recent data which indicates positive results of AA treatment in patients who had not
      previously received chemotherapy, a significant use of this drug is anticipated in the
      uro-oncology community in the coming years.

      The precise definition of dose according to the food-effect on bioavailability may be
      critical not only from a purely medical perspective and / or pharmacological but even for its
      socioeconomic impact in our health system.

      The hypothesis for this study is to prove that AA administered in reduced doses with standard
      diet presents a suitable pharmacokinetic profile which would achieve therapeutic levels in
      blood, so that regimens lower than currently approved in association with food can be used in
      future studies on efficacy.
