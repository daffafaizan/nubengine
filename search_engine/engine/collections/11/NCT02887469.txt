      The extent and rate of increase in serum sodium (sNa) levels during treatment are critical.
      Several methods for continuous infusion of hypertonic saline were used to guide rate of fluid
      administered to achieve the required serum sodium target. As based on static model, they had
      a bias to over-correction of hyponatremia. Alternative approach to treatment with hypertonic
      fluid is to use small, fixed boluses to achieve controlled increments in sNa. However, there
      was no high quality evidence on whether hypertonic saline are best given in continuous
      infusion (preferred by most) or bolus injection. The aim of present study, a multi-center
      (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital [2016.8~], Seoul National University Boramae
      Medical Center [2016. 9~], Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital [2017.7~]),
      randomized, open labelled, controlled clinical trial, is to investigate efficacy and safety
      of rapid intermittent correction compared with slow continuous correction with hypertonic
      saline in patient with moderately severe or severe symptomatic severe hyponatremia. A total
      178 patients, who suffer from symptomatic severe hyponatremia, will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to receive either intermittent bolus infusion or slow continuous infusion by 3%
      hypertonic saline. Subjects will take different rate of 3% hypertonic saline for 24-48 hours
      stratified by severity of clinical symptoms. Serum sodium will be measured at every six hours
      during two days.
