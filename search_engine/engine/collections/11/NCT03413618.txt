      structural changes in the wall and valves reflected with chronic venous insufficiency that
      called postthrombotic syndrome (PTS).

      Diosmin as a flavonoid agent has properties to reduce leukocyte-endothelial interaction and
      inflammatory response, that could reduce the damage to venous wall and valves.

      The hypothesis of the study is based on assumption that diosmin combined with standard
      anticoagulation can improve outcomes of femoro-popliteal DVT due to increase speed of veins
      recanalization, decrease of vein wall inflammation and finally decrease the incidence of PTS
      at 6 month and 1 year after index DVT.
