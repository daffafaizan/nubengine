      Cambridge Oncometrix believe that a semen biomarker may be able to predict the presence of
      prostate cancer. This study will allow work to be carried out on semen samples donated by men
      who have been identified by their GPs as having a risk of prostate cancer. Normally, GPs
      refer men with symptoms or a raised PSA to hospital to have an MRI scan and a biopsy.

      The PLiS research team at the hospital will contact potential patients, who have been
      referred by their GPs, before they have an MRI or a biopsy, ask them if they are willing to
      take part in the study, consent them and ask them to provide a semen sample. Semen samples
      will be produced by the potential participants at home into a seminal fluid collection
      container, they will also have to complete a study questionnaire. Both the sample and the
      questionnaire will be returned to the central laboratory in Cambridge using the stamped
      addressed envelope provided.

      In addition to providing a semen sample and completing a questionnaire, each participant will
      have two blood tests to measure male hormones. Participants then exit the trial and their
      usual care carries on from this point. The PLiS study will register 400 men and of those it
      is hoped that 300 of them will be able to provide semen.
