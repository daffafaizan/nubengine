      prevalence of both diseases is about 1%. Recently, another clinical entity was described, the
      non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). The origin and mechanisms of NCWS are unclear at
      present, but the existence of this new disease entity has been proven by double-blind
      placebo-controlled challenge tests. Three different grain components have been proposed as
      triggers of NCWS, gluten, Î±-amylase trypsin inhibitors or fermentable carbohydrates
      (FODMAPs).

      It is reported that individuals with self-diagnosed NCWS quite often tolerate spelt products
      much better, even though spelt shows a higher gluten content than bread wheat products.
      Therefore, the question arises whether this putative spelt tolerance can be confirmed on an
      objective basis and whether the underlying molecular mechanisms can be elucidated. So far,
      human study addressing such questions are lacking.

      This project aims to verify the hypothesis that spelt products are more tolerable than bread
      wheat products in a target group of individuals with self-diagnosed wheat sensitivity. In
      addition, the influence of different manufacturing processes on wheat sensitivity will be
      revealed.

      For this purpose, the trial involves individuals with self-diagnosed wheat sensitivity and
      spelt tolerance. Six different kinds of bread will be tested, including 4 wheat and spelt
      breads, each of them produced following a traditional or a conventional way. Aim of this part
      is to objective bread wheat and spelt intolerance in a defined population. To find out
      whether FODMAPs or gluten affect the tolerance of bread, two additional breads will be
      tested, a gluten-free bread with added gluten and a gluten-free bread with added FODMAPs.
