    
      The subject of this clinical investigation is the Continuum Metal Bearing THA System in
      primary total hip arthroplasty. This system consists of a cementless modular Trabecular
      Metalâ„¢ (TM) Continuum Acetabular Shell, a modular Metasul Taper liner, and a modular Metasul
      femoral head. The characteristics of this THA system may allow for reduction in wear and
      osteolysis as compared to other approved and marketed THA systems and thus increase the
      expected implant life.

      In total, 3 centers will be involved. This number of clinical sites will permit assessment of
      the consistency among a multitude of investigators. A total number of 100 subjects will be
      included in the study. It is anticipated that each clinical site will enroll 10 to 45
      eligible study subjects, who have provided written informed consent.
