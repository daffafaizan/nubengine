      formation and progression of non-exudative in age related macular degeneration (armd) by
      imaging the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) and the choroidal microvasculature and by
      studying their inter-dependence to determine if the loss of the CC could prove useful as an
      anatomic clinical trial endpoint in future drug trials. This is an extension of a currently
      ongoing longitudinal observational study (BIRC-01) (NCT03688243).
