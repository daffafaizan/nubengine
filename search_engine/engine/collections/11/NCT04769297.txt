    
      An investigation of a novel, off-label use of an FDA approved drug (ketamine) in a low(micro)
      dose sublingual formulation of ketamine provided to front-line healthcare workers who were
      identified as suffering from acute stress disorder.

      The study was conducted completely virtually via real-time telemedicine for physician visits
      and via asynchronous interaction for outcomes data collection.

      Patients self-referred to the study via email outreach, and diagnosis was confirmed by
      medically validated screening assessments and study physician confirmation.

      Once treatment was initiated, patients were seen via live telemedicine every 40 days while
      treatment response/outcomes data was collected weekly and monthly.

      Patients were treated up to 120 days.
