    
      Radical nephrectomy (RN) is the current standard of care for large organ confined renal
      tumors.

      Experience and surgical technical improvements have allowed the feasibility of Nephron
      Sparing Surgery (NSS) in tumors larger than 4 cm and up to 7cm. Very limited data exist
      regarding the feasibility and safety of NSS in tumors larger than 7cm.

      It has been demonstrated that NSS compared to RN offers similar oncological outcome while
      better preserving renal function and thus improving overall survival.

      The purpose of this study is to test the possibility of offering patients with large organ
      confined renal tumors, candidates for radical nephrectomy according to current guidelines the
      benefit of partial nephrectomy thanks to axitinib neo-adjuvant treatment.
