      oscillations (SO, large amplitude waves <1 Hz) and sleep spindles (8-15 Hz), that can be
      measured by electroencephalography (EEG), appear to be critical for declarative memories.
      According to the "active system consolidation" account, newly encoded memories are
      reactivated during sleep, accompanied by sharp-wave ripple events (80-100 Hz) in the
      hippocampus, and redistributed to cortical long-term storage networks through a coordinated
      dialog between the hippocampus and neocortex. This dialog is supposedly mediated by a
      particular coupling between cortical SO and thalamo-cortical fast spindles (12-15 Hz), with
      spindles preferably occurring during SO up-phases, and hippocampal ripples grouped at the
      troughs of fast spindles. Slow spindles (8-12 Hz) are a separate kind of sleep spindle
      activity whose function in memory consolidation is less well understood.

      Interventions targeting sleep parameters may not only make it possible to beneficially
      modulate a vital aspect of memory consolidation, i. e., sleep-dependent memory consolidation,
      but may also help to delineate which specific elements of the neural dynamics during sleep
      are crucial for successful consolidation.
