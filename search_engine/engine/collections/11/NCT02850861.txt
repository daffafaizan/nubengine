      surgical treatment from January 2014 to June 2016. Patients in the experimental group were
      treated with the condylar reductor, and patients in the control group were treated with the
      traditional surgical instruments. The primary outcome variable was reduction time and
      reduction rate. The continuity correction X2 and test student t test were used.
