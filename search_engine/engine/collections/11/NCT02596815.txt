      achieves pain relief through mechanical stimulation of the Median Nerve and the brachial
      plexus. It is believed that the hypoalgesic effect offered by the neural tissue mobilization
      procedure is a consequence of descending nervous system pain modulation activity and an
      improvement in the distinct biomechanical and sensitive properties of the involved neural
      tissue. The neural tissue mobilization procedure is associated to an increase in nerve
      mobility, edema, inflammation and intraneural pressure reduction without any known side
      effects when applied properly which is an important contrast to the wide variety of side
      effects caused by commonly used drug therapy to treat cervicobrachial pain.

      Despite the crescent interest among the scientific community in evidence based options to
      treat pain there is a current lack of enough controlled double blind clinical trials that
      measure the effectiveness of neural tissue mobilization techniques such as the (MNNM) and its
      specific effect over cervicobrachial pain. For this reason the present investigation
      consisted in the application of a treatment protocol based on Median Nerve Neural
      Mobilization in a controlled double blind clinical trial with the aim to assess its clinical
      effectiveness in treating pain symptoms.
