      immediate-release alprazolam, and Staccato Placebo in 14 subjects with a history of sedative
      abuse. Subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria received 2 mg of oral alprazolam and
      matching placebo over 2 sessions. Those who demonstrated greater liking for alprazolam versus
      placebo were eligible to participate in the study.
