      (different groups of subjects). Immediately following adaptation, continuous theta burst
      magnetic stimulation (cTBS) will be applied to either auditory or somatosensory or motor
      cortex with the goal of blocking consolidation of motor memory. The logic of applying cTBS to
      both sensory areas is to test the hypothesis that both areas are involved in motor memory
      consolidation. Subjects leave the laboratory following cTBS and return 24 hours later to
      assess retention of learning. Learning is assessed as percentage change in speech sounds or
      movements relative to baseline. Retention is measured on a 0 to 100 scale relative to the end
      of learning.
