        -  Determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
           leukemia treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (CMA-676) and high-dose cytarabine.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (CMA-676) (phase I closed
      to accrual effective 08/25/2003). Patients are stratified according to disease status
      (refractory vs relapsed).

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual effective 08/25/2003): Patients are enrolled in one of four
           cohorts.

             -  Cohort I (closed to accrual as of 10/1/02): Patients receive CMA-676 at the first
                dose level IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8.

             -  Cohort IA (open to accrual as of 10/15/02): Patients receive high-dose cytarabine
                (HD-ARA-C) IV over 3 hours on days 1-5 and CMA-676 IV over 2 hours on day 7.

             -  Cohort II: Patients receive HD-ARA-C as in cohort IA and CMA-676 at the first dose
                level IV over 2 hours on days 7 and 14.

             -  Cohort IV: Patients receive CMA-676 at the second dose level and HD-ARA-C as in
                cohort II.

      Dose escalation stops if at least 3 of 9 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive HD-ARA-C IV over 3 hours on days 1-5 and CMA-676 IV over 2
           hours on day 7 (one course).

      Patients are followed at 1 month, monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then
      annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a
      total of 37 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study within 2 years. (Phase I
      closed to accrual effective 08/25/2003).
