      condition for which multiple strategies are needed to improve outcomes. The absolute number
      of years lost to disability due to COPD exceeds the years of life lost due to premature
      death. There is strong evidence that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves outcomes and is
      cost saving, but fewer than 2% of patients have access to these programs. New methods of PR
      are needed to increase access of patients with COPD to these established benefits. To address
      this gap we propose a novel physical activity self-management (PASM) program based on an
      evidence-based physical activity intervention designed to increase physical activity and
      quality of life. Key components of the program include tailored telephone counseling, a
      workbook, and computer-assisted telephone follow-up. Our specific aims are: 1) To implement a
      PASM program for patients with COPD. 2) To conduct an 18-month, randomized, controlled,
      single-blind trial comparing PASM (n=150) to usual care (UC) (n=150) to determine the
      effectiveness on functional performance and health status. 3) To determine the
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Follow-up data will be collected at 6, 12, and 18
      months after start of the intervention. We will test the following two hypotheses: 1)
      Patients with COPD who receive PASM have clinically and statistically significant
      improvements in functional performance (i.e., Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire [CRQ] dyspnea
      domain and 6-minute walk) compared to patients who receive UC. 2) The PASM program is more
      cost-effective compared to the UC. The project addresses a major gap in the current
      management of COPD and may provide a novel, cost-effective strategy for improving functional
      performance and health status.
