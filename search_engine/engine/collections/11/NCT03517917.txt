      development of manufacturing processes for potential immunotherapies.

      Visit 1: Suitable patients will provide consent at the first patient visit, followed by
      baseline assessments as per standard of care and per protocol. Details will also be collected
      about current medical conditions and procedures and current medications. Patients will be
      tested for infectious diseases e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Human T-cell
      lymphotropic virus (HTLV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Syphilis.

      Visit 2: Procured tumour samples will be obtained during the patients standard of care
      surgery, or the patient may provide a superficial skin or subcutaneous lymph node disease
      sample strictly for the purposes of the trial. All patients will also donate a whole blood
      sample conducted as a non-standard of care procedure.

      All donated samples will be couriered to a specialist Sponsor laboratory with appropriate
      oversight maintained.

      Visit 3: Following the surgical procedure patients will receive their standard follow up
      care. Under this protocol a follow up telephone call will be made to ensure patients have
      recovered fully.

      For those patients who plan to undergo the leukapheresis procedure:

      Visit 3 serves as a re-confirmation of eligibility (screening) to undergo leukapheresis
      collection Visit 4: The leukapheresis procedure is conducted, providing the patient consents
      and is deemed fit by their treating physician to undergo the procedure.

      Visit 5: A leukapheresis safety follow up visit is conducted where bloods are checked for the
      patient. Visit 5 concludes the patients participation in the study.
