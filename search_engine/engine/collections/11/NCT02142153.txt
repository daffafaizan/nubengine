    
      Double blind, placebo controlled, ascending single intravenous dose, sequential group study.
      Forty subjects will be studied in 5 cohorts (Groups A to E), each group consisting of 8
      subjects. Each subject will be on study for approximately 6 weeks. Each subject will
      participate in one treatment cohort only, residing at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from
      Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 6 (120 hours post-dose). Each cohort will be dosed in a
      leading edge design in which two subjects will receive study drug (1 active and 1 placebo) on
      the first dosing day, and the last 6 will receive study drug (active or placebo) on the
      second dosing day.

      All subjects will return for a post-study visit 8 to 10 days after the dose of study
      medication.

      Cohorts will be dosed at 2 weekly intervals. There will be a review of safety and
      pharmacokinetic data prior to each dose escalation.
