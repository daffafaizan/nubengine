      suggests that urolithins, gut microbial metabolites derived from ellagitannins contained in
      raspberries, can improve vascular health. It has also been observed that the capacity of the
      gut microbiome to metabolize urolithins can influence the cardiometabolic response to
      ellagitannin consumption. In this work the investigators aim to investigate whether urolithin
      metabotypes (UM-A, B and 0) can influence the vascular response to a (poly)phenol-rich
      breakfast containing red raspberry ellagitannins in a healthy UK population.

      You will be stratified by metabotype in a first phase (NCT03573414) and are then randomly
      allocated to treatment or placebo. Outcomes are measured at baseline and after 12 weeks
      consumption of the study product.
