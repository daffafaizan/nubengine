    
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common disorder with an estimated annual incidence of
      125-542 in adults, and an estimated prevalence of 1 to 5 percent in the general population.
      CTS is the most frequent compressive focal mononeuropathy and causes pain, paresthesia and
      weakness of the median nerve distribution in patients.

      The treatment of the CTS includes both, conservative and surgical treatment depending on the
      severity of the symptoms.

      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been proved to be efficient in the non-surgical treatment of
      CTS, however its potential used as co-adjuvant in surgical treatment has not been assessed.

      We propose a randomized clinical trial in patients in which the surgical treatment is
      indicated. Participants in the intervention group receive a PRP injection, and in the control
      group a platelet-poor plasma injection after open carpal tunnel release. The evaluation is
      performed pretreatment as well as on the 6st week after treatment. Outcome measures include:
      hand grip strength (primary outcome), pain, sympton severity and functional status.
