      Bexsero速 nor with Trumenba速, are available in asplenic patients, population at high risk of
      infection.

      As asplenic individuals (all causes) show less optimal immune response to conjugate
      meningococcal C vaccine compared to matched controls. [4], we hypothesize that a similar less
      optimal response may be expected for MenB vaccines among asplenic subjects. .

      That is why, we proposed in this study to evaluate two reinforced strategies with 3
      administrations (M0, M1, and M6) of Bexsero速 or Trumenba 速. Moreover, the study will also
      allow exploring the persistence of the immune response in this population. Indeed, few data
      are available on this persistence in the general population.
