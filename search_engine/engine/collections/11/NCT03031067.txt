    
      Our national single-center study, interventional with medical device, exploratory and safety,
      will be assessed the optimal graft preservation, liver and kidney, from marginal donors ECD
      (Expanded Criteria Donors), using hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (PIO) compared to the
      static cold storage that is the preservation control method of custom. PIO will be applied to
      10 ECD liver transplants and 10 ECD kidney transplants that meet the inclusion criteria.

      The marginal graft will be perfused with oxygenated solution of preservation at 4Â°C for two
      hours with Exiper, Bologna Machine Perfusion, developed by Medica s.p.a and our research
      group.

      Flow and pressure values will be set up for the kidney and liver perfusion, otherwise. The
      oxygenation of solution will be performed by an oxygenator and a filter for decapneization /
      oxygenation. During the perfusion the oxygen pressure will be required between 600-750 mmHg
      (pO2 80-100 Kpa), as reported in the scientific literature. The pH, lactate concentration,
      and oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (PCO2) partial pressure were measured in the preservation
      solution at T0 and T1 by means of a standard haemogasanalyzer.

      After transplantation, the recipients will be monitored clinically to assess the graft
      function. The liver's data will be compared with similar case treated with SCS in our centre
      of transplant, retrospectively; instead, the kidney's data will be compared with the "twin"
      organ transplanted without PIO, prospectively.
