    
      IMM-101 is a suspension of heat-killed whole cell Mycobacterium obuense. Since it is a
      heat-killed preparation, treatment is not associated with the potential side-effects of
      delivering live or attenuated organisms.

      Five studies with IMM-101 have been completed including a 110-patient randomised Phase II
      study in pancreatic cancer and exploratory studies in other solid tumours (melanoma,
      colorectal cancer and advanced melanoma).
