      (GB) is currently dismal, and temozolomide adds a modest survival benefit at high monetary
      cost and is accompanied by considerable toxicity. A possible explanation for the failure of
      radiotherapy to cure GB is the observation that glioma cells migrate widely into healthy
      bilateral brain tissue from one or more foci of origin. These isolated cells are not detected
      by current radiological techniques or even imaging and therefore usually not included into
      the target volume during radiotherapy. In this present study the investigators would like to
      test the hypothesis that the dose prescribed to the normal tissue stem cell niche in the
      adult brain will influence the effectiveness of radiotherapy for patients suffering from
      HGG/GB as these niches may serve as a harbor for radioresistant glioma stem cells, which are
      the only cells in a HGG believed to able to repopulate a tumor.

      The hypothesis is based on previous reports showing that adult normal tissue stem cells
      reside in the lateral periventricular regions of the lateral ventricles and animal studies
      reporting that transformation of normal tissues stem cells but not differentiated cells lead
      to tumor formation. This unique anatomical pattern of the brain that clearly separates stem
      cell niches as a potential pool of cancer stem cell (CSC's) from differentiated tissue make
      this an ideal model system to study the impact of radiation dose given to these stem cell
      niches. Therefore, prospective, randomized clinical trials are needed to address the efficacy
      and toxicity of including the CSC-containing subventricular region as additional target
      volumes into treatment plans for patients suffering from HGG/GB. This intervention could
      dramatically improve the outcomes of patients suffering from progressive, relapsing disease
      despite our best efforts currently.
