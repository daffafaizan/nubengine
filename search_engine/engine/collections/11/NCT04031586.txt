      malnutrition in high proportions. Without proper access to care and a minimal or basic level
      of care, these children are exposed to worse conditions. Studies have shown that more than
      half of the children with cancer are also malnourished at diagnosis. This increases
      children's risk of complications associated with the treatment as well as the abandonment of
      care, as well as decrease the level of survival rates. With an established nutritional
      education and clinical intervention program, the outcomes of these children can be improved,
      especially in Central America where the cancer rates and malnutrition is high, as shown by
      several studies.
