      trial, in parallel groups. Patients will be stratified by clinical center, by percentage of
      classic CNV vessels: [predominantly classic (>50%) vs. minimally classic (1-49%) vs. purely
      occult (0%)], and according to whether, or not, they have received prior PDT with Visudyne
      (no more than once). All patients will be re-randomized after 54 weeks of treatment to
      either, continue or discontinue therapy for further 48 weeks.
