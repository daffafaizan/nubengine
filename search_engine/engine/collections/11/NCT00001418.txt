      6-[18F]fluorodopamine ([18F]-6F-DA) to visualize sympathetic innervation and function in
      patients with neurocardiologic disorders. Patients undergo infusion of [18F]-6F-DA, followed
      by PET scanning of one or more body regions. Patients may also undergo PET scanning after
      administration of [13N]-ammonia, to assess regional perfusion; regional blood sampling
      (including sampling from the coronary sinus or great cardiac vein) during infusion of
      [3H]-l-norepinephrine ([3H]-NE), to assess the kinetics and metabolism of NE; or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to delineate the ventricular myocardium. PET scanning after
      [18F]-6F-DA administration, in conjunction with other clinical assessment tools, should
      provide comprehensive information about regional sympathoneural innervation and function in
      neurocardiologic disorders.
