      I. To obtain preliminary data (e.g. mean, variance, distribution) in the regional brain
      parenchymal changes associated with gadolinium (Gd) deposition during 8 to 18 months period
      after administration of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) to Gd naive intracranial
      neoplasm patients who will be randomized to gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance) or gadoterate
      meglumine (Dotarem).

      II. To explore if areas of increased regional Gd deposition at individual level are
      correlated with baseline regional DCE permeability metrics such as volume transfer
      coefficient reflecting vascular permeability (kTrans), extracellular volume ratio reflecting
      vascular permeability (ve) and plasma volume (vp) in intracranial neoplasm patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care QSM and T1 weighted imaging (T1WI). Patients then
      receive gadobenate dimeglumine intravenously (IV) and undergo GOCART DCE MRI over 60 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care QSM and T1WI. Patients then receive gadoterate
      meglumine IV and undergo GOCART DCE MRI over 60 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 8-18 months.
