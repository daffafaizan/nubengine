      controls) performed a behavioral task: the Eriksen Flanker Task. The continuous EEG was
      segmented, corrected for artifacts and averaged. A component of the event-related brain
      potential known as the error-related negativity (ERN) was identified and its amplitude
      quantified in microvolts.

      This procedure was conducted two hours after the administration of risperidone 1 mg and
      placebo (lactose) on two different experimental days and for each participant group (SPD
      patients and controls).

      The amplitude of the ERN after placebo was compared between groups to test for baseline
      (non-drug-induced) differences between patients and controls.

      The impact of risperidone on the amplitude of the ERN was compared between the two
      participant groups.
