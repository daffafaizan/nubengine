      with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The data for pharmacologic treatment of repetitive
      behaviours in this disorder has also become difficult to interpret given that the last two
      large multisite trials of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism are
      reported to be negative for the treatment of repetitive behaviours. Only the associated
      symptom of irritability has 2 drugs with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications,
      whereas no systematic data exists on the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety in ASD, and
      response rates to stimulants for hyperactivity are lower than what is seen in Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In addition, there are no biological markers of
      treatment response identified in this population at this point. This study will examine the
      potential efficacy and safety of tideglusib for core and associated symptom domains of
      autism, and will explore biological markers of safety and treatment response. As there is no
      juvenile toxicity published in the animal model, we will limit the age range to 12 years of
      age and older.
