      adenoid tissues of children with COM versus a control group without any COM.

      Design: This is a monocentric, prospective, unrandomized case-control study comparing the
      prevalence of biofilm formations in adenoid tissues of two groups.

      Clinical research study without direct medical benefit: during routine adenoidectomy,
      specimens are not used and thrown away. This study do not modify the common management of
      included children.

      Number of subjects required: A considered approach of simple size calculation have been made
      using a method proposed by MIETINEN for Mc NEMAR Chi2 test. Simple size N=104 will allow 80%
      power to detect different of 20% (absolute), considering a total percentage of discordance
      pair at 30 %.

      Expected results: a higher prevalence (30% estimation) of biofilm formations in group 1 in
      comparison with that in group 2 would be the first clinical research study bringing
      understanding of the role of adenoid tissues by harboring mucosal biofilms in otitis prone
      children.
