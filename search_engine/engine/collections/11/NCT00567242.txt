      aphasia patients was developed. The intention component involves initiating word-finding
      trials with a complex left-hand movement. The study addresses (1) whether or not the
      intention manipulation (complex left-hand movement) makes a unique contribution to treatment
      outcome and (2) whether or not the intention manipulation helps to shift word production
      mechanisms from the left to the right frontal lobe. All study participants take part in
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of word-finding before and after treatment
      and at 3-month follow-up to measure changes in lateralization of frontal lobe activity during
      word finding. Only patients with a substantial degree of left frontal activity on the
      pre-treatment fMRI scan can participate. There are three specific aims: (1) to determine if
      repetitive initiation of word production with a complex left-hand movement leads to increased
      right-hemisphere lateralization of frontal activity and if these changes can be attributed to
      the intention component of treatment, (2) to determine whether activity in posterior
      perisylvian cortices that is entrained to right frontal activity shows a greater increase in
      right-hemisphere lateralization from pre- to post-treatment fMRI when the intention component
      is included in treatment, and (3) to determine whether onset of hemodynamic responses (HDRs)
      in right motor/premotor cortex becomes more closely associated with the temporal onset of
      participants' spoken responses across treatment when the intention component is included in
      treatment. If successful, the treatment can provide a new treatment vehicle for increasing
      language function in patients with "nonfluent" aphasia.
