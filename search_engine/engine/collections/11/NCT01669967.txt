      over four weeks following infusion compared to an active placebo infusion of
      diphenhydramine(Benadryl) in normal saline. If we can show that intravenous lidocaine
      provides sustained benefit for up to one month, this will be a major advance in the
      management of individuals suffering from neuropathic pain.
