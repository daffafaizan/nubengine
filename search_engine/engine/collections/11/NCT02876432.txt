      Î²2-adrenoreceptors by catecholamines, Electrical stimulation of vagus nerve limits the
      inflammatory response in several animal models of inflammatory diseases, In addition,
      voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system by meditation, training or breathing
      techniques limits production of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo during experimental
      endotoxemia in healthy human volunteers.

      Currently there are therapies that effectively antagonize proinflammatory cytokines and
      control pain, as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics, but had serious
      side effects if used chronically. Therefore, alternative therapies as electroacupuncture,
      which may limit inflammatory cytokine production more physiologically, are warranted. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate de effect of electroacupuncture used for attenuation of low
      back pain in the activation of sympathetic nervous system and leukocyte inflammatory
      potential.
