      sites currently include: The Hospital for Special Surgery, Oregon Health and Science
      University, Inova Sports Medicine, and Mayo Clinic. Patients are randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment groups. Patients assigned to the "stabilization" group will undergo surgery to
      reconstruct the MPFL using either a hamstring tendon that is your own or one obtained from a
      donor. Patients assigned to the "conservative" group will be treated with physical therapy,
      and possibly a simple knee arthroscopy if you are found to have a loose fragment on x-ray or
      MRI. All patients will be required to return for follow-up visits, which will continue over
      the course of 5 years. During these visits, patients will be examined, asked to answer
      questions about their surgery and general health, and have imaging (x-ray and MRI) performed
      on the knee. All patients enrolled in this study will undergo a standardized, intensive
      rehabilitation protocol. The investigators anticipate that all patients may benefit from
      extensive rehabilitation, including strengthening and return to sport training. The knowledge
      gained from this study may benefit others in the future.
