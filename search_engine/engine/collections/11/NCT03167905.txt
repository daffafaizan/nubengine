      take part in this study, they will be assigned to either epidural or non-epidural pain relief
      for labour based on the study randomization result. Blood samples will be drawn to study the
      presence of known functional polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with depression,
      pain, stress and anxiety. Patients will be followed up with study questionnaires related to
      pain and postnatal depression screening during the study.

      During any time of the labour period, the patient is allowed to switch the pain relief option
      upon request.
