    
      GOG-210 is a molecular and surgico-pathological staging study of endometrial carcinoma. The
      overall goal of this pilot protocol is to improve outcome and/or quality of life for patients
      with endometrial cancer. This fundamental goal will be accomplished through the development
      of more accurate models of risk, identification of candidate targets for therapeutic
      intervention and utilization of individualized treatments based on molecular characteristics
      identified in tumor tissue, normal tissue and/or in readily accessible biological fluids,
      like serum and urine. This molecular and surgico-pathological staging study is structured to
      collect tissue, urine, serum, and epidemiologic and clinical data from approximately 3,500
      patients with endometrial cancer identified at participating GOG institutions. All of the
      patients will be surgically-pathologically staged, consistently evaluated, further treated as
      needed, and followed for up to 10 years after surgery to document further treatment and
      outcome. A series of independent and integrated research projects will be undertaken to
      utilize high-throughput methodologies (e.g., genomics and proteomics) and more traditional
      techniques (e.g., immunoassays) to examine cellular and extracellular factors, including
      chromosomes, DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. The results obtained from the
      comprehensive laboratory testing performed on these clinical specimens with the clinical and
      epidemiologic data collected for each GOG-0210 patient will represent an enduring resource
      for endometrial cancer research to study the factors that control the growth and spread of
      endometrial cancer, and how to predict response to therapy and risk of disease spread,
      recurrence and overall survival for patients with this disease. This will be the first
      implementation of the NCI-developed epidemiologic questionnaire, which will allow GOG
      protocols to systematically and uniformly collect demographic and epidemiologic data that
      will enhance the analytic capabilities of this study. If successful, this study will serve as
      a model for other protocol to implement the same epidemiologic questionnaire.
