      hematopoiesis. DNA hypomethylating agents such as decitabine have been shown to have activity
      in this disorder by reversing the epigenetic mechanism of gene silencing.

      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a hematological disorder characterized by ineffective
      hematopoiesis and malignant expansion of clonal myeloid cells. In elderly patients (â‰¥ 60
      years old), MDS commonly precedes the diagnosis of AML. Standard therapy for AML consists of
      cytotoxic chemotherapy and is often followed with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
      Unfortunately, elderly patients are often unable to tolerate such aggressive therapy.

      Arsenic has also shown activity in patients with MDS and AML though modulation of apoptosis
      via increased oxidative stress. In preclinical modes, arsenic activity is related to the
      production of radical oxygen species that damage mitochondria. Cellular glutathione acts as a
      cellular antioxidant and can be depleted with the vitamin ascorbic acid which increases
      intracellular oxidative stress and sensitivity to arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis.

      We are studying the combination of decitabine, arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid, two
      primary agents and one vitamin all with different mechanisms of action in order to improve
      the response rate in patients with MDS and AML. This is an open-label, single-arm,
      single-center, dose escalation Phase I trial of decitabine, arsenic trioxide and ascorbic
      acid in patients with MDS, either de novo or secondary, fitting any of the FAB
      classifications and AML.
