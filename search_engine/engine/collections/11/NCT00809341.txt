      or an equivalent regimen must be used. During the third cycle of Rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy,
      a PET-CT scan will be performed. The PET scan will be designated as negative or positive.
      Based on the results, patients will either complete standard dose therapy or receive two
      cycles of R-ICE followed by high dose cyclophosphamide and rituximab.

      A repeat PET-CT is required between 4 to 6 weeks following treatment completion. Patients
      will be followed-up every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for one year, then
      annually until 5 years.
