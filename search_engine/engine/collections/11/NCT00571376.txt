      electronic health records within 10 years and the presence of a widespread clinical
      information exchange capability will greatly facilitate this goal. Through HEAL NY, New York
      State is currently awarding millions of dollars in grants to support health information
      technology initiatives across the state through regional clinical information exchanges. The
      financial success of these initiatives is expected to result from improvements in health care
      quality and efficiency. However, whether these initiatives will be cost saving, as experts
      assert, and what the return-on-investments of these initiatives will be are unknown.
      Answering these questions will provide critical information to the nation as we progress
      towards a national health information network. We will conduct a multi-center financial
      evaluation of regional clinical information exchanges. The results of the financial
      evaluations proposed in this study will provide a framework and standardized methodology
      including metrics for financial evaluations of regional health information organizations and
      return-on-investment analyses from the perspectives of providers and payers. We will consider
      the financial effects as driven by changes in quality, safety, and efficiency.

      The most advanced community we studied was Rochester, NY, and studying this community allowed
      us to measure the effects of health information technology and health information exchange on
      3 major utilization outcomes (hospital admissions, hospital re-admissions, and repeat medical
      imaging).
