      will be used concurrently with sorafenib at 3 different dosages to determine the tolerability
      and efficacy of this combined treatment. Sorafenib doses will be 200mg twice daily orally for
      28 days in level I, 400 mg in the morning and 200mg in the evening in level II, and 400mg
      twice daily orally for 28 days in level III . Radiotherapy will be started at day 8, patients
      will receive a total of 6 fractions over 2 weeks. Patients will be assessed weekly during
      treatment, 1 month post-tx, then at 3-month intervals for up to a year after tx, and then
      followed-up at 6-month intervals up to 3 years. Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is
      established, an expanded cohort for each stratum will accrue such that a total of 10 patients
      per strata. This will allow us to gain further experience with this regimen and consolidate
      the safety and efficacy data. Quality of Life (QOL) assessment will be carried out at
      baseline and 1/3/6/9 mos post-tx. Patients will also be offered correlative studies looking
      at biomarkers through tissue, blood, and urine samples, and an imaging study looking at
      tissue perfusion.
