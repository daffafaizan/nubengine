        -  Determine the response rate of patients with poor-prognosis, HIV-related non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma treated with rituximab combined with prednisolone, vincristine, and bleomycin.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV and bleomycin IV on day 1 and oral
      prednisolone every other day beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6
      courses. Patients also receive rituximab on days 14, 21, 28, and 35. Patients who achieve
      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy after CR.

      Patients are followed every 1-2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
