      reference Neulasta® in women (≥18 years) receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. Therefore
      patients were randomized to receive LA-EP2006 (n = 159) or the reference product (n = 157)
      for ≤6 cycles of (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel 75mg/m^2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m^2, and
      cyclophosphamide 500mg/m^2) chemotherapy. The primary end point was the duration of severe
      neutropenia (DSN) during Cycle 1 (defined as number of consecutive days with absolute
      neutrophil count <0.5 × 10^9/l). The equivalence was confirmed if 95% CIs were within a ±1
      day margin. LA-EP2006 was equivalent to the reference product in DSN (difference: 0.07 days;
      95% CI [-0.12, 0.26]). Further, LA-EP2006 and the reference Neulasta® showed no clinically
      meaningful differences regarding efficacy and safety.
