    
      This is a multicentre, prospective, observational study. Length of patient recruitment is 12
      weeks, the length of observation is 360 postoperative days. The expected number of patients
      is 1000.

      Subject population:

      Men and women

        1. aged ≥ 18 years AND

        2. are classified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status
           Classification System (ASA) ≥ 3 AND

        3. are scheduled for elective or emergency surgical procedure classified as major OR
           major/complex by Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT)

      Not eligible surgical procedures:

        -  organ transplantation

        -  immediate trauma

        -  breast

        -  ear, nose throat

      Patient characteristics will be prospectively collected from medical records: age, gender,
      co-morbidities, medical history, physical activity, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen
      saturation and neurological function; routine laboratory findings; type, complexity, urgency
      of surgery, incision localization and malignancy; lowest intraoperative systolic blood
      pressure, heart rate. The outcomes are the postoperative complications (POMS) classified by
      the Clavien-Dindo classification tool (during hospital stay), and mortality , use of
      medications, hospital admissions (0-360 days) and new occurrence in different disease related
      national quality registries.
