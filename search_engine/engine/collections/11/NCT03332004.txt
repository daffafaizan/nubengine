      consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The first abdominal and pelvi's inspection was made using direct laparoscope visualization
      under white light conditions. All areas suspected of peritoneal endometriosis were classified
      as white, black and red lesions and recorded together with their anatomic location in the
      surgical record for the purposes of subsequent extirpation.

      After the first visual inspection the patient was administered with 0.05 - 0.25 mg /(kg BW)
      Indocyanine Green intravenously. The Indocyanine Green imaging mode of the Olympus
      Indocyanine Green Imaging System was activated and suspected areas in Indocyanine Green
      imaging mode were recorded with their corresponding appearance in white light mode.

      If suspected areas were visible either in white light or Indocyanine Green imaging mode,
      specific sample has been taken from these areas.

      In addition control biopsy specimens from inconspicuous peritoneum has been taken.
