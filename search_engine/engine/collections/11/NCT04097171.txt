      sub-elite, highly trained recreational athletes competing in endurance events. However,
      recently the ketogenic diet (extremely low carbohydrate content) has become popular in these
      populations. The effect on endurance exercise performance, energy expenditure, postprandial
      blood profiles, and cognitive function and mood states requires further investigation.

      In this study, highly trained recreational cyclists and triathletes will adhere to each diet
      (high-carbohydrate and ketogenic) for 14 days in a crossover design. Experimental trials at
      baseline and after each diet will evaluate endurance cycling performance (time trial),
      resting energy expenditure, the thermic effect of food of test meals corresponding in
      composition to each diet, postprandial responses of blood lipids, glucose and appetite
      hormones, and cognitive function and mood states.
