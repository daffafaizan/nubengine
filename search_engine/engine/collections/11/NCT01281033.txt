    
      The SMART Study is an on-label, randomized, 2-arms, prospective study in patients with STEMI
      undergoing primary PCI. Diagnosis of STEMI is based on ECG evidence of ischemic ST changes,
      clinical symptoms, and elevated CK and CK-MB cardiac enzymes. Patients who are eligible for
      the Study and who provide written informed consent will be included in the study.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Patient is > 18 years of age.

        -  Patient has ST-segment elevation of at least 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous leads or
           presumably new LBBB for all types of infarcts.

        -  Patient's AMI presentation is greater than 30 minutes but less than 6 hours after
           symptom onset.

        -  Patient provides written informed consent.

        -  Patient has no childbearing potential or is not pregnant.

        -  Target artery has a reference vessel diameter of at least 2.5 mm on visual assessment at
           baseline angiography.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Known prior history of renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL).

        -  Cardiogenic shock.

        -  Prior administration of thrombolysis for the current infarction.

        -  Participation in another study.

        -  Major surgery within past 6 weeks.

        -  History of stroke within 30 days, or any history of hemorrhagic stroke.

        -  Severe hypertension (systolic BP > 200 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 110 mm Hg) not controlled
           on antihypertensive therapy.

        -  Known neutropenia ( <1000 neutrophils per mm3) or known severe thrombocytopenia (<
           50,000 platelets per mm3).

        -  Patient unwilling to receive blood products.

        -  Previously stented IRA (stent thrombosis).

        -  Inability to identify the IRA.

        -  Severe vessel tortuosity that enables OCT assessment.
