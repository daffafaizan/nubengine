      and is currently causing a global pandemic.

      The disease, named COVID-19, causes an influenza syndrome associated with respiratory signs,
      but there are also asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic forms. Approximately 2 to 3% of
      patients, primarily patients with pre-existing chronic diseases and the elderly, develop a
      very severe form responsible for an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead
      to death.

      It has been shown that patients with a severe and critical form had an impaired type 1
      interferon response, with decreased plasma levels of IFN-alpha2 in the most severe patients
      compared to hospitalized patients with a moderate form, and undetectable levels of IFN-beta.
      This lack of type 1 IFN response was associated with greater viral persistence in the blood
      and an exaggerated inflammatory response mediated primarily by the NF-kB pathway.

      Almost all studies published to date on immune system disruption during CoV-2-SARS infection
      included mainly hospitalized patients requiring oxygen therapy due to their severity,
      assessed at the time of clinical worsening.

      Thus, there is no or little data on immunological response profiles, particularly on type 1
      IFN response but also on other aspects of the immunological response (adaptive cellular and
      humoral immunity), and its relationship with viral clearance kinetics during ambulatory forms
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas these forms represent more than 95% of the clinical forms.

      The asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic forms managed on an outpatient basis represent the
      most common form of CoV-2-SARS infection, with a favourable outcome in almost all cases.

      A better description and understanding of the immunological profile, including type 1 IFN
      response and viral clearance kinetics in saliva, blood and feces, during asymptomatic and
      mild clinical forms will allow the identification of the major players in the immune response
      against SARS-CoV-2, and thus better define the responses that are lacking in severe patients.
