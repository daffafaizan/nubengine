           standards, based on clinical indications. Macroscopic examination of the fetus will be
           performed initially, followed by organ removal for tissue fixation for a period of two
           weeks. The brain is then scanned with MRI at the Hospital for Sick Children. The brain
           is transported in an air-tight container containing 10% formalin and sealed with
           paraffin lined tape. All brains will be anonymised and coded with a number prior to MRI
           examination. Following MR imaging, the tissue will be examined, sampled and reported in
           the usual fashion at Mount Sinai Hospital.

        2. Postmortem MR will be included as part of the autopsy examination in cases of suspected
           brain malformations. Postmortem MR will be performed at the Hospital for Sick Children
           due to availability of expertise in postmortem neuroimaging and imaging will be done
           using 1.5T GE CV/I MRI magnet (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Postmortem MR will be
           performed following dissection and tissue fixation to avoid any unnecessary delay in
           tissue fixation. The specimen will be scanned in an air-tight container containing
           formalin 10%, sealed with paraffin lined tape. Structural postmortem MR will include
           coronal spin-echo T1 (TR=517msec, TE=10msec, FOV=18cm, slice thickness=20-30mm,
           matrix=320x256), axial SPGR (TR=23msec, TE=8msec, FOV=18cm, slice thickness=1.1mm,
           matrix=256x256) and T2 imaging in three planes (TR=4115msec, TE=115msec, FOV=16cm, slice
           thickness=20-30mm, matrix=320x256). Diffusion tensor imaging (TR=8300msec, TE=99msec,
           FOV=180mm, slice thickness=2-3mm, b=700mm/sec2, NEX=8, matrix=128x128, 25 directions)
           will be performed in the coronal plane to match the histological sections of brain
           tissue in autopsy.

        3. Analysis. The laminar organization of the fetal cerebrum on structural MR and diffusion
           tensor imaging will be evaluated. In particular, the germinal matrix, intermediate zone,
           subplate and cortex will be assessed. This will be compared with the gold standard of
           histopathology. The presence or absence of corticospinal tracts will also be assessed
           and compared with macroscopic examination and histological sections.

        4. Statistical analysis. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of postmortem MR, both
           structural and diffusion tensor imaging, as compared to the gold standard of autopsy in
           assessing the abnormal laminar organization of fetal cerebrum will be evaluated.
