      mineralisation, several studies have shown immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D. Vitamin D
      deficiency is a common problem in patients with COPD..

      Objective: To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate in patients
      with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency.

      Study design: Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study.

      Study population: 240 patients aged 40 years and older with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency
      (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration(25OHD)<50 nmol/l) with a COPD exacerbation. An
      exacerbation is defined as sustained worsening of respiratory symptoms during 48 hours and
      requiring oral corticosteroid, antibiotic or combination treatment that was initiated by a
      physician. Respiratory symptoms include at least one of the Anthonisen criteria (increased
      dyspnoea, sputum volume or purulence). Patients with a severe vitamin D deficiency (25OHD<15
      nmol/l), known osteoporosis and/or use of vitamin D supplementation > 400 IU per day will be
      excluded.

      Intervention: Participants will be randomly allocated to receive vitamin D3 16800 IU or
      placebo orally once a week during 1 year.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is exacerbation rate.

      Follow-up of the study:

      Recruitment of participants is more troublesome than expected due to several reasons, more
      use of vitamin D supplements, higher 250hydroxyvitamin D levels than anticipated, less
      suitability due to presence other exclusion criteria.

      29/8/2017 total number recruited participants is 119

      10/7/2018 closure of recruitment, total number recruited participants is 158
