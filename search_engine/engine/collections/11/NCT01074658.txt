      CoreValve System for percutaneous aortic valve implantation in a "Real-World" patient
      population with severe aortic valve stenosis. Data collected in this study will provide
      additional information on the understanding of the safety and device performance and how to
      best treat elderly patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. In addition, health economic
      data will be collected to understand the improvement of quality of life and the cost
      effectiveness of the therapy.
