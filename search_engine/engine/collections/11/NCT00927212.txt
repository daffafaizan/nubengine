      of children and 2% of adults worldwide. The mechanism of AD is still not completely
      understood, but the disorder appears to result from the complex interaction between
      immunological responses, various susceptability genes, defects in skin barrier function, host
      and environmental factors and infectious agents. AS101 is a non toxic potent immunomodulator
      that has been shown to have beneficial effects in diverse pre clinical and clinical studies.
      Recently, AS101 has shown efficacy and safety in the treatment of mild to moderate Psoriasis
      which shares with AD a related immunological mechanism along with the AS101 ability to
      decrease the level of interleukins known to be involved ith the pathogenesis of AD.
