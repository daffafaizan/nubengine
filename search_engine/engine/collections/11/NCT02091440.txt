      defined as alive on the originally implanted HW005 or transplanted or explanted for recovery.
      Patients must survive 60 days post-explant for recovery to be considered successful. The
      primary endpoint is not statistically powered. The six eligible implanted cases will be
      evaluated as a proportion of success accompanied by a 95% exact confidence interval and
      presented alongside the ADVANCE results for visual comparison.
