      colonoscopy. Although evidence of benefit of a liquid diet is minimal and there is a growing
      body of evidence about the benefits of a liberalized diet, a high degree of heterogeneity in
      the clinical trials comparing the diet modifications before colonoscopy prevents a formal
      recommendation in current guidelines. A low-fiber diet the day before colonoscopy may result
      in same efficacy of bowel cleanliness, with an improved tolerability and acceptability.

      All consecutive patients of a population-based colorectal screening cancer program referred
      for a colonoscopy will be invited to participate in the study. After obtaining informed
      consent, they will be randomized to one of the groups: liquid diet or low-fiber diet. The
      will be interviewed by a registered research nurse, and they will be provided with written
      instructions for bowel preparation and questionnaires for registering the data of the study.
      The day of the colonoscopy, questionnaires will be collected and endoscopists blinded for the
      study bowel preparation will perform the colonoscopy. Patients will be contacted for adverse
      events and a general satisfaction questionnaire, 3 days after colonoscopy.
