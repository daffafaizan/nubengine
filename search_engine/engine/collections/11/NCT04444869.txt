      positive oropharyngeal cancers, in a population whose cancer is thought to be highly
      radio-sensitive. This is a population whose outcomes are already known to be very good with
      high rates of local and distant control of the disease. With the long term disease control
      and survival of patients with this disease, long term treatment toxicity and resulting
      reduction in quality of life poses new problems. This has lead to several studies to examine
      the role of radiation dose de-escalation through various strategies in attempt to reduce long
      term toxicity from treatment and yet achieve equivalent long term disease control.

      This trial specifically hypothesizes that a lower dose of radiation therapy to the clinically
      and radiographically uninvolved lymph nodes will no detrimental effect on loco-regional
      control or overall survival and will improve the long-term side effect profile, particularly
      with regards to xerostomia and dysphagia. The goal of this study is therefore to determine
      whether a lower dose to the clinically and radiographically uninvolved lymph nodes can be
      done safely and with better long-term toxicity profile and better overall quality of life
      without compromising the expected outcomes of progression free survival.
