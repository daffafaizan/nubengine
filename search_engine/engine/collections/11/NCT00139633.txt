      paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour and carboplatin AUC 2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,
      22, 29 and 36. 5-FU 225mg/m2 was delivered as a continuous infusion on days 1-38. RT was
      given 1.8Gy 5 days/wk for 5.5 wks (50.4Gy in 28 fx). After 6-8 weeks, patients underwent
      repeat staging with computed tomography (CT) scan, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and biopsy.
      Patients with a positive biopsy, or less than PR by CT and EUS, received a boost of 9 Gy with
      the same concurrent chemotherapy. Patients were followed every 4 months with CT/EUS first
      year, every 6 months thereafter.
