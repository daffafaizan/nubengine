      suspected of having bladder cancerous using the UroVysionÂ® Bladder Cancer Kit (UroVysion Kit)
      which is FDA approved. This kit is designed to detect aneuploidy for chromosomes 3, 7, 17,
      and loss of the 9p21 locus. Results from the UroVysion Kit are intended for use, in
      conjunction with and not in lieu of current standard diagnostic procedures, as an aid for
      initial diagnosis of bladder carcinoma in patients with hematuria and subsequent monitoring
      for tumor recurrence in patients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer.
