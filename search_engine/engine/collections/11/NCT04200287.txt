    
      Objective 1: Establish feasibility and acceptability of conducting research with YA-F cancer
      survivors at the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
      (LPCH).

      Hypothesis 1: Study procedures will be feasible in the given timeframe and acceptable to
      patients, as evidence by recruitment, enrollment, and completion rates and participant
      feedback.

      Objective 2: Evaluate the impact of using the tool as a part of survivorship care on patient
      reported outcomes (PROs; i.e., information needs, fertility distress, decision-making
      uncertainty, and satisfaction with care).

      Hypothesis 2: In a single-arm pilot study (N=20), use of the decision aid tool will lead to
      improvements in fertility distress, decision-making uncertainty, and satisfaction with care.
