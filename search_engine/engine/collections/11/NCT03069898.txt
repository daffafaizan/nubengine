      typically been addressed in separate intervention and research silos. The TRUE Dads program
      proposes a unique integration of employment, fathering, and co-parenting services, with the
      overarching goal of strengthening fathers and the family unit by: 1) increasing fathers'
      economic stability and self-sufficiency, 2) enhancing the quantity and quality of father's
      engagement with their children, 3) improving the quality of the collaborative relationship
      between fathers and mothers or men and their co-parenting partners, 4) improving the
      relationship quality of fathers in their intimate partner relationships (with the co-parent
      or new partner), and 5) positively affecting children's behavior and development.

      Twelve hundred fathers will be recruited for the study. After an initial interview of the
      fathers and their co-parenting partners, who will complete Baseline survey, 720 of the 1,200
      fathers and co-parents will be assigned to the TRUE Dads intervention (Program track), and
      480 to a no-treatment control condition (Study track). Participants will be informed that the
      program consists of participation in a series of 12 three-hour meetings. Those 12 sessions
      include six meetings covering a core fatherhood curriculum, attended with the co-parent,
      combined with one of three intensives selected by the father: a) six sessions with an
      emphasis on employment, b) six sessions with an emphasis on building healthy romantic
      relationships with the co-parent, or c) six sessions with an emphasis on parenting with a
      participating co-parent. Participants in the Program track may be referred for additional
      employment, mental health, or other needed services. Both program and control participants
      (fathers and co-parents) will fill out a Follow-up survey one year from their entrances into
      the study.
