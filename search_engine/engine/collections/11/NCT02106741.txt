      to that of acupuncture. It involves the application of physical pressure on different
      acupuncture points (acupoints). One advantage of acupressure is the ability to
      self-administer the treatment. Acupressure is also a viable alternative to acupuncture in
      situations where patients: (1) cannot come to the clinic to receive an acupuncture treatment;
      (2) when a more frequent intervention is needed; or (3) where needle phobia or safety
      concerns are an issue.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity and feasibility of teaching
      acupressure interventions using an acupressure educator for the management of symptoms
      related to low back pain.

      Specific aims:

        1. To examine the effect of 6-weeks of relaxation acupressure (RA) compared to a regime of
           stimulating acupressure (SA) or wait-list control (WL) on fatigue and sleep quality as
           assessed by Brief Fatigue Inventory and wrist-worn accelerometry (sleep efficiency).

        2. To explore the effect of 6-weeks of RA compared to a regime of SA or WL on for chronic
           low back pain in terms of reduced pain and improved function.
