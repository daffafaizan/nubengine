      Myriad studies demonstrate that RSD may be carried out using hand or ulstrasonic instruments
      with equal efficacy. Locally, effective debridement results in reduced inflammation in the
      gingival tissues, ultimately preserving the dentition. Systemically, RSD results in an
      immediate inflammatory response with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and cytokines (e.g.
      interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor) detectable in the serum. This systemic inflammation
      may relate to systemic dissemination of bacteria from the periodontal pockets into the
      circulation, during instrumentation. Bacteria are detectable in serum immediately after
      instrumentation. The incidence of the bacteraemia varies considerably between different
      studies, ranging from 13% of patients to 43% to 55%. These studies used different methods of
      instrumentation; Kinane et al used full mouth ultrasonic scale, Zhang et al used a mixture of
      hand and ultrasonic instruments, and Heimdahl et al used curettes only. Whilst tempting to
      speculate that ultrasonic instrumentation induces less bacteraemia than hand instrumentation,
      there is no direct comparison of the effect of ultrasonic instrumentation with hand
      instrumentation on post treatment systemic inflammation.
