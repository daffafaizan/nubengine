    
      PROADAPT pilot study is a standardized geriatric intervention constructed on a
      multi-professional and multi-disciplinary basis after a systematic analysis of published
      data.

      This intervention was designed to be implemented pragmatically in the centers according local
      habits in several distinct hospital contexts in different tumor contexts.

      It consists in:

        1. before surgery: a prehabilitation of the patients including a nutritional, physical and
           educational preparation;

        2. during the hospitalization for surgery: an optimisation of their treatments through a
           pharmaceutical conciliation, educational interventions, standardization of surgical
           procedures and enhanced rehabilitation after surgery;

        3. bridging and post-discharge interventions for hospital-to-home transition.
