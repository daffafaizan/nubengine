      leukemia (AML). More than half of them are over 65 years old. In this older population, the
      median overall survival (OS) is only 2 to 8 months. With conventional induction chemotherapy
      or hypomethylating agents, the expected 2-year OS is less than 25% in patients with
      intermediate- or high-risk disease.

      Performing an allo-HSCT in older patients is however still controversial because of the
      higher risk of non-relapse mortality (15 to 35%) and graft-versus-host disease. Depending on
      the center policy, patients older than 65 years will either be contraindicated for transplant
      or will receive allo-HSCT. Noteworthy, no prospective randomized trial has yet compared
      allo-HSCT to a non-transplant strategy in older patients with AML. A previous attempt made 10
      years ago, by the EBMT to run a slightly similar trial, has failed in France and most
      European countries, mainly (i) because it mandated the type of transplant procedure to be
      applied and (ii) because of the absence of novel and effective drugs.

      New targeted therapies and treatment strategies are evolving rapidly. A standardized unique
      treatment administrated to all sub-types of AML is no longer the optimal approach for
      induction and non-transplant maintenance strategies. No treatment has reached consensus for
      older patients. For these reasons, this trial will not limit the choices of drugs
      administered to the patients but compare two strategies allowing patients to receive the best
      available standard of care.

      The trial aim to assess prospectively the outcomes and quality of life of older patients with
      AML receiving allo-HSCT strategy compared to those receiving a non-transplant approach.

      Patients will receive initial treatment with chemotherapy (or other appropriate
      non-palliative therapy). Once first complete remission is achieved and a donor is identified,
      patients will be included.

      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) after inclusion to receive one of the following
      strategy:

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation arm: patients will undergo allo-HSCT
           after consolidation therapy (or completion of other appropriate non-palliative strategy)
           according to standard procedures of the transplant center (choice of donor, conditioning
           regimen, GVHD and infection prophylaxis). The use of novel therapies (such as sorafenib,
           midaustorine, venetoclax, etc.) will be allowed as post-transplantation maintenance
           strategy

        -  Non-transplant arm: patients will be treated according to the standard procedures of the
           treating center for this type of population.

      All patients will receive the best available treatments (including additional conventional
      chemotherapy or other non-palliative therapies such as 5-azacytidine, decitabine, venetoclax,
      midaustorine, enasidenib, etc.). Supportive care will be performed according to each
      participating center usual practice.
