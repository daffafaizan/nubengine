      the purpose of elimination of wastes and may be temporary or permanent depending on the
      purpose of the initial surgery. The most common reasons for permanent bowel diversion are
      cancer and ulcerative colitis. Appliances have improved greatly over the last 50 years, but
      patients continue to experience appliance leakage and skin infections and struggle with the
      emotional and social impact of an external pouch. This study seeks to answer the opportunity
      to significantly improve quality of life to a large segment of the global population through
      optimization of a technology for a stoma occlusion device in patients with permanent stomas.
      Four pre-clinical animal studies have been conducted. All the animals that completed the
      study tolerated the device well and had no adverse reactions to device materials. This
      project will allow a prototype of an artificial stomal occlusion device to be tested in
      humans.
