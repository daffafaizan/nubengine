      and post-operative (surgical outcomes and early complications rate) characteristics, of a
      series of patients undergoing primary surgery (PDS or IDS) for AEOC at"Fondazione Policlinico
      Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS, UniversitÃ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Department of
      Gynecologic Oncology" between December 2011 and October 2019.

      The enrolled population included all patients with histological diagnosis of epithelial
      ovarian, fallopian or peritoneal cancer (FIGO stage IIB-IVB), judged suitable for surgery by
      clinicians, and who underwent recto-sigmoid resection and anastomosis with curative intent.

      Patients with no evidence of colorectal involvement, and who therefore did not undergo
      recto-sigmoid resection, or patients with end-colostomy or end-ileostomy were excluded from
      the study.

      Pre-operative clinical variables, surgical features and post-operative outcomes were
      retrospectively retrieved.

      Several system scores, helpful in predicting operative risk, were used to classify patients'
      physiological status, as the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, the Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status (ECOG-PS) and the Age-Adjusted Charlson
      Comorbidity Index (ACCI).

      Patients with an ASA score > 2, ECOG-PS >/= 2 and an ACCI > 2 were considered at high risk of
      post-operative complications.

      Pre-operative albumin level below 30 mg/dl and pre-operative hemoglobin values below 10.0
      g/dl were indicative respectively of a severely poor nutritional status and moderate-severe
      anemia.

      Other demographic and surgical variables were recorded: age (< 60 vs >/= 60 year-old), body
      mass index (BMI) (divided into the following categories: underweight patients: BMI <18,
      normal weight-overweight: BMI 18-30 and obese patients with BMI >/= 30), International
      Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (FIGO stage 2014: </= IIIA vs IIIC-IVB),
      smoking habit, Ca-125 tumor marker level at initial diagnosis (< 1000 U/mL vs >/= 1000 U/mL),
      surgical timing (PDS vs IDS), Predictive Index Value (PIV) at initial diagnosis (</= 6 vs >
      6), presence of ascites (< 500 mL vs >/= 500 mL), Surgical Complexity Score (SCS) (SCS 1-2 vs
      SCS 3), estimated blood loss (EBL) (EBL < 500 vs >/= 500 mL) , intra-operative transfusions,
      additional surgical procedures performed and colorectal resection and anastomosis specific
      characteristics. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) was used to
      classify intra-operative complications (CTCAE 0-1 vs CTCAE >/= 2).

      The suspicion of anastomotic leakage (AL), suggested by general clinical signs as abdominal
      pain or distension, leukocytosis, fever, as well as more specific signs such as emission of
      gas, pus, or feces via the drains, the laparotomy incision, or the vagina, was ascertained by
      computed tomography (CT) with rectal contrast enema or simple contrast enema radiography with
      a water-soluble contrast agent.

      The ultimate diagnostic procedure was re-laparotomy with direct verification of AL and/or
      fecal peritonitis.

      Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of primary diagnosis to the date of death
      or to last follow-up visit for the patients still alive.

      The primary end-point of the study was to assess the anastomosis leakage rate in patients
      subjected to colorectal resection and anastomosis during primary surgery (PDS or IDS) for
      advanced ovarian cancer, in a third referral centre for gynecologic oncology with ESGO
      certification.

      The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the influence of several possible pre/intra and
      post-operative risk factors on AL in order to identify, at an early stage, the population at
      greatest risk.
