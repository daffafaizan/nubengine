      tissue such as the airway epithelium and sub-mucosal tissue layers. The energy is delivered
      via a proprietary catheter through the bronchoscope.

      Two sessions of treatment will be delivered one month apart. The right lung is treated at the
      first treatment session and the left lung is treated at the second treatment session
      (approximately one month after the right side is treated). Treatment will be delivered by a
      respiratory physician (interventional pulmonologist) in a tertiary teaching hospital during a
      bronchoscopic procedure. The bronchoscopy will be delivered during general anesthesia. It is
      anticipated that the bronchoscopic procedure will last less than 60 minutes in total.
      Treatment will be deemed to have been delivered following the successful treatment during the
      two bronchoscopies.

      Subjects will be required to submit tests during the study including three CT scans (lung),
      respiratory function tests, exercise testing.
