cesium-131 uptake and distribution in the human heart.. an analysis ofcardiac scans in 104 patients .when properly used, cesium-131 is a satisfactory agent for the studyof cardiac morphology by photoscanning, which we believe is a usefuladjunctive diagnostic procedure in patients for whom the results ofother methods of evaluation are at variance with the clinical symptomsof cardiac disease . the studies reported here suggest that perhapsinfarction of a subclinical type, size, or location may occur earlierthan has been previously thought and that the damage it leaves may notbe detectable by any means other than autopsy or a technique such asscanning . we have not yet been able to measure the actual concentrationof cesium-131 in the heart at autopsy so that the cold and cool areascould be examined by histologic sections .
