    
      Participants older than 44, with at least one chronic disease, (n=60) will participate in a
      before-and-after study integrating a population based, rehabilitation-focused program
      targeting physical function into a Family Health Team. The program, delivered by a
      Physiotherapist and Occupational Therapist, will consist of comprehensive functional
      assessments and individualized self-management care plans; a rehabilitation based chronic
      disease self-management program; and on-line self-monitoring of physical function. Process
      and outcome measures will be administered at baseline and 4 months follow-up.
