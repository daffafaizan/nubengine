    
      This multi-centered, cooperative and epidemiological observation study is so designed to
      investigate the ownership ratio of gBRCAm in the newly diagnosed patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer because such a ratio has
      not yet been adequately clarified in Japan.

      The newly diagnosed eligible patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal
      cancer or fallopian tube cancer shall be asked to participate in this study in order of
      diagnosis. After obtaining their consents by the written informed consent following
      appropriate explanation, investigations about the demographic information including the
      cancer family history shall be performed. Subsequently, blood is collected for investigation
      about gBRCAm. In addition, histological classification shall be conducted based on the
      resected tumor tissues.
