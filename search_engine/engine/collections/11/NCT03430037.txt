      of frailty markers. Several studies involve use of Fisetin for its anti-oxidative and
      anti-apoptotic effects in animal models. Fisetin may reduce oxidative stress, alleviate
      hyperglycemia, and improve kidney function. No one has evaluated the biologic markers of
      inflammation and frailty in older postmenopausal women. The researchers plan to evaluate
      markers of frailty and markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and bone resorption while
      maintaining bone formation in older postmenopausal women.
