    
      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the effect of two conventional dry eye therapies,
      artificial tears to hydrate and cyclosporine A as an anti-inflammatory, on the irritation
      symptoms and ocular surface disease of dry eye patients who will be exposed to a low humidity
      environment for 90 minutes. Patients with dry eye will be enrolled in this study and complete
      a validated symptom questionnaire and then undergo a complete ocular surface and tear
      examination to characterize their disease. Enrolled subjects will be exposed to a low
      humidity environment at the initial evaluation prior to any treatment and will be exposed to
      a low humidity environment for a second time. They will be randomized to receive either
      artificial tears or 0.05% cyclosporine A emulsion drop four times a day for 6 weeks.
