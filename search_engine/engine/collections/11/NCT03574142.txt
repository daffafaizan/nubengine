      subjects. Approximately 14 subjects will receive a single oral dose of Epanova 4 g followed
      by a 72-hour washout period, and then receive Epanova 4 g orally once daily for 14
      consecutive days. Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within
      4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of investigational product (IP). Subjects will be
      admitted to the clinical pharmacology unit approximately 48 hours prior to the first dosing
      (Day -2) and will stay at the unit until at least 72 hours (Day 20) after their last dose of
      IP (Day 17). Blood samples will be collected for PK analyses. Subjects will be monitored
      closely for adverse events throughout the study.
