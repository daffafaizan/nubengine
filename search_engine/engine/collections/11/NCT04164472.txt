    
      This study takes a proven effective program (Friend to Friend) that was initially run by the
      research team in a clinical trial and examines for the first time its effectiveness when
      conducted by teachers and counselors with active coaching from the research team. The primary
      target population for this study will be 4th-5th grade relationally aggressive girls. In
      intervention schools, these girls will participate in Friend to Friend with Coaching (16
      small group sessions, 8 classroom sessions and additional pre- and post- program
      questionnaires).

      In both intervention and control schools all 4th-5th grade students (boys and girls) will
      participate in a screening measure to identify the relational aggressors and pre- and
      post-program questionnaires. Counselors and 4th-5th grade teachers in both conditions will
      participate in pre/post questionnaires and will also participate in training, coaching, the
      small group intervention and classroom sessions in intervention schools.

      These procedures will be repeated with new students in 10 of the F2F with Coaching schools
      the following school year, except that the research team will provide minimal coaching to
      staff running the intervention in year 2.
