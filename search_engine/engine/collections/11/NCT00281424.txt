      promotional efforts focused on pedometers, people seem to think that owning a pedometer will
      influence activity levels.

      However, an examination of a few social cognitive theories produces no theoretical rationale
      that would support any sustained positive influence of pedometers in the absence of some
      other conditional factor, such as a behavioural goal or a social support system. We believe
      that once people determine how many steps their usual routes and daily activity typically
      amounts to, that the pedometer will no longer be used. We based our contentions on two
      theories: self efficacy theory (Bandura, 1986;1997) and self-determination theory (Deci &
      Ryan, 2000).
