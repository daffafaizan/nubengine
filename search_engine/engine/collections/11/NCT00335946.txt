      common mental disorders in society. The NIH estimates that nearly 200 million Americans
      suffer from anxiety. Anxiety disorders are associated with a lower quality of life,
      functional impairment and disability, and are also associated with co-morbid physical
      illness.

      Acupuncture, one form of complementary and alternative medicine, has been used to treat
      anxiety. Non-needle acupuncture is one of the safest methods, with none to rare side effects.
      This method has been studied in China (Han 1986) and America (Ulett 1998) Pre-intervention
      testing, then three treatments within one week, will be followed by post intervention
      testing.
