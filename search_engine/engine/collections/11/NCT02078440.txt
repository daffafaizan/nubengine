    
      The study is a multi-center, single dose, open-label, 1-period design. Thirty (30) patients
      will be enrolled in the study and at least twenty-four (24) patients are expected to complete
      the study.

      Male and female patients with confirmed Type 2 Diabetes, non-or ex-smokers, aged 10 to less
      than 18 years will be selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Patients will be admitted to the clinical site at least 10 hours prior to drug administration
      which will occur within 2 hours of waking on the morning of Day 2.

      Ondansetron hydrochloride will be administered orally, approximately 6 hours before the
      dosing time of Cycloset (bromocriptine mesylate). Subjects weighing 50 to 60 kg will receive
      6mg ondansetron hydrochloride (liquid 7.5 ml) and subjects weighing â‰¥60 kg will receive
      ondansetron hydrochloride 8 mg (liquid 10 ml).

      A single, weight-adjusted dose of CYCLOSET (bromocriptine mesylate), of approximately 0.048
      mg/kg, will be administered orally with 240 mL of water in the morning, after a 10-hour
      overnight fast, and thirty minutes after the start of a standardized breakfast that meets
      American Diabetes Association diet recommendations.

      On day 2, after a supervised overnight fast, the patients will be awakened, vital signs
      (blood pressure, pulse rate and body temperature) will be measured and the first blood sample
      (T= 0) will be collected.

      Seventeen (17) blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic sampling at 0.25, 0.50,
      0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 and 36 hours post drug administration.

      Finger sticks for blood glucose levels will be obtained every hour for the first 4 hours
      following administration of bromocriptine mesylate, and then additionally as deemed necessary
      by the study physician.

      Safety will be evaluated through the assessment of adverse events and laboratory tests and
      vital signs.
