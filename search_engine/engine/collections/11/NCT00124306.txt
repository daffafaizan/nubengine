      Approximately 270 participants will be randomly assigned to take up to 75 milligrams of
      amitriptyline or a placebo each day for 14 to 26 weeks. All participants will be given
      techniques to practice suppressing the urge to urinate for increasingly longer stretches
      until they can wait 3 or 4 hours before going to the bathroom. Participants will also
      regulate when and how much they drink and avoid bladder irritants such as alcohol, acidic
      foods and carbonated or caffeinated drinks. Staff and patients will find out who received the
      amitriptyline when the study is finished. Medications and tests are free to participants.

      Ten medical centers in the United States and Canada are recruiting adults newly diagnosed
      with either painful bladder syndrome (PBS) or interstitial cystitis (IC).The centers make up
      the Interstitial Cystitis Clinical Research Network, sponsored by the National Institute of
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at NIH.
