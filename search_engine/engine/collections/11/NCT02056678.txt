      receiving intraoperative IV acetaminophen and those not receiving the drug. The patients will
      be blinded to the administration of acetaminophen. For the group randomized to receive the
      study drug, anesthesia providers will be instructed to administer 1000mg of IV acetaminophen
      intraoperatively immediately after induction. They may utilize narcotics and other pain
      medication perioperatively at their discretion according to their perceived patients' needs.
      Post-operatively in the recovery unit, all patients will be monitored according to current
      standards with appropriate oxygen supplementation as needed, and they may receive narcotics
      or other adjuncts as ordered by the anesthesia provider. Recovery nurses will record vital
      signs, Aldrete score, pain score, and drugs administered per standard protocol. The recovery
      nurses will be blinded to the study group, and no patients regardless of control vs. study
      group will be allowed to receive acetaminophen in the PACU or for six hours from surgery end
      time due to FDA approved dosing of IV acetaminophen no more frequently than every six hours.
      The patients' recovery data will then be de-identified and reviewed, and each of the groups'
      recovery time, narcotic use, pain score, and any complications will be examined and compared.
