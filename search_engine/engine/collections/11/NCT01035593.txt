      to enroll 30 adult renal transplant recipients with biopsy-confirmed AMR within 30 days post
      transplantation. After informed consent is obtained and study eligibility is confirmed,
      subjects will be enrolled immediately after biopsy confirmation of AMR and positive donor
      specific antibody (DSA). Subjects will then be randomized into one of two treatment groups
      (SOC [control] or rhC1INH). An initial cohort of 8 subjects (3 SOC, 5 rhC1INH) will receive
      intensive safety monitoring of the coagulation system and for thromboembolic events.
