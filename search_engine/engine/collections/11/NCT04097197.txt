      Pulmonary Disease, Asthma) are at increased risk of developing complications from infection
      with influenza virus, that could ultimately result in death.

      Flu vaccination is recommended by many authorities, including the World Health Organization,
      as a means to decrease the risk of developing such life-threatening conditions. However,
      vaccination rates are well below the recommended threshold.
