      children presenting to an Emergency Department setting with acute respiratory symptoms. The
      patient cohort will be children 1 month to 18 years of age presenting to the Children's
      Hospital Colorado (CHCO) Emergency Department with influenza like illness who are triaged as
      level 3, 4, or 5 by the Emergency Severity Index, representing the typical patient population
      who are evaluated in an urgent care setting. All eligible participants will undergo a
      nasopharyngeal swab and point of care testing, and participants will be allocated 1:1 by
      computer-generated randomization to either the intervention group - test result available to
      providers, or the control group- test result not available (routine clinical care). The
      investigators will compare the clinical outcomes between the two groups.
