      paralysis (partial or complete) and provide rehabilitative standing and walking intervention.
      The study will be conducted with a trained clinician that will fit each patient into the
      adjustable exoskeleton system and provide customized programming to meet each user's specific
      needs. The training program will be initiated based upon each patient's comfort in the
      exoskeleton and ability to stand with assistance. Each patient will be closely monitored to
      assess ongoing health as well as their individual standing and walking ability. All
      exoskeleton sessions will be performed with a trained medical professional controlling the
      exoskeleton. Patient safety is the primary concern and all adverse events will be documented
      and addressed. This study will evaluate the ExoAtlet 2.0 exoskeleton for safety and
      effectiveness of providing persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI) who are non-ambulatory or
      have limited ambulatory function, the ability to stand up and walk in a clinical facility.
