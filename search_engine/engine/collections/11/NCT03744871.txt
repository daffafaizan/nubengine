      personal-level intervention (N95 respirators) to improve validated surrogate markers of
      cardio-metabolic health in patients with a recent Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Patients
      with ACS are a vulnerable patient population with vulnerability and at risk for future
      cardiovascular events. This vanguard phase study in Beijing involving patients exposed to
      high levels of air pollution who have recently sustained an ACS event, is necessary to obtain
      feasibility data and gather a battery of information allowing for the appropriate design of a
      larger clinical outcome trial. What is more, positive results would provide
      critically-important information demonstrating for the first time that it is feasible to
      "prescribe" the use of these personal protection devices to cardiac patients, and that their
      usage is capable of translating into demonstrable health benefits (i.e., improved BP and
      insulin sensitivity) over the long-term.

      The study hypothesis is that long-term personal-level interventions to reduce exposure to
      PM2.5 can be feasibly performed for 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and will result
      in significant improvements in validated surrogate cardiometabolic endpoints predictive of
      morbidity/mortality.
