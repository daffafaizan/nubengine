      centers by using a mathematical (Small World) approach to the analysis of EEG-related neural
      networks. The aim is to provide reliable discrimination of amnesic-Mild Cognitive Impairment
      (a MCI) subjects who, on individual basis, will rapidly convert to Alzheimer Disease (AD)
      after a relatively brief follow-up. Moreover, keeping in mind that the epsilon-4 allele of
      the ApoE gene is a genetically determined risk factor for pathogenesis of late-onset AD, a
      secondary endpoint is introduced to investigate whether the EEG connectivity markers together
      with a genetically determined risk of dementia as represented by ApoE testing can reach
      higher sensitivity/specificity for early discrimination of MCI converting to AD
