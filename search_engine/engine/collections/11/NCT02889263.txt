      The hospital administrative data for this study are from the SNIIRAM (Syste'me National
      d'Informations Inter Regimes de l'Assurance Maladie) which also includes the national
      hospital reporting system (PMSI - Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information. The
      SNIIRAM is a centralized administrative database of all health services reimbursed under
      France's NHI program. The PMSI, based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), is a centralized
      administrative database of hospital discharge records by diagnosis, procedure, age and
      residence of patients from all hospitals in France. It is managed by a national agency
      (ATIH).

      To calculate the proportion of rehospitalized patients (65Ã¾) who received outpatient visits
      (all physician consultations in community-based practice, as well as hospital outpatient
      visits) between the time of discharge and rehospitalization, we collaborated with analysts at
      the French NHI fund (CNAMTS). We linked the individual identifying variable for
      rehospitalized patients and extracted the outpatient visits from the SNIIRAM database for all
      medical and surgical admissions. Of the total number of hospitalized French patients aged 18
      years and over (5,804,677) with identifiers in 2010, only 299,364 (5%) were unidentified
      after linking these datasets. These patients are most likely to have been foreigners and
      newborns who had not yet received an identifier. Outpatient visits include all physician
      consultations in community-based practice, as well as hospital outpatient visits.
