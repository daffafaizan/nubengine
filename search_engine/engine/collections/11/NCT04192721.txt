      counseling focused on the depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, automatic thoughts, and coping
      ways among undergraduate nursing students with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.

      The study was completed with a total of 63 participants (n=31 for the intervention group and
      n=32 for the control group) in the 2017-2018 academic year. The effect of the intervention
      was evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Automatic Thoughts
      Questionnaire, and Ways of Coping Questionnaire. The measurements were taken 3 times:
      pre-test, post-test, and 2-months post-test.
