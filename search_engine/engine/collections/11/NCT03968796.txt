      women, 15 men, mean age 47,5 Â±7,94 years) with lateral epicondylitis were enrolled. Patients
      were allocated into 4 treatment groups: Group 1 received TENS and Kinesio Taping, group 2
      received TENS+sham Kinesio Taping, group 3 received sham TENS+ Kinesio Taping and group 4
      received sham TENS+sham Kinesio Taping. TENS was applied for 10 sessions and Kinesio Taping
      for 4 times in 10 days. All patients were given a progressive exercise program and were
      informed about the disease. All patients were told to take paracetamol 500 mg if their pain
      is severe and to note the number of the paracetamol taken.

      Outcome measures were pain-free grip strength, pressure pain threshold and pain severity at
      rest, night and forced wrist extension test. Patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation (PRTEE)
      was used to determine functional status. Patients were assessed for outcome measures at
      screening, after treatment (day 10) and 12th week after the treatment.
