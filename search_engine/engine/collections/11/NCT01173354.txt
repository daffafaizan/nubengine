      amino acid mixture (dose of 7.0 g EAA + 15 g carbohydrates) will stimulate protein anabolism
      to a greater extent than a standard balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential)
      amino acids (dose of 6.7 g total AA + 15 g carbohydrates) in COPD patients. The principal
      endpoints will be the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate and the reduction in
      endogenous protein breakdown. The current project will provide information that will enable
      us to better understand the underlying metabolic mechanisms that regulate protein metabolism
      in patients with COPD.
