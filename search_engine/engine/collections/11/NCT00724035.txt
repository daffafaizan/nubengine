      vascular puncture during infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. The role of this technique
      has thus been expanded to overlap those procedures for which an axillary nerve block would be
      commonly considered as first choice.

      A reference block for upper limb surgery thanks to its safety profile and clinical efficacy,
      the axillary approach may be more painful or unpleasant for some patients.

      The investigators aim to determine possible differences in onset time and patient acceptance
      between the two techniques.
