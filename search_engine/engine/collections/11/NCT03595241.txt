      refractory visceral pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Abdominal pain is a main symptom
      in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Patients have a background constant pain with acute
      episodes needing admissions. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a recognised treatment for
      neuropathic pain. This involves placing an electric wire in the spine and the use of
      electricity to manage the pain. This is a pacemaker for controlling pain. Burst DR
      stimulation delivers a wave form which mimics the way nerves conduct electrical signals,
      there are short bursts or spikes of stimulation followed by short periods of rest. The key
      aims and objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of Burst DR SCS as a treatment
      for persistent pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis
