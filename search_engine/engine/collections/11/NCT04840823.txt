      daily) for 30 days. On day 1, 7, 14, 21, and 30 of treatment and at a follow-up visit 14 days
      after the last dose, participants will be assessed for safety measures and blood will be
      collected to assist with the determination of enoxacin pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD). On day 1 and day 30 of dosing, participants will only take one dose of
      study medication (the morning dose) to assist with determination of enoxacin single dose PK
      over a 24-hour period. A lumbar puncture (LP) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for PD
      assessments will occur on day 1 and day 30.
