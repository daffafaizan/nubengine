      it would be relevant to investigate whether this therapeutic strategy could be considered as
      a more effective approach in the rehabilitation with dental implants of individuals with type
      2 DM, since these patients may be more disposed to peri-implant changes, both from the point
      of view of marginal bone remodeling as related to local variations in immunoinflammatory
      response. Thus, the propose of this split-mouth randomized controlled trial was to compare
      the impact of crestal level or supracrestally implant platform in T2DM rehabilitated with
      implant-retained overdentures on the clinical, tomographic and immunoinflammatory
      peri-implant outcomes after implant loading.
