      standard of care (SOC) induction therapy in a subgroup of CD patients with a
      relapse-associated microbiome profile.

      Prior to starting SOC induction therapy at week 0, subjects will provide a baseline stool
      sample that will be screened for microbiome profiles associated with risk of relapse
      according to an established statistical model.

      At week 4, subjects with a relapse-associated microbiome will be randomized into either a
      control arm that will continue to receive SOC induction therapy for an additional 8 weeks, or
      a treatment arm that will receive adjunctive antibiotic therapy in addition to continuing to
      receive SOC induction therapy for an additional 8 weeks. Subjects who do not have a
      relapse-associated microbiome will enter a separate control arm that will continue to receive
      SOC induction therapy and will have data collected for exploratory objectives. Subjects who
      are not in clinical remission by week 4 will receive antibiotic therapy regardless of
      microbiome signature at baseline. Subjects will be monitored for an additional 40 weeks after
      the treatment period (52 weeks total).
