      Jordanian men and women.

      This study was designed to investigate whether omega 3 supplementation has a potential effect
      on the reducing of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

      This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (RCT) was designed to evaluate 300 mg
      omega-3FA daily for 2 months on serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. This RCT will be
      conducted on 80 to 90 Jordanian men and women aged 22 to 66 years. Baseline and follow-up
      levels for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphate, liver
      and kidney functions will be assayed.
