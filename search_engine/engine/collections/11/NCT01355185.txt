      cancer with excellent cure rates and a favorable toxicity profile. Having a more detailed
      understanding of seed movement after an implant will provide clinicians with details about
      the clinical impact of these phenomena on implants and provide the detailed understanding of
      these phenomena that are necessary for more sophisticated brachytherapy implants that are
      envisioned in the future.
