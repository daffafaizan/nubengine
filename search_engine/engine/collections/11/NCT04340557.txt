      compare the impact of adding an ARB to the Standard of Care (SOC) to the SOC without an ARB.
      Randomization ratio will be 1:1. The goal of this study is to identify whether or not ARBs
      have an impact on inhibiting the progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical
      ventilation in patients with mild to moderate hypoxia in the setting of COVID-19. The
      addition of an ARB to the standard of care treatment for these patients may be beneficial in
      abating acute lung injury in patients in early stages of SARSCoV-2 induced hypoxia.
