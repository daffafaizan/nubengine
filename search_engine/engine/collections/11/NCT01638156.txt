      protocol-required technology. The Pennsylvania Department of Health funding for this trial is
      limited to sites in Pennsylvania. Participants will undergo pre- and post-operative cardiac
      MRI, blood draws, a 6-minute walk test, arterial tonometry, medical history assessment, and
      quality-of-life questionnaires to characterize the pathophysiologic factors causing
      variability in regression after AVR. Researchers will evaluate the role of specific
      hemodynamic abnormalities as determinants of post-AVR LV remodeling (LV hypertrophy and LV
      myocardial fibrosis) as seen on contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI. The trial also will evaluate a
      non-contrast-enhanced MRI approach (T1rho) potentially effective in assessing LV myocardial
      fibrosis.
