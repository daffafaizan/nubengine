      Bucharest and will compare the analgesic effects of ketorolac tromethamine against morphine
      in renal colic.

      The patients will be randomised to receive either ketorolac 30 mg intravenous (diluted in 20
      ml of 0,9% saline) or morphine 0,1 mg/kg weight intravenous. A scale of 1-10 will be used for
      measuring the pain, and the effects of the treatment will be evaluated at 15 minutes and 30
      minutes from the administration of the drugs. After 30 minutes if there is no significant
      reduction of the pain a rescue therapy will be used : chlorhydrate drotaverine 40 mg,
      xilocaine 100 mg, both diluted in 100 ml saline and the other medication not used from the
      study (morphine or ketorolac tromethamine).
