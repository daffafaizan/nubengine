    
      The Double-Trunk Mask (DTM) is a device designed to increase the fraction of inspired oxygen
      in patients who receive oxygen therapy. The mask is composed of a regular aerosol mask with
      corrugated tubing (15 cm length) inserted into two lateral holes.

      Each included patient will wear standard nasal cannula in addition to the Double-Trunk Mask
      for 30 minutes, then only their standard oxygen interface for the next 30 minutes. While
      maintaining the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) at a target value of 94%, the
      impact of the DTM will be assessed by measuring the change of oxygen flow given to the
      patient.
