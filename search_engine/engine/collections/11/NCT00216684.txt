      reservoir-type Durotep® Patch, fentanyl transdermal matrix patch is not liable to leakage of
      drug solution and does not contain alcohol, which becomes a cause of skin irritation. Also
      this new formulation has become available in a smaller dose of 12.5mg/hr while the smallest
      Durotep® Patch is 25mg/hr. While Durotep® Patch is currently indicated only for cancer pain
      in Japan, this clinical trial was planned to assess effectiveness, and safety of fentanyl
      transdermal matrix patch in Japanese patients with chronic intractable pain receiving
      codeine, morphine hydrochloride, or fentanyl injectable formulations. After pre-treatment
      period for seven to fourteen days for evaluating the eligibility of the patients for the
      study, patients will be treated for 4 weeks as Treatment period 1 and 48 weeks as Treatment
      period 2 followed by 3-day post-treatment observation period. One patch can be used for 72
      hours, which is the same as the existing Patch. Starting from the first day of treatment,
      fentanyl will be applied to the chest, the upper arm or other appropriate site, which will be
      replaced with a new patch every three days (ca. 72 hr). Starting dose should be between 12.5
      mcg/hr and 75 mcg/hr, depending on the prior opioid dose.
