      cardiomyopathy. These ECG markers will be evaluated from a clinical Holter recording. All
      patients will have a primary implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as part of their
      clinical care. Patients will be followed prospectively for 2 years to evaluate the primary
      outcome of appropriate ICD shocks. Multivariable modelling will be performed to determine
      whether the ECG markers of electrical instability independently predict the primary clinical
      outcome.
