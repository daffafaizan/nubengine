      Plan of the study : More than 150 patients referred for ARCA suspicion have been analyzed by
      NGS (Montpellier platform) since September 2013. The clinical data of these patients will be
      entered at the computer level into the algorithm to obtain the prediction of the gene
      involved (under the form of a probability for each of the genes known to ARCA). The
      investigators will compare this result with that obtained by standard NGS analysis. For
      patients without molecular diagnosis defined after standard NGS analysis, the investigators
      will take the 5 most probable genes selected on the basis of the algorithm in order to carry
      out an in-depth analysis of the variants found and a bioinformatic analysis by semi-automatic
      detection of CNVs. Main Evaluation Criterion: Concordance of the algorithm with standard NGS
      analysis for the genetic diagnosis of ARCA. Secondary evaluation criterion:% of patients for
      whom the prediction based on the algorithm suggested the correct diagnosis (subsequently
      confirmed after revision in the detail of the genetic data) while the standard genetic
      analysis was not not informative. Statistical Analysis: The investigators will perform a
      concordance analysis (Cohen's k) to validate the algorithm in clinical practice. For a given
      patient, there will be concordance if: i) one of the first 5 genes predicted with the highest
      probability by the algorithm is compatible with the mutation found after standard NGS or ii)
      if no gene is predicted by the algorithm (score <20) and no mutation found by NGS analysis.
