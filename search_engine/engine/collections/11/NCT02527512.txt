      wounds prior to closure. While this bacterial contamination may or may not lead to infection,
      recent adult studies demonstrated reduced infection rates by using povidone-iodine irrigation
      before closure. This study will determine the safety of using povidone-iodine irrigation in
      pediatric spinal patients and how effective it is at reducing bacterial contamination of the
      spinal surgical wound prior to closure, compared with normal saline. The investigators
      hypothesize povidone-iodine is both safe and effective. Understanding techniques that reduce
      the local bacterial load in the wound prior to closure after spinal fusion will give data to
      support measures that will ultimately reduce the rate of postoperative infections.
