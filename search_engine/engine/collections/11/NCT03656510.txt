    
      JNJ-53718678 is an investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) specific fusion
      inhibitor and is under development for the treatment of RSV infection, which results in an
      upper and/or lower respiratory tract illness. The primary hypothesis of this study is that
      JNJ-53718678 has antiviral activity against RSV (that is, results in a decrease in RSV nasal
      viral load from immediately prior to first dose of study drug until Day 5). This will be
      assessed by a positive dose-response relationship of JNJ-53718678 compared to placebo.
      Besides the RSV nasal viral load through day 5, other timepoints will also be evaluated as
      well as other nasal viral load related parameters. In addition, the evolution of signs and
      symptoms of RSV disease will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study by evaluating the occurrence and severity of adverse events and by laboratory and
      electrocardiogram measurements. Study participants will be identified when they are
      hospitalized or expected to be hospitalized within 24 hours after presentation to the
      hospital (Cohort 1) or present for medical care as outpatients (Cohort 2) with symptoms of an
      acute respiratory illness supporting a diagnosis of RSV infection. Eligible participants will
      be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either a low or a high dose of JNJ 53718678 or placebo and
      will be receiving study treatment for 7 days. They will be followed up for 3 weeks after the
      last dose. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 29 days.
