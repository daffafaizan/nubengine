      intensity endurance exercise training (HIIT) and progressive resistance exercise prior
      allo-HCT. This multicenter pilot study will include n=30 patients. Patients perform two
      supervised exercise sessions per week. Recruitment take place 6-12 weeks prior allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation. Further aims of this pilot study are: to estimate the number of
      eligible patients, evaluate the recruitment procedure, and to explore the effect of HIIT
      prior allo-HCT on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak),submaximal endurance capacity, muscle
      strength, patient-reported-outcomes including QoL and physical functioning.
