    
      The study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, multicenter, phase
      III trial comparing two acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis regimens:
      CD24Fc/tacrolimus / methotrexate (CD24Fc/Tac/MTX) versus placebo/tacrolimus / methotrexate
      (placebo/Tac/MTX) in the setting of myeloablative conditioning (MAC), matched unrelated donor
      (MUD) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with acute leukemia
      (AML/ALL) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The study agent, CD24Fc, will be administered
      through IV infusion on days -1, 14, and 28 at the dose of 480mg, 240 mg and 240mg,
      respectively. The placebo will be 100 ml normal saline IV solution.
