      respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, are a frequent cause of morbidity in
      children and is the leading cause of mortality in developing countries.

      In the last 20 years, despite several research, only a small decrease in morbidity and
      mortality has been achieved.

      Corticosteroids have an immune-modulation effect, not completely elucidated. Most likely,
      this effect is due to down regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

      We postulate that adding corticosteroids to antibiotic treatment of CAP might change the
      immune response and thereby reduce morbidity, leading to a decrease in patients hospital
      length of stay.
