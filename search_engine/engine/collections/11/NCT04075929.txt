      volume in order to perform at a high level in endurance sports. It is also well documented
      that both low intensity training (LIT), moderate intensity training (MIT) and high intensity
      training (HIT) should be included in the overall training efforts. It is well documented that
      HIT has a positive effect on the aerobic endurance among both elite athletes and recreational
      athletes.

      Despite the fact that there is general agreement that HIT is an important part of the overall
      training, it is unclear how this part of the training should be organized in order to
      optimize the training effects. The adaptions of endurance performance seem to depend on both
      the intensity and the accumulated duration of the HIT sessions. Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to compare the effects of SI and LI training, including equal accumulated HIT
      duration, during a 4-week intervention period, conducted as 4x8-min with 2-min recovery
      periods, 4x(12x40/20-sec) with 2-min recovery periods and 4x(8x40/20-sec) with 2-min recovery
      periods, in different physiological- and performance parameters among well-trained cyclists.
