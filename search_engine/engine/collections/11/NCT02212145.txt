      study, which is of great importance to the value of this cohort study.

      Of the three study populations two (2-3)will be created by using national registries.

        1. The screened group consists of the individuals (n = 5938) who had direct contact with
           the prevention program, ie undergone a voluntary opportunistic cardiovascular screening
           (questionnaire, physical examination and testing in connection with visits to health
           centers) and the rest of all individuals who lived in Sollentuna Municipality between
           1988-1993.

        2. Relatives of individuals included in the screened group who lived in Stockholm county at
           the time of the intervention will be identified by the use of the Medical Birth Register
           and the Multi-Generation Register. Family members are defined as parents, siblings and
           children and husband / wife to those in thescreened group and will be analyzed in the
           same way as those who participated in the intervention for risk of developing
           cardiovascular disease and cancer.

        3. The comparison group consists of the entire population of Stockholm County minus
           Sollentuna 1988-93, taking into account population changes (migration, birth, death)
           during the period.

      This three populations will be followed-up in national registries and databases

      All subjects will be monitored for example disease history, socio-economics and biochemical
      risk factors presented below national registries and research databases. When all the matches
      of national registers and a local register (AMORIS)have been done the database will
      de-identified and anonymized data to be available for statistical processing.
