      require surgical treatment due to the healing potential in children. The management of
      proximal humerus fractures in children subsequently underwent a major change with the
      introduction of surgical metal rod nailing. Despite that, the best criteria for choosing
      between these two treatment options are still not agreed upon. To date, the clinical benefits
      and harms of surgical intervention in proximal humerus fractures in children remain
      debatable. The investigators hypothesised that the outcomes of the non-operative management
      for proximal humerus fractures to remain excellent due to the healing ability of children. If
      good clinical results are achieved in our patient cohort, the investigators would like to
      send out the message that non-operative treatment for proximal humerus fractures in children
      should be recommended, even for those severely displaced fractures.

      With Caldicott approval, the investigators can review the X-rays performed in children and
      adolescents, aged from 10 to 18-year-old in NHS Tayside, from 2008 to 2015. By using the
      Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), the investigators will be able to identify
      the cohort of patients who had proximal humerus fractures from the X-rays. The Caldicott
      approval also allowed the investigators to obtain clinical communication from Clinical
      Portal. The identified potential participants will be approached by the paediatric
      orthopaedic team. An invitation letter, a participant information sheet and questionnaire,
      based on UEFI will be sent to all potential participants by the care team via post. If no
      response within 2 weeks, the investigators will send out 1 further reminder. If no further
      response, the patient will be excluded from the study.
