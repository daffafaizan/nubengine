    
      The overall goal of Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS II) study is to refine
      thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke who can be treated within three
      hours of stroke onset.

      This multi-center, non-randomized pilot study will provide preliminary data about the
      benefits and risks of combined intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) recombinant tissue
      plasminogen activator (rtPA) and low-intensity ultrasound energy in ischemic stroke patients
      with baseline NIHSSS >/= 10 in whom intravenous treatment can be started within three hours
      of stroke onset. rt-PA is a thrombolytic, clot-dissolving drug.

      The primary objectives for the study are to obtain reliable estimates of the effectiveness
      and safety of a treatment approach combining IV/IA rt-PA and ultrasound for stroke patients;
      and to determine if the estimated effectiveness of combined IV/IA rt-PA at 3 months-as
      compared to the 3 month outcome of placebo-treated patients in the NINDS rt-PA Stroke
      Trial-warrants proceeding to a large, phase III randomized trial.
