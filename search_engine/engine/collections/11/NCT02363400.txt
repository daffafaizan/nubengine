      III-IV) NPC, originated from the results of the Intergroup study [69]. However, all
      meta-analysis reported no any benefit in using adjuvant chemotherapy for NPC patients
      [82-85]. These contradictions puzzle most oncologists for decades. In our opinion, routine
      delivery of post-radiation adjuvant chemotherapy after RTÂ±induction/concurrent chemotherapy
      for "all" advanced-stage NPC patients should be re-considered. The major goal of adjuvant
      chemotherapy in NPC is to reduce the occurrences of distant failure. But, not all advanced
      NPC patients need adjuvant chemotherapy. In our previous phase III study, only 19.1% (27/141)
      NPC patients with 1988 AJCC stage III-IV disease developed distant failure after CCRT . In
      another study of 210 NPC patients with 1997 AJCC stage IIB-IVB treated by induction
      chemotherapy + RT, 55 patients (26.2%) suffered from subsequent distant metastasis [67]. We
      should remember that unnecessary adjuvant therapy is frequently used. For example, if the
      target patients have as high as 50% subsequent distant failure rate, and the adjuvant therapy
      protocol has a 50% control rate for the subclinical disease. When we treat all target
      patients, only 25% patients benefit from the adjuvant therapy because of unnecessary
      treatment in 50% and ineffective treatment in another 25% patients. Thus, adjuvant therapy
      should be designed for "selected" patients. For NPC patients, pEBV DNA-guided adjuvant
      therapy trial is very reasonable. We plan to prove that adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial
      for post-radiation detectable pEBV DNA patients in this prospective multi-center trial. We
      will conduct another trial to investigate (compare) which adjuvant chemotherapy regimen is
      the best one in the future.
