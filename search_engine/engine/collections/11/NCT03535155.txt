      indications. Applications include neuraxial anesthesia for surgery, epidural labour
      analgesia, epidural steroid injections and lumbar punctures. The current blind palpation
      landmark technique is known to be highly inaccurate and may increase the risk of multiple
      insertion attempts, patient suffering and complication rates such as spinal cord injury. A
      key challenge for neuraxial procedures is the correct identification of needle insertion
      site.

      The ultrasound imaging technique has found its way to neuraxial procedures as an imaging
      method to detect the inner anatomical structure of the lumbar spine and is superior to the
      traditional palpation method. However, a full interpretation of ultrasound images requires
      professional training and experience.

      The overall aim of this proposal is to develop an automated spinal landmark identification
      system to improve patient safety and efficacy of neuraxial procedure needle insertion
      success. The primary aim is to develop an automated spinal landmark identification algorithm
      using image processing system to achieve 90% 1st spinal needle success rate within 12 months.
      The investigators will recruit 100 subjects in a prospective cohort study to investigate the
      spinal needle success rate as a clinically relevant outcome.
