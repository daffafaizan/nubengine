      Coronary heart disease (CHD) continues to be a leading cause of death and disability in the
      United States. Information about the contribution of different subspecies of HDL-C to
      increased or decreased risk for premature CHD and the extent to which common lipoprotein
      lipase (LPL) mutations affect HDL-C composition and subspecies could contribute to an
      increased understanding of the role of HDL-C in determining CHD risk.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The following parameters will be measured in blood samples collected from the VA-HIT study
      and the Framingham Offspring Study: apo A-I-containing HDL subspecies (prebeta, alpha, and
      prealpha) in plasma using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis immunoblot and image analysis,
      LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II in plasma using differential electroimmunoassay, and apo C-III in HDL
      using immunoturbidometric assay. The study hypotheses are as follow. a) Subjects from the
      placebo arm of VA-HIT will have significantly lower alpha l HDL subspecies, LpA-I, and apo
      C-III in HDL, and higher HDL/alpha l and apo A-I/alpha l ratios than subjects free of
      coronary heart disease from the Framingham Offspring Study. b) These parameters will also
      predict prospectively risk of coronary heart disease in both groups. c) In the VA-HIT study,
      treatment with gemfibrozil, which has been shown to be associated with a 22 percent reduction
      in myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death, will be associated with increases
      in alpha l HDL subspecies, LpA-I, and apo C-III in HDL, as well as decreases in HDL/alpha l
      and apo A-I/alpha l ratios, compared to placebo. d) The hypothesis that subjects with
      specific mutations in the lipoprotein lipase gene have less beneficial changes in HDL
      subspecies with gemfibrozil than subjects with no mutations will also be tested.
