      ependymoma, craniopharyngioma and low- and high-grade glioma. The ability of the therapy to
      control brain tumors in children is known to depend on the tumor type, extent of resection
      and other clinical factors. Children who received radiation therapy on this study were
      evaluated for treatment failure at 12 months. In addition to the primary objective, the study
      was designed to explore the association between radiation dose and volume and a variety of
      neurological, endocrine and cognitive deficits up to 5 years after treatment.
