      regarding self-directed, stepped care will result in reduced morbidity and medical care
      utilization, while increasing quality of life.

      One half (54) of the identified cases will be randomized to receive the previously
      established "BREATHE" study educational program, emphasizing patient-centered, self
      management of asthma. Periodic follow-up through personal contact and surveillance of IHS
      RPMS or other medical provider records was conducted.
