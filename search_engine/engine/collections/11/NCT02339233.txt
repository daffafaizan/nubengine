      bladder and cardiovascular experiments, followed by 80 sessions of locomotor training.
      Participants will repeat experiments after the 80 training sessions to quantify that no motor
      pattern changes are achievable with locomotor training alone and will be evaluated for
      appropriate candidacy for surgery and epidural stimulation. Participants will be surgically
      implanted with an epidural stimulator and experiments will be conducted with and without
      stimulation. Investigators will identify appropriate stimulation parameters for inducing
      stepping and standing in combination with manual assistance using body weight support on a
      treadmill and/or overground. Participants will undergo 80-200 training sessions of locomotor
      training with epidural stimulation. Experiments will be repeated mid and post-training
      interventions.
