      pancreas, which is generally a well-tolerated procedure with minimal complications. Upon
      further investigation under the microscope, after resection during a complex Whipple
      operation, it is noted that particularly the exocrine glandular tissue atrophied
      substantially. Based on this information, the hypothesis for utilizing stereotactic radiation
      on the remaining pancreas is production of a fibrosis of the pancreas and a decrease in the
      production of exocrine portion of the gland. The use of stereotactic radiation will be
      performed on individuals that are non-surgical candidates.
