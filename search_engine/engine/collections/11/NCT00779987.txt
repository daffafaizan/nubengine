      impairment of the patient´s life quality. Up to date there is no ideal therapy for this
      condition. Few studies have reported some kind of improvement in different parameters related
      to dry eye with the use of autologous serum, but no one has considered the patient´s symptoms
      with a systematic and validated evaluation method.
