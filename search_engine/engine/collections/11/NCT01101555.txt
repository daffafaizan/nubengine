    
      Otelixizumab is a humanized, aglycosyl, non-mitogenic, anti CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)
      directed against the Îµ domain of the human lymphocyte antigen CD3, which is currently
      undergoing phase III clinical trials in adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patients and
      has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients in small exploratory
      studies. Otelixizumab has been administered via the subcutaneous route as a single dose in
      type I diabetes patients. This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled,
      repeat dose study of otelixizumab administered subcutaneously in rheumatoid arthritis
      patients. One cohort will receive a single dose of adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott) as rescue
      medication to assess additional concomitant safety and tolerability issues.

      This study will consist of a screening phase, followed by an in-house phase whereby
      otelixizumab will be administered to cohorts in a staggered fashion. Six cumulative doses
      will be evaluated covering a 10-fold dose range in seven cohorts. The starting regimen will
      be three doses (1.5 mg cumulative dose), increasing to 15 doses (15 mg cumulative dose).
      Cohorts 1a and 1b have been included as optional lower doses. Serial blood samples will be
      obtained for clinical laboratory testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum
      otelixizumab PK parameters, and immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from the
      previous dose(s) will be evaluated prior to dose escalation or modification to ensure safety
      and to achieve target systemic peripheral blood pharmacology. Adverse events, laboratory
      values, vital signs and ECG's will be monitored closely during this study. All subjects in
      the study will undergo long-term follow-up out to 48 months to monitor and ensure patient
      safety.
