      ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (USGRA). One of the key challenges of USG LPB is
      visualization of the lumbar plexus. That are currently in use for ultrasound-guided lumbar
      plexus blockade - paramedian transverse scan (PMTS) and shamrock technique.

      Method: Twenty-three healthy adult volunteers aged â‰¥ 18 years were enrolled in this
      prospective cohort study. Ultrasound visualization results were compared between methods.
