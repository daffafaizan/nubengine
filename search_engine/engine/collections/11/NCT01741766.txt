      blood pressure,arterial stiffness, wave reflection, endothelial function and cardiovascular
      autonomic control. The specific aim of the study is:

      - To evaluate the effects of 8 weeks of ST on arterial function and aortic hemodynamics by
      assessing arterial stiffness (aortic, systemic, and leg), aortic blood pressure and wave
      reflection, and autonomic function (heart rate variability, vascular sympathetic activity
      [low-frequency power of systolic BP variability], and baroreflex sensitivity)
