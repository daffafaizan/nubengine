    
      This study is for men and women who participate in the YMCA's Diabetes Prevention Program
      (YMCA's DPP) and have been diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There
      will be no administration of study drug. The purpose of this study is to see if participation
      in the YMCA's DPP will result in weight loss and improvement in the liver in patients with
      fatty liver disease.

      Eligible participants will visit Weill Cornell Medical College's Gastroenterology and
      Hepatology clinic to review their medical history, physical examination, complete a survey,
      and conduct imaging tests (FibroScan, ultrasound, DEXA scan) for their baseline visit. Blood
      will be collected as part of standard practice. An additional blood sample will be collected
      for storage. Subjects will complete 9 out of 16 weekly sessions. The YMCA's program will be
      conducted at Weill Cornell Medical College Gastroenterology and Hepatology Division.

      Participants will be in the YMCA program for about 1 year and an additional 1 year in the
      long-term follow-up for data collection.

      Participants will be compensated for their time.
