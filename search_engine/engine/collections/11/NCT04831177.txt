      suggested including inflammation, loss of conjunctival goblet cells during suction,
      exacerbation of a preexisting dry eye, abnormal interaction between the lid margins and the
      ocular surface. Intact corneal sensation is crucial for proper tear production and
      distribution on the ocular surface as well as maintaining the normal dynamics of eyelid
      blinking. Disruption of corneal nerves in LASIK decreases the release of neurotrophic factors
      necessary for the normal function of the corneal epithelium as well as the integrity of the
      lacrimal functional unit, a condition referred to as LASIK induced neurotrophic
      epitheliopathy (LINE) that largely contributes to the development of post- LASIK dry eye .

      Many studies evaluated the incidence of post-refractive dry eye after LASIK compared to
      flapless laser vision correction (LVC) procedures such as PRK and small incision lenticule
      extraction (SMILE). The aim of this study is to assess and compare different dry eye
      parameters following LASIK with planned thin flaps created by femtosecond laser (FS) and
      mechanical microkeratome (MK).
