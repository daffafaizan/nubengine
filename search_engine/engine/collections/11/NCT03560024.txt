      (VIP)/glucagon/secretin family. PACAP exists in two forms: Studying Pituitary adenylate
      cyclase-activating peptide 38 (PACAP38), which consists of 38 amino acids and PACAP27 which
      contains 27 amino acids at its N-terminus. PACAP38 is implicated in migraine pathophysiology
      however PACAP27 is not studied well. Therefore, the investigators will study PACAP27's effect
      on extra- and intracerebral arteries assessed by MRA on healthy volunteers.
