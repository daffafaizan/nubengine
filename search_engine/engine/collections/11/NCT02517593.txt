    
      This trial is a prospective pilot study looking to integrate a novel and retrospectively
      validated polygenic risk score (PRS), based on 77 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs),
      into a standard breast cancer prevention consultation for non-BRCA women. In order to be
      eligible for trial participation, women will need to have a BCRAT estimate of â‰¥3% for the 5
      year risk of developing breast cancer (which corresponds to the United States Preventative
      Services Task Force threshold for moderate to strong benefit from breast cancer preventing
      medications such as tamoxifen or raloxifene.

      At the time of the breast cancer prevention consultation, women will be offered participation
      in this study by a clinical trials nurse and informed written consent will be obtained. For
      consenting patients, a single 7 to 10 ml blood sample will be taken and couriered to the MAYO
      clinic for sample analysis and several surveys will be administered. One of the surveys will
      assess the participants understanding and intention to take or not take breast cancer
      preventing medications. The decision to take or not take a breast cancer preventing
      medication will be deferred until a subsequent follow up visit.

      On the second visit, the PRS test results will be reviewed with the patient and a
      recommendation regarding preventive medications will be made. The PRS score will risk
      stratify patients into one of three lifetime risk categories of developing breast cancer (low
      risk (<15 % lifetime risk), above average risk (15 to <40% risk) and high risk (>40%)).
      Participants will then answer a second survey in which their understanding of their breast
      cancer risk and intention to take breast cancer preventing medications will be assessed.
