      them aged > 18 years with no special condition for the duration of disc prolapse. All of them
      had clinical manifestations in the form of mechanical low back pain or sciatica or limited
      spine mobility. All participants had no or poor response to conservative treatment. Previous
      surgery, severe facet arthropathy, ankylosing spondylitis, sensory or motor deficit and wedge
      fracture were considered as exclusion criteria. Distraction, compression, thigh thrust, and
      sacral thrust were used to assess SIJ dysfunction only at baseline before injection.
      Fingertip to floor and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were used to assess mobility and
      function of the spine at baseline (before and after injection) and after 2 and 16 weeks.
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used for pain appraisal at the same intervals. Participants
      will be randomly assigned into active and control group using 1:1 allocation. In the active
      group bilateral SIJ injection will be performed under ultrasound US guidance. Under US
      guidance a 22G spinal needle, where 1 mL 2 % lidocaine hydrochloride (xylocaine, AstraZeneca)
      mixed with triamcinolone 40 milligrams (Kenacort, Bristol Myers Squip) will be injected in
      each SIJ.
