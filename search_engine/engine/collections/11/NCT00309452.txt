    
      We propose to conduct a clinical trial for first episode psychosis patients not eligible for
      CMHC services that will compare randomized access to care at CMHC versus the usual procedure
      of referral to community providers outside CMHC. Patients randomized to access to CMHC
      services will receive multifaceted, intensive, phase-specific care delivered by a specialized
      clinical team. This care will include five principal components: antipsychotic prescription,
      multi-family group therapy, group cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive remediation and
      individual case management including supportive, problem solving approaches and a focus on
      resumption of movement towards educational and/or employment related goals. All consenting
      subjects will undergo research evaluations every six months for up to five years. Outcomes
      will be assessed in the domains of re-admission (primary outcome), relapse, symptoms, overall
      functioning, quality of life, education and employment, treatment satisfaction, adherence,
      substance use, adverse events (including self-harm) and economic measures including service
      use, cost of care and forensic data.
