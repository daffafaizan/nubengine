    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship between the length of short-term lyophilized black
      raspberries (LBR) administration to human oral cancer patients and the modulation, in oral
      cavity tissues, of a subset of specific genes previously identified by us to be
      "LBR-responsive" and associated with LBR's chemopreventive activity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of LBR administration in humans on cell proliferation, apoptosis,
      and angiogenesis in oral cavity tissues using various established biomarkers including Ki-67
      or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), caspase-3, vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

      II. To assess the feasibility of administering lyophilized freeze-dried black raspberries in
      oral troche form to pre-surgical patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral
      cavity (compliance, tolerance, adverse events).
