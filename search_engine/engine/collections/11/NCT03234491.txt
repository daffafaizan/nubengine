      to determine whether use of Afrezza inhaled insulin with ultra-fast kinetics will improve the
      performance of a closed-loop (CL) system, both with respect to immediate post-prandial
      hyperglycemia and the subsequent late post-prandial hypoglycemia as compared to hybrid CL
      (HCL) with subcutaneous (SC) rapid-acting insulin (RAI) pre-meal bolus.

      The second study aim will be to examine the efficiency and feasibility of Afrezza inhaled
      insulin as a pre-meal bolus and a missed meal correction bolus on mitigating post-prandial
      blood glucose control during outpatient CL therapy.

      This study will test the hypothesis that Afrezza inhaled insulin given before a meal to mimic
      physiologic first phase insulin release will limit the magnitude and rate of rise of glucose
      levels following a meal and will achieve greater percent time spent within target blood
      glucose range as compared to conventional hybrid CL therapy without inhaled insulin both in
      the in-clinic research and outpatient real-life setting.
