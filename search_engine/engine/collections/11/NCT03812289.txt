      I. Assess the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) patients with advanced liver cirrhosis as a feasible approach to providing localized
      disease control that adequately suffices liver transplant eligibility criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess preliminary efficacy and toxicity in HCC patients with advanced cirrhosis following
      liver SBRT.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess qualify of life in HCC patients with advanced cirrhosis following liver SBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, then every 3 months
      for up to 2 years.
