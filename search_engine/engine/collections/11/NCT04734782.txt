    
      A prospective cohort study of mothers with a prenatal diagnosis of a fetus with congenital
      heart disease will be carried out. To whom titers will be measured. Anti-RSV IGG antibodies
      result from previous exposure.

      According to the IGG titers in anti-RSV serum, 2 groups will be formed:

      Protective Mothers (high IGG titers) Non-protective mothers (low IGG titers) The products
      will be followed up for 6 months after birth to correlate the maternal titers of Ac anti-RSV
      with the presence and severity of respiratory infection by RSV (Bronchiolitis) in this
      period.

      Population and period

      Pregnant women evaluated in the National Medical Center 20 de Noviembre, Pediatric Cardiology
      service for the prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease in their fetuses. Newborns
      with corroborated congenital heart disease with prenatal diagnosis.

      Study inclusion period February 1, 2021, to October 30, 2021. Study follow-up period March 1
      2021 to December 30 2021.
