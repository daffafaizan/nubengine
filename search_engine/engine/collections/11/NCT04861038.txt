    
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective, observational intervention study to
      determine the safety and effectiveness of the aerSleep II System. Up to 200 subjects will be
      enrolled at up to ten study sites in the United States to ensure that approximately 79
      subjects who are termed initial responders can be evaluated after 24 weeks of home use with
      the aerSleep II device. As part of screening and prior to intervention, home sleep testing
      will be performed to establish baseline apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Subjects meeting study
      criteria will wear the aerSleep II device at home. After a 1-week period of acclimation,
      subjects will have a second HST (HST #2). Initial responders with a â‰¥50% reduction in AHI
      from baseline with an AHI <20/hour will be continued on home treatment. Non-responders will
      be discontinued from the study. After 12 weeks, subjects will have an interim home sleep
      study. After 24 weeks of home use, subjects will have HST #4 to determine the primary
      effectiveness endpoint.
