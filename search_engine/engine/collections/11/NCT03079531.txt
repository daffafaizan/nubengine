      the etiology of rosacea is unclear, although there may be a genetic predisposition (Chang et
      al., 2015). Currently, there is no cure. Rosacea can lead to scarring, itching, burning, and
      is associated with anxiety and depression (Moustafa et al., 2015), significantly affecting
      quality of life.

      Secukinumab is an antibody that binds to a protein (interleukin (IL)-17A) that is involved in
      inflammation. When IL-17A is bound to secukinumab, it cannot bind to its receptor, thereby
      inhibiting its ability to feed the inflammatory response. In clinical trials, secukinumab has
      been effective for moderate to severe psoriasis (Blauvelt et al., 2015). Recently, human data
      from all types of rosacea have shown Th1/Th17 polarization profile of the T-cell response,
      suggesting that anti-IL-17 therapy may be beneficial for rosacea (Buhl et al., 2015). Hence,
      secukinumab could be effective against rosacea. This proposal is a proof-of-concept study to
      use secukinumab in open label design for moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea.
