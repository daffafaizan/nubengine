      irreversible loss of language abilities. Prior studies suggest that transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) directed toward language areas of the brain may help to ameliorate
      symptoms of PPA. In the current study, the investigators are examining whether tDCS could be
      used to enhance language abilities (e.g., picture naming) in individuals with PPA variants
      primarily characterized by difficulties with speech production (non-fluent and logopenic).
      Participants are being recruited from the Penn Frontotemporal Dementia Center to receive 10
      days of both real and sham tDCS (counter-balanced, full-crossover design; participants are
      na√Øve to stimulation condition). A battery of language tests are being administered at
      baseline, immediately post-tDCS (real and sham), and six weeks and twelve weeks following
      stimulation. Real tDCS may improve language performance in some individuals with PPA.
      Specifically, the investigators expect that tDCS will be more effective in people whose
      baseline performance is worse based on previous research. Severity of deficits at baseline
      may be an important factor in predicting which patients will respond positively to
      language-targeted tDCS therapies.
