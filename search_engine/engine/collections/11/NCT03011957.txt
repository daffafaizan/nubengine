    
      MATCH is a non-randomized observational longitudinal study. We will recruit HIV infected
      adults (50 to 65 years old) and demographically matched uninfected control subjects to be
      followed for 4 years over the course of a 5 year study. The targeted age range of 50-65 is
      chosen to evaluate aging HIV infected individuals at risk for early frailty in the United
      States. All subjects will undergo blood draws and physical function assessment, and a subset
      will undergo a CT scan of muscle and will have a muscle biopsy taken.

      A substudy will be performed on a subgroup of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men from the
      main cohort to measure daily physical activity by using an activity tracker.
