      (IGR) is associated with development of peripheral neuropathy coupled with gait and mobility
      impairment that may be disabling for the patient. Recent novel data from the investigators'
      group indicates that improved diet and exercise can significantly improve and even reverse
      neuropathy associated with IGR, however this has not been tested as a specific intervention
      in a controlled diabetes complications trial. IGR includes patients with early type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and impaired fasting glucose
      (IFG) based on standardized criteria for the diagnosis of T2DM. The investigators hypothesize
      that, compared to IGR participants advised to follow the current standard care
      recommendations on diet and exercise (Standard Care or "SC"), IGR participants undergoing a
      Tailored Diet and Physical Activity (TDPA) enhancement program will show greater improvement
      in the 6 minute walk test (6MW) and will show a greater reduction in markers of neuropathy
      progression e.g. intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IEFND). Furthermore, the investigators
      will test the hypothesis that improvement in measures of neuropathy, mobility function and
      physical activity (PA) will correlate strongly with each other and with improvement in
      specific measures of metabolic function, and weight loss. This proposal will permit us to
      determine if TDPA can improve mobility and induce nerve regeneration in subjects with early
      diabetes.
