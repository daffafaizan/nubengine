      surrogate markers for CLR .

      All patients take 300mg loading dose clopidogrel plus 100mg daily ASA and 75mg daily
      clopidogrel after admission. Patients are recruited after percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI). Light transmittancy aggregation (LTA) in response to 5Î¼M ADP is to measured 5 days
      after taking the loading dose clopidogrel.Than CLR patients were selected.

      In the initial biomarker-screening stage, plasma and platelet samples from 20 CLR patients
      and 20 controls underwent Solexa sequencing to identify miRNAs that showed significant
      differences between the CLR cases and matched controls.

      Subsequently,we performed a biomarker confirmation analysis with a hydrolysis probe-based
      RT-qPCR assay to refine the number of plasma and platelet miRNAs in the CLR signature. This
      analysis was carried out in 2 phases: (a) the biomarker-selection phase, in which plasma and
      platelet samples from 20 CLR patients and 20 control individuals formed the training set, and
      (b) the biomarker-validation phase, in which plasma and platelet samples from an additional
      80 CLR patients and 80 controls formed the validation set.
