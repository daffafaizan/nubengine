      recurrence. II. Correlate pathologic and biologic parameters with disease-free interval and
      survival. III. Determine the value of surgical and ancillary techniques in management of
      colon cancer. IV. Compare disease-free interval and survival after curative resection vs.
      chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil/methyl-CCNU/vincristine vs. BCG immunotherapy. V. Relate the
      total lymphocyte count to the course of the disease. VI. Determine the feasibility of
      conducting a trial employing immunotherapy in a surgical adjuvant setting. VII. Identify
      appropriate future protocols based on data generated in the study.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study for patients with Dukes Stage B and C disease only. All patients
      with Dukes A and D lesions enter Arm I. Arm I: No therapy following surgery. Arm II: 3-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy. 5-Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; Methyl-CCNU, MeCCNU, NSC-95441;
      Vincristine, VCR, NSC-67574. Arm III: Immunotherapy. BCG-Pasteur, BCG, NSC-B116328.
