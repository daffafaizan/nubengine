        -  Determine the long-term safety and tolerability of VEGF Trap in patients with incurable
           relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with stable or responding
           disease after receiving treatment on protocol MSKCC-01131.

        -  Determine the biological effect of this therapy on suppressing tumor growth or
           progression in these patients.

        -  Determine the steady state concentration of VEGF Trap over time in these patients.

        -  Determine whether patients develop antibodies to this therapy during extended exposure.

      OUTLINE: This is an extension study for patients who showed evidence of stable disease or
      complete or partial remission after completing treatment on protocol MSKCC-01131.

      Patients continue to receive VEGF Trap subcutaneously once weekly for up to an additional 6
      months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive treatment at the same dose
      level as on protocol MSKCC-01131.

      Patients are followed at approximately 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
