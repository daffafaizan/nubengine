      around the world. Radial artery occlusion is the most common significant complication after
      transradial catheterization, with incidence varying between 1% and 10%. Endothelial injury of
      the radial artery and decrease in blood flow after sheath and catheter insertion appear to
      contribute to thrombus formation and are predisposing factors for radial artery occlusion.
      Procedural factors can predict and influence radial artery occlusion incidence. Sheath size
      and its relation to radial artery diameter, as well as the utilization of specific
      pharmacological agents (such as anticoagulants and vasodilators) have been studied. But,
      impact of Introducer sheath length on the rate of a radial artery occlusion has not been
      studied. The investigators suggest that, longer introducer sheath sizes can prevented the
      vascular damage and a pro-thrombotic environment.
