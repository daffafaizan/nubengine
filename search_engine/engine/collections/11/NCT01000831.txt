    
      The goal of this study is to determine if one or two doses of the H1N12009 influenza vaccine
      are needed in young children, a population group at high risk of influenza infection and
      subsequent hospitalization.

      The objectives of this study are two-fold:

        1. To compare the safety and immunogenicity of 1 and 2 doses of adjuvanted H1N12009
           influenza vaccine in children 6-35 months of age.

        2. To conduct the trial soon after the vaccines become available and share the observations
           with health officials and the public as soon as possible.
