    
      The Cardiovascular Imaging Registry of Canada (CIROC) was conceived to provide a common
      standardized architecture for the collection of clinically reported imaging biomarkers,
      demographic information, resource utilization and clinical outcomes among patients referred
      to non-invasive cardiac imaging. The Registry was designed to assess the feasibility of
      implementing personalized care strategies through automated high quality data collection and
      patient engagement.

      The CIROC Registry was launched with inaugural focus on Cardiac MRI base phenotyping, however
      has evolved to encompass cardiac CTA and echocardiography. Clinically referred patients are
      engaged by automated, tablet-based tools to collect informed consent and deploy standardized
      patient health assessments. Standardized reporting of disease features are captured using
      bespoke reporting tools. All patients are prospectively followed for a period of 10-years
      using linkage to administrative health data, inclusive of ICD-coded events, laboratory test
      results, ECG and vital statistics.
