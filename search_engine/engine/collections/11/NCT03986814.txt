      metabolome with obesity. Recent studies show that environmental exposures, such as ambient
      air pollution (AAP) exposure can affect gut bacteria and modify risk for obesity.
      Additionally, proximity to green space has been shown to reduce exposure to air pollutants
      and increase gut microbial diversity. The investigator's preliminary work has shown that
      near-roadway air pollution exposure was positively correlated with gut microbial taxa that
      have been linked with obesity. These findings suggest that air pollution exposure may
      increase susceptibility to obesity through alterations in the composition and function of the
      gut microbiome. Despite this, no studies have systematically examined the impact of air
      pollutants and green space on the gut microbiome and metabolome among adolescents. The
      overall goal of this research is to determine whether exposure to air pollutants and/or green
      space affect the gut microbiome and metabolome in Hispanic young adults residing in Denver,
      Colorado. This study will examine residential-based estimates of air pollution exposure and
      green space and also perform detailed gut microbial and metabolite profiling in 100
      adolescent and young adults.
