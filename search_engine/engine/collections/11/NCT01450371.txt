      non-obese and free of any signs or symptoms of disease, as revealed by medical history,
      physical examination and electrocardiogram at rest and during cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breast-feeding, alcohol or drug abuse, and any
      medication with potential effects on cardiovascular variables. Subjects were asked not to
      drink caffeine-containing drinks or exercise for at least 12 and 48 hours, respectively,
      before the experimental protocols.
