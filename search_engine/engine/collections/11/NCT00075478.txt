    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival at 3 years after conditioning with 200 cGy TBI alone vs.
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate)/200 cGy TBI in heavily pretreated patients with
      hematologic malignancies at low/moderate risk for graft rejection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the non-relapse mortality 1-year after conditioning in patients who received
      TBI alone vs. fludarabine/TBI.

      II. To compare the incidences of graft rejection in patients who received TBI alone vs.
      fludarabine/TBI.

      III. To compare the incidences of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
      chronic extensive GVHD.

      IV. To compare rates of disease progression and/or relapse-related mortality.

      V. To compare the immune reconstitution and the risks of infections.

      OUTLINE:

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2. Patients
      then undergo low-dose TBI on day 0.

      ARM II: Patients undergo low-dose TBI on day 0.

      ALLOGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT): After TBI, patients undergo
      PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      56 in the absence of GVHD. Patients with no evidence of GVHD at day 56 begin a cyclosporine
      taper and continue the taper until day 180. Patients with evidence of disease progression and
      no evidence of GVHD prior to day 56 receive tapered doses of cyclosporine for 2 weeks.
      Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) PO BID on days 0-28 in the absence of GVHD.
      If treatment for GVHD is required before day 28, MMF is continued until a steroid taper
      begins.

      Patients are followed up periodically for 1.5 years and then annually for 5 years
      post-transplantation.
