      centers to obtain an abortion from a certified gynecologist. This creates barriers to
      accessing safe abortion that disproportionately affect poor women and girls, through wage
      loss due to missed work and accrued costs due to transportation. This innovation is a novel
      service delivery model that allows self-management of medical abortion (MA) with remote
      guidance from a provider. After confirming their pregnancy, women seeking MA will receive
      counseling from a gynecologist via videoconference and will subsequently obtain the necessary
      medication via mail or at at participating pharmacy with prescription. Follow-up will occur 1
      weeks later via phone/videoconference (with referral to a doctor if necessary) to confirm MA
      success and assess the patient's and provider's satisfaction with the service. We hope to
      demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of telemedicine MA services in
      Moldova so that it can thus be integrated into the national public healthcare system. As a
      result, this project will serve as a model that could be adapted and implemented in nearby
      countries within the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region.
