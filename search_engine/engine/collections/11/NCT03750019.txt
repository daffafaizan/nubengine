      and satiety) can be manipulated in the laboratory and whether this influences later food
      intake. In a between-subjects design participants consumed a fixed lunch and then rehearsed
      the satisfying or dissatisfying aspects of the meal, or a neutral experience (control), in
      order to manipulate memory for meal satisfaction. Three hours later, in a second visit to the
      laboratory, participants completed a bogus taste-test to measure food intake and meal memory
      measures.
