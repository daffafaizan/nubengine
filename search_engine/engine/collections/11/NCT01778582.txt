      examine information processing in the context of clinical trial consent forms, perceptions of
      risk of study side effects, hypothetical intentions to enroll, and satisfaction with the
      consent review process. Adult human subjects will be randomly assigned to watch a movie and
      take the main character s. Participants will also be asked to read a consent form for a
      clinical trial. Finally, they will be asked a series of questions about the consent form. I
      have also attached changes to the lay summary, which I had previously submitted, just to make
      sure that you have them.
