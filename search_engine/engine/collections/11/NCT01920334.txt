      experience a period of sleep deprivation (SD). Recent research has shown that SD, even in the
      short-term, may be related to echo and electrocardiographic changes that may potentially be
      predictors of cardiac arrhythmias.

      The objective is to evaluate the effects of early treatment with zolpidem controlled release
      (CR®) compared to a placebo on clinical and polysomnographic parameters for patients in a
      cardiac ICU who had recently been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome.

      A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in cardiac ICU
      patients who had been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. The patients in group A will
      receive placebo and patients in group B will receive zolpidem CR® 12.5 mg from the first
      night of hospitalization until their discharge. Patients will undergo overnight full
      polysomnography on the first night in the ICU and will complete a sleep diary with a visual
      analogue scale to evaluate sleep quality in the morning after the first 3 nights of
      hospitalization. The results of the routine ICU laboratory tests including the serum levels
      of cardiac enzymes [troponin T and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB)] will be collected preceding
      the first dose of the drug/placebo, and then daily thereafter.
