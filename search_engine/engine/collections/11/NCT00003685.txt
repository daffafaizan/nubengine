      symptoms in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the toxicity of these two
      regimens in these patients. III. Compare the quality of life and survival of patients treated
      with these two regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, weight loss in the previous 6 months (no greater than 10% vs greater than 10%), and
      performance status (ECOG 0 or 1 vs 2 or 3). Patients are randomized to undergo radiotherapy
      as 5 fractions over 5 days or 1 fraction on 1 day. Quality of life is assessed before
      treatment, weekly for 5 weeks, and monthly thereafter. Patients are followed weekly for 5
      weeks, then every 2 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 210 patients will be accrued for this study.
