    
      The study will involve three trials, each conducted as non-blinded randomised controlled
      trial, with GP practices as the unit of randomisation.

      Trial 1 Targeting practices whose prescribing in the past year was under the new target but
      who would exceed the target if they had a 5% increase in prescribing

        -  Control: No letter

        -  Intervention: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing is just under the
           new target (Letter A) Trial hypothesis: Sending a letter to GPs whose practices are just
           under the new prescribing target will reduce antibiotic prescribing

      Trial 2 Targeting practices whose prescribing in the past year was above the new target but
      who not in the top 20% of prescribers

        -  Control: No letter

        -  Intervention 1: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing exceeds the new
           target (Letter B1)

        -  Intervention 2: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing exceeds the new
           target with a graph representing prescribing relative to the target (Letter B2)
           Hypotheses: (i) Sending a letter to GPs whose practices missed the new prescribing
           target will reduce their prescribing; (ii) A letter with a graph will be more effective
           than a letter without a graph.

      Trial 3 Targeting practices that are currently in the top 20% of prescribers

        -  Control: Current standard practice, a social norms message, that their practice is in
           the top 20% of prescribers (Letter C1)

        -  Intervention 1: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing exceeds the new
           target (Letter C2)

        -  Intervention 2: Social norms message, that they are in the top 20%, with a specific
           example of a case of patient harm caused by antimicrobial resistance (Letter C3)

      Hypotheses: (i) A letter with a social norms message and a specific example of a case where a
      patient came to harm will be more effective than a feedback letter without a specific
      example; (ii) A letter telling GPs that they missed the prescribing target will be no less
      effective than a letter with social norms feedback

      For each letter, there will be two versions, one for practices whose prescribing has
      increased by > 5% in the previous year, informing them of that their prescribing has
      increased since the previous year, and one for practices whose prescribing has not been
      increasing.

      The letters will signpost GPs to resources to help address patient demand for inappropriate
      antibiotic prescribing, recognising that many GPs feel that patients expect antibiotics and
      that GPs may find it difficult to have the necessary patient conversations, especially within
      a short consultation. As with previous letters, these letters will advise GPs of actions that
      they can take to reduce inappropriate prescribing, supporting them to have conversations with
      patients, and there will be TARGET leaflets enclosed.

      Power calculation All trials are powered to detect a 2% reduction in prescribing at a
      significance level of 0.05 with a power of 80%.

      Statistical analysis plan In order to test our hypotheses, the investigators will use a fixed
      effects panel regression model, with time trends accounting for seasonal effects, to estimate
      the effect of treatment status on prescribing. The investigators will also run ANCOVAs for
      each month separately and one covering the whole six months of the trial. Analysis will
      control for baseline prescribing rates and for whether practices got the version of the
      letter saying that their prescribing has been increasing.
