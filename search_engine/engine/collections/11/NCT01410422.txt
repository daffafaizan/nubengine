      involved in cellular processes in a single assay to derive metabolic profiles. Compared with
      genomics or proteomics, metabolomics reflects changes in phenotype and therefore function.
      Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a newly developed, noninvasive method that
      may allow clinicians and researchers to assess biochemical profiles in the alveolar lining
      fluid. The aims of this study are: (1)Collecting and metabolomic profiling of the EBCs from
      patients with COPD/bronchiectasis; (2) Comparing the profiles of these patients obtained
      during stable and acute exacerbation periods; (3) Comparing the profiles of these patients
      with and without Pseudomonas colonization/infection; (4) Correlation of EBC metabolomic
      profiles with clinical phenotypes, severity and outcomes of these patients.
