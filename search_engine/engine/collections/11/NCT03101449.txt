      vocal tract exercises (SOVTE) - Finnish tube and phonation in high strength straw - in vocal
      parameters, vocal extension profile and maximum phonation time for a period of four months in
      a group of singers. acoustic analysis will be performed of the average parameters of the
      fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer and glottal to Noise Excitation (GNE) by
      VoxMetria program and perceptual analysis through Consensus Assessment Perceptual Hearing the
      Voice Protocol (CAPE-V) three times: before the vocal conditioning, after the last meeting of
      the technical realization and a week after the vocal conditioning period.
