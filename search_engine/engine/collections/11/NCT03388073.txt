      extracts on adult stem cells, using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over
      study design. The research involves testing of acute effects of single doses of
      antioxidant-rich berry-based extracts, compared to a placebo. Blood samples are taken at
      baseline and 1 and 2 hours after consuming a single dose. The blood will be used to measure
      the numbers of different types of stem cells, to evaluate potential effects of stem cell
      mobilization and homing after consuming plant-based extracts. Adult stem cells are a type of
      cells that play a role in repairing and rejuvenating various tissue and organs in the body.
      At NIS Labs, we have shown that many types of plant-based nutritional products have small but
      reproducible and significant effects on stem cells, cytokines, and regenerative growth
      factors.
