    
      Objective:

      This study is to test whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits the spontaneous oxidation of
      central neural dopamine as indicated by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of
      5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) in patients with Parkinson s disease (PD).

      Study population:

      The study population comprises up to 35 patients with early (less than or equal to 5 years
      from diagnosis), mild, levodopa-untreated PD. The patients will be on an inhibitor of
      monoamine oxidase (MAO) that is prescribed for their disease.

      Design:

      The study has a one group, pretest-posttest design. Each patient undergoes a lumbar puncture
      (LP) as an inpatient at the NIH Clinical Center to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for
      assays of Cys-DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and related biochemicals. The
      second LP is done after the patient has taken at least 5 doses of NAC (2 grams orally twice
      per day). The LP takes place about 2 hours after the last NAC dose.

      Outcome measures:

      The main outcome measure is the CSF concentration of Cys-DA. Other outcome measures are
      levels of other catecholamine-related neurochemicals or of indices of oxidative stress.
      Depending on the results, an exploratory study may be done involving NAC at 1 gram orally
      twice per day.
