      lead to a decrease in falls and the fear of falling.

      this study targets retired people, 65 years of age and over, living at home, identified as
      being independent (Iso Group Resources type 4-5-6 without formal validation being carried
      out) but who represent statistically an increased risk of falls in comparison to the general
      population.

      The inclusion takes place before the first session of the Equilibr'Age® workshop. Subjects
      will have already benefited from a first collective information organized by the Boulogne
      City Council (see annexes of the CRF). 3 times mark the collection of data.

      At the time of inclusion, at the end of the 12 sessions of the Equilbr'Age® workshop (M3) and
      3 months after the end of the workshop ( 6 months after the beginning of inclusion).

      The study does not involve new acts since it is only an assessment of the effects of a
      protocol that proposes non-sports activities as well as advice to citizens of the
      municipality.
