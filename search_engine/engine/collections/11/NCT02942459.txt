      chronically. Negative Symptoms are difficult to reduce by Medication and Psychosocial
      Treatment Possibilities are searched for. Three Cochrane Reviews (2005, 2011, 2017) have been
      conducted concerning Music Therapy and Schizophrenia with Positive Results. This RCT,
      double-blinded Study aims at verifying, if these Results can be Recognized in the Danish
      Health System. It also aims at being similar to Biomedical Study Designs as much as possible
      to strengthen the Evidence of the Study. A Power Calculation showed, that a minimum of 44,5
      Participants in each Arm should be available, but as drop out can be anticipated with this
      Population, 60 Participants in each Arm were recommended. The screening Procedure is
      Comprehensive as it aims at securing, that the negative Symptoms are part of the Illness
      Schizophrenia and not side Effects from Medication or simultaneous Depression (See the
      Inclusion- and Exclusion criteria).

      The Measurement Tools are as follows:

      At Baseline, after 15 Sessions and at Termination:

        -  The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),

        -  Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS),

        -  Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref),

        -  Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS),

        -  Board of Clinical Examinations (Danish Questionnaire) (UKU)

        -  Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) 4 Weeks after Termination Follow Up
           Interview. In the Arm of Music Therapy Audio Recording of Music Interventions are done
           in Session 1,15 and 25.

        -  Helping Alliance Questionnaire, patient version, (Haq-II) This Haq-II is filled out
           after 5 sessions and after 15 Sessions and at Termination together with a Research
           Assistant in both Arms.
