      various eye conditions when using different types of eyeglass lenses. Therefore, the goal of
      this study is to determine factors that may account for variability in the visual functioning
      of individuals with a range of refractive errors and their ability to perform everyday
      activities when equipped with different types of lenses. We hypothesize that the subjects
      will perform visual tasks of function better when using iZonâ„¢ Wavefront-Guided Glasses than
      with conventional glasses. This hypothesis is based upon the glasses yielding better visual
      acuity and because the design of the glasses reduces the effects of glare. This research is
      important so that alternate treatments and vision correction may be implemented which will
      have a more beneficial impact on those with refractive errors and visual impairment.
