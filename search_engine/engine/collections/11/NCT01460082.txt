      however, there is cumulating data suggesting that the inflammatory reaction associated with
      COPD is not restricted to the lungs but has systemic effects. Patients with COPD have
      increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The suspected link between increased
      cardiovascular mortality and systemic inflammation is endothelial dysfunction, which in turn
      is caused by impaired activity of NO. Endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in
      patients with COPD. Furthermore there is a close correlation between endothelial dysfunction
      in coronary and peripheral vessels, which allows assessing flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in
      the brachial artery via high resolution ultrasound as an early predictor of atherosclerosis.
      Moreover, systemic inflammatory markers correlate with endothelial dysfunction in patients
      with stable COPD.

      Exacerbations of COPD are episodes of worsening symptoms characterized by increased airway
      and systemic inflammation. If systemic inflammation is a cause of endothelial dysfunction in
      COPD, endothelial function would be suspected to be further impaired during exacerbation and
      recover thereafter. The purpose of this study is to determine a possible association between
      the clinical entity of exacerbation, markers of systemic inflammation and endothelial
      dysfunction in patients with COPD.
