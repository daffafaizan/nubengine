    
      Patients enrolled are randomized to active substance or placebo approximately 30 minutes
      prior to skin incision.

      Patients are followed for 30 days postoperative with registration of outcomes on a
      postoperative questionnaire. Patients are contacted by telephone at every registration time.
      The primary outcome is also secured over the telephone in case patients do not return their
      questionnaire.

      With a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% we need 64 patients (32 in each arm) to
      show a 30% reduction in postoperative pain during the first 3 postoperative days with 5
      measurements and we need 42 patients (21 in each arm) to show a 15% increase in the QoR-15
      during the first 3 postoperative days. With an anticipated loss to follow up of 20% we need
      80 patients ( 40 in each arm).
