      aspirin (325 mg) in the perioperative period. These dosages are based on the Pharmacist's
      letter/Prescriber's letter which provides aspirin dosing recommendations for varying
      cardiovascular indications. Allocation of dosing will be based on computerized randomization
      in order to achieve approximately 100 patients in each group. Patient records will then be
      assessed for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, functional outcome scores
      (Sf-12), operative time, intraoperative estimated blood loss, postoperative blood loss in
      drainage tubes (when applicable), cumulative blood loss, transfusion of blood products,
      hemoglobin level, preoperative International Normalized Ratio (INR), preoperative platelet
      count, hospital length of stay, and morbidity and mortality including development of NSTEMI,
      atrial fibrillation, surgical site infection, pulmonary embolism, and hospital 30-day
      readmission rates.
