      problems.

      A possible explanation for this is, an influence of thyroid autoantibodies on the functioning
      of the thyroid gland. It is therefore recommended to check thyroid gland function and for the
      presence of autoantibodies before pregnancy. In general, 2 types of thyroid autoantibodies
      are known: anti-thyreoperoxidase autoantibodies and anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies.

      In case of abnormal thyroid function, treatment is sometimes necessary in regards to
      fertility. The risk of abnormal thyroid function is increased in women with thyroid
      autoantibodies during pregnancy. Therefore, thyroid function is regularly monitored during
      pregnancy in women with thyroid antibodies. The influence of thyroid autoantibodies on
      thyroid function in pregnancy after fertility treatment is not well known.

      The objectives of the present study are:

        1. To monitor the course of thyroid function during pregnancy and to compare between women
           with and without thyroid autoantibodies.

        2. Compare pregnancy outcome between women with and without thyroid antibodies
