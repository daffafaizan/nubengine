      has successfully commercialized several innovative products to quantify human movement; 2)
      the Balance Disorders Laboratory in the department of Neurology at Oregon Health & Science
      University (OHSU); and 3) NorthWest Rehabilitation Associates (NWRA), a nationally-recognized
      outpatient rehabilitation center that will test the effectiveness of Mobility Rehab for
      adults with mobility disturbances.

      The objective of this Phase II application is to prepare the Mobility Rehab system for
      commercialization and demonstrate its efficacy for mobility training. Our hypothesis is that
      feedback-based rehabilitation will be more effective than standard rehabilitation for gait in
      older adults with gait disturbances. In this Phase II, we will use a pragmatic clinical trial
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Mobility Rehab on 300 patients with various types of gait
      disturbances in a physical therapy clinic. In addition to visual feedback, the system will be
      optimized in Phase II to also provide verbal feedback commands for patients during training.
