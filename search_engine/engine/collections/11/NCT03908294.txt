      frequency of impaired glucose tolerance. It is well known that metabolic factors play an
      important role in fibrosis progression and steatohepatitis for example in non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH). Accordingly changes in glucose metabolism in patients with chronic
      hepatitis C might directly impact disease and fibrosis progression. The study aims to
      evaluate whether a therapy with direct-acting antiviral agents leading to a sustained
      virologic response directly impacts parameters reflecting glucose metabolism and fibrosis.
      Follow-up examinations will determine the long-term metabolic changes of successful
      elimination of the virus by antiviral treatment.
