      Primary

        -  Compare the activity of docetaxel with or without oblimersen, in terms of
           prostate-specific antigen response, in patients with hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma
           of the prostate.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, metastatic disease (M0 vs M1 with non-measurable lesions only vs M1
      with measurable lesions), prior estramustine (yes vs no), and prior bisphosphonates (yes vs
      no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 5 and oblimersen IV continuously
           on days 1-7.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. In both arms, treatment
           repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until progressive disease and then every 16 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102 patients (51 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
