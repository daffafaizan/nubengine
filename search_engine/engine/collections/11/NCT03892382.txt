      progressive loss of central and peripheral motor neurons. ALS leads to death usually within 3
      to 5 years from the onset of the symptoms. Available treatment can prolong the disease
      duration but cannot modify the disease course. Apathy is a frequent complication of ALS,
      which negatively influences quality of life (caga et al. 2018) and is an independent poor
      prognostic factor for survival (Caga et al. 2016). Similarly, the depression is also a
      frequent complication of ALS. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a
      noninvasive method of modulation of brain plasticity with confirmed beneficial effect on
      apathy in several neurologic and psychiatric conditions like mild cognitive impairment
      (Padala et al. 2018), stroke (Sasaki et al. 2017), Alzheimer disease (Nguyen et al. 2017) and
      schizophrenia (Prikryl et al. 2013). The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effectiveness of rTMS in improving the apathy in patients with ALS with placebo stimulation
      and - as a secondary outcome - depression in patients with ALS.

      Intervention will include ten daily sessions of rTMS. In each session 3000 magnetic pulses
      will be administered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation intensity will
      equal 120% of the motor threshold value for the right first dorsal interosseus.

      Assessment of apathy and of depression and daily functioning will be made before and after
      therapy, as well as two and four weeks later.
