    
      This study is a Phase 1 and pharmacologic open-labeled dose-escalation trial using a "3+3"
      design exploring weekly, bi-weekly, and tri-weekly dosing schedules. Successive MM-151
      monotherapy cohorts of three or more patients will be treated at escalating doses until a
      maximum tolerated dose is identified, and subsequently in combination with irinotecan. The
      study consists of three parts as follows: MM-151 monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1); MM-151
      monotherapy expansion cohort in cetuximab-refractory colorectal cancer (Part 2); MM-151 +
      irinotecan dose escalation (Part 3). It is expected that approximately 4 study sites will
      participate.
