      fresh tumor specimen that will be sent to Celcuity for CELx HSF testing, in order to assess
      the status of their HER2 signaling activity (abnormally or normally active).

      Patients who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity will receive weekly paclitaxel plus the
      anti-HER2 therapy regimen of trastuzumab and pertuzumab following completion of initial
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate whether
      patients with HER2-negative breast cancers based on standard American Society of Clinical
      Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) testing criteria, but with abnormal
      HER2-driven signaling pathways determined by the Celcuity HSF assay and receive HER2-targeted
      therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, will have a higher rate of pathological complete
      response in the breast and lymph nodes (pCR breast and lymph nodes) than has been found
      historically in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy alone. Secondary endpoints include pathologic complete response (breast),
      clinical complete response (cCR), residual cancer burden (RCB) 0-1 index, and relationship
      between quantitative CELx score and pCR rate.

      It is expected that approximately 270 patients will need to be prescreened in order to enroll
      54 patients (26 ER-positive/HER2-negative and 28 ER-negative/HER2-negative) who have abnormal
      HER2 signaling activity.
