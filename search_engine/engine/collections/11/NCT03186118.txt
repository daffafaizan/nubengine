      presenting cells (T-APCs) designed to reactivate and numerically expand CD19-specific CAR T
      cells. The underlying hypothesis to be examined is that after remission is achieved with CAR
      T cell treatment, the duration, magnitude, and activation state of persisting memory CAR T
      cells impact on the potential for durable leukemia eradication. This is of particular
      relevance in two groups of patients we have identified: those who are predicted to lose
      persistence of their CAR T cells before Day 63, and those who have definitively lost
      persistence of CAR T cells prior to 6 months. By providing these patients with episodic
      exposure to T-APCs capable of activating CD19-specific CAR T cells for proliferation and
      redistribution to tissue beds where tumor cells of ALL seed, ideally over several months
      following remission induction, it is posited that the incidence of disease relapse will be
      diminished.
