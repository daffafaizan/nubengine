      kidney transplant recipients. The kidney transplant patients will be screened for kidney
      transplant dysfunction and hyperparathyroidism. The study medication will be given to 50
      patients. The other 50 patients will continue to be treated with the actual standard of care
      at the transplant clinic. Subjects will be followed for 18 months and their laboratory
      values, bone density, vascular calcification and stiffness will be collected to see if there
      is an effect of Hectorol® compared to the actual standard of care.
