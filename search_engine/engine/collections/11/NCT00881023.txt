      morselized autologous hyaline cartilage harvested arthroscopically, affixed onto a synthetic,
      resorbable implant using a fibrin sealant and implanted in a single surgical procedure. The
      system is designed as a surgical treatment of damaged knee cartilage using the subject's own
      healthy cartilage obtained from a non-weight or low weight-bearing region.
