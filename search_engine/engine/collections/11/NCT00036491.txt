      autoantibodies. Clinical observations support the contention that intervening in the
      production of autoantibodies by the B lymphocyte will be effective therapy. Current approved
      therapy for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma includes anti-CD20. The results of anti-CD20
      administration in SLE are anticipated to be similar to those in lymphoma patients. The
      current proposal explores the mechanisms and applicability of B-cell depletion as a potential
      treatment for SLE.

      Participants receive 4 weekly infusions of study medication. Each participant is enrolled in
      the study for a total of 1 year with protocol visits weekly for the first 3 months, then
      every other week for the next 2 months, every month for the next 4 months, and every other
      month for the remaining 5 months of the study (Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,
      19, 23, 27, 31, 39, 47, and 55). Responses to exogenous antigens are measured; assessments
      for clinical response with SLE-disease activity score (SLEDEI) and systemic lupus activity
      measure (SLAM) score are performed. Participants complete a health questionnaire and a health
      survey and laboratory parameters are evaluated.
