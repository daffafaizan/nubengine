    
      This is a phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using light-activated
      talaporfin sodium in patients with LUTS due to BPH who are candidates for interventional
      therapy.

      The eligible patient will undergo placement of a proprietary drug activator into the
      prostatic urethra. Following the placement of the drug activator, patients will receive
      talaporfin sodium at 1 mg/kg intravenously by slow push over 3-5 minutes. Fifteen minutes
      after injection a light dose of 100 Joules per centimeter (J/cm) will be delivered at 20
      mW/cm to each patient for a treatment duration of 1 hour 23 minutes.

      SAE reporting will occur from the day of treatment (Day 0) through end of study (month 12),
      inclusive. Any SAE that is still ongoing at the end of the study will be followed until
      assessed as chronic, stable or resolved.
