        -  Determine the efficacy of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin, IP and IV paclitaxel, and IV
           doxorubicin HCl liposome, in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival, in
           patients with optimally debulked stage III ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or
           primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the feasibility of and toxic effects associated with this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1, intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin over
      30-60 minutes on day 2, IP paclitaxel over 30-60 minutes on day 8, and doxorubicin HCl
      liposome IV over 1 hour on day 8. Patients not able to tolerate IP infusion receive
      paclitaxel IV and cisplatin IV on day 1 only. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
