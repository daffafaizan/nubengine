      inform their medical practitioner that they do not want any life-sustaining treatment should
      they become unconscious and terminally ill where death is imminent. It may be completed by
      any person, of sound mind, aged 21 years and above.The AMD Act was passed in the Singapore
      Parliament in May 1996.

      A cross-sectional, community-based study surveyed 1200 selected households in Singapore. Only
      37.9% of the sample population had heard of the AMD prior to the study, though when
      approached, 60.6% were willing to sign an AMD. As of 2017, less than 25,000 people (0.45%) in
      Singapore have opted to sign an AMD.

      Past studies have shown that end of life discussions reduce stress, anxiety, and depression
      in surviving relatives. A local study in 2010 revealed a 33% patient-surrogate discrepancy in
      end-of-life decision making.

      There are a lack of intervention studies regarding AMD in Singapore. In this study, we aim to
      compare the effectiveness of counselling sessions together with pamphlets, versus pamphlets
      alone, versus current care, in increasing the completion rates of the AMD in the Singapore
      Polyclinic setting.
