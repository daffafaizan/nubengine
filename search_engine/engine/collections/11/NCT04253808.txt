      carbohydrates is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and disease-specific
      mortality in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The purpose of this study is to
      conduct a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility of a
      carbohydrate-restricted, high-fat (CRHF) diet intervention in newly diagnosed HNSCC patients
      who will receive definitive radiation. The secondary aim is to collect preliminary data on
      the effect of the intervention on tumor progression, nutritional status, body composition,
      quality of life (QOL), and symptom burden. 30 newly diagnosed non-metastatic HNSCC patients
      will be recruited from Augusta Victoria Hospital (AVH) in Jerusalem and randomized to an
      experimental or standard diet arm. The experimental arm (N=15) will be provided a CRHF diet
      both neoadjuvantly (for 2 weeks prior to treatment) and adjuvantly (during treatment with
      radiation). The standard diet arm (N=15) will receive standard oncologic treatment including
      a regular diet that is provided by the AVH. Feasibility outcomes, including recruitment,
      retention, intervention adherence, and safety will be tracked weekly. Biomarkers, tumor
      progression, nutritional status, body composition, QOL, and symptoms will be assessed at
      baseline, 2-weeks, and 1.5-2 months post-treatment. This proposed pilot/feasibility study is
      the first step in determining if a CRHF diet is an effective treatment modality in HNSCC.
