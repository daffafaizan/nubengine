      the course of the child's life will change as the duration of life with the disease
      increases. In epilepsy, it is necessary to develop self-management behaviors in order to
      facilitate adaptation to the disease, to encourage seizure control and to increase the
      quality of life. Regular repetition of the trainings created within the framework of a
      certain plan to improve self-management behaviors is one of the recommended steps to
      strengthen the individual with chronic disease in the disease process. This randomized
      controlled study including aged 12-18 adolescents with a diagnosis of epilepsy, monotherapy,
      mental retardation without cerebral palsy, and no secondary disease and their parents.
      However, there isn't enough published research examining the effect of education program
      given to adolescents diagnosed with epilepsy and their parents based on Ryan and Sawin's
      individual and family self-management theory, on adolescents 'attitudes towards disease,
      self-efficacy, quality of life and parents' nurse-parent support levels.
