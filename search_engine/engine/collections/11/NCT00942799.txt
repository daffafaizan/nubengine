    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the
      safety and tolerability of Genz-644282, administered as an IV infusion, to patients with
      advanced malignant solid tumors. Drug will be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion on days
      1, 8, and 15 of the 28 day treatment cycle, or on days 1 and 8 of the 21 day treatment cycle.

      Treatment with Genz-644282 will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      is observed. Patients will be enrolled in escalating dose cohorts until the Maximum Tolerated
      Doses (MTDs) are established.

      Safety will be evaluated throughout the study.
