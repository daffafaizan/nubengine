      mutations are poor prognostic factor in advanced solid tumor, the TP53 gene is frequently
      inactivated by mutation in a majority of human tumors. However, no effective TP53 -based
      therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment. So, investigators
      intend to review and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PARP inhibitor in combination
      with the VEGFR inhibitor for TP53 mutation in advanced refractory solid tumors patients from
      a real-world population.
