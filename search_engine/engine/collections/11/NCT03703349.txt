    
      Post operative atrial fibrillation following coronary surgery (POAF) is a common complication
      that can affect 10-50% of patients. It is associated with many complications. POAF increases
      the postoperative length of stay and increases the cost of hospitalization.

      Several studies and meta-analyzes have demonstrated the beneficial effect of intravenous
      magnesium (Mg), administered per-or post-operatively, in reducing the incidence of POAF.
      However, the effect of preoperative magnesium loading on the incidence of POAF is not yet
      studied.

      The aim of this study is to study the effect of oral Mg, administered preoperatively, on the
      incidence of POAF.

      Following IRB approval, 200 patients admitted for elective coronary surgery under
      Cardiopulmonary bypass will be included in this prospective randomized controlled trial.
      Patients will be allocated inn a 1: 1 ratio in 2 groups:

        -  Treatment group will receive preoperatively 8 tablets of Mg (3.2 g) per day, at day
           (-3), day (-2), and day (-1) before the day of planned coronary artery surgery.

        -  Control group will receive 8 tablets of placebo daily,at day (-3), day (-2), and day
           (-1) before the day of planned coronary artery surgery.

      The anesthetic and surgical management protocols will be identical for both groups. The
      occurrence of POAF during the 7 postoperative days, the main outcome of the study, will be
      recorded, including the number of POAF episodes, their duration, recurrence, and the
      associated ventricular response rate. From a safety point, the occurrence of complications
      and the length of hospital stay will be noted.
