      time of the pre-operative visit. Screening will be performed at the time of evaluation in the
      emergency room. Patients will be assigned to a particular group based on the surgeon that
      performs their surgery. Each surgeon at the onset of the study will commit to one technique
      of operative management with the understanding that this technique may be abandoned by the
      surgeon in any case where it is felt to be inadequate. Changing technique will be considered
      a failure of the technique. Data regarding the treatment will be collected from the chart and
      x-rays at the time of treatment and at follow up visits in the orthopedic office.
