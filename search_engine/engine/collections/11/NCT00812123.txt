    
      This pilot study is designed to show differences in efficacy, safety and cost between the two
      regimens. Its main purpose is to provide information, if calcineurin free immunosuppressive
      treatment is a valuable alternative in the treatment of de novo kidney transplant recipients.
      Furthermore, by investigating the side effects in both arms it will be possible to decide, if
      the absence of calcineurin inhibition and lack of nephrotoxicity will outweigh the adverse
      effects of Rapamycin. With the obtained information it will be possible to plan a larger
      trial, which is warranted to compare the mentioned treatment regimens in more detail.
