      failing a standard pemetrexed-based chemotherapy regimen.

      For this reason, the best supportive care (BSC) alone might be considered as a standard
      reference for a randomized phase III trial in this setting.

      However, single-agent chemotherapeutic agents (such as doxorubicin,gemcitabine, or
      vinorelbine) with a well-documented safety profile and antitumor activity are also used in
      clinical practice.

      Therefore, the best investigator's choice (BIC) between either best supportive care alone or
      combined with a few selected single-agent chemotherapy (including doxorubicin, gemcitabine,
      or vinorelbine) might be considered as an acceptable reference arm as well in this setting.

      The current phase III study aims to show a superior efficacy in terms of overall survival
      duration of NGR-hTNF 0.8 Âµg/mq weekly plus BIC versus placebo plus BIC in advanced MPM
      patients progressing after a standard pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.
