      The concept of stereotactic radiosurgery involves tightly conforming dose of therapeutic
      radiation confined to a small region of the body. This results in eradication or ablation of
      the target tumor with sparing of surrounding normal tissues. The largest experience with
      stereotactic radiosurgery is for the treatment of intracranial tumors Neoadjuvant treatment
      of IVC-TT with SABR may decrease local recurrences and lower the likelihood of embolic
      complications and systemic metastasis.
