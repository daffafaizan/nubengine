      NSCLC and breast cancer. But to gastric cancer, few clinical data has been reported. However,
      bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor was shown effective in combination with chemotherapy
      in advanced gastric cancer in some phase II study. So in this study, we want to explore
      whether endostar is also effective and safe in advanced gastric cancer. Response predictive
      factor is expected to be identified.
