      some patients, they can persist. The investigators believe that in some individuals, dry eye
      symptoms after LASIK persist because the nerves in the cornea become hypersensitive. The
      investigators wish to study if a medication, called pregabalin, can protect corneal nerves at
      the time of LASIK surgery and decrease the frequency and severity of dry eye symptoms 6
      months after surgery. This medication has been used in a similar way to reduce the frequency
      of uncomfortable sensations after other surgeries (knee, abdomen) but has never been studied
      in LASIK surgery.
