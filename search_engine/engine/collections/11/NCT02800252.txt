      impact on quality of life, longevity, and costs in public health. The World Health
      Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2040, 642 million people will suffer from diabetes,
      around 10% of the world adult population (WHO, 2015). Periodontal Diseases are considered the
      sixth complication of DM. This close relationship between both diseases is characterized by
      mutual influence. Thus, an appropriate control of periodontal disease may facilitate the DM
      control, improving quality of life on diabetic patients. Besides that, the presence of DM
      might impair prognosis of diverse dental treatments due to its inflammatory nature, negative
      influence on wound healing, on bone biology, and the establishment of infections. As a host
      modulatory therapy (HMT), the daily supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      and low-dose aspirin has been proposed as adjunct therapy to the treatment of chronic
      periodontitis, showing good clinical and metabolic results in normoglycemic patients.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of daily supplementation
      of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and low-dose aspirin as adjunct therapy to one-stage
      full-mouth periodontal ultrasonic debridement for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in
      type 2 diabetic patients through a superiority randomized clinical trial.
