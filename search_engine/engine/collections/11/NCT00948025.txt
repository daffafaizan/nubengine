      randomized, two phase study comparing clinical outcomes of AVANCE Nerve Graft to hollow tube
      conduits. The first phase (pilot phase) assesses projected differences expected between two
      treatment groups. The second phase of the study provides comparison data between the two
      treatment groups.

      AVANCE Nerve Graft is current regulated in the United States as a 361 HCT/P Tissue for
      transplantation; not a Drug, Biologic, or Medical Device. Hollow tube conduits are currently
      regulated in the United States as medical devices.
