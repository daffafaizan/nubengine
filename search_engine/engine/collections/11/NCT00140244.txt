      fat depletion (lipoatrophy), high triglyceride levels, and in some patients, high sugar
      levels or diabetes. This syndrome is associated with a deficiency of leptin, a hormone
      produced by fat cells. Recent studies involving leptin administration to patients with
      congenital lipoatrophy have shown dramatic improvements in metabolic parameters such as
      insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Leptin administration to patients with HAART-induced
      lipoatrophy may also lead to significant improvements in the metabolic abnormalities found in
      these HIV+ patients. The aims of this study are to examine the effect of leptin
      administration on insulin resistance and other parameters of the metabolic syndrome in HIV
      patients with HAART-induced lipoatrophy.
