      maternal niacin levels caused by a low niacin diet can lead to stillbirth(HJ Shi, et al.
      2017). Due to the lack of a recognized clinical niacin test, it is unclear whether niacin
      deficiency is associated with abortion. However, some studies have showed: 1. Nearly
      one-third of pregnant women present low niacin level during the first trimester of pregnancy;
      2. Insufficient parent niacin intake is positively correlated with the incidence of
      congenital heart disease; 3. Vitamin B6 affects niacin metabolism, while maternal B6
      deficiency is significantly associated with early abortion. Based on this, the investigators
      predict that (1) a certain proportion of recurrent abortion women's niacin levels are lower
      than the normal range of women's normal; (2) supplementation of niacin can reduce the risk of
      repeated abortion.

      There are many methods for detecting niacin, but so far with no reports for large population.
      Dr. Shi Hongjun from West Lake University used the most sensitive QTRAP 6500+ liquid
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometer to accurately quantify the concentration of NAD,
      nicotinamide, niacin and other niacin metabolites in plasma and have optimized the detection
      process, which would be applicated in this study.

      At the same time, studies have shown that pregnant women generally have multiple vitamin
      deficiency during pregnancy, including plasma thiamine, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12
      and vitamin D. Therefore, in addition to detecting plasma niacin, this study will also
      examine the plasma levels of the remaining multivitamins to further explore the impact of
      nutritional deficiencies on the probability of recurrent miscarriage.
