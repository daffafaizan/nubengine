      hearing impairment. The families will be recruited by the clinical investigators. The clinic
      and radiological characteristics of the hearing impairment will be collected by the clinical
      investigators. Samples of patients and healthy relatives will be sent to the referral center.
      A linkage study of the whole genome by SNP studies is in progress in a cohort of large
      families affected by autosomal dominant deafness. This work will enable us to select the loci
      that may be frequently implicated in our population and screen these genes in the 150
      families included in the protocol.
