      entry, iterative opioid dose reduction is performed in conjunction with open-label NPNS
      treatment. For each of two iterative step-downs in opioid dose (step-down #1 and step-down
      #2), a 1-2-week run-in phase to allow resolution of opioid withdrawal symptoms unrelated to
      RLS is followed by a 1-wk assessment phase to evaluate if RLS symptoms have increased. Study
      participation is terminated if there is a clinically significant increase in RLS severity
      during the assessment phase or if there are intolerable opioid withdrawal symptoms at any
      time. Participants who tolerate both step-downs have the option of an extension phase
      involving a third step-down with the same format.
