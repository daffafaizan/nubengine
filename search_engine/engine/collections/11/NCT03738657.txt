    
      This study aims to collect data from patients with HNC undergoing RT or chemo-RT to correlate
      quantitative chemosensory gustatory function with

        -  Detailed dosimetric data for critical structures relevant to perception of taste

        -  Fungiform papillae density (FPD)

        -  Use of concurrent platinum based therapy

        -  Patient reported taste loss using The Taste and Smell Survey (TSS) [14]

        -  Patient reported toxicity and overall QOL using University Washington Quality of Life
           Revised Version 4 (UW-QOL v4) [15].

        -  Clinician reported acute and late toxicity using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
           Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4) [16] and Scale of Subjective Total Taste Acuity
           (STTA) [17].

        -  Weight (as a surrogate of nutritional status).

      This study hopes to demonstrate a dose dependent relationship for loss of taste and to
      develop a dose constraint for preservation of taste. In turn this will serve as a platform
      for further research to optimise the technical delivery of radiation either in the form of
      optimised IMRT or through the use of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT).
