      reconstruction were admitted to the hospital overnight. However, recent retrospective studies
      utilizing ERAS protocols have reported same day discharge as a possibility for this patient
      population. ERAS protocols for breast cancer surgery and reconstruction are becoming more
      popular. This along with the increasing utilization of prepectoral breast reconstruction that
      is associated with less postoperative pain and opioid use, are promising avenues to decrease
      the need for overnight hospital stay. If it can be shown that discharge on the same day of
      surgery does not pose any major risks compared to discharge on post-operative day one, there
      is the potential to decrease length of hospital stay, improve hospital capacity and
      dramatically decrease costs.
