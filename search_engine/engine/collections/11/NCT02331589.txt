      We used to be KRUPP's fatigue severity scale. The survey has nine questions as following: (1)
      my motivation is lower, when I am fatigued (2) exercise brings on my fatigue (3) I am easily
      fatigued (4) fatigue interferes with my physical functioning (5) fatigue causes frequent
      problems for me (6) my fatigue prevents sustained physical functioning (7) fatigue interferes
      with carrying out certain duties and responsibilities (8) fatigue is among my 3 most
      disabling symptoms (9) fatigue interferes with my work, family, or social life. All subjects
      scored each question on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = neither disagree nor
      agree to 7 = strongly agree). All fatigue severity scale calculated and collected by one
      research nurse (C.W.K) in the Department of Internal Medicine.
