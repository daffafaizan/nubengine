      pneumonia, and other serious infections. It is therefore important to find drugs that can be
      given along with AZT to control these infections. Aerosolized pentamidine (PEN) has been
      shown to be useful in preventing PCP and is expected to lower the 2-year risk of PCP. Both
      sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) and dapsone probably also provide effective
      preventive treatment against PCP, and both may be useful in preventing toxoplasmosis and
      extrapulmonary pneumocystosis.

      All patients receive AZT. In addition, they are placed in one of three groups to receive
      either SMX/TMP, dapsone, or PEN. Stratification criteria are:

      Received first AZT equal to or less than 6 weeks prior to study entry. Received first AZT
      more than 6 weeks prior to study entry. Potential to participate in ACTG 981. ACTG center in
      which the patient is enrolled.
