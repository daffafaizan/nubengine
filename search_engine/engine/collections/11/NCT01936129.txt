    
      Aim To assess the neuroprotective effect of Cop-1 (Copaxone) in reducing functional and
      structural damage after acute primary angle closure (APAC)

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measures will be the point-wise linear regression in the visual fields.

      The secondary outcome measure will be the evaluation of structural changes, namely, RNFL
      thickness and Optic disc changes as measured by stratus OCT and HRT respectively.

      Study population

      The study population (n=196; 1:1 randomisation) will be patients with APAC attending the
      Singapore National Eye Centre who fulfil the inclusion criteria and are willing to take part
      in the study.

      Study design:

      The study design is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded trial where patients
      with APAC will be randomized to receive either Cop-1 (Copaxone) or placebo in addition to the
      standard medical therapy.

      An interim analysis will be conducted after 40 patients complete the trial. Routine
      examination will be done at all visits.
