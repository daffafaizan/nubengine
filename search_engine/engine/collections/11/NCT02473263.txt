      2001, Rivers observed a reduction in mortality through early hemodynamic optimization. In
      2009, Arnold emphasizes that establishing more early antibiotic therapy allowed a further
      reduction of mortality.

      In France, pre hospital care is based on mobile intensive care unit (MICU) called SMUR. SMUR
      is consisting of a driver, a nurse and an emergency physician.

      Actually in France, management of severe septic syndrome (severe sepsis and septic shock) are
      not standardized and based on a "conventional" strategy at the discretion of the emergency
      physician. Antibiotics are given in only two cases: fulminans purpura and meningitis.
      Hemodynamic optimization is not a standard of care and no recommendation exist for
      hemodynamic targets.

      An "aggressive" strategy based on early antibiotics administration, hemodynamic optimization
      and opotherapy when required could be initiated by SMUR since first contact with the patient
      before hospital admission.

      We assume that an "aggressive" strategy initiated during the first 60 minutes of prehospital
      stage compared to "conventional" strategy could allow to reduce mortality in severe sepsis
      patients.
