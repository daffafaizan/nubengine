      cyclophosphamide have some efficacy against different types of breast cancer. However, the
      optimal sequence in which to administer these treatments remains unknown. The current study
      assesses two separate sequences of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide.

      Purpose: This study will evaluate two different combination chemotherapy schedules for
      patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer. Combination one is docetaxel before
      doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Combination two is docetaxel after doxorubicin and
      cyclophosphamide. The combination with no dose reductions of docetaxel within 10 weeks will
      then be tested in a Phase III study. The toxicities of docetaxel will also be assessed in
      study participants.

      Treatment: Patients in this study will receive one of two chemotherapy combination schedules.
      A computer will randomly assign patients into their treatment group. Group one will receive
      docetaxel before doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Group two will receive docetaxel after
      doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.

      Patients in group one will receive docetaxel every two weeks for a total of eight weeks.
      These patients will then be given combination doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every two
      weeks for a total of eight weeks. Patients in group two will receive combination doxorubicin
      and cyclophosphamide every two weeks for a total of eight weeks. These patients will then be
      given docetaxel every two weeks for a total of eight weeks.

      Several tests and exams will be given throughout the study to closely monitor patients.
      Treatments will be discontinued due to disease growth or unacceptable side effects.
