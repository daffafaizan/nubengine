      supplementation is necessary as vitamin D is required not only for prevention of rickets as
      traditionally thought, but also for its emerging role in development of diseases such as
      myopathic disorders, proneness to infection, autoimmune disorders and cancers .However
      supplementation studies are limited and predominantly from foreign countries. Moreover most
      of them report variable outcomes with no unanimous outcome with respect to optimum dose and
      duration of supplementation of vitamin D. Various national authorities recommend different
      doses of vitamin D for supplementation. American Academy of Pediatrics, The Institute of
      Medicine of National Academics, The Drug and Therapeutics Committee of the Lawson Wilkins
      Pediatric Endocrine Society, the Canadian Pediatric Society and European Society for
      Pediatric Endocrinology recommend that 400IU of vitamin D should be supplemented in all
      infants starting from within a few days of birth throughout childhood. ESPGHAN recommends
      800-1000 IU for high risk infants, Ireland recommends 200IU vitamin D per day, UK does not
      recommend any supplements upto 6 months of age , however if formula milk intake <500ml/day
      then 300 IU is recommended. There are no such guidelines for India. Hence this study aims at
      evaluating the proportion of vitamin D deficient
